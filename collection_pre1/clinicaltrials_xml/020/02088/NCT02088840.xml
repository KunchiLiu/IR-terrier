	<detailed_description>Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria ( SIGNB ) remain important cause morbidity mortality patient submit stem cell transplant particularly engraftment patient suffer profound prolong neutropenia subsequent neutropenia period related loss engraftment viral infection . Epidemiology severe infection gram negative bacteria stem cell transplant patient vary last decade due increase use highly immunosuppressive stem cell transplant procedure , relation global epidemiological phenomenon involve several population immunocompromised patient include submitted stem cell transplant . The epidemiological evolution severe infection gram negative bacteria immunocompromised patient represent also emergence infection cause Gram-negative bacillus , particular enterobacteria , resistant several antimicrobial . Such pattern susceptibility antibacterial agent represent challenge issue current strategy use antibiotic prophylaxis therapy . Despite increase attention clinical therapeutic aspect infection stem cell transplant recipient , contrast data available incidence , microbiologic characteristic clinical outcome Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria population . Management patient submit stem cell transplant frequently complicate Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria may represent obstacle transplant procedure . Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria cause microorganism resistant betalactamic antibiotic , golden standard empirical antibacterial therapy febrile neutropenia , represent challenge problem . A revision antibacterial strategy consideration new molecule different antibacterial mechanism action consider light emerge epidemiology . Antimicrobial prophylaxis , diagnostic approach antimicrobial therapy adapt infectious risk transplant population accord stem cell source , condition regimen also infectious history transplant . A crucial problem definition strategy represent continuous change epidemiological pattern infection result modification risk factor transplant population global epidemiology hospital community acquire infection . In particular emergence antibiotic resistant enterobacteria represent serious problem dramatically impact antibacterial prophylaxis treatment choice . The Investigator think continuous epidemiology survey require order well define proper prevention , diagnostic treatment approach . A common problem infection control immunocompromised population represent lack epidemiological consciousness single centre relationship local policy use antibacterial drug . A prospective , multicenter survey Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria antibiotic resistant pathogen , particular enterobacteria , may useful tool evaluate epidemiological pattern infection , impact overall survival , critical analysis use antibacterial drug . The Investigator study think result survey may offer precious indication timely update prophylaxis , diagnosis treatment strategy Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria patient undergo stem cell transplant procedure . An important aspect study represent involvement stem cell transplant microbiology Italian society , GITMO Gruppo Italiano per il Trapianto di Midollo Osseo , cellule staminali emopoietiche e terapia cellulare AMCLI Associazione Microbiologi Clinici Italiani respectively , `` joint venture '' study clinical microbiological aspect Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant population . Investigators GITMO AMCLI involve design , write monitoring study participate transplant center clinician , responsible clinical data , microbiologist , responsible microbiological data , provide . The general objective study prospectively evaluate epidemiology Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria antibiotic resistant pathogens autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant patient engraftment period . All consecutive patient submit autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant underlie disease 50 Italian transplant center prospectively monitor severe infection gram negative bacteria engraftment period . The follow stop 4 month day transplant . Risk factor , incidence prognostic factor Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria evaluate overall population subpopulation accord different transplant characteristic . Data vitro susceptibility pattern microorganisms antibacterial use prophylaxis therapy collect . Descriptive analysis perform Severe Infections Gram Negative Bacteria case occur among patient enrol study . The study conduct accordance ethical principle derive Declaration Helsinki , CGP regulation . In study investigator use E-CRF apposite web site . Data collect E-CRF ( electronic case report form ) registration clinical data special web portal dedicate study . Investigators responsible preparation storage clinical data concern clinical trial accordance ICH guideline good clinical practice . Access clinical data reserve exclusively authorize personnel . Investigators verify ensure strict confidentiality record could identify patient compliance standard privacy personal data accordance Italian legislation . On data collection form ( related documentation ) patient uniquely identify date birth code enrolment . The full name patient never use communication / correspondence . Will require direct access patient 's original medical record verification monitor clinical data . The investigator oblige inform patient medical record could verify , without breach confidentiality personal data . Investigators allow monitor clinical data relate study , revision IRB / IEC inspection regulatory authority accordance Italian legislation , provide direct access medical record patient . The national coordination study carry Office Clinical Trials GITMO . The Office Clinical Trials GITMO act Data Management Center quality control , provide data management administrative support throughout course study .</detailed_description>
