	<brief_title>Treatment PRP Diabetes Wound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes condition body dose effectively use sugar much sugar blood . It estimate 15 % diabetic suffer diabetic food ulcer point . The heal process slow easily infect pathogens patient risk amputation . The wound heal process complex mechanism involve interaction molecular signal different cell type . Platelets play important role wound heal . When injury occur platelet activate thrombin clot form . In addition function hemostasis , activate platelet release many growth factor trigger angiogenesis , extracellular matrix production cytokine release , need wound heal . Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) portion plasma fraction autologous blood high concentration thrombocyte . Thrombin induce activation PRP result release multiple growth factor , include platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) , transform growth factor beta ( TGF-Î² ) . PRP known capacity stimulate cell proliferation differentiation . PRP also interact macrophage improve tissue heal regeneration , exhibit potent activity several kind pathogen . Our study focus advantage PRP aid wound heal diabetes . PRP autologous blood mixed thrombin appropriate ratio inject sit around wound , adjuvant treatment along standard care chronic diabetic . The wound check 1 2 time week evaluation PRP clinical application .</detailed_description>
