	<brief_summary>Many study reveal infliximab ( IFX , immunoglobulin gamma-1 antibody ) response well Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) patient intolerant corticosteroid immunosuppressant , steroids-dependent .More , A complex fistula CD indication early IFX therapy conjunction surgical drainage.Some paper claim IFX may prevent enterectomy CD patient relapse . Those risk factor diagnosis associate `` disabling disease `` include age &lt; 40 year , initial need steroid therapy , presence perianal disease recommend use IFX early . IFX approve State Food And Drug Administration ( SFDA ) 2007 , safety still controversial then.Some study proclaim side effect may infections , acute infusion reaction , anaphylactic reaction , autoimmunity , drug-induced lupus , congestive heart failure , abortion demyelination , etc . So problem still need settle follows:1 ) infliximab date country , rare date Chinese , especially large quantity random control study CD patient enterectomy.2 ) despite large number databases international , stop predictor response still obscure.3 ) The high cost IFX may hinder application , especially moderate severe active CD patient take mesalazine and/or immunosuppressant maintain remission.In addition , pathogenic age segment occurence CD : 15~ 50 year old , suffer disability self-improvement . The main object clinical trial complete database Chinese CD patient , especially safety efficacy IFX enterectomy.Then record clinical manifestation moderate severe CD patient use IFX conventional drug , include dose , course Concomitant treatment.We also study predictor appropriate time stop use IFX .We make mode cost-benefit help patient choose best project .</brief_summary>
