	<brief_summary>Radiation exposure operator occupational hazard invasive cardiologist . During radial access diagnostic catheterization , new radio-dense arm board advertise reduce operator radiation exposure . The investigator randomize patient new radio-dense armboard versus standard radio-transparent armboard diagnostic catheterization measure radiation exposure operator . Both group radio-dense pelvic shield place . The investigator hypothesize operator radiation dose decrease use radio-dense armboard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction Physician Radiation Exposure During Radial Access Cardiac Catheterization Using Radiation Protection Board</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Compared standard shield lead pelvic drape alone , use radio-opaque arm board addition pelvic drape decrease operator radiation exposure radial access cardiac catheterization least 30 % . STUDY DESIGN This randomize , prospective study patient randomized random number seal envelope standard shielding ( pelvic drape alone , `` no-board group '' ) experimental shielding ( pelvic drape plus radiation board , `` board group '' ) . A robust radiation safety monitor program place . Patient exposure measure catheterization laboratory equipment record . Lindauer Microstar Nanodot badge worn waist level radiation lead use measure operator radiation exposure . A new Nanodot use every case . Radiation exposure operator 's Nanodot measure immediately procedure technician blind study assignment . All patient 18-89 year old presenting Geisinger Medical Center diagnostic cardiac catheterization evaluate study . All interventional cardiologist fellows perform cardiac catheterization procedure also study subject . Approximately 150 Geisinger patient satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion include . Each arm include 75 patient participate study . Approximately 8 interventional cardiologist 10 fellow include study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Operators : Interventional diagnostic interventional attending fellow , operator willing participate . Patients : Age 1889 year old require catheterization Geisinger Medical Center use radial access patient CABG , require extensive imaging , operator switch procedure patient procedure take unusual time anatomic issue , need switch alternative access .</criteria>
