	<brief_summary>People schizophrenia tend problem attention concentration . Studies find patient unable block gate non-relevant distract information ( e.g. , noise ) . This may lead brain overload . Cognitive ability like concentration , memory , learn may worsen . This ability filter sensory information link gene affect way nicotine act brain . Patients schizophrenia high rate cigarette smoking . 60 % 90 % smoke compare 25 % general population . It suggest patient may use nicotine improve ability block distract information . Brain wave activity ( EEG ) response sound proved useful understand gating problem . The present study use EEG measure performance task find new nicotine-like treatment , add ongoing treatment medication , gate cognition . It hop new treatment improve way patient process information , may help day-to-day activity .</brief_summary>
