	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) imply sensory deficit pain , loss motor function impair proprioception turn may affect balance fine motor skill . It mainly subject peripheral part extremity , may transient permanent.CIPN common , potentially severe often dose-limiting side effect patient exposure numerous class antineoplastic agent include platins , taxanes , vinca alkaloid , bortezomib thalidomide . At present , evidence base treatment CIPN available . A variety different drug drug combination clinically test value treatment uncertain . Many patient CIPN refer physiotherapy still treatment base clinical experience tradition scientific evidence . In nonrandomized study , sensory electrical stimulation ( MC5-A Calmare ® ) test 16 persons.The electrode place hand foot intensity gradually increase give daily 10 day . Pain reduced 20 % numeric pain score 15 16 participate patient . Our clinical experience indicate treatment long wave diathermy ( LWD ) may decrease CIPN symptom . This treatment produce electromagnetic radiation accord capacitor method heighten circulation heat assume reduce pain . Interferential Therapy ( IT ) electro-physical method base electric field painful area four electrode vacuum cup place skin . Increased blood circulation pain relief suppose achieve . IT use two different intermediate frequency ( 1001-10000 Hz ) alternate current painful area . The treatment effect correspond `` gate control-theory '' ; inhibition pain signal small diameter fiber activity large-diameter Aβ-fibers spinal neuron . Some study show effect treat pain interferential current pain experimentally induce induced cold otherwise pain-free volunteer , compare control placebo . The hypothesis study combination therapy longwave diathermy high power interferential current give good result longwave diathermy low power .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial investigate effect combination therapy longwave diathermy high power interferential current , compare longwave diathermy low power ( control group ) sensory motor symptoms patient CIPN foot low leg . Sensory motor symptom define numbness , pain , discomfort balance impairment . Interferential current administer `` Electrostimulation unit ES-520 &amp; Vacuum Unit . The longwave diathermy low high power give thru capacitive energy transfer system administer `` Skanlab 25 Bodywave '' . The drug clinically test study magnesium , calcium , vitamin E B6 , glutamine , glutathione , n-acetyl cysteine omega-3 fatty acid , acetyl-L-carnitine alpha lipoic acid .</detailed_description>
