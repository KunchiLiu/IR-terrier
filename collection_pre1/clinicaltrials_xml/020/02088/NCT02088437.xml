	<brief_summary>Every day , 40 Australian break hip , Most age sixty five . Hip fracture significant problem old people , hospital system community whole increase number fracture cost hospitalisation ongoing care . After one year , less half people hip fracture walk well fracture . Physiotherapy acute hospital set integral part patient care , although intensity physiotherapy patient receive variable optimal number treatment session per day remain unknown . Studies patient group show increased physiotherapy improve patient outcomes increase muscle strength mobility . It also reduce negative effect bed rest muscle wasting , blood clot lung leg vein chest infection pneumonia . This study aim investigate effectiveness intensive physiotherapy program hip fracture patient understand effect patient function . In research investigator randomly allocate patient 2 group ; usual care intensive physiotherapy . The usual care group physiotherapy treatment daily whereas intensive physiotherapy group additional daily treatment physiotherapist well daily treatment ally health assistant . The objective achieve good functional outcome patient 's hospital stay ( ie improve mobility ) , reduce time patient physically ready go home , increase number patient able go directly home fast stream rehabilitation ( rather slow stream option ) . If increase intensity physiotherapy find improve patient 's mobility outcomes , research provide confidence endorse change current clinical practice .</brief_summary>
