	<brief_summary>Hemospray ( TC-325 , Cook Medical Inc , Winston-Salem , NC , USA ) , new adsorptive nanopowder hemostatic agent endoscopic treatment high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer , provide significant ease administration compare combined conventional technique saline-adrenaline injection mechanical clip heater probe application . The Hemospray powder easily apply ulcer difficult endoscopic position ulcer fibrotic base , combine conventional technique limit efficacy . Building preliminary work small single-arm study , investigator aim establish efficacy safety Hemospray treat bleed peptic ulcer comparison combined conventional technique . The investigator propose pilot study establish centre 's feasibility perform prospective , randomize , parallel group trial , compare efficacy Hemospray combine conventional technique , endoscopic treatment high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer . Patients high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer treat Hemospray determine initial hemostasis rate ( define endoscopically verified cessation bleed least 5 minute endoscopic treatment ) , rebleeding rate ( recurrent hemorrhage 4-week period follow initial hemostasis ) safety profile .</brief_summary>
