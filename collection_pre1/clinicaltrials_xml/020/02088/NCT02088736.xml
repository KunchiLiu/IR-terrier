	<brief_summary>In patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest Singapore , investigator aim assess benefit introduce resuscitation protocol include use intravenous ( IV ) access and/or intraosseous ( IO ) vascular access pre-hospital setting . The assumption low vascular access rate could due difficulty set IV cannula field due certain factor like poor light space constraint . Thus , introduce protocol include IO access difficult IV case , success rate vascular access high might lead high survival rate . This study compare 'IV+IO ' 'IV alone ' protocol patient cardiac arrest manage Singapore Civil Defence Force ( SCDF ) emergency ambulance service . The trial recruit 400 patient 1 year . Each 30 SCDF ambulance provide 'IV+IO ' 'IV alone ' treatment 2 consecutive phase 6-months order allow ambulance crew chance train usage IO . Currently , IO insertion accept standard care Singapore General Hospital , Department Emergency Medicine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : In adult paediatric patient Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest ( OHCA ) Singapore , investigator aim evaluate incremental benefit introduce resuscitation protocol include use intravenous ( IV ) access and/or intraosseous ( IO ) vascular access compare protocol intravenous ( IV ) access SCDF paramedic pre-hospital set return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) rate . Secondary Objective : - To compare success rate vascular access IV access and/or IO insertion compare intravenous ( IV ) access alone SCDF paramedic pre-hospital setting . - To compare rate successful 1st dose adrenaline give field cardiac arrest patient IV+IO IV group whether translates high survival rate 30 day . - To determine cost benefit introduce IO access emergency ambulance service OHCA . Hypothesis : In adult paediatric patient Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest ( OHCA ) Singapore , hypothesis low vascular access rate could due difficulty set IV cannula field due certain factor like poor light space constraint . Thus , introduce protocol include IO access difficult IV case , success rate vascular access high might lead high ROSC survival rate .</detailed_description>
