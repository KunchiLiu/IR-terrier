	<brief_summary>Mayo Clinic fund National Institute Disability Independent Living &amp; Rehabilitation Research ( NIDILRR ) Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) Model System Center continuously since 1998 . We successfully compete fund consistently produce high quality research provide comprehensive team-based rehabilitation service people TBI family continuum care associate superior outcome . Lack access specialize TBI care common need identify individual hospitalize TBI . The upper Midwest high population rural dweller , elderly , Native Americans , high risk TBI likely limit access rehabilitation service acute care . Explosive advance communication technology bring tele-medicine forefront health care . The CONNECT trial test effectiveness use modern technology - phone consultation telehealth communication system - deliver specialized brain rehabilitation resource remotely patient provider upper Midwest . The group target CONNECT trial : - Individuals recently hospitalize TBI ; - Their family ; - Their local health care provider ( primary care provider , psychologist , therapist , social service provider , job counselor ) . The CONNECT trial first study scope - 4 upper Midwest state ( MN , IA , ND , SD ) , 3 health system ( Mayo Clinic , Altru Health System ND , Regional Health SD ) , 2 state Departments Health ( IA , MN ) - use electronic technology see outcome improve provide care face-to-face contact . The trial study whether outcome three year different group receive remotely provide model care compare match group receive usual care community . The desired long term outcome study increase capacity provide care reduce barrier access specialized TBI rehabilitation service face individual TBI family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MAYO CLINIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY MODEL SYSTEM CENTER : The CONNECT Trial Connecting upper Midwest traumatic brain injury community Mayo Clinic : provide research evidence effectiveness remote support care coordination Problem : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common injury cause disability US , yet medical practice specialize treat post-acute chronic impairment , activity limitation , restriction community participation employment often result TBI . This particular concern rural area , among elderly , Native American population . Gap knowledge : Evidence exist effectiveness care provide multi-discipline clinical rehabilitation team treat complex medical , cognitive , psychosocial sequela TBI improve outcome . Some evidence exist effectiveness remotely provide service , cognitive rehabilitation . Mayo Clinic 's specialty brain rehabilitation practice experience assemble treatment team remote community provide clinical guidance , positive anecdotal report effectiveness . However , currently exist research evidence indicate intervention superior treatment usual ( TAU ) . Research design : In collaboration Departments Health Iowa Minnesota , Regional Health South Dakota , Altru Health System North Dakota , Mayo Clinic 's TBI Model System Center recruit 500 individual discharge hospital year 's time ICD-9/10 diagnosis TBI . Subjects randomize demographic urban/rural status two group : intervention group TAU group . Subjects intervention group remotely interview evaluated Mayo 's clinical team . Their rehabilitation need assess connection make local health care community provider receive TBI-specific education consultative support Mayo 's TBI Model System Center staff . The target population consent : 1 ) individual TBI ; 2 ) family member caregiver ; 3 ) local care provider . All consented subject follow regularly 3 year .

Primary outcome measure include measure impairment , activity limitation , participation primary focus outcome related independent living , employment , quality life . The hypothesis outcomes remotely coordinate intervention group superior outcome group receive TAU . If study result support hypothesis , hub-based system remotely coordinate brain rehabilitation care could consider , use TBI Model System Centers test site could revolutionize provision medical care post acute support individual TBI family .</detailed_description>
