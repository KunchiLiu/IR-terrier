	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) determine radiation dose deliver radioactive sphere patient liver metastasis primary liver biliary cancer . Comparing result diagnostic procedure dose delivery radioactive sphere liver may help determine radioembolization dose plan best treatment liver metastasis primary liver biliary cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship radiation dose 70 % tumor volume determine post-treatment positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) local control 6 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability PET-CT reproducibly determine dose tumor , normal liver , surround organ . II . To determine stability microsphere location examine change dose subset patient PET-CT scan perform day 0 day 1 . III . To determine relationship dose predict technetium-99m ( Tc-99m ) label Macro-aggregated albumin ( MAA ) image use single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) versus post-treatment dosimetry . IV . To determine effect dose deliver local control normal tissue complication . V. To measure perfusion tumor correlation dose deposition , base arterial phase CT measurement . OUTLINE : Patients undergo PET-CT scan standard radioembolization day 0 . A subset patient undergo PET-CT scan day 1 , 24 hour day 0 post-treatment PET-CT. After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week , 1 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
