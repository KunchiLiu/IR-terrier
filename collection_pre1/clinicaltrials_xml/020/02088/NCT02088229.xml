	<brief_summary>This longitudinal interventional case series utilize patient University Michigan W.K . Kellogg Eye Center schedule begin treatment diabetic macular edema . Baseline measure take include structural assessment circulatory capacity utilize fluorescein angiography , addition retinal layer integrity thickness use high resolution optical coherence tomography . Also , functional assessment visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , photostress recovery , dark adaptation , perimetry , cellular fluorescence test . Adverse event record compare historical control ensure currently accept intervention safe . Finally , potential confounding variable DME include related eye , systemic factor , patient demographic record assess influence variable treatment response . The primary objective develop hypothesis might well explain retinal structural ( anatomical ) and/or functional ( physiological ) mechanism visual impairment eye receive treatment diabetic macular edema ( DME ) .</brief_summary>
