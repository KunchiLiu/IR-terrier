	<brief_summary>The aim current proposal determine PCIT treatment manual successfully utilized preschooler ASD disruptive behavior ( across range intellectual functioning level ) evaluate ability significantly decrease measure problem behavior . It hypothesize current manual require modification use ASD , comparison wait-list control group , family undergo PCIT training evidence significant gain measure parent stress , child externalize behavior compliance parental request . To address pilot study aim , recruit total 20 family child ASD ( age 2.6-6.11 year ) whose child already receive intensive , one-on-one behavioral treatment service ( 15-30 hour per week ) structure parent training . Families randomize either intensive service + PCIT intensive service alone ( wait list control ) . Assessments complete baseline , mid-treatment ( 10 week post baseline ) , post-treatment ( 20 week baseline assessment ) long-term follow-up ( 12 week post-treatment ) . PCIT family attend 20 weekly , one-hour coaching session . Both active treatment wait-list control family continue receive intensive ABA service home community . Control family receive PCIT train 16 week `` wait-list . '' The aim pilot study : 1 . To assess utility current PCIT treatment manual preschooler ASD disruptive behavior parent ; Hypothesis 1 : The current PCIT treatment manual able utilized family child ASD minimal modification . Hypothesis 2 : Families child ASD consistently attend PCIT session . 2 . To determine PCIT population result increase appropriate parent behavior subsequent decrease target child behavior ( e.g. , direct assessment noncompliance , behavior rating scale ) . Hypothesis 3 : Families receive PCIT train evidence statistically great decrease measure disruptive behavior , quality parent-child interaction parental stress family wait-list control group . Hypothesis 4 : Gains attain 20 week maintain 12-week post-treatment follow-up .</brief_summary>
