	<brief_summary>The focus present study develop echocardiographic technique measure cardiopulmonary transit time ( PTT ) pulmonary blood volume ( PBV ) use ultrasound contrast . The Specific Aims present study follow : 1 . To compare echocardiography-based PTTs cardiac MRI-based PTTs obtain use 'peak-to-peak ' method 2 . To quantify relationship echocardiographically-derived PTT , use Optison , exist echocardiographic method use determine ventricular function 3 . To measure reproducibility echocardiographically-based PTT use Optison .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Pulmonary Transit Time Echocardiography : Comparison With Cardiac MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures The measurement PTT PBV describe detail prior protocol . These calculation techniques identical current study . In addition , may place additional region interest ( ROIs ) off-line analysis , step would influence data acquisition TEE TEE procedure . Note placement peripheral intravenous ( IV ) catheter standard-of-care patient undergoing TEE . Acquisition Analysis Data : The following anticipate flow data acquisition analysis : 1 . Prior upon arrival TEE Suite , prospective patient screen study personnel inform consent . 2 . After informed consent obtain , patient undergo focus TTE TEE Holding Room prior TEE . One two dos echocardiographic contrast administer obtain PTT via TTE facilitate comparison PTT derive TEE ( Specific Aim # 3 ) . Prior ultrasound contrast administration , agitate saline injection give intra-cardiac shunt suggest color Doppler evaluation . If shunt present , contrast would administer patient would unenrolled study . 3 . During TEE , direct supervision attend cardiac anesthesiologist and/or attend cardiologist , 2 additional dos echocardiographic contrast would administer . A sub-set patient receive 2 dos facilitate comparison PTT obtain different view ( Specific Aim # 2 ) . This analogous previous protocol multiple dos contrast administer order ass reproducibility PTT measurement . 4 . As part standard-of-care , patient complete TEE monitor TEE Suite least 30 minute include assessment blood pressure , heart rate , oximetry . Studies analyze locked Echocardiography cart data transmit separate work-station 'off-line ' analysis use dedicate software . As back-up , data also store DVDs , store lock key PI co-investigator 's office VHVI . As described prior protocol , clinical echocardiographic data enter REDCap database . We estimate conduct limited TTE prior schedule TEE take ~ 10-15 minute . However , step carry TEE Holding Room another patient get TEE Procedure Room therefore add procedural wait time length schedule TEE . If first TEE patient day enrol study , study personnel perform TTE portion Procedure Room prepped TEE . During TEE , administration contrast manner describe estimate add ~ 10-15 minute duration procedure . This include administration contrast , case administer multiple dos , wait initial contrast injection wash , administer additional dose .</detailed_description>
