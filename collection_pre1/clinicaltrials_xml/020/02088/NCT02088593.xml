	<brief_summary>Medical student score high general population measure depression , anxiety , fatigue , poor sleep sleepiness . Data suggest disparages circadian phase might contribute problem . From internal validity standpoint , first year medical student ideal group study . The majority student match variable education , age , intelligence . However , importantly , nearly identical life style come factor schedule , living condition , level stress , time stressor . The specific aim hypothesis : Medical student randomize sleep hygiene counsel plus simulated dawn report less depression , anxiety , fatigue , sleepiness , sleep disruption ( measure standardize questionnaire ) student randomize sleep hygiene counseling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulated Dawn Med Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There substantial grow body literature identify medical student group suffers increase level depression , anxiety , marker `` psychological distress '' . Other study demonstrate conjunction `` psychological distress '' , medical student suffer sleep deprivation , sleep disruption , daytime sleepiness . Finally preliminary evidence resident intern show increase symptom fatigue . It might reasonably assume symptom inter-related importantly detrimental student patient care . There interventional study aim educate participant stress management , however attempt limit success . Circadian rhythm biological rhythm contribute body ' physiological process . It determine light major environmental cue influence set circadian rhythm . Under ideal circumstance exposure natural sunlight sufficient maintain consistent synchronized circadian rhythm . Often time case . Reduced exposure natural light increase exposure artificial light two influencing factor . Artificial light therapy successfully apply treatment disorder circadian rhythm well treatment affective disorder . Most notably , light therapy show effective treating symptom depression sleep disruption , specifically patient seasonal affective disorder , non-seasonal major depression , delay sleep phase syndrome , advance sleep phase syndrome , sub-syndromal level . The theoretical mechanism action review Terman et al asserts morning bright light therapy advance stabilizes circadian rhythm individual delay drift rhythm . There subsequent synchronization entrainment individual 's endogenous rhythm environmental rhythm daily life review . The timing , duration , type light deliver paramount concern , improper delivery therapy show advantage placebo . One method light delivery simulate dawn light therapy . Simulated dawn light therapy work gradually increase light exposure specify period time end sleep period . This gradually increase light exposure sleep period contrast traditional light therapy , deliver full intensity wake time . Simulated dawn show great promise effective traditional light therapy additional advantage time efficient , easy use , easily tolerate . All factor important consideration application intervention medical student , short time significant stress hallmarks medical education . The following proposal novel approach , use light therapy , improve mental well-being first year medical student .</detailed_description>
