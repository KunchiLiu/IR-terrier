	<brief_summary>Exposure heat stress compromise physiological cognitive function life threatening , particularly military setting . Various strategy precondition heat stress explore past prove inapplicable . We aim examine influence Astaxanthin supplementation precondition strategy heat stress human model use heat tolerance test . This achieve double-blind , placebo control supplementation trial , expose human subject , consume Astaxanthin placebo , control heat strain environment , perform moderate exercise heat chamber .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>34 young , healthy civilian volunteer participate study . After read signing informed consent form , subject undergo medical examination interview nutritionist ass dietary intake Astaxanthin . They undergo 3 day train cognitive testing software . During first stage , consume Astaxanthin free diet , subject participate physiological test : heat tolerance test ( HTT ) , thermo-neutral test ( TTT ) maximal oxygen consumption test ( VO2max ) 3 separate day . During second stage , subject randomly blindly assign either placebo Astaxanthin supplementation arm , undergo 35-40 day supplementation . Physiological test second stage take place 31st 35th ( 40th - optional ) day supplementation include HTT , TTT VO2max 3 separate day .</detailed_description>
