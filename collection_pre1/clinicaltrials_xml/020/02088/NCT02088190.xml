	<detailed_description>With age population increasingly susceptible obesity obesity-related comorbidities include sarcopenia diabetes , effective safe treatment option tailor need old adult imperative . While medication lifestyle intervention generally fail achieve sustain large-scale weight loss , bariatric surgery effective long-term weight loss treatment obese patient improve many medical complication associate obesity . Sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) result substantial weight loss may appropriate old adult due low rate complication mortality . Therefore , SG propose reasonable primary treatment modality old obese individual , substantial recent increase number intervention perform . Despite potential benefit , little known physiologic metabolic effect bariatric surgery , include SG , glucose homeostasis muscle physiology old adult . A fundamental understanding effect excess adiposity weight loss intervention profound importance , especially emerge evidence earlier treatment obesity may delay/prevent many comorbidities . An underlying inflammatory state implicate pathogenesis sarcopenia insulin resistance may provide important connection age-related decline see old obese patient . Therefore , study aim evaluate modify effect age inflammation SG-induced change body composition , muscle physiology , insulin sensitivity . This protocol conduct two age cohort ( great 60 less 50 year old ) .</detailed_description>
