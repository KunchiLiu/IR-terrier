	<brief_summary>Background : - Monocytes type white blood cell find human blood . They help immune system . Researchers find monocyte take blood healthy people kill tumor cell . Now want know monocyte take blood people ovarian cancer kill tumor cell . - In addition , native host anti-tumor cell mediate immune mechanism may play role clinical outcome epithelial ovarian cancer ; data indicate presence intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells show prognosticate improve outcome advanced ovarian cancer . Furthermore , non-cellular component blood , exosomes , may influence outcome . Objective : - To see monocyte take blood people ovarian cancer kill tumor cell . Eligibility : - Women 18 year old ovarian cancer . Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history physical exam . - Blood test . - CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis and/or MRI . For scan , lie machine take picture body . - A small amount blood ( two tube ) collect needle one visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Using vitro vivo assay show human monocyte prim Interferons alpha gamma tumoricidal capable kill number tumor cell line human tumor implant immunocompromised mouse . We show monocyte isolated elutriation NIH blood bank monocyte isolate anticoagulated peripheral blood healthy woman NIH blood bank equally capable kill tumor cell . No data collect whether monocyte patient Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer tumoricidal property . In addition , native host anti-tumor cell mediate immune mechanism may play role clinical outcome epithelial ovarian cancer ; data indicate presence intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells show prognosticate improve outcome advanced ovarian cancer . Furthermore , noncellular component blood , exosomes , may influence outcome . Objectives : To obtain blood sample patient ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . Eligibility : Females great equal 18 year age prior diagnosis ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer see Women Cancer Clinic NCI . Patients must able willing provide inform consent . Design : We collect approximately 20 ml peripheral blood single time point patient ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer currently therapy screen trial , see consultation , present enrollment clinical trial .</detailed_description>
