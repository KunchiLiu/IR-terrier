	<detailed_description>General Approach : Single center , non-randomized , unblinded study patient follow Essentia Health - St. Mary 's Medical Center refer clinically indicate diagnostic EP study without ablation . During procedure , event atrial fibrillation , sinus rhythm bundle branch block may occur course case save electronically analyze offline . These event may occur routine , clinically indicate portion procedure save occur . The stored data evaluate change activation time near- far field ventricular signal store event . Methods Materials : Up 50 patient enrol primary investigator and/or associate investigator . As part usual EP study , catheter place coronary sinus right ventricle . For study involve catheter ablation atrial fibrillation complex arrhythmia , 3-dimensional mapping system frequently use catheter location 3-dimensional space leave clinical discretion operator time procedure . An EP-Med WorkMate workstation use record measure event part usual clinical procedure . 1 . Data Acquisition : During course case , catheter place right ventricular apex coronary sinus use record near- far-field signal episode atrial fibrillation , sinus rhythm bundle branch conduction disturbance occur . Near field-signal record distal proximal pair catheter locate right ventricular apex . Far-field signal measure distal electrode catheter right ventricular apex distal electrode coronary sinus catheter . If 3-dimensional mapping available , spatial location right ventricular coronary sinus catheter record . If 3-dimensional mapping available , fluoroscopic map catheter position obtain . Recorded signal save EP-Med WorkMate workstation sample rate 2000 Hz amplitude 78 nV per unit . 2 . Analysis : Patient identifier purge saved event printout , study identification number assign . Those saved event extract input Matlab Octave analysis . Custom algorithms write primary investigator use . Both ventricular far-field ventricular nearfield electrograms analyze . Initially , 3 consecutive ventricular signal sinus rhythm evaluate patient average estimate activation timing change . A baseline template reference activation sequence create patient use reference event patient . The signal rectify additional filtering apply . Using peak farfield signal time 0 , difference near- far-field peak signal measure average three ventricular event . In turn available atrial fibrillation bundle branch block conduction disturbance even analyze use technique . Differences reference activation sequence event measure compare . In Figure 1 , upper pane show episode baseline rhythm ( sinus rhythm ) . During baseline rhythm event , near-field peak signal consistently come far-field peak signal . During ventricular tachycardia , two peak nearly simultaneous , represent change activation time change activation circuit ventricle .</detailed_description>
