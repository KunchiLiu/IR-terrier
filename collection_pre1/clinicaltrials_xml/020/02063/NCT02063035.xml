	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Topical application Tranexamic acid surgical wound spine surgery decrease overall blood loss post-operatively . This reduction blood loss reduce need transfusion . In addition also significantly reduce cost surgical procedure . Specific Aim 1 : The goal study quantitatively ass whether topical application tranexamic acid place surgical wound lumbar spine surgery decrease post-operative blood loss , thus lower need blood transfusion . By reduce number transfusion patient avoid well know complication associate . The investigator plan measure serum tranexamic acid level . Several meta-analyses level I study show IV administration tranexamic acid effective reduce post operative blood loss need transfusion</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study Drug Tranexamic Acid Reduce Post-surgery Blood Loss Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid , antifibrinolytic agent , study great length across myriad medical specialty reduce blood lose surgery . More specifically , widespread use agent proven safe effective cardiothoracic ; ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) ; oral maxillofacial ; orthopaedic surgery ( total hip , total knee , spine surgery ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . Additionally , oral version tranexamic acid , FDA approve , historically used Gynecological literature patient menorrhagia . Even large dos prophylactic antifibrinolytic agent , specifically , tranexamic acid also proven safe effective major orthopaedic spine surgery ( 5 ) . Tranexamic acid FDA approve oral IV form 25 year wealth safety efficacy documented literature . In recent prospective double blind study involve total knee arthroplasty 25-30 % reduction blood loss compare negative control show use tranexamic acid topically ( 6 ) . While systemic ( Intravenous ) use tranexamic acid study spine surgery , little study show effectiveness reduce blood loss use topically . This study propose determine topical application tranexamic acid surgical wound posterior multi-level lumbar spine surgery decrease postoperative blood loss , thus decrease need potential transfusion . Tranexamic acid well document safety efficacy , investigator believe agent become important tool reduce blood loss spinal surgery . It offer reduction blood loss , ultimately , decrease transfusion rate pose risk patient significant cost .</detailed_description>
