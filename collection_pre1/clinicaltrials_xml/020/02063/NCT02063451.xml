	<brief_summary>Obesity reach epidemic level United States , rise many industrialize nation . The rate recidivism long-term weight loss substantial present critical problem give importance obesity modifiable risk factor disease like type 2 diabetes . Further , comorbidity depression disease like obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease suggest may underlie shared biology disease metabolic dysfunction emotional dysregulation . The shared biology disease may actually promote precipitation exacerbation comorbid condition , impact success treatment . Endogenous opioid system regulate number physiological psychological process include mood , energy management , reward . Endogenous opioid µ-receptor-mediated reward processing think involve short-term control eat hedonic food consumption , base data animal model . The present proposal examine function µ-opioid receptor ( MOR ) system lean obese human volunteer follow overnight fast change µ-opioid receptor occupancy ( i.e. , endogenous opioid release ) follow consumption standardize meal use PET image µ-selective radiotracer [ 11C ] carfentanil . The obese individual retested fast feed state follow 15 % weight loss Very Low Calorie Diet . Further , investigator evaluate function MOR system within context individual 's metabolic psychological profile include aspect mood inhibitory control . This information provide neurobiological base develop novel avenue intervention base individual variation central mechanism associate motivational system appetite potential role weight regain . The investigator hypothesize overeat chronically obese individual associate dysregulation MOR system function , manifest reduction baseline MOR availability ( bind potential , BP ) limbic reward circuitry , low release endogenous opioids standard meal , compare lean volunteer . The latter observe acute reduction BP measure meal ingestion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroimaging Study . Male Female volunteer recruit Investigational Weight Management Clinic ( IWMC ) University Michigan study . All neuropsychological instrument collect lean obese individual baseline , 4-6-months . Obese individual undergo 4 PET scan : 1 ) baseline follow overnight fast ; 2 ) baseline follow consumption Ensure shake ; 3 ) least a15 % reduction body weight follow overnight fast ; 4 ) follow consumption Ensure shake post-weight loss time point . Lean individual undergo two scan baseline fast post-Ensure shake consumption . All lean subject consume normal diet prior initial scanning . The obese subject undergo second set scan , post-weight loss , still consume HMR diet . Neuroimaging Measures . Two PET study [ 11C ] carfentanil ( selective µ-opioid receptor radiotracer ) acquire lean volunteer 4 PET study [ 11C ] carfentanil acquire obese individual . Structural functional MRI acquire obese individual weight loss , lean individual baseline co-registration anatomical standardization PET data activation response visual stimulus . After completion , follow data use statistical analysis : 1 ) Baseline µ-opioid receptor availability vivo ( bind potential , BPND ) lean obese individual follow overnight fast . 2 ) µ-opioid system activation consume 500 kcal ( 16fl oz , 18 % protein , 14 % CHO , 25 % fat ) Ensure shake ( feed ) lean obese individual measure acute reduction BPND . 3 ) Baseline MOR BPND obese individual lose ≥15 % body weight 4-6 month ( fast ) , follow overnight fast . 4 ) µ-opioid system activation obese individual lose ≥15 % body weight consume 250 kcal Ensure shake ( feed ) . PET Acquisition . Briefly , [ 11C ] carfentanil selective specific µ-opioid receptor radioligand , administer tracer dos use bolus/continuous infusion protocol achieve rapid steady-states specific non-specific binding region ( 5-7 min post-tracer administration ) . Twenty-eight frame acquire 70 minute increase duration ( 30 sec 5 min ) . Two scan acquire twice : A baseline , without challenge , scan follow consumption Ensure shake . Subsequently , dynamic image data receptor scan transform , voxel-by-voxel basis , parametric map , co-registered . These include , 1 ) tracer transport measure ( K1 ratio , proportional cerebral blood flow ; tracer transport = blood flow x tracer extraction ) , receptor-related measure , ( BPND ) , 2 ) baseline scan , 3 ) follow shake consumption . The reduction BPND baseline post-shake consumption represent measure endogenous opioid system activation follow shake consumption ( related occupancy ligand-receptor interaction endogenous ligand ) . These parametric image calculate use modify Logan graphical analysis , occipital cortex reference region . PET image co-registered T1 MRI structural , anatomical image , affine transform warped standard Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) stereotactic space use mutual information algorithm . The baseline scan , fasted state , precede post-consumption scan due time constraint , avoid carry-over effect active ( feed ) baseline ( fast ) state . Both PET scan perform day reduce travel time subject hence experimental burden . Clinical Measures Psychobehavioral measure acquire image study include : The Positive Negative Affect Scale , Profile Mood Scales , State portion Spielberg Anxiety Inventory , visual analog scale ( VAS ) appetite palatability administer experiment . These measure assess emotional state appetite correlative purpose change neuroreceptor circulate hormone level performance study . The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI600 ) , Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS-SR ) , EuroQol measure health outcome , Trait portion Anxiety Inventory , NEO Personality Inventory obtain prior scan secondary analysis ( e.g . relationship image measure `` stable '' trait ) .</detailed_description>
