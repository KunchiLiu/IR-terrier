	<brief_summary>There consensus exercise therapy use therapy approach CLBP little consensus reach preferential type therapy . There occur wash effect heterogeneous character CLBP patient . Therefore need development CPR 's . Objectives trial first , derivation clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) predict treatment response three form exercise therapy patient nonspecific chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) . Secondly , validate clinical prediction rule three form exercise therapy patient nonspecific CLBP . The study design Randomized control trial . Patients non-specific low back pain three month duration recruit Antwerp University Hospital . After examination patient randomly assign one three intervention group : motor control therapy , general active exercise therapy isometric training therapy . All patient undergo eighteen treatment session nine week . Measurements take baseline , nine week , six month one year . The primary outcome use Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire . For type exercise therapy clinical prediction rule derive validate . For validation CPR apply divide treatment group two subgroup ( match unmatched therapy ) use baseline measurement . We predict good therapy effect match therapy . Never RCT design perform development CPR exercise therapy CLBP patient . Only one CPR describe single arm design motor control therapy sub-acute non-radicular LBP patient . In study , sufficiently large sample include derivation validation phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Clinical Prediction Rules Rehabilitation Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods/ Design Ethical approval ( B300201215600 ) obtain local ethic committee University Antwerp Antwerp University Hospital . Study design The development CPR consist three consecutive phase . The first two derivation validation phase . In derivation phase CPR derive number variable predictive potential therapy outcome . These variable obtain baseline measurement multidimensional character ( impairment , activities/participation contextual factor ) . Data analysis use calculate powerful combination variable finally form new derive CPR In validation phase derive clinical prediction rule apply new study population . This application result match patient ( allocate accordance CPR ) unmatched patient ( accordance CPR ) . The treatment success group compare . The hypothesis treatment success high match group . For phase , single blind RCT study design use . The project start August 2014 . Analysis data plan end 2015 . Patient recruitment Patients recruit doctor service two setting locate Antwerp Antwerp University Hospital ( UZA ) . Treatment measurement perform site patient recruit . Inclusion criterion : Current nonspecific LBP persist least three month , consult medical doctor last month persistent low back pain , age 18 60 , sufficient fluency Dutch follow treatment instruction answer survey question . Exclusion criterion : spinal canal stenosis , spondylolisthesis spondylitis , large herniated disc sciatica , radiate pain knee , previous back surgery , history know spinal fracture , malignancy , know muscle- , nerve- , skin- , joint disease , pregnancy lack consent . These in-and exclusion criterion apply derivation validation phase . Measurements Baseline test As primary ( dependent ) outcome measure Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire use . The MODI disease specific questionnaire measure disability LBP patient [ 21-23 ] . As secondary ( independent ) outcome measure follow test use : First , Measurement impairment : duration LBP/ pelvis impairment / respiratory impairment ( three item anamnesis ) . Prone instability test , Straight Leg Raise , Beighton scale , Active Straight Leg Raise , sit knee extension test , waiter bow , pelvic tilt , side support test , extensor endurance test , active sit-up , Visual Analogue Scale pain ( VAS ) . Second , measurement limitation activity participation : hour physical activity/week ( trough anamnesis ) . Short Form 36 Health Survey ( SF36 ) , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) . Third , measurement contextual factor : gender/ age / height / weight / body mass index / smoke / profession / underwent previous therapy / comorbidity ( trough anamnesis ) . Tampa scale kinesiophobia , Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire ( FABQ ) , We perform literature search select use clinical test base reliability validity [ 24 ] . Further , clinical test use Hicks et al also include study design . The Baseline test take 30 minute . Follow-up Short-term follow : take place completion treatment program nine week . All primary secondary outcome measure baseline test reevaluate moment . Long-term follow-up : six month one year enter study follow outcome measurement inventoried : age , weight , hour physical activity/week , profession , duration low back pain , MODI , Tampa scale kinesiophobia , VAS . The patient contact mail initially phone respond mail within two week make appointment . Randomization &amp; blinding In phase patient randomly assign one three treatment group baseline test . The responsible researcher use randomization list generate Microsoft ® Excel ® software ( version 14.3.9 , 2010 © Microsoft Corporation ) . Intervention During nine week intervention , patient treat two time week . Patients assign randomly one three intervention group ( motor control therapy , general active exercise therapy isometric training therapy ) . Each intervention take seventy minute . Ten minute warm cool treatment regime . Each group receive fifty minute therapy specific intervention . Previously trained physiotherapist give treatment . To ensure therapist provide exercise , treatment protocol treatment group develop treatment diary fill session . Interventions derivation validation phase similar . Power analysis After derivation phase new patient include execute validation phase . Derivation phase Because ca n't predict therapy effect derivation phase , use two-tailed hypothesis calculate power . A pilot study show standard deviation primary outcome measure , MODI , comparable result Brennan et al . [ 17 ] . Given estimate , 120 patient need detect minimum clinically important difference ( effect size 0.43 ) 80 % power use two-tailed hypothesis . This mean 3 X 40 patient need complete whole trial . Since Van der Wouden et al . [ 34 ] mention dropout rate 54 % , aim include 260 patient . Validation phase In validation phase intervention therapy stay new patient include . In study design , interest treatment success high match group unmatched group mean one-tailed hypothesis use calculate power . In validation phase need 105 patient detect minimum clinically important difference ( effect size 0.43 ) 80 % power use one-tailed hypothesis . This mean 3 X 35 patient need complete whole trial . Again take dropout rate 54 % account aim include 229 patient . Data analysis Derivation phase This phase aim detect potential predictive variable treatment success ( dichotomous , yes/no ) set baseline measurement . A minimal decrease MODI score 6 point consider treatment success [ 35 ] . Potential predictive variable select follow : first , individual variable self-reports , history , physical examination test bivariate association reference standard use independent sample test , Mann-Whitney U test Chi-square test base nature data . Variables significance level P &lt; 0.10 retained potential prediction variable . We choose liberal significance level stage avoid exclude potential predictive variable . Next , select potential prediction variable know predictor determine study Hicks et al . [ 16 ] enter multiple linear regression equation determine optimal set predictor . A significance P &lt; 0.05 used stage . Variables retain regression model use develop multiple clinical prediction rule classify patient likely responder treatment . This statistical analysis perform treatment group ( motor control therapy , general active exercise therapy isometric training therapy ) . Validation phase In validation phase new patient assign randomly one three treatment group . Based derived CPR determine phase 1 intervention group divide either `` match therapy '' `` unmatched therapy '' . The recruitment , information form , informed consent , measurement , blind intervention procedure derivation validation phase . To verify intergroup difference baseline , variable compare group use independent test , Mann-Whitney U test , Chi-square test independence independence base nature data . To examine principle hypothesis ( difference treatment effect match unmatched group ) , three-way repeated- measure analysis variance perform treatment group ( motor control vs. general active exercise therapy vs. isometric therapy ) classification subgroup ( motor control vs. general active exercise therapy vs. isometric therapy ) between-subject variable time ( baseline , 9 week , 6 month 1 year ) within-subject variable . The dependent variable disability ( MODI score ) . The hypothesis interest three-way interaction , two-way interaction time treatment group , time classification subgroup . We hypothesize outcome time differ base randomized treatment group , classification subgroup , depend interaction treatment group classification subgroup , patient randomize 'matched treatment ' well outcome patient randomize 'unmatched treatment ' . This hypothesis support three-way interaction significant , two-way interaction . Pairwise post hoc comparison perform follow-up period explore significant interaction term . In derivation validation phase use intention-to-treat analysis . Information form inform consent If patient meet in- exclusion criterion schedule interview one researcher informed trial . If patient decide participate sign inform consent . Information form inform consent make approve ethic committee UA Antwerp University hospital .</detailed_description>
