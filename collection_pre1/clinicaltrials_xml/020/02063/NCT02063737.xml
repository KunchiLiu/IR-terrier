	<detailed_description>More half ( 55 % ) Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) shift worker report severe mental physical fatigue work , ( Patterson et al , 2012 ) 36 % report excessive daytime sleepiness , ( Pirrallo et al ; 2012 ) 60 % poor sleep quality . ( Patterson et al ; 2012 ) Sleepiness fatigue duty result injury EMS worker medical error patient . ( Patterson et al ; 2012 ) The investigator ' recent research show odds injury among fatigued EMS worker 1.9 time higher non-fatigued worker . ( Patterson et al ; 2012 ) Additional data show emergency worker ( e.g. , emergency physician nurse ) vulnerable sleepiness fatigue work . ( Fisman et al ; 2007 ; Machi et al ; 2012 ; Thomas et al ; 2006 ; Geiger-Brown et al ; 2012 ) . There number individual system factor influence sleepiness fatigue shift work emergency worker . Individual factor include sleep hygiene , medical condition like obstructive sleep apnea , factor . ( Schaefer et al ; 2012 ; Simon et al ; 2012 ) System factor include shift length , patient care intensity , workload . Many factor modifiable , yet difficult others change control . Reducing shift length customary pattern shift work , 12-hr 24-hr shift , feasible many employer shift worker emergency medicine care set . In location , &gt; 80 % EMS worker hold multiple job , 40 % work 16 shift per month , many accumulate unsafe amount overtime order make livable wage . ( Patterson et al , 2010 ; Patterson et al , 2012 ; Bauder 2012 ) Other shift worker emergency care setting face similar obstacle EMS shift worker . An objective research study pilot test real-time assessment emergency care worker sleepiness fatigue . The investigator seek determine text-messaging fatigue-reduction strategy emergency care worker report high-level sleepiness fatigue start shift reduces perceive sleepiness fatigue end shift . A long term goal research determine innovative text-messaging tool use reduce likelihood fatigue-related injury among emergency care shift worker . Aim 1 : To determine real-time assessment perceive sleepiness fatigue use text-messaging impact worker 's Attitudes , Perceived Norms , Self-Efficacy , Alertness Habits , Perceived Importance Fatigue , Knowledge Sleepiness/Fatigue , Perceptions Environmental Constraints regard behavior improve alertness shift work . Rationale : The investigator recognize emergency care shift worker hold different belief attitude risk sleepiness fatigue duty different stage adopt risk-reduction behavior . Behavioral research show modify one factor impact future behavior potentially reduce risk long term . Approach : The investigator develop list candidate item operationalize Integrative Model Behavioral Prediction . The investigator administer candidate item baseline end study period assess impact . Aim 2 : To determine text-messaging emergency care worker fatigue-reduction strategy real-time start shift work reduces worker perceive sleepiness fatigue end shift work . Approach : At baseline , investigator randomly assign 100 emergency care worker one two group ( control group intervention group ) . The control group ( n=50 / 50 % ) receive standard text-message question sleepiness fatigue beginning , , end shift . The 50 % ( n=50 ) assign intervention group receive text-message question control group , well additional text-messages include strategy investigator hypothesize lead reduction perceive sleepiness fatigue end shift work . With 100 EMS worker ( 50 % intervention / 50 % control ) , investigator 80 % power detect difference ( effect size 0.78 ) self-reported fatigue level report end shift control intervention group . The investigator collect data 90-day study period . Eligibility Criteria include : 1 . The study subject must 18 year age old ; 2 . The study subject must currently work emergency medicine set emergency physician , emergency nurse , emergency medical technician ( EMT ) / paramedic worker ; 3 . The study subject must work shift part employment emergency medicine setting ; 4 . The study subject must cell-phone / smartphone receive send text-messages ; 5 . The study subject must willing take part research study he/she require send receive multiple text-messages start , , end schedule shift work ?</detailed_description>
