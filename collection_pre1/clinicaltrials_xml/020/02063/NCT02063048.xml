	<detailed_description>Text message show effective weight-loss limit test . DH experience text message base intervention weight management intervention . This study aim enhance Denver Health 's ( DH ) exist Patient Relationship Management ( PRM ) text message ( SMS ) infrastructure include culturally-appropriate outreach promote weight loss . Subjects randomized one two arm : - Usual care : Patients randomize arm receive text message weight-loss support besides usual care provide DH . They receive weight loss educational packet ask follow primary care provider discus effort weight loss additional follow-up direct provider . They contact periodically weigh . Providers make aware patient participate study 's control arm . - Text Message-based weight loss support . Patients receive weight loss educational packet randomize usual care . Patients assist choose self-management goal relate exercise eat behavior . They receive text message frequency 1x daily ; input focus group guide text message frequency . SMS content similar Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) curriculum fall follow category : - Outgoing `` tip day '' - Interactive message solicit simple response day participant - Outgoing reminder inform participant event community clinic appointment primary care provider . Basic descriptive statistic categorical variable generate describe baseline demographic clinical characteristic . Univariate analysis perform determine whether difference patient three arm intervention . For clinical outcome , general linear mixed effect model use intervention time ( interaction ) specify fixed effect determine whether change time outcomes differs significantly three group . A random subject effect specify model correlation observation take individual . Contrasts construct test difference intervention six month 12 month . If data follow approximate normal distribution normalize use log transformation rank outcomes analyze mixed effect model . All statistical analysis perform use Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS ) version 9.2 . The study power detect difference six month text message group usual care group . Previous research suggest , 60 participant per group , researcher would 89 % power detect difference group 1.7 kg . The investigator think reasonable estimate , subject control group study lose 0.4 kg , believe subject control group weight stable . While investigator anticipate patient participate DPP program lose weight , believe participation across usual care SMS group comparable ) randomization stratify two group past participation DPP ii ) relatively equal participation two group anticipate throughout intervention period . This stratification intend equalize effect class-attendance heterogeneity across two study group . The study aim 90 participant per group improve power sub-group analysis .</detailed_description>
