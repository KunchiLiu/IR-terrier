	<brief_summary>Technologic advance field radiation oncology make possible deliver highly conformal accurate radiation dose target tissue . Accompanying rapid implementation novel technique often reduction radiation margin , reinforces importance accurate target delineation , reduces side effect therapy . F-18 FDG PET/CT widely use oncology , include complete whole body staging , restaging monitor tumor response different type cancer . As non-oncology application , inflammation almost tissue result increase FDG accumulation . However , normal tissue spar radiation may show subtle change , would difficult detect . FDG PET/CT limit spatial resolution 5 mm low FDG-avid disease . To evaluation interval change metabolic response radiotherapy thoracic malignancy , plan initiate prospective study trail take advantage recent technical advance technique 4-dimensional PET/CT ( 4-D PET/CT ) respiratory gate system . Respiratory motion create artifact PET PET/CT image , alter diagnosis . The tumor edge would blur due respiratory movement , underestimated uptake value . Also , semi-quantitative measurement , standard uptake value ( SUV ) , combine parameter lesion site shape , commonly use make final assessment disease would mis-estimated . The study aim investigate correlation 4-D PET/CT respiratory gate method free breathe PET/CT process primary thoracic malignancy normal tissue effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiation pneumonitis dose-limiting toxicity thoracic radiotherapy ( RT ) thoracic malignancy . It occur begin initiation RT 6 month characterize cough , shortness breath , change lung function . A mortality rate approach 50 % severe radiation pneumonitis [ 4 ] . Dosimetric parameter , percentage lung volume irradiate â‰§20 Gy ( V20 ) mean lung dose ( MLD ) , provide guide ass risk radiation pneumonitis treatment planning process . However , parameter poor predictive power individual risk . The appearance radiation lung injury show computed tomography ( CT ) characterize early late phase . Since , radiation pneumonitis characterize migration leukocytes blood irradiated lung tissue ; thus , FDG-PET imaging , intense inflammatory response result great FDG uptake . Identifying early sign precursor normal tissue damage help predict delay organ dysfunction . In combined PET/CT , CT use localization correction attenuation PET image . An accurate spatial registration PET CT image set prerequisite accurate diagnosis SUV measurement . However , respiration , difference acquisition time require image thorax PET ( 6-9 minute ) CT ( ~15 second ) , spatial misalignment 2 image set uncommon . This misalignment significantly compromise interpretation PET image , result mislocalization lesion inaccurate quantitation SUV . The main cause artifact dynamic interaction transaxial image acquisition asynchronous motion tumor normal tissue . To account motion effect , respiratory gate technique develop . A sophisticated respiratory-motion monitoring system Real-Time Position Management respiratory gate system ( RPM ) . The system include video camera measure respiratory motion track vertical displacement 2 infrared reflective marker rigidly mount plastic block place patient 's thorax . The motion block display graphical interface RPM workstation . It use gate radiotherapy lung , respiratory-gated CT , 4-D CT , well respiratory-gated PET imaging . We plan enroll patient thoracic cancer schedule radiotherapy . Patients pre-existing chronic lung disease , COPD , interstitial lung disease , cystic lung disease , et al , exclude . The FDG PET/CT perform radiotherapy ( baseline study ) , 30-45 day complete radiotherapy ( 2nd study ) . Free-breathing whole body scan perform 40 minute , regional 4D PET/CT RPM method chest perform subsequently . These patient follow-up radiation oncology clinic , radiation-related adverse effect long-term prognosis record . The association data analysis investigate . We obtain good delineation correlation difference free-breathing PET/CT 4-D PET/CT RPM respiratory-gating method process tumor metabolism , , assess normal tissue metabolic effect . And work try find application help clinical outcome prediction prognosis technique 4-D PET/CT RPM respiratory-gating method .</detailed_description>
