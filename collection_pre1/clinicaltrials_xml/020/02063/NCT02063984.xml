	<brief_summary>This study continue research design improve treatment outcomes adolescent substance use disorder integrate neuroscience- behaviorally-based treatment . In particular , project first evaluate whether Working Memory Training enhance cognitive function reduce impulsive decision make improve abstinence outcome . In addition , adaptive abstinence-based incentive program evaluate new method intervene respond first-line treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study test two novel strategy enhance outcomes . Working Memory Training ( WMT ) , efficacious method strengthen specific cognitive process , aim improve factor ( e.g. , delay discounting / impulsive decision-making ) show strong relation substance use treatment response . Second , intensive high magnitude CM ( ICM ) use motivate abstinence among teen abstinent Week 6 . The investigator hypothesize strategy improve outcomes modify fundamental cognitive system involve make choice engage risky behavior increase motivation abstain early nonresponders . Aim 1 pilot refine new procedure community clinic preparation randomize trial . A sequential , multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) allow study determine effective first-line treatment effective adaptive strategy ( Aim 2 ) . All teen begin treatment CM CM/WMT . After 4 week , responder continue first-line treatment , nonresponders randomize ICM continue first-line treatment . Aim 3 conduct mechanistic analysis ass whether cognitive change relate WMT engender increase abstinence , whether specific tailor variable moderate treatment effect . Aim 4 gather formative data implementation factor inform future large-scale study dissemination effort . Primary hypothesis : ( 1 ) first-line treatment WMT improve abstinence outcome reduce relapse ; ( 2 ) strategy ICM nonresponders result good outcome without ; ( 3 ) WMT reduce delay discounting , predict outcome . The unique approach hold promise reduce multiple type risky behavior affect basic mechanism determine impulsive decision-making .</detailed_description>
