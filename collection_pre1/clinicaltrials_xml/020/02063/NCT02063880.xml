	<brief_summary>Design : Randomized clinical trial involve hospitalize HIV-1 infected child . Children randomize randomize urgent ( &lt; 48 hour ) versus early antiretroviral therapy ( 7-14 day ) . This trial unblinded . Population : Hospitalized HIV-1 infected child antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) naïve ≤ 12 year age . Sample size : 360 child randomize ( 180 per arm ) . Treatment : All infant treat ART accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) Kenyan national guideline . Study duration : Enrollment study occur course 36-48 month infant routinely follow maximum 6 month . Study site : Kenyan hospital . Primary hypothesis : HIV-1 infected child hospitalize severe co-infection either may unsalvageable due far advanced immunosuppression/co-infection may benefit urgent ART . Secondary hypothesis : Urgent ART acute infection could potentially result increase risk immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) drug toxicities/interactions . Specific aim : 1 . To compare 6 month all-cause mortality rate , incidence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) , incidence drug toxicity HIV-1 infected child ( ≤ 12 year old ) present hospital serious infection randomize urgent ( &lt; 48 hour ) versus early ART ( 7-14 day ) . 2 . To determine co-factors mortality , IRIS , drug toxicity . Potential cofactor include : baseline weight-for-age , height-for-age , weight-for-height ( Z-scores ) , CD4 , HIV-1 RNA , type co-infection , age , rate viral load CD4 change follow ART , immune activation marker , pathogen HIV-1 specific immune response . Secondary aim : To determine etiology IRIS compare immune reconstitution HIV , TB , EBV CMV follow ART overall trial arm .</brief_summary>
