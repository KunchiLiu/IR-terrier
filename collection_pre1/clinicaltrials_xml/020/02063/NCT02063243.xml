	<brief_title>Intralesional Cryotherapy With Argon Gas Based Device Treatment Keloid Hypertrophic Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intralesional ( IL ) cryotherapy novel treatment keloid hypertrophic scar , scar frozen inside . Published result promise , however Caucasian patient population study . This prospective evaluation study effectiveness IL cryotherapy treat keloid hypertrophic scar population consist Fitzpatrick skin type patient . Multiple device available , mostly base simple open system . Closed , argon gas base , system highly control provide accurate freezing . However , technique never use IL cryotherapy treatment keloid hypertrophic scar . All patient keloid hypertrophic scar meet inclusion criterion treat argon base device call Seednet . Scar quality possible recurrence assess pre- postsurgery ( 3 , 6 12 month ) objective device determine scar color , scar elasticity , scar volume patient 's skin type . In addition , scar evaluate use Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale .</detailed_description>
