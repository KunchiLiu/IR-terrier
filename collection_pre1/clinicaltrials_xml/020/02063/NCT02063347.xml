	<detailed_description>Background PROTECTIVE EFFECT AND INTER-INDIVIDUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE COLLATERAL CIRCULATION IN DIFFERENT VASCULAR REGIONS Of vascular region , collateral circulation heart probably extensively study since initial study Fulton.1 The clinical importance coronary collateral circulation2 establish numerous investigation demonstrate protective role well vs. poorly grow coronary collateral artery . Whereas involvement peripheral arterial network obstructive arterial disease frequently asymptomatic , , nevertheless , relevant association increase mortality strong predictor adverse cardiovascular outcome . The clinical relevance collateral circulation low extremity epitomize discrepancy frequently encounter long segmental occlusion rare occurrence severe ischemia amputation . With regard systematic evaluation apparently well-collateralized region , , however , recently assessment use direct quantitative method perform . Regarding kidney , collateral circulation hitherto subject systematic research experimental study , data human sparse limited angiographic assessment . While hypertensive effect renal arterial constriction well-known since seminal study Goldblatt 1934 , effect renal collateral context neglect despite readily apparent effect therefrom experiment . The duration ensue hypertension short Goldblatt 's experiment dog , observation explain abate effect efficient collateral renal artery constriction consequently develop reduction renal ischemia . In human , limited indirect data compensatory effect renal collateral circulation set renal arterial constriction exist.The ratio selective renin concentration sample renal vein kidney ( affected/unaffected ) commonly use assess hemodynamic significance unilateral renal artery stenosis . Ernst et al. , 37 patient unilateral renal stenosis , determine ( selective ) renal vein renin ratio additionally perform angiography presence renal collateral ( document 68 % ) . Renal collateral tend normalize renin excretion kidney affect renal artery stenosis . Indeed , 7 patient severe stenosis visible renal collateral normal renin ratio cut-off 1.4 . The clinical relevance renal artery stenosis underscore prevalence significant proportion patient undergoing routine cardiac angiography.22 , 23 In context , noteworthy hypertension present almost one half patient angiographically significant narrowing renal artery . PRE-EXISTING COLLATERAL CIRCULATION AND ITS INTRA-INDIVIDUAL DISTRIBUTION As allude , acute vascular occlusion arteriosclerosis ensue absence relevant narrowing . In situation , solely native , pre-existing collateral extent lessen ischemic tissue injury . On hand , gradual narrow vessel allow development large arterial anastomosis pre-existing small arteriole process know arteriogenesis . The notion pre-existing collateral extent nevertheless remain basis capacity anastomose enlarge support instructive experimental study Zbinden et al . : Flow recovery superficial femoral artery ligation correlate strikingly pre-existing collateral extent . Thus , mouse already high level pre-existing collateral concordantly high flow recovery , mice low level pre-existing collateral low flow recovery . Given systemic process atherosclerosis , preform innate human collateral function different vascular region mention interest . On patient level , relate intra- , opposed inter-individual distribution collateral network . While inter-individual distribution collateral function human show vary widely also absence vascular narrowing , recent experimental study mice show innate collateral extent share qualitatively different tissue . However , human , association collateral function different vascular region human far investigate . In conclusion , clinical experimental study demonstrate importance pre-existing , ie innate collateral supply different vascular region . Furthermore , pathophysiological consideration experimental data imply important role association collateral function different vascular region . Objective To determine vivo prevalence distribution functional collateral supply coronary , renal peripheral circulation , intra-individual association collateral function different vascular territory . Additionally , effect renal collateral response kidney short bout ischemia investigate . Methods DESIGN Prospective , comparative observational study collateral function measurement coronary , renal superficial femoral artery . PRIMARY STUDY ENDPOINT Pressure-derived collateral flow index ( CFI ) SECONDARY STUDY ENDPOINTS Intracoronary ECG ST segment shift temporary coronary balloon occlusion ; plasma renin concentration , immediately 10 minute main renal artery occlusion , sample suprarenal inferior vena cava ; transcutaneous oxygen tension ( tcpO2 ) obtain leave superficial femoral artery occlusion leave anteromedial low leg .</detailed_description>
