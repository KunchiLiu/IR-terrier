	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : A primary aim phase II FOCULM study explore whether cetuximab combination FOLFOXIRI first treatment could improve surgical conversion patient KRAS/NRAS wild-type , unresectable liver - metastasis colorectal cancer . The first secondary aim evaluate safety tolerability chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI plus Cetuximab target therapy regimen patient population . Secondary aim include determination objective response rate , progression free survival , quality life time recurrence patient undergo complete resection and/or ablation liver .</brief_summary>

Male female subject &gt; 18 year &lt; 65 age Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 must consider potential candidate major hepatic surgical procedure . Histological cytological documentation adenocarcinoma colon rectum . All histological type exclude . There must documentation PET/CT scan , CT scan , MRI , intraoperative palpation ( time resection primary colorectal tumor , applicable ) patient evidence metastasis confine Liver ( Histologic confirmation hepatic metastasis required. ) . The liver metastases must determine hepatic surgeon approve participate study unresectable base least one follow criterion : All liver metastasis resect ( and/or ablate ) negative margin , i.e. , lesion ( ) locate area would result resection hepatic vein main portal vein right leave hepatic artery common bile duct ; Complete resection and/or ablation would require great 60 % liver parenchyma remove . Patients eligible follow : primary tumor regional node resect clear surgical margin evidence extrahepatic disease ; unresected primary tumor plan resect primary tumor prior study entry ; unresected primary tumor plan resect primary tumor liver metastases single surgical procedure perform within 8 week last preoperative dose chemotherapy/cetuximab ; unresected primary plan resect primary tumor liver metastasis stag procedure perform within 8 week last preoperative dose chemotherapy/cetuximab . The colorectal primary tumor metastatic tumor must determine KRAS NRAS wildtype . At least one measurable lesion liver metastases accord accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion measure within 4 week prior registration . No previous systemic anticancer therapy include cytotoxic therapy , signal transduction inhibitor , immunotherapy hormonal therapy metastatic disease metastatic disease ( adjuvant chemotherapy nonmetastatic disease allow terminate 6 month ago ) .
