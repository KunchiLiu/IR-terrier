	<brief_summary>Recently , availability R substantially change therapeutic approach FL patient , since combination chemotherapy improve response rate , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Based result recently complete randomized study standard treatment patient FL consist initial therapy R-CHOP combination follow two-year maintenance R. Although result randomized trial confirm approach result improve patient ' outcome make step forward management patient FL , one important question raise approach really need patient FL could benefit reduced intensity treatment achieve result term outcome survival . This question particular interest newly diagnose patient maintenance affect OS . More recent data demonstrate outcome patient FL predict evaluate quality response therapy study minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . This project address objective evaluate combine clinical response assess FDG-PET scan molecular response measure MRD detection could permit single group patient different risk progression consequently modulate maintenance therapy , aim provide clinician rational use available diagnostic therapeutic resource .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Response-adapted Strategy Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , phase III , superiority study compare standard v response drive approach maintenance . Adult patient ( age ≥ 18 year ) naïve , untreated follicular lymphoma , stage II-IV , Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 ( FLIPI2 ) &gt; 0 require therapeutic intervention recruit randomly assign 1:1 ratio either standard experimental arm . All patient receive induction therapy 6 cycle R-CHOP R-bendamustine 2 additional dos Rituximab . At baseline patient assess molecular status stag mean CT scan . A baselineFluorine-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan also perform . At end chemoimmunotherapy patient assess disease response common clinical laboratory examination , CT scan FDG-PET . An intermediate assessment response CT scan FDG-PET ( optional ) also perform first four course R-chemoimmunotherapy . At end induction therapy status minimal residual disease also evaluate . After induction treatment respond patient standard arm receive standard maintenance therapy Rituximab ( every 2 month 2 year ) , patient experimental arm subdivide two risk group assign different post induction treatment base FDG-PET MRD result . In arm , patient stable progressive disease ( PET positive less PR CT scan ) address salvage treatment choose physician discretion . In experimental arm , risk group allocation perform primarily basis FDG-PET result : - Group 1 ( low risk ) : negative FDG-PET - Group 2 ( high risk ) : positive FDG-PET Patients low risk ( FDG-PET negative ) receive maintenance therapy accord MRD status , particularly : - Group 1a ( MRD negative ) : observation - Group 1b ( MRD positive ) : pre-emptive Rituximab therapy Patient high risk ( FDG-PET positive ) receive maintenance regardless MRD status : · Group 2 : intensified maintenance ( ( 90 ) Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan + Rituximab maintenance )</detailed_description>
