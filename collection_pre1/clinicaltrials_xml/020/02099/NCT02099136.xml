	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify change erythema response human subject expose minimally erythemic dos solar-simulated ultraviolet light celecoxib treatment . II . Determine effect celecoxib various biomarkers follow ultraviolet ( UV ) -irradiation . The modulation follow biomarkers , treatment celecoxib examine : apoptosis proliferation index , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) , cyclooxygenase- 2 ( COX-2 ) level . OUTLINE : Patients undergo UV-irradiation right buttock baseline . Chromameter reading obtain 24 hour post UV-irradiation patient undergo skin biopsy 24 96 hour follow UV-irradiation . Patients randomize 1 5 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients receive placebo orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 14 day . GROUP II : Patients receive low-dose celecoxib PO BID 14 day . GROUP III : Patients receive high dose celecoxib PO BID 14 day . GROUP IV : Patients receive dose celecoxib PO Group III daily ( QD ) 14 day . GROUP V : Patients receive high-dose celecoxib PO QD 14 day . After 10 day post-treatment , patient undergo UV-irradiation leave buttock . Chromameter reading obtain 24 hour post UV-irradiation patient undergo skin biopsy 24 96 hour follow UV-irradiation . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 25 .</detailed_description>
