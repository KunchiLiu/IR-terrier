	<detailed_description>The study investigate functional metabolic change course antidepressive treatment . The investigator apply different image method investigate effect antidepressive intervention rest state neural activity , functional activiation cognitive emotional stimulation , neurotransmitter concentration well concentration brain- derive neurotrophic factor . The investigator hypothesize antidepressive intervention modulate excitatory glutamatergic system thereby increase either concentration glutamate glutamate/ glutamine ratio . These metabolic change accompany altered functional activation medial lateral prefrontal area emotional cognitive stimulation , respectively . After longterm treatment , excitatory glutamate inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration adapt new homeostatic level reflect antidepressive response remission symptom . The investigator assume level glutamate gamma-aminobutyric acid determine amplitude BOLD responses emotional cognitive stimulation . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize plasma concentration brain- derive neurotrophic factor might predictor therapy response change course treatment . With protocol adhere rule good scientific practice observe relevant law , regulation guideline pertain project . The investigator ' study compliance Declaration Helsinki approve local ethic committee . Storage data accordance german privacy law .</detailed_description>
