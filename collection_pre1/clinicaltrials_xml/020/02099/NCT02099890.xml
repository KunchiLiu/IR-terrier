	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) condition commonly associate state chronic inflammation due number factor . A loss motor sensory function typically result great susceptibility development acute secondary health complication urinary tract infection pressure sores result frequent bout inflammation . The loss mobility also place individual elevate risk development variety metabolic disorder obesity type 2 diabetes ; independently associate chronic inflammation . Additionally , elevate level circulate proinflammatory cytokine autoantibody show present serum individual SCI even asymptomatic secondary health complication . As , follow SCI , individual commonly state perpetual low grade inflammation . It yet establish whether elevation proinflammatory mediator beneficial patient fact surrogate marker neurological impairment . Such mediator play critical role tissue repair however , also well establish immune system ability communicate system body . As , immune system ability influence influence system suggest immune dysfunction capability ( likelihood ) influence nervous system degree . A variety neurological behavioural disorder include depression , cognitive impairment , neuropathic pain link state chronic inflammation dramatically elevate prevalence follow SCI . Pro-inflammatory mediator suggest influence nervous system via direct indirect mechanism . There evidence suggest cytokine may directly influence somatic nerve alter ion channel kinetics channelopathy . Pro-inflammatory cytokine also show possess ability up-regulate key enzyme result protein imbalance and/or increase production neuromodulatory protein , may influence severity variety neural disorder . Presently , majority treatment strategy condition major depression pain utilize drug treatment target `` downstream '' enzymes receptor . As , treatment provide fairly rapid affective relief symptom . However , strategy target inflammatory basis disorder provide temporary solution whereby symptom likely return upon cessation treatment . In addition , long term use certain drug treatment selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI 's ) may enhance biochemical vulnerability exacerbate symptom long-term . An understanding immune nervous system interact may provide unique opportunity treat neural behavioral disorder target aspect immune system via anti-inflammatory intervention . Natural anti-inflammatory intervention include diet consist food supplement anti-inflammatory property may effective option treat inflammation population . As treatment strategy target inflammatory basis many disorder would expect lead reduction pro-inflammatory mediator thereby lead sustainable long-term immune improvement . Despite , surprisingly little research focus use anti-inflammatory food treatment chronic inflammatory condition , effect specific SCI almost completely neglect . The research objective present study evaluate effect reduce inflammatory state mean anti-inflammatory diet depression , cognitive impairment , neuropathic pain , somatic autonomic nerve function . Participants place 3 month anti-inflammatory diet consist daily supplementation include omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , InflanNox ( curcumin ) , anti-oxidants , chlorella , vegetarian protein powder . A focus food supplement natural anti-inflammatory property expect lead beneficial reduction incidence infection well positive metabolic adaptation . Together , help reduce elevate level proinflammatory mediator . It hypothesize reduction pro-inflammatory mediator result positive alteration enzyme regulation lead beneficial change protein balance ultimately improvement measure outcome .</detailed_description>
