	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study genetic molecular mechanism assess response patient prostate cancer receive enzalutamide therapy . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , enzalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Studying sample tissue blood laboratory patient prostate cancer may help doctor good understand hormone resistant prostate cancer . It may also help doctor make improvement prostate cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Molecular Mechanisms Assessing Response Patients With Prostate Cancer Receiving Enzalutamide Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) change ( &lt; / &gt; = 50 % decline ) 12 week vs. baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure PSA change 12 week study visit vs. baseline enzalutamide treatment . II . To measure objective response enzalutamide treatment . III . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways progression-free survival , disease-specific survival , overall survival . IV . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways time PSA progression . V. To identify molecular feature cellular pathway present tumor men metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) progress despite enzalutamide treatment . VI . To explore correlation baseline molecular feature pathway change circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) count . VII . To explore correlation baseline molecular feature pathways objective response . VIII . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature pathways degree PSA decline 12 week maximal PSA decline observe study . IX . To assess correlation baseline molecular feature time treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( cfDNA ) molecular feature blood molecular feature pathways biopsy sample . II . To assess correlation cfDNA molecular feature endpoint primary secondary objective list . III . To assess correlation cell-free DNA tumor molecular feature change PSA discontinue enzalutamide . IV . To explore correlation baseline molecular feature tissue histology . V. To explore correlation baseline tissue histology PSA change , time PSA progression , time treatment , progression-free survival , overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor biopsy metastatic site study entry ( prior initiation enzalutamide ) time progression . Patients may continue treatment beyond progression investigator 's discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-3 6 week every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
