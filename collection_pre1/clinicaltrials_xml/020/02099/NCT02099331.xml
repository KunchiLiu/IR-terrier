	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common heart rhythm condition occur cardiac surgery associate increase hospital length stay , overall hospital cost , worsen clinical condition high rate death . Newer research indicate inflammation key contributor atrial fibrillation set . Melatonin naturally make hormone regard extremely effective anti-inflammatory substance , favorable safety profile . This clinical trial do test ability melatonin reduce risk develop atrial fibrillation cardiac surgery . This research study patient give either oral melatonin 40 mg placebo nightly prior sleep . The study product start approximately 2 day prior schedule surgery date continue 3rd day operation . The remainder clinical care remain . The investigator project patient receive melatonin significant decrease occurrence atrial fibrillation surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common arrhythmia occur coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . This arrhythmia occur approximately 1 every 3 patient set rate even high valve combine valve CABG procedure . The majority episodes atrial fibrillation occur within first 3 day cardiac surgery initial episode atrial fibrillation , majority go another recurrence within 2 day first episode . Postoperative atrial fibrillation associate increase neurological , renal infectious complication well prolonged hospitalization significant increase overall healthcare cost . There considerable amount emerge data indicate inflammation oxidative stress , way reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , associate cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) may play important role development postoperative atrial fibrillation . Prior animal study demonstrate ROS may lead electroanatomical remodel increase vulnerability atrial fibrillation promote progressive fibrosis subsequent alteration extracellular matrix . A randomized controlled trial demonstrate beneficial effect pre-treatment anti-inflammatory medication statins prevention post-operative atrial fibrillation . With mind , anti-inflammatory therapy may also effective prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation . Melatonin ( N - acetyl - 5 - methoxytryptamine ) main product secrete pineal gland show powerful scavenger ROS regard potent endogenous antioxidant . In fact , melatonin effective antioxidant remove free radical lipophilic hydrophilic property contribute consistent penetration cellular membrane . In addition naturally synthesize hormone , melatonin show favorable safety profile administer clinical setting . For reason , investigator design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial patient undergo cardiac surgery CPB , randomize melatonin placebo investigator determine incidence post operative atrial fibrillation group . Additionally , investigator measure ROS serum well right atrial appendage sample subject assess effect melatonin ROS level compare placebo .</detailed_description>
