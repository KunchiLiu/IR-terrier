	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death US . Statistics show approximately 91 % individual CVD vascular dysfunction . Hypertension major modifiable risk factor CVD approximately 60 % adult US pre-hypertensive hypertensive . In addition , prevalence hypertension associate age gender ; however , increase blood pressure ( BP ) woman menopause exceeds men . The development effective safe strategy improve vascular function significance great impact quality life , productivity economic burden affect population . One alternative would introduce diet food source rich naturally occur bioactive compound . Thus , long-term goal investigator provide feasible effective dietary way postmenopausal woman improve vascular function quality life . Strawberries rich source bioactive compound total antioxidant content rank third among fruit vegetable . Hence , purpose study bring forth evidence incorporation strawberry diet reduce blood pressure improve cardiovascular function pre- stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal woman . Sixty eligible postmenopausal woman age 45 65 seat BP ≥ 130/85 mm Hg ≤ 160/100 mmHg screen visit randomly assign one three group : 1 . 25 g freeze-dried strawberry powder ; 2 . 50 g freeze-dried strawberry powder ; 3. placebo powder . Participants ask consume supplement 8-weeks . Medical history , medication use , dietary intake , physical activity assess 0- , 4- , 8-weeks follow blood draw . Serum level marker cardiovascular function well oxidative stress inflammation measure . The investigator hypothesize regular consumption strawberry improve cardiovascular function , decrease BP blood marker oxidative stress well inflammation . Investigators also expect finding study provide foundation study examine effect long-term incorporation strawberry diet integrity cardiovascular system .</brief_summary>
