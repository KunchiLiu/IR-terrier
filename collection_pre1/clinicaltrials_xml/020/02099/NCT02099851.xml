	<brief_title>Endovascular Carotid Body Ablation Patients With Treatment- Resistant Hypertension : A Safety Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose new method treatment , unilateral carotid body ablation , treatment- resistant hypertensive patient restore normal blood pressure control , reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient . This strategy increase number therapeutic option available many patient physician well offer potential normal blood pressure patient blood pressure remain elevated despite vigorous , drug device base therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age participant 1875 year . Treatmentresistant hypertensive subject medical management . Office systolic blood pressure ( oBP ) ≥ 160mmHg . Daytime mean ambulatory BP ( ABPM ) ≥ 140 mmHg . Persistent hypertension least three antihypertensive medication , include diuretic , stable , maximum tolerate dose within last 90 day . No evidence cause secondary HTN ( hypertension ) follow thorough clinical assessment . At least one carotid body detect CT angiography neck , define hyperenhanced ovoid structure strongly locate postermedially area carotid bifurcation . Ability give give inform consent participate study . Women childbearing potential negative pregnancy test . Calculated GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ) &lt; 30ml/min/m2 Obstructive carotid atherosclerotic disease precludes safe delivery ablation catheter performance ablation Must least 6 month post renal denervation therapy . Oxygen saturation rest 92 % . Requirement oxygen therapy maintain oxygen saturation . Severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea ( define apneahypopnea index ( AHI ) ≥ 30/hour Polysomnography associate average minimum oxygen desaturation &lt; 85 % . Patients wish participate mountain climbing , sky dive free diving . Pregnancy anticipation pregnancy . Acute coronary syndrome unstable angina &lt; 6 month schedule procedure . History repeat episode hypoglycemia hypoglycemic unawareness . Known diabetic autonomic neuropathy . History , current atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Life expectancy le 24 month due disease . Intravenous inhale recreational drug use . Excessive use alcohol sedative ( alcohol intake &gt; 28 units/week ) . Morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 ) . Febrile illness within two week participation . History Stroke , transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) significant chronic neurological condition medical history . History spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage within past 12 month . Unable tolerate exposure radiopaque contrast agent . Unable tolerate aspirin and/or anticoagulation ; antiplatelet medication . Femoral arterial access possible . Presence carotid artery dissection prior index procedure . Atherosclerotic disease involve vessel adjoin carotid body , marked vessel tortuosity anatomical finding preclude safe placement guide catheter investigational system , delivery RF energy . Carotid body within reach investigational system due position within carotid bifurcation distance CB ( carotid body ) femoral access point . Other abnormal angiographic finding indicate patient risk stroke , carotid intracranial aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) , developmental traumatic vascular lesion tumor . Dementia confusion preclude patient 's full understanding information require informed consent full participation study . Unable attend schedule follow appointment one ( 1 ) _month , three ( 3 ) month , six ( 6 ) month , one ( 1 ) year two ( 2 ) year post treatment . History gastrointestinal bleeding within last six ( 6 ) month . Active treat malignancy last twelve ( 12 ) month . Patient participate another clinical study followup currently go . Patient noncardiac comorbidities life expectancy &lt; 2 year . Patient condition , opinion Investigator , preclude participation , include willingness comply followup procedure .</criteria>
