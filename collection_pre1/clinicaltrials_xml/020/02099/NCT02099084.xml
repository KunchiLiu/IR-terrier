	<brief_summary>This research study do see effect Teduglutide people short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) . Teduglutide synthetic medication administer injection , show increase intestinal blood flow , inhibit gastric secretion , increase growth intestinal cell increase absorption nutrient . Teduglutide demonstrate decrease Total Parenteral Nutrition ( TPN ) requirement 20 % . Teduglutide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment adult patient Short Bowel Syndrome ( SBS ) dependent parenteral support . The primary hypothesis study 1 ) Teduglutide significantly increase gastric empty half time solid compare placebo . 2 ) Teduglutide significantly decrease intestinal permeability urinary excretion lactulose compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Bowel Syndrome Teduglutide Versus Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) refer anatomical and/or functional decrease small intestinal absorptive capacity , mostly cause extensive intestinal resection . The decrease intestinal absorptive capacity lead malabsorption cause malnutrition , dehydration weight loss , severely impact patient 's quality life . In study , qualify participant assign 2 different treatment arm consist placebo Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously daily seven day . Subsequently , participant switch alternate treatment arm seven day , washout period least seven day . In arm , six day treatment placebo , participant underwent series measurement day 7 treatment , include 8 hour GI transit , permeability measurement use mannitol lactulose ( 0-2h , 2-8h collection ) , 8 hour urine stool collection measurement volume . Throughout study participant fill food diary stool diary ( number , consistency , ease passage ) every day . On day 7 intervention period participant arrive clinical research unit fast least 8 hour . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test . Participants receive seventh dose placebo Teduglutide ( 1 dose , 1 hour breakfast ) . Technetium sestamibi ( 99mTc ) pellet ingest scramble egg , toast , milk meal ( 218 kcal ) facilitate measurement gastric transit . All subject receive standard 550 kcal meal 4 hour ( chicken meal ) radiolabeled meal .</detailed_description>
