	<brief_summary>Studies show individual suffer spinal cord injury increase risk Vitamin D deficiency compare able-bodied individual . It recently show Vitamin D deficiency link large number disease condition , include chronic lung disease , vascular problem , insulin resistance . If common nutritional deficiency proven cause disease condition person SCI , may easily remedied cheap effective therapeutic approach : vitamin D replacement therapy . Because high prevalence vitamin D deficiency person SCI , therapy alone combination treatment option expect significantly improve overall well SCI population , decrease hospitalization rate , low financial burden care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency prevalent individual Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) . Recent study link vitamin D prevention and/or treatment wide range disease , include chronic lung disease . Patients chronic lung disease appear increase risk vitamin D deficiency reason clear . Chronic lung disease asthma chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) link vitamin D genetic basis . A recent observational study find significant association vitamin D deficiency decrease pulmonary function large able-bodied population . The exact mechanism involve identify , postulate vitamin D possess range anti-inflammatory property involve modulation oxidative stress , , possibly , protease/antiprotease balance tissue damage/repair , mechanism show important pathogenesis chronic lung disease . The relationship vitamin D immune system utmost importance give individual high cervical lesion express many obstructive aspect pulmonary physiology commonly observe individual asthma , airway inflammation represent underlying pathophysiological mechanism . In addition high prevalence vitamin D deficiency , person SCI high prevalence insulin resistance ( IR ) , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . In general population , vitamin D deficiency show associated IR , IGT DM . If treatment vitamin D deficiency person SCI show associated improvement insulin sensitivity reduction impair glucose tolerance DM , progression severe carbohydrate disorder may delay prevent .</detailed_description>
