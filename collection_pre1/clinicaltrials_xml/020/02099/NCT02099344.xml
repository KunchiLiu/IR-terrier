	<brief_summary>Compare Artegraft Propaten graft use dialysis access see one performs well . How long one last complication arises graft longer use compare . The study hypothesis Artegraft , actual blood vessel , work well manufacture Propaten graft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artegraft Versus Propaten Dialysis Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50 eligible patient End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) require hemodialysis randomize receive one two graft part standard care . Patients assess 2-3 week post-operatively 6 12 month flow characteristic , dialysis adequacy graft associate complication stenosis , infection thrombosis . Data urea reduction ratio ( URR ) , kinetic modeling ( Kt/V ) , access flow ( QB ) collect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month via phone call hemodialysis center order evaluate patency function . Access complication ( stenosis , thrombosis , infection ) treat per standard protocol . These data record primary , assisted primary secondary patency rate calculate graft arm compare use life table analysis .</detailed_description>
