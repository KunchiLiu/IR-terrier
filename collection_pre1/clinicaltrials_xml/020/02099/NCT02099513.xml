	<brief_summary>This study develop pilot initial interface mobile health platform allow intra-individual tailor personalization health intervention . This allow just-in-time intervention adapt content timing , initially , also time base upon prior outcome data , response intervention , current environmental social context , activity level , location , time , individual 's psychophysiological state.1,2 Aim 1 : To develop initial interface mobile health platform allow patient report receive data represent multiple health domain include blood pressure , pO2 ( pulse oximeter ) , value , weight , physical activity , calorie burn , sleep , self-report survey measure pain fatigue . Aim 2 : To assess feasibility mobile health platform receive deliver data represent multiple health domain 1 month single-case study design ( N=6 ) .3 Aim 3 : To develop algorithm use diet data collect Aim 1 facilitate adaptive work provide patient automate real time feedback progress . Aim 4 : To develop algorithm use diet data collect Aim 1 facilitate adaptive approach alert clinician progress patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At baseline collect demographic variable acceptance use technology survey , biological variable include blood pressure , weight , blood glucose electronic medical record . Over period 1 month , participant ask track collect daily data weight use iHealth wireless scale . Participants also collect blood pressure ( BP ) , pO2 , pulse use iHealth blood pressure device . Physical activity sleep activity measure use fitbit device . Participants receive evidence-based daily nutrition exercise weight loss message via text message . Following one-month observation participant ask complete follow-up survey acceptance use technology undergo post-formative semi-structure telephone interview discus perception usefulness attitude toward platform , technical difficulty barrier , recommendation future development .</detailed_description>
