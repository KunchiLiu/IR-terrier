	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) bone marrow malignancy characterize poor bone marrow function may progress acute myeloid leukemia . Many patient become red blood cell transfusion-dependent . Transfusion dependence associate inferior quality life ( QOL ) . However , relationship degree anemia QOL less clear . A commonly use transfusion strategy target hemoglobin ( Hb ) range 80-90 g/L ( normal hemoglobin &gt; 120-130g/L ) . The question : would higher hemoglobin target lead improvement QOL despite negative impact transfusion dependence may QOL ( due associate time commitment , expense , transfusion reaction etc ) . Several group prospectively show target hemoglobin level great 120 g/L ( hematopoietic growth factor ( HGFs ) and/or blood transfusion ) incremental increase 15-20 g/L ( HGFs alone ) associate improved QOL . The investigator MDS program conduct prospective assessment QOL since 2007 register consent patient use variety validate questionnaire . Preliminary analysis ( 236 patient ) reveal , compare age-matched healthy general population , MDS patient inferior QOL . Transfusion dependence anemia independently predictive poor functioning , fatigue decrease health utility . Furthermore , hemoglobin level ≥100 g/L seem key threshold improvement function symptom score . The investigator hypothesize target hemoglobin transfusion dependent MDS patient low may account inferior quality life . Our goal compare effect QOL restrictive strategy ( current standard care ) , liberal transfusion strategy large randomize controlled trial transfusion dependent MDS outpatient . Before embark endeavor , investigator must first prove feasibility small pilot randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
