	<brief_summary>COPD currently afflict 24 million US resident ; prevalence COPD high among Veterans . Persons COPD significant functional disability result disease . This project determine whether novel Internet-mediated walking program couple pedometer improve exercise capacity , improve health-related quality life , decrease risk acute exacerbation person COPD . If successful , base estimate 33 64 % COPD patient Internet user , propose exercise intervention could help 8 million person . The Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) strong commitment provide care person COPD support research direct COPD-related disability . The 2012-2016 Strategic Plan VHA Office Research Development include research COPD rehabilitation . The propose research address Rehabilitation R &amp; D Service 's current priority area improve disabled Veterans ' health-related quality life reduce disease burden maximize functional recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Physical Activity Promotion Short Long-term Outcomes COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major cause global morbidity project become third lead cause death world 2020 . In Veterans , prevalence high ; VISN1 FY 2012 , 9 % outpatient Veterans ICD-9 diagnosis COPD . In COPD , shortness breath lead physical inactivity significant disability . A grow body knowledge identify physical activity exercise modifiable factor may impact COPD-related morbidity mortality . Epidemiological cross-sectional study show person COPD physically active well functional status less likely hospitalize die . A high daily step count , directly measure , associate low risk acute exacerbation ( AEs ) mortality COPD , independent lung function . Despite potential benefit , intervention increase walk person COPD . Although supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program improve exercise capacity , accessible could benefit low adherence rate . Novel intervention incorporate strategy behavioral change accessible , individualized , sustain need promote physical activity person limit COPD . Funded RR &amp; D CDA-2 Dr. Moy team develop pilot novel exercise intervention combine website pedometer promote walk person COPD . The program , Every Step Counts ( ESC ) Lung Health , accurately monitor walk , provide iterative feedback individualize goal-setting , delivers education motivation . This study propose 2-arm randomized , control trial study efficacy ESC improve exercise capacity person COPD , compare usual care ( verbal write instruction exercise ) . Primary Aim : Determine efficacy ESC intervention increase 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) distance . Secondary Aims : Estimate effect ESC intervention ( ) health-related quality life ( HRQL ) , measured St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) , ( b ) dyspnea , ( c ) inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein ( CRP ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , ( ) risk AEs COPD-related hospitalization , ( e ) engagement physical activity measure daily step count . 185 subject enrol total 12 month , interventional phase 6 month follow observational phase 6 month . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) one 2 arm : ( 1 ) verbal write instruction exercise home ( usual care ) ( 2 ) usual care plus pedometer Internet-mediated walking program . Subjects perform 6MWTs , complete questionnaire , blood drawn clinic visit baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Telephone contact occur 9 month . AE history daily step count assess contact . Analysis variance compare 6MWT distance intervention usual care group 6 month . Multivariate regression model ass 6MWT distance function treatment group , adjust baseline 6MWT distance , study site , season enrollment , unbalanced baseline characteristic . This study hypothesize person randomize ESC great 6MWT distance 6 month , compare person usual care group . It also hypothesize person randomize ESC great improvement HRQL , dyspnea , daily step count , great decrease level inflammatory biomarker risk AEs COPD-related hospitalization , compare control . The propose intervention potential ( 1 ) bring exercise program vast majority person COPD go hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation program , ( 2 ) improve effectiveness current rehabilitation program sustain long-term exercise , ( 3 ) become effective integral part COPD self-management program . Ultimately , intervention could decrease risk hospitalization , AEs , COPD-related morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
