	<brief_summary>This study involve research . Some chemotherapeutic drug permanently reduce hearing term `` ototoxic '' . One drug chemotherapy call cisplatin . Currently , patient receive cisplatin , hear test Audiology Clinic use lengthy protocol may retested requested oncologist Veteran arrange appointment . Researchers think hear test prior every treatment cisplatin may reduce number Veterans get disable hearing loss treatment . The purpose study compare current method monitoring hearing ( audiology clinic protocol term `` usual care '' ) new portable hearing monitoring program ( comprehensive program ototoxicity monitoring term `` COMP-VA '' ) test hear use portable hear test audiometer variety efficient tool technique test occur prior cisplatin treatment quiet location hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparison Ototoxicity Monitoring Programs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research objective compare effectiveness ototoxicity monitoring implement use Comp-VA usual care regard ( 1 ) improve Veterans ' hearing quality life outcome , ( 2 ) assist oncologist pre-treatment counseling therapeutic planning ( 3 ) increase use post-treatment rehabilitative service . The investigator plan recruit total 320 Veterans undergoing cisplatin chemotherapeutic treatment 4 year 120 control subject . Program Evaluation : Hearing test prior treatment do order establish eligibility , enroll randomize subject one two study arm . At 5 week one year post-randomization hearing re-tested order obtain estimate longitudinal trend hear quality life assessment . Use audiological service follow treatment randomized subject track . Finally , data also collect treatment interval track use counseling tool oncology personnel treatment decision . Serial measurement subject receive cisplatin prior treatment randomize : Comp-VA group get screen hear test prior treatment , treatment interval one-month post-treatment . Auditory test do near Chemo Unit include otoscopy , immittance testing , hear test do Veteran use self-testing procedure , may test use distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) , take reliable hearing test . Usual care group receive full audiometric evaluation ( otoscopy , immittance testing , air conduction bone conduction hear testing , speech audiometry , distortion product otoacoustic emission , DPOAEs ) schedule audiology clinic sound booth accord Audiology Service ototoxicity monitoring protocol . Testing arrange accord availability appointment patient convenience . Additionally data also collect control subject similar age test interval similar chemotherapy subject .</detailed_description>
