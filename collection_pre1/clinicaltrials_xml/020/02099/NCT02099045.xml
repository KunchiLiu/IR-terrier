	<brief_summary>Background : It well know emergency physician conduct ultrasound examination supplement initial physical examination . No previous study conduct evaluate total finding ultrasound broad unselected group patient Emergency Department . Aim : We aim identify pathology find unselected cohort patient Rural Emergency Department . Secondarily aim quantify change do treatment result ultrasound examination perform bedside Emergency Department . Hypothesis : Supplemental ultrasonographical examination change diagnostics treatment 10 % unselected cohort patient Emergency Department . Method : We perform structure ultrasound examination 406 patient unselected cohort emergency department . All patient age 18 year present emergency department include study . Patients unwilling give inform consent exclude study . Patients exclude ultrasonographic examination perform within first two hour initial contact treat physician . The study conduct two substudies . Sub study 1 include patient legally competent give inform consent . Sub study 2 include legally incompetent patient give informed consent due acute illness . These patient include study rule emergency research . After include patient ask treat physician series binary question regard diagnosis treatment plan . Outcome : Primary outcome pathology find ultrasound department . Secondary outcome change diagnosis treatment plan . Pathology change diagnosis/treatment stratify accord initial complaint , triage level , age factor . This never do unselected patient Emergency Department . Ethical consideration adverse effect : Ultrasound transmit high frequency wave tissue , reflect ultrasound probe . The time magnitude return sound wave interpret picture screen . No adverse effect report basis sound wave transmit tissue . Some patient might experience discomfort due sticky sensation application ultrasound gel . Others might experience discomfort pressure apply probe image . Adverse effect , aware , may exist . However , clinical ultrasound exist since 1950'ies new adverse effect unlikely . Publication : All result publish international peer-review journal . Also event inconclusive result .</brief_summary>
