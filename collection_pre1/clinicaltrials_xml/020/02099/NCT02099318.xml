	<detailed_description>Overview : This study blind , multicenter , randomize study compare key effort time variables 20 prospective SRP case effort time variables 20 video record control neurosurgery case . SRP control case randomly select accord predetermined alternate sequence . Effort assess number clip attempt clip evaluation , identify blind , train rater observe video record SRP neurosurgical case control neurosurgery case . Time assessed time vessel temporarily occlude well total microsurgical time . To maximize potential effect SRP platform learning , case protocol limited Chief Neurosurgery Resident Cerebrovascular Fellow performs majority microsurgical dissection . Their participation study researcher , participant . The SRP involve preoperative rehearsal planning . Similarly CT/MRI study , SRP available surgeon surgery evaluation optional surgical approach . Control case consist video record case do exact way perform prior implementation SRP neurosurgery case . Due alternation case , SRP control case take place period . Inclusion/exclusion criterion SRP case control case define clinically similar patient group . Only patient , opinion physician , qualify clip procedure consider study . The purpose project determine simulate practice surgeon prior surgery use SRP lead well effort time efficiency . Findings use inform development large rigorous trial SRP preliminary result promise . Inclusion/exclusion criterion follow : Inclusion criterion : - Patient age &gt; =18 year old unruptured rupture cerebral aneurysm anterior circulation craniotomy microsurgery recommend - Patients schedule undergo surgery clip cerebral aneurysm - Able provide write informed consent Exclusion criterion : - Repeat aneurysm surgery - Previous history craniotomy reason - Previous history non-aneurysmal hemorrhagic stroke - Pregnancy - Posterior circulation - Giant ( 25 mm large ) aneurysm - Nonsaccular aneurysm SRP case : After patient provide write informed consent , CT and/or MRI image obtain part routine preoperative care use construct model neurosurgeon use SRP . No new additional image obtain part study , SRP model rely neuroimaging conduct part standard preoperative assessment . For SRP case , prior perform surgery , surgeon plan rehearse patient-specific cerebral aneurysm surgery . Similarly CT/MRI study , SRP available surgeon surgery evaluation optional surgery approach . Control case : The control group randomly select accord predetermined alternate sequence consecutive prospectively video record aneurysm case . Informed consent patient control SRP group obtain . Surgical care : All surgical procedure do accord standard care . Except presurgical rehearsal , expect surgical procedure historical case SRP differ . All care receive surgery routine care . Research procedures measure Prior embark propose study , PI assign blind reviewer review video record case enrol site . This blind reviewer fully train neurosurgeon otherwise affiliate study . The reviewer undergo period train whereby review cohort record aneurysm case ( affiliated current study ) consultation primary investigator co-investigators time agreement reach regard method evaluation outcome measure . Following training blind reviewer , study proceed follow ( Figure 1 ) : 1 . Patient recruitment utilize inclusion/exclusion criterion , include collection demographic clinical patient data aneurysm characteristic ( Table 1 ) 2 . All surgery videotape consistently current procedure . All videotape consist microsurgical technique ; subject neurosurgery resident identify information reveal . 3 . Blinded evaluator view videotape surgery complete evaluate case use outcome measure previously describe . Subjects Subjects patient admit surgery clip cerebral aneurysm . Recruitment Study Population . Two center throughout US screen identify 60 subject unruptured rupture cerebral aneurysm . Patients identify recruited site emergency department , clinical stroke service , direct admission neurological ICUs . Case selection It must acknowledge prospectively collect control comparison ensure lack bias lead group differences neurosurgical procedure prospectively do SRP case control case . In effort standardize group comparison , control SRP case select time period practice surgical PI co-investigators . The PI surgical co-investigator experience neurosurgeon expert cerebral aneurysm clip surgery . Additionally , control cohort SRP cohort obtain consecutive manner begin implementation study minimize potential selection bias manner representative clinical practice . The investigator also attempt standardize group , include individual similar clinical demographic characteristic .</detailed_description>
