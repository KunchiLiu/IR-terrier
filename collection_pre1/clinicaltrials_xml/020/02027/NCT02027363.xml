	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer one common malignant tumor , morbidity approximate 100 million case per year . About 40 % patient present metastatic ( stage IV ) colorectal cancer time diagnosis , 25 % patient local lesion ultimately develop metastatic disease . 5-Fluorouracil（5-FU ) efficacious treatment metastatic colorectal cancer nineties 20th century , afterwards discovery chemotherapy oxaliplatin , irinotecan capecitabine , response rate well survival improve greatly . Most advanced colorectal cancer progress first-line treatment ; therefore , seek efficient low toxic maintain regimen prolong PFS become hot topic oncologic field . Some clinical research demonstrate maintain treatment follow first-line treating advance NSCLC could extend PFS OS . In metastatic colorectal cancer , patient receive 5-FU/leucovorin ( LV ) maintain therapy experience significantly longer PFS stop chemotherapy six cycle FOLFOX4 OPTIMOX2 study . One phase II study show median PFS 13.9 month , median OS 31 month 30 patient receive first-line treatment six- month FOLFOX4 follow UFT maintain treatment . A non-randomized small sample study conduct department medical oncology Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center indicate patient receive first-line treatment XELOX follow capecitabine maintaining therapy significantly prolong median TTP , compare non-maintaining treatment patient , ( 14months vs. 9 month , respectively ) . Above , far , data demonstrate regular 4-6 month chemotherapy follow maintaining treatment could prolong TTP OS advance colorectal cancer . Capecitabine effective colorectal cancer , approve palliative treatment advance colorectal cancer adjuvant chemotherapy ; addition , relative less frequency side effect convenient oral administration , capecitabine maintain regimen could prone accepted patient . Therefore , study design investigate capecitabine maintain treatment first-line palliative chemotherapy could improve TTP OS patient advance colorectal cancer perspective randomize clinical study .</brief_summary>
