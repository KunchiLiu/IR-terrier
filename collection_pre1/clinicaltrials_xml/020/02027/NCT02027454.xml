	<brief_summary>This study conduct comply Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommendation new non anti-arrhythmic drug assess cardiac repolarization effect electrocardiographic evaluation . Therefore , study evaluate effect GSK1265744 cardiac conduction assess collection twelve-lead continuous digital data healthy adult . This study evaluate effect three dos GSK1265744 QT duration correct heart rate ( QTc ) interval compare placebo . Moxifloxacin use positive control order validate sensitivity study detect QTc change . This study consist three treatment period ( separated 21 day washout period ) follow follow-up visit 10 14 day post last dosing . The total duration study include follow-up visit approximately 62 day . Approximately 42 subject enrol 34 subject complete dose critical assessment .</brief_summary>
