	<brief_summary>In study , combination two antibody conjugate cell-killing toxin ( so-called immunotoxins ) evaluate . The antibody direct T-cell antigen 'cluster differentiation 3 antigen ' ( CD3 ) CD7 . Previous vitro study demonstrate particular immunotoxin-combination , name T-Guard , act synergistically eliminate T cell preference kill activate T-cells . In subsequent clinical pilot-study , T-Guard generate encouraging result apply third-line therapy patient suffer form steroid-resistant acute Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) . Extensive biological clinical response could note absence severe acute toxicity . Building result , current study aim evaluate safety efficacy T-Guard treat steroid-resistant GVHD administer earlier phase disease process , i.e . second-line instead third-line therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study T-Guard Treat Steroid-resistant Acute GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental design bicentric non-controlled fixed-dose Phase I/II study . A total 20 adult patient acute steroid-resistant GVHD enrol 12 month period . The treatment consist standard dose 4 infusion T-Guard ( 4 mg/m2 ) , give 48-hours apart 4-hour period . The intended follow-up period 6 month . The primary objective determine efficacy T-Guard , 4 week first infusion ( Day 28 ) , induce objective clinical response patient acute GVHD refractory standard first line corticosteroid therapy . Secondary objective : - To evaluate overall safety efficacy T-Guard first 6 month imitation therapy ; - To determine pharmacokinetic profile T-Guard ; - To determine immunogenicity T-Guard . Exploratory objective : - To study specificity kinetics treatment-induced depletion subsequent repopulation lymphocyte subset ; - To evaluate diagnostic predictive GVHD biomarkers relative treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
