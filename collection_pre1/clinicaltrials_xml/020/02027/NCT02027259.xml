	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Nearly 33 % 24.5 million people US diabetes mellitus ( DM ) co-morbid depression . Since 65 % patient DM die cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , concomitant control CVD risk factor along glycemic control crucial prevent adverse outcome . However , co-morbid depression make DM CVD risk factor harder control . We demonstrate pharmacist-led group visit model consist : 1 ) pharmacotherapy management DM , hyperlipidemia hypertension , 2 ) self-management education , 3 ) case management 4 ) behavioral strategy DM CVD self-care behavior , efficacious improve hyperglycemia CVD risk factor compare standard primary care control general DM population also patient DM co-morbid depression . For participant DM depression also non-significant trend toward improvement depression despite lack depression treatment . OBJECTIVE : Our objective determine whether group visit add behavioral activation ( BA ) depression ( case ) great clinical impact standard group visit without BA depression ( active control ) reduce risk future coronary event measure United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) risk engine depression symptom measure Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) 6 month . RESEARCH PLAN/METHODS : The goal conduct randomized-controlled pilot trial ( n=25 arm ) evaluate clinical effect add BA group intervention patient DM depression Hemoglobin A1c &gt; =8 % PHQ-9 depression score &gt; =10 least one additional CVD risk factor tobacco use , hyperlipidemia hypertension American Heart Association American Diabetes Association guideline recommend goal . The intervention arm consist 4 weekly group visit 2-hour duration follow monthly booster group visit 6 month prevent relapse . The primary aim : - 1 ) To examine effect group visit model without added BA therapy 10-year UKPDS coronary event risk , PHQ-9 depression score 6 month - 2 ) To examine acceptability adherence group visit model without added BA therapy way focus group attendance The secondary aim - 1 ) To explore mediating factor group visit model add BA therapy associate improvement CVD risk depression</detailed_description>
