	<brief_title>Spinal Control During Functional Activities Improve Low Back Pain Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many people , mechanical low back pain ( LBP ) long-term , function-limiting condition rather short-term , self-limiting condition . Exercise one primary non-surgical approach use worldwide manage LBP . Specifically people chronic LBP , exercise find efficacious , efficacious 1 ) treatment , 2 ) usual care , 3 ) many treatment , massage laser therapy . Despite grow body evidence beneficial effect exercise , however , limit evidence 1 ) exercise best person , 2 ) long effect different exercise last , 3 ) type exercise people adhere , long , 4 ) mechanism underlie effect different type exercise . This study aim address limitation directly compare effect 1 ) exercise increase strength trunk increase flexibility trunk extremity , 2 ) individualize , motor skill train directed performance daily functional activity painful limit due person 's LBP . This study also examine 1 ) effect booster phase intervention , 2 ) relationship adherence intervention function , 3 ) relationship performance functional activity function-related outcome . People chronic LBP randomize 1 ) intervention strength flexibility exercise motor skill training , 2 ) booster no-booster intervention . Intervention provide 2 phase : 1 ) initial phase : 6 - 1 hour session , once/week 6 week , 2 ) booster phase : # session need regain independence home program , begin 6 month initial phase . The investigator collect 1 ) measurement pain , function , disability , economic outcome , 2 ) report adherence , 3 ) laboratory-based measure performance functional activity . People follow 12 month initial intervention phase . Three set hypotheses propose . First , investigator hypothesize intervention result improvement pain , function , disability , economic outcome , motor skill train result long lasting improvement strength flexibility exercise . Second , investigator hypothesize effect booster phase intervention 1 ) result longer lasting improvement function well adherence no-booster intervention , 2 ) great motor skill train strength flexibility exercise . Finally , investigator hypothesize 1 ) adherence motor skill train strongly relate function adherence strength flexibility exercise , 2 ) performance functional activity people receive motor skill train strongly relate function performance functional activity people receive strength flexibility exercise .</detailed_description>
