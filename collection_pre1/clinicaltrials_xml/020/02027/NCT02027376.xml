	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , phase Ib study . In trial , patient Triple Negative ( TN ) Advanced Breast Cancer ( ABC ) treat increase dos LDE225 docetaxel determine MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) , DLT ( Dose Limiting Toxicity ) RP2D ( Recommended Phase II Dose ) combination . Eligible patient hormonal receptor negative HER2 negative ABC include treat docetaxel intravenously every three week cycle . LDE225 administer orally three dose level 400 , 600 800mg QD ( -1 dose level include case dose de-escalation need ) . Treatment repeat day 1 21-day cycle radiographic symptomatic progression , unacceptable toxicity withdraws inform consent . The investigator propose develop phase Ib trial combination docetaxel LDE225 TN ABC patient define safety , tolerability RP2D , well information efficacy combination . Primary Objective : To determine MTD RP2D LDE225 administer orally combination docetaxel TN ABC patient . Primary End-point : To determine incidence rate DLT within first two cycle LDE225 combination docetaxel dose level . Secondary Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability LDE225 give combination docetaxel . - To characterize effect LDE225 combination docetaxel QTc interval correlation systemic drug exposure . - To evaluate efficacy combination docetaxel LDE225 TN ABC patient . - To evaluate Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) combination docetaxel LDE225 . Secondary End-points : - Safety assessed standard clinical laboratory test ( hematology , serum chemistry ) . Adverse event grade define NCI CTCAE v4.0 . - Changes QT/QTc baseline ECG value correlation systemic drug exposure . - The efficacy endpoint Time To Progression ( TTP ) Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) . TTP measure initiation treatment till disease progression ORR define RECIST 1.1 criterion complete response rate + partial response rate . - The PK determine whether LDE225 influence pharmacology docetaxel . Blood sample take time defined protocol . Exploratory Objectives : - To study potential predictive biomarkers efficacy evaluate activation Hh signal pathway relate pathway . - To analyze pharmacodynamic ( PD ) treatment effect expression Smo related biomarkers Hg target gene correlative sample . - To correlate biomarker , PD PK finding efficacy toxicity data . Exploratory End-points : - Hh gene expression signature associate pathway activation ( least Shh , Smo , Ptch1 , Ptch2 , Gli1 , Gli2 ) , analyzed tumor sample . - Changes Smo relate pathway biomarkers ( least Gli1 ) skin blood correlative sample . - Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis result correlate PK finding , efficacy toxicity data . Demographics Baseline Characteristics : Standard descriptive statistic , mean , median , range proportion , use summarize patient sample estimate parameter interest . Ninety-five percent confidence interval provide estimate interest wherever possible . Safety Analyses : Adverse event data serious adverse event report frequency table ( overall intensity ) . The safety analysis perform population receive least one dose drug . Efficacy Analyses : Response analyze patient measurable disease receive least one dose drug . TTP evaluate patient receive least one dose drug . Study population : Patient hormonal receptor negative HER2 negative ABC .</brief_summary>
