	<brief_summary>Egypt high prevalence hepatitis C virus infection adult ( 20 % ) child ( 5.5 % ) . The major genotype ( 90 % ) type 4 . Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a -2b ribavirin use small number hepatitis C virus-infected child sustain virological response high genotype 2 3 genotype 1 4 . Genotype 4 described difficult-to-treat genotype . Several attempt modify treatment protocol try adult attempt achieve high rate sustain virological response . Shortening injection interval and/or treatment duration prolongation try variable outcome report . A novel Hansenula- derive pegylated interferon alpha 2a : 20 Kilo dalton ( Reiferon Retard ) use last 4 year Egyptian market . We aim investigate safety efficacy Reiferon retard plus ribavirin customized regimen hepatitis C virus-RNA seropositive Egyptian child . Forty six child chronic hepatitis C virus age 3-19 year select 3 hepatic tertiary center . Clinical laboratory evaluation undertaken . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) HCV-RNA do start treatment , 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 week treatment 6 month stoppage treatment . All patient assign receive weekly subcutaneous injection pegylated interferon alpha 2-a ( Reiferon Retard ) plus oral Ribavirin daily 12 week , case divide accord PCR result 2 group . Group I : Patients continue treatment weekly basis : group include patient negative PCR week 12 well positive PCR without change viremia . Group II : Patients continue treatment 5- day schedule : group include patient decrease viremia week 12 . Patients PCR-negative week 48 least one PCR-positive test therapy assign extended treatment course 6 month duration . The occurrence adverse effect assess treatment follow</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>hepatitis C virus major health problem , adult also pediatric age group . In Egypt , prevalent genotype difficult-to-treat genotype 4 . Attempts make improve treatment outcome . In current study aim investigate effect customize pegylated interferon-alpha-2a plus ribavirin child chronic hepatitis C virus . For , 46 child chronic hepatitis C virus recruit three tertiary Pediatric Hepatology center . All assign receive weekly subcutaneous pegylated interferon-alpha-2a plus daily ribavirin 12 week . At point , study population divide two arm . Arm 1 include become hepatitis C virus-RNA negative polymerase chain reaction show change viremia decrease le 1 log . This group continue treatment weekly base 48 week , even hepatitis C virus-RNA positive . Arm 2 ; include patient decrease viremia one log pre-treatment viremia level . For patient , injection interval shorten every 5-day completion period 48 week . Patients either group polymerase chain reaction-negative week 48 , least one polymerase chain reaction-positive test therapy , assign extended treatment course 72 week . So first customization , 1. prolongation treatment duration 48 week regardless response type 2 . Shortening injection interval patient every 5-day injection 3 . The third customization prolongation treatment extra 6 month , i.e . tp 72 week patient . The occurrence adverse effect , virological biochemical response assess treatment follow .</detailed_description>
