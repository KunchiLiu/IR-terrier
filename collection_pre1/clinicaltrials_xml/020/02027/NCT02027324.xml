	<brief_summary>There approximately 1.4 million cesarean delivery United States year , average 1250 elective cesarean delivery year Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) Boston , Massachusetts . Among cesarean delivery perform BWH , approximately 2 % patient diagnosed surgical site infection ( SSI ) . Because SSI associate significant morbidity increase cost care , numerous guideline exist guide preoperative administration prophylactic antibiotic . However , recommendation choice antiseptic solution prevention SSI . Among currently popular antisepsis preparation , chlorhexidine-alcohol ( CA ) know decrease SSI non-obstetric surgery . However , time require CA dry ( ~ 3 min ) minimize flammability risk disadvantageous set emergent cesarean delivery . Many institution use povidone-iodine , another antisepsis preparation require mandatory drying time . Our randomized study aim compare incidence SSI patient receive either CA PI elective cesarean delivery , hypothesize CA would associate low incidence SSI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct three year estimate sample size 4500 patient . Prior enrollment study subject , year divide 3-month block block assign one two study antiseptic solution — 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate 70 % isopropyl alcohol ( CA ) 10 % Povidone-Iodine ( PI ) — alternate manner . All patient undergo elective cesarean delivery block receive preoperative skin preparation , concordance guideline use . The block assignment alternate within year order reverse one year minimize eliminate seasonal variation skin infection rate . All patient receive routine history physical examination , blood test , pre-procedure bathing instruction , preoperative body hair clip desire primary obstetric provider . Age , body mass index ( BMI ) , gestational age , history smoking , previous abdominal surgery , number pregnancy , live birth document entry study . Eligible patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis weight-based cefazolin within 60 min skin incision . We collect data preoperative preparation surgical site ( clip vs. shave ) , type skin uterine incision , method fascia skin closure , duration procedure , use postoperative antibiotic , adverse reaction skin preparation . The primary endpoint study SSI diagnose within 30 day cesarean delivery . Our secondary outcome type SSI ( base Center Disease Control infection classification ) time diagnosis SSI . The Infectious Disease department BWH perform surveillance SSI/endometritis . This team blind choice anti-sepsis preparation study period . Briefly , surveillance include daily , weekly , monthly , quarterly review data . The infectious disease team perform daily review microbiology result positive wound blood culture , ass whether patient cesarean section within 30 day prior culture . On weekly basis , report obstetric patient readmitted within 30 day generate , patient select admit diagnosis consistent infection set history recent cesarean delivery . Each month , report patient generate ICD-9 discharge code cesarean section well ICD-9 code complication obstetrical surgical wound major puerperal infection . Post-cesarean delivery patient receive antibiotic least 2 day first postoperative day , receive antibiotic readmission also identify record . During every quarter , number elective cesarean delivery perform quantified , incidence specific sub-types SSI ( superficial , deep , organ space/endometritis ) document . In addition inpatient surveillance , electronic clinic record patient review , data record SSI diagnose treated outpatient basis . Documentation discharge six-week postpartum visit review ensure data fidelity , infection occur within 30 day cesarean delivery include final analysis . Active SSI treat accord prevail guideline .</detailed_description>
