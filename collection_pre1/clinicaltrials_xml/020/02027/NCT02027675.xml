	<brief_summary>In society exercise prescribe physician increase physical condition , improve dietary habit reduce cardiovascular risk , impact exercise , acute chronic , diet inflammation immunity unknown . Specific population different response towards acute chronic exercise . Moreover specific condition , like type meal ingest , interfere response . The true effect pre-competitive meal exercise immunity inflammatory response unknown . Acute physical inactivity period , commonly happen daily life , related work acute illness . New evidence point induces immediate metabolic endocrinological change , might also associate change immune response . Aims project : 1. ass effect precompetitive meal inflammatory , neuro-immune metabolic response exercise ; 2. ass effect sedentary behaviour inflammatory , neuro-immune metabolic response ; 3. ass difference change healthy , asthmatic obese subject</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two intervention perform assess research question aim : A ) Randomized cross-over , wash period 7 day , single-blinded trial two different pre-competitive meal follow exercise challenge ; inflammatory neuro-immune metabolic response assess challenge . Participants recruit advertisement four different group compare : obese-asthmatic ; asthmatic non-obese ; obese without asthma non-asthmatic non-obese . All patient allocate meal challenge high fat poor micronutrient meal follow Mediterranean meal vice-versa ; meal challenge order randomize participant blind intervention . The main outcome intervention airway inflammation lung function . All outcome assess 3h meal . A group individual , three hour meal , perform exercise challenge , aim induce acute immune change . B ) Randomized control trial participant , run-in period eligibility evaluation , allocate intervention consist reduction physical activity 50 % maintain habitual physical activity two week ; inflammatory neuro-immune metabolic response assess intervention .</detailed_description>
