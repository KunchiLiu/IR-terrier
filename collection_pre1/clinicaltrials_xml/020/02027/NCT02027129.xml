	<brief_summary>Recent data large trial high-frequency high frequency oscillation ( HFO ) without cuff leak v , lung-protective conventional ventialtion ( CMV ) fail show HFO-related benefit respect outcome . A possible explanation HFO increase probability right ventricular dysfunction due combination high mean airway pressure ( mPaws ) hypercapnia . In contrast , available preliminary data low-frequency HFO-tracheal gas insufflation ( TGI ) cuff leak vs. CMV suggestive HFO-TGI related benefit . Low-frequency HFO-TGI cuff leak associate relatively low mean tracheal pressure adequate control PaCO2 . Thus , investigator intend test hypothesis low frequency HFO +/- TGI cuff leak associate well right ventricular function relative high-frequency HFO without cuff leak .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale study Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) acute inflammatory state pulmonary parenchyma cause hypoxemia , atelectasis , pulmonary congestion , reduction pulmonary compliance . Mechanical ventilation actually life-saving , may traumatize lung ( e.g . volutrauma , barotrauma , atelectrauma , biotrauma ) . The use low tidal volume high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , aim attenuate ventilator-associated lung injury . However , ARDS mortality still remain high . High frequency oscillation ( HFO ) alternative ventilatory technique employ low tidal volume ( 1-4 ml/kg ) administer high frequency ( 3-15 Hz ) . Prior observational study report improvement oxygenation , whereas recent two-center data severe ARDS suggest survival benefit intermittent , combine use low-frequency HFO cuff leak , Recruitment maneuver ( RMs ) , tracheal gas insufflation ( TGI ) . The addition TGI improve oxygenation CO2 elimination ; however , still unclear whether affect survival . Two recently publish multicenter study show either neutral ( 10 ) negative result ( 11 ) respect survival high frequency HFO without cuff leak use treatment early ARDS . However , negative result may partly due right ventricular overload/dysfunction/failure cause combination high intrathoracic pressure hypercapnia , consequent hemodynamic instability increase need inotropic/vasopressor support . Accordingly , investigator hypothesize different HFO strategy [ employ combination low frequency cuff leak - augments CO2 elimination associate relatively low mean tracheal pressure - could lead different result . A high intrathoracic pressure may impede venous return increase pulmonary vascular resistance . This concurrent right ventricular preload reduction afterload increase might cause right ventricular dysfunction/failure . On hand , placement cuff leak result low ( approx . 5-6 cmH2O ) mean tracheal pressure relative set HFO-ventilator mean airway pressure ( mPaw ) , consequent unload right ventricle . In addition , unload right ventricle expect combine use cuff leak , TGI , high HFO bias flow ; measure improve PaCO2 control may prevent excessive , hypercapnia-induced increase pulmonary vascular resistance . Right ventricular function assess transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) previously describe . Right ventricular dysfunction associate dilatation may cause cardiac output reduction coronary hypoperfusion ; latter may compromise right ventricular performance contribute right ventricular failure . The main goal present study document compare effect lung protective conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV ) different HFO strategy ( already clinically test trial conflict result ) 1 ) right ventricular performance 2 ) coronary blood flow determine TEE . More specifically , intend compare high-PEEP , lung protective CMV `` high '' mPaw/no cuff leak , high-frequency HFO strategy , `` high '' mPaw cuff leak , `` low '' frequency HFO strategy without TGI . Methods METHODS Eligible patient ( relevant criterion provide ) early severe ARDS enrol obtainment inform , write , next-of-kin consent . Patient monitoring include electrocardiographic lead II , intra-arterial pressure ( +/- cardiac index PICCO plus , Pulsion Medical Systems , Munich , Germany ) ] , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) . Anesthesia maintain midazolam and/or propofol , fentanyl remifentanil . Nrutomuscular blockade accomplish cisatracurium , use concordance current recommendation part attend physician-prescribed medical treatment . During study period , patient receive continuous infusion cisatracurium . CMV strategy Eligible study participant receive least 60 min lung protective CMV follow combination FiO2/PEEP : 0.5/10-12 cm H2O , 0.6/14-16 cm H2O , 0.7/14-16 cm H2O , 0.8/14-16 cm H2O , 0.9/16-18 cm H2O , 1.0/20-24 cmH2O . A high-PEEP-associated survival benefit recently document . Whenever oxygenation deteriorate , PEEP increase first , follow increase FiO2 accord aforementioned FiO2/PEEP combination . Tidal volume within 5.5-7.5 mL/Kg predict body weight . The maximal plateau pressure limit 40 cmH2O , target plateau pressure ≤32 cmH2O ; rationale : study Meade et al , high plateau pressure tolerate allow use high PEEP level . When plateau pressure exceed 32 cmH2O &gt; 15 min , follow adjustment conduct : tidal volume reduction 4.0 mL/kg predict body weight , respiratory rate increase 35/min , PEEP reduction ≥2 cmH2O . These adjustment concurrently result achievement below-provided gas-exchange target . The respiratory rate titrate pHa 7.20-7.45 . The inspiratory-to-expiratory time ( Ι : Ε ) ratio ≤1/2 . The oxygenation target SaO2=90-95 % , and/or PaO2=60-80 mmHg . At pHa &lt; 7.20 , breathe circuit deadspace minimize replace routinely use catheter mount short , low-volume angular connector , tidal volume increase 8.0 mL/kg predict body weight , respiratory rate increase 35/min . If measure fail , criterion `` poor control pHa/PaCO2 , '' use bicarbonate infusion permit . An additional option extracorporeal CO2 removal . Algorithm RMs PEEP/FiO2 1 . RM - Continuous positive airway pressure 40-45 cmH2O 40 sec , FiO2 1.0 ) titration PEEP FiO2 SaO2=90-95 % , PaO2=60-80 mmHg ( RMs may repeat twice daily , every 5 hour ) 2 .

The RMs repeat prior change HFO frequency prior to/just initiation/termination TGI . 4 . FiO2 initially set 1.0 . 5 . Bias flow set 60 L/min improve CO2 clearance breathe circuit . 6 . I : E ratio maintain 1:2 . 7 . According method result precede study investigator , TGI equal 50 % precede CMV minute ventilation . 8 . The initial HFO mPaw exceed mPaw precede CΜV 8-10 cm H2O titrate ( ±3 cmH2O ) best oxygenation response 60-min period standard , low frequency HFO cuff leak . The aforementioned period precede below-described 180-min period HFO strategy test . 9 . Initial oscillation frequency randomly set either 3.5-4 Hz 7 Hz . The low frequency set combine 3-5 cmH2O cuff leak TGI 60 min follow `` no-TGI '' another 60 min random order . The high frequency set combine either cuff leak TGI maintain additional 60 min . Oscillatory pressure amplitude ( ΔP ) set 90 cmH2O . TEE measurements The following parameter determine baseline CMV : Right ventricular diastolic area , leave ventricular diastolic area , Eccentricity Index .

The measurement repeat 120 , 180 , 240 min HFO initiation , 60 min follow return CMV . At time point , determine gas exchange , hemodynamics include cardiac output PICCO plus . Lastly , respiratory mechanic assess rapid end-expiratory/end-inspiratory airway occlusion CMV . Rescue oxygenation Rescue oxygenation methodology may include low-frequency HFO-TGI cuff leak , prone positioning , inhale nitric oxide , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . The duration rescue oxygenation session least 10 hour allowance unlimited extension PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg . Rescue initiation criterion : PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg 30 min FiO2=1.0 high-PEEP , lung protective CMV , absence reversible cardio-respiratory pathology and/or ventilator malfunction . Patient follow Physiological variable ( hemodynamics gas-exchange , respiratory mechanic ) medication record within 2 hour study enrollment 9 a.m. day 1-10 follow study enrollment . Organ dysfunction accord Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment score clinical course complication document day 60 post-enrollment . Lastly , final outcome ( i.e . survival hospital discharge in-hospital death ) also record . POTENTIAL RISKS OF INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR PREVENTION . Potential risk : Barotrauma . Preventive measure : This potential risk equally high CMV HFO . We also anticipate notable clinical complication due use high-frequency , high mPaw HFO without cuff leak , duration use exceed protocol-pre-specified time limit 60 min . POSSIBLE BENEFITS For participate patient : possible increase probability survival hospital discharge HFO-TGI use rescue oxygenation method detailed TEE evaluation cardiac function .
