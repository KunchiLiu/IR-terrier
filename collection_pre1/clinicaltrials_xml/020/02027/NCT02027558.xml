	<brief_title>Novel Treatment Comorbid Insomnia Sleep Apnea Older Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance common old adult associate increase healthcare utilization , depressive symptom , adverse effect health-related quality life . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) disorder characterize repetitive episode complete partial upper airway obstruction occur sleep . OSA increase prevalence age , associate increase risk cardiovascular disease , decrease quality life , increased mortality . Insomnia also increase prevalence age , associate numerous adverse outcome , include cognitive decline , decrease quality life , increase healthcare cost increase mortality . The diagnostic criterion insomnia include decreased ability fall asleep stay asleep , frequent nighttime awaken poor quality sleep associate daytime impairment fatigue , impaired attention , daytime sleepiness . Increasing evidence suggest insomnia often coexist OSA , particularly old adult , predicts bad outcome OSA . Both OSA insomnia high prevalence among Veterans , compare general population . Little known best approach manage large number patient coexist OSA comorbid insomnia . Guidelines best practice typically address condition separately , positive airway pressure ( PAP ) standard treatment OSA , cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBT-I ) consider first-line treatment chronic insomnia . CBT-I particularly recommend insomnia older adult , adverse effect sleep medication problematic . Early adherence PAP therapy ( i.e. , within first week PAP therapy ) one strong predictor long-term PAP adherence . However , adherence rate PAP therapy patient OSA low . In addition , CBT-I widely implement treatment insomnia ( part due limit access mental health specialist able provide CBT-I ) , untreated OSA limit response treatment insomnia , untreated insomnia negatively impact PAP adherence . Based evidence finding investigator ' prior work , investigator believe integrate , behavioral treatment approach address OSA insomnia early course PAP therapy need maximize patient adherence treatment success condition coexist . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial test novel , behavioral approach integrate best practice management condition among old Veterans OSA prescribe PAP therapy comorbid insomnia . The purpose project determine whether intervention improves nighttime sleep , PAP adherence , mood health-related quality life .</detailed_description>
