	<brief_summary>Hypothesis I : The anatomic alignment pelvic bone , electromuscular activation limb muscle ground reaction force different patient sacroiliac joint pain , compare healthy control . Hypothesis II : The application pelvic belt alters alignment pelvic bone , electromuscular activation limb muscle ground reaction force . Hypothesis III : The effect propose hypothesis II different patient sacroiliac joint pain , compare healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Belt Effects Osseous Anatomy , Muscule Activation Ground Reaction Forces</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sacroiliac joint among frequently involve anatomical structure low back pain . Pelvic belt anatomy make sacroiliac joint vulnerable involve chronic painful condition . However , anatomical functional correlate sacroiliac joint pain yet undetermined . According guideline International Association Study Pain ( IASP ) , painful condition primarily manage conservatively . However , exist study fail provide sound evidence effect conservative device therapy sacroiliac joint pain . In study , total 17 patient suffer sacroiliac joint pain 17 control investigated mean magnetic resonance imaging , EMG , health survey grind reaction force measurement . A pelvic compression belt administer two level compression correspond magnetic resonance imaging , EMG ground reaction force data measure .</detailed_description>
