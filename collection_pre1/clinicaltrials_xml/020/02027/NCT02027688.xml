The secondary objective test whether every 6 hour feeding allow improve medical stability oral-motor coordination compare commonly use q3 hour schedule . Each infant randomly assign q6 hour q3 hour oral feeding schedule . Data oral feeding progression , respiratory status oral motor proficiency collect compare . The study collect data long take infant get full oral feed , respiratory status throughout time oral feeding , whether episode medical complication , measure oral motor feed skill , time discharge hospital . This study crucial first step towards determine feed schedule optimal preterm infant ensure timely attainment full oral feed hospital discharge without compromise medical stability .</detailed_description>
