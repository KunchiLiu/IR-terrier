	<brief_summary>Bangladesh remain endemic cholera , experience biannual outbreak additional epidemic see time flood , cyclone natural disaster . It affect age group majority fatal case occur child . Therefore , immunization cholera remain important public health component prevention control disease .The current two-dose regimen internationally available oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ) create logistical programmatic challenge use national program epidemic , important determine single dose vaccine protective region cholera endemic . If vaccine find efficacious follow single dose , profound implication use vaccine area limited resource particularly complex emergency multiple dose regimen difficult deploy . A single-dose regimen vaccine improve 'field ability ' allow vaccine use outbreak control , especially difficult setting risk cholera extremely high provision clean water sanitation available . With low OCV production rate , large population could immunize cholera single dose find efficacious . A single-dose schedule could facilitate inclusion global stockpile strategy . The study design two-arm individually randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial .

	<detailed_description>Background : Cholera serious public health problem worldwide . Recently , unprecedented outbreak see many country include Zimbabwe , Haiti , Pakistan , Nepal , Guinea , Cuba , Congo , Sierra Leone . These cholera outbreak cause undue suffer high mortality morbidity figure well economic social disruption . Bangladesh remain endemic cholera , peak biannually increase see flood cyclone .It affect age group , although majority fatal case occur child . Therefore , immunization cholera remain important public health tool prevent control disease . Considerable progress make last decade development new generation oral vaccine cholera . Dukoral , kill whole cell V. cholerae O1 recombinant B-subunit ( rBS-WC ) , first license internationally available mostly developed country traveller 's vaccine . This vaccine license 50 country , include Bangladesh . The WHO recommend Dukoral endemic epidemic cholera . However , two disadvantage limit broad use Dukoral . First , current price high . Second , Dukoral need administer buffer , complicate large scale deployment . The Shanchol vaccine license India vaccine prequalified WHO 2011.The technology vaccine manufacturing transfer Shantha Biotechnics India ( own Sanofi ) IVI . A large double-blind placebo control phase III trial NICED IVI evaluate efficacy vaccine produce Shantha prevent diarrhea cholera 70,000 people Kolkata . An analysis phase III trial three year conclude vaccine 66 % efficacious . Advantages Shanchol™ vaccine include cost low require administration buffer , thus make feasible use mass vaccination program resource poor setting . The current multi-dose schedule Dukoral Shanchol™ restrict application oral cholera vaccine situation need . Getting vaccine people twice pose difficulty control cholera endemic epidemic setting . In study perform cholera-endemic area Kolkata , India find Shanchol™ induces significant vibriocidal response even single dose .This study design determine protective efficacy duration protection offer single dose regimen intend replace recommended 2 dose regimen endemic area . This useful epidemic outbreaks situation . Study population : Mirpur select study . Mirpur part Dhaka metropolitan area estimate population 2.5 million people . Different socio-economic group community live area . The icddr , b hospital treat patient Mirpur part Dhaka . We select 9 ward Mirpur ( 7-13 , 15 41 ) study 16 ward . The selection base high number cholera patient ward visit icddr , b hospital last year . Before start study commission census high cholera incidence ward Mirpur . The census team create geographic information system ( GIS ) database digitize building structure target ward use satellite derive image . The digitized building structure verify ground verification . The census team visit build ascertain whether people live building . Based survey , team ass whether people live building/structure high risk group . The census team collect verbal consent respondent information household . We conduct de jure census enumerate 324,178 high risk resident target ward . Census study population : A paperless data collection system use census survey subsequent census update also perform biannually use handheld device , Samsung tab ( `` TAB '' ) . The demographic surveillance conduct community health worker update population vital demographic event include birth , death , internal external migration . Name description study agent : 1 . Bivalent oral kill cholera vaccine : dose vaccine contain V. cholerae O1 Inaba El Tor strain Phil 6973 formalin kill 600 ELISA unit ( EU ) Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) V. cholerae O1 Ogawa classical strain Cairo 50 heat kill 300 EU LPS V. cholerae O1 Ogawa classical strain Cairo 50 formalin kill 300 EU LPS V. cholerae O1 Inaba classical strain Cairo 48 heat kill 300 EU LPS V. cholerae O139 strain 4260B formalin kill 600 EU LPS 2 . Non Biological placebo : The composition placebo follow : Ingredients Per 1.5 ml dose Starch : 60mg Ponceau 4R dye : 0.019 mg Brilliant blue : 0.003mg Tetrazine dye : 0.02 mg Xanthum gum : 3 mg Preservative : 0.002 % ( w/v ) Thiomersal ( equivalent .03 mg per 1.5 ml ) Water : Up 1.5 ml Administration vaccine placebo : The agent receive participant determine randomization number vial . Vials consecutively number , individually randomize vaccine placebo arm . After shake vial properly , open give participant . The content pour mouth recipient , follow intake small volume water . Census update : The census study population update every six month intervention study agent . Disease Surveillance : All patient study area present care hospital diarrhea include routine hospital surveillance.The diarrheal disease surveillance project conduct icddr , b hospital Mohakhali Mirpur health facility patient come Mirpur study area ( ward 7-13 , 15 41 ) . Clinical staff two hospital facility evaluate patient hospital triage area provide treatment per routine procedure . Immunological assay use blood specimen study participant : Blood : Immunological analysis conduct small subgroup ( 334 participant ) participant .To account unblocked unique number coding , plan enrol 500 participant ( less 5 year , 5 less 15 year 15 year age old ; obtain least 108 age group ) vaccination site . Venous blood ( 2-5 ml ) collect participant prior immunization 14 day intake study agent . Active follow safety : We select 6,000 participant purposively study participant verbal consent obtain . These 6,000 participant actively follow every two week safety outcomes 28 day period study agent administration . Primary Analysis 6 month follow-up : Primary analysis plan 6 month follow dosing . Analysis 6 , 12 , 18 24 month follow-up : Primary analysis perform 6 month . The follow available time point ( 12 , 18 and/or 24 month secondary analysis point . Surveillance 24 month Surveillance continue complete 2 year follow-up . Blinding maintain end follow-up period . The analysis 2 year follow-up point still perform blinded manner . Verbal Autopsy : We carry 'Verbal Autopsy ' study area death identify household search home visit conduct study staff . We use two questionnaire verbal autopsy , one child age 1 year 14 year person age 15 year . After identification , train medical professional visit home decease perform verbal autopsy . Pregnancy Outcome Study : Pregnancy status marry woman ascertain least two month vaccination home visit train field staff . Those confirmed pregnancy time point follow 6 month well visit monthly ascertain pregnancy outcome delivery . A pregnancy follow questionnaire use consent take visit</detailed_description>
