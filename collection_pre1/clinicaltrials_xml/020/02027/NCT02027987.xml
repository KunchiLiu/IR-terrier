	<brief_summary>1 . Background : Preliminary study suggest valproate acid ( VPA ) may promote neuron survival , inhibit apoptosis , decrease neuron function deficit cerebral ischemia , promote brain functional recovery traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Besides , guide prevention treatment epilepsy 2007 , VPA one antiepileptic drug suggest prevent early epilepsy TBI ( less 7 day ) . 2 . Objectives : Our main objective evaluate whether VPA could protect brain improve recovery brain function severe TBI . The secondary objective explore whether VPA could prevent late epilepsy severe TBI ( 7 day ) . 3 . Methods : We would enroll 160 patient vegetative minimally conscious state 4 16 week TBI receive inpatient rehabilitation . Patients randomly assign receive VPA placebo 4 week follow 2 week treatment discontinue . The rate functional recovery Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ; range , 0 29 , high score indicate great disability ) compare 4 week treatment ( primary outcome ) 2-week washout period use mixed-effects regression model .</brief_summary>
