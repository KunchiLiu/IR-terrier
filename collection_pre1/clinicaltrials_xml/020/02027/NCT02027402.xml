	<detailed_description>Drain widely use many abdominal surgery therapeutic purpose removal infected debris abscess , support heal leakage fistula . Although usability therapeutic drain commonly accept , efficacy prophylactic drain still debate . Most surgeon insert prophylactic drain expectation drain would helpful early detection postoperative bleeding leakage , also prevention intra-abdominal abscess remove debris curd . However , evidence-based study actual effectiveness prophylactic drain objection routine use drain raise . Most surgeon place drain cholecystectomy expectation could help detect postoperative bleeding bile leakage prevent intra-abdominal infection . However , lack evidence regard role drain laparoscopic cholecystectomy acutely inflamed gallbladder surgeon place drain base experience belief , evidence-based guideline . In previous retrospective study , [ 4 ] describe routine drain use laparoscopic cholecystectomy acutely inflamed gallbladder advantage detect bile leak bleed helpful prevent postoperative morbidity intra-abdominal abscess wound infection . The aim present multicenter trial ass value routine drain use laparoscopic cholecystectomy acutely inflame gallbladder large , randomize control prospective study .</detailed_description>
