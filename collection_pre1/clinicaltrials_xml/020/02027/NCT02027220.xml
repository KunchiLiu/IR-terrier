	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth myeloma cell block proteasome activity . Cyclophosphamide dexamethasone may work different way stop growth myeloma cell stop divide kill cell . Granulocyte Clone Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) possess ability mobilize plasma cell detach myeloma niche , promote drug sensitivity . PURPOSE : This phase Ⅱ trial study well combination G-CSF , bortezomib , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone work treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination G-CSF , Bortezomib , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myeloma cell reside specialised microenvironments , call myeloma niche . Myeloma niche provide important cell-cell interaction signal molecule regulate localization proliferation myeloma cell . stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) /Chemokine ( C-X-C Motif ) Receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) play important role process . G-CSF report induce stem cell mobilization decrease bone marrow SDF-1 . Our vitro study find G-CSF enhance bortezomib activity inhibit SDF-1/CXCR4 . Myeloma patient treat Bortezomib , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone achieve relatively good response , ORR 80 % complete remission 40 % . We hypothesize G-CSF may mobilize myeloma cell myeloma niche thus enhance bortezomib activity .</detailed_description>
