	<detailed_description>Biomarkers investigate predictor HIV disease progression , i.e . development acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) deﬁning diagnosis death . There limited data level biomarkers among HIV-infected individual sub Saharan Africa effect antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) initiation level . In addition , work need examine association marker various complication associate HIV well mortality sub Saharan Africa . The overall aim study develop cohort HIV-infected adult initiate ART health facility Kenya establish sample bank plasma urine sample order understanding level inﬂammatory biomarkers ( IBM ) coagulation biomarkers ( CBM ) African patient effect ART initiation biomarkers . The study objectives follow : - To recruit , establish follow cohort HIV-infected individual eligible initiation ART 12 month - To obtain blood urine sample cohort participant baseline , month 2 , 6 , 12 future HIV relate research - To describe demographic disease characteristic cohort participant association various biomarkers</detailed_description>
