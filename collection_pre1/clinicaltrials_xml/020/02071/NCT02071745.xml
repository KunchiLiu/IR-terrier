	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement one commonly perform orthopedic procedure . As 2010 , 600,000 total knee replacement perform annually United States number rise . The normal knee joint function complex hinge allow primarily ﬂexion extension , rotation gliding . The knee joint make three compartment , lateral , medial anterior ( patellofemoral ) . Damage cartilage one compartment may result osteoarthritis ( idiopathic post-traumatic ) , inﬂammatory arthritis ( rheumatoid , psoriatic , etc . ) , a-vascular necrosis , tumor , congenital deformity . Osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis cause overwhelm majority total joint arthroplasty . A successful Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery include : accurate alignment ( mechanical axis axial rotational plane ) , well significant pain relief improve function quality life . Incorrect alignment lead abnormal wear , premature mechanical loosening component patellofemoral problem . The common technique Total knee replacement : 1 . Conventional method TKR 2 . CT/MRI-based preoperative navigate TKR 3 . Image-free intraoperative navigate TKR In research focus 3rd method use Orthopilot navigation system Aesculap® , Tutlingen , Germany . This system active PC base guide system help surgeon decide accurate alignment orientation implant cut surface bone thus avoid incorrect alignment . We aim compare pre-operative post-operative low limb alignment ( mechanical axis ) Aesculap base TKA use serview CT . Furthermore , try examine existence correlation CT scan Orthopilot navigation system output assess clinical outcome patient postoperatively . Our Hypothesis intra-operative navigation system accurate correlate CT image result , moreover , allow surgeon achieve good mechanical axis high clinical outcome ,</brief_summary>
