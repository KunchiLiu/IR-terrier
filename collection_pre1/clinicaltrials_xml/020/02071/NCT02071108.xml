	<brief_title>Safety Performance Study Shockwave Lithoplasty System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shockwave Medical , Inc. intend conduct prospective , single-arm , multi-center , clinical study design evaluate safety performance Shockwave Lithoplasty System subject moderate heavily calcified peripheral artery 3.50mm 7.0mm reference vessel diameter target site . The Shockwave Lithoplasty System indicate generate sonic shockwave energy within target treatment site disrupt calcium within lesion allow subsequent dilation peripheral artery stenosis use low balloon pressure . Up thirty-five ( 35 ) subject enrol treat Lithoplasty yield thirty ( 30 ) evaluable subject complete study assume 15 % lose follow-up rate .</detailed_description>
