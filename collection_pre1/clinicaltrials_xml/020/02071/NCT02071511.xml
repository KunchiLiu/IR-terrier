	<brief_title>Renal Denervation In Patient Undergoing VT Ablation : Combined Renal Denervation VT Ablation v . Simply VT Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study protocol : Catheter ablation ventricular tachycardia versus combine catheter ablation ventricular tachycardia renal denervation . A total 50 patient ventricular tachycardia treat ICD shock ATP enrol study . The randomization study do ablation . For ablation , arterial access require group . During 30 minute wait time apply group , renal denervation perform . In period time operator staff blind procedure , thereby wo n't know patient receive renal denervation , way investigator avoid bias future treatment patient . Follow repeat procedure : All Patients follow period 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 18 month procedure . Regular visit do investigator office . The visit include ICD Interrogation , VT documentation ICD Holter , 24-hour Holter ECG Tele-ECGs , echocardiography . Re- VT ablation allow time . In case renal artery stenosis , denervation perform . Drug therapy continue .</detailed_description>
