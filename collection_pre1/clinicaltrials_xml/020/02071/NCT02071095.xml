	<brief_summary>This study involve research new approach treat HIV infection . Currently , HIV infection treat combination drug call antiretrovirals . These drug protect cell infection interfere virus ' ability make copy infect new target cell . Though drug effective , cure HIV infection must take every day prescribe dos maintain beneficial effect . This research study investigate new approach involve addition exist medication . The study investigate medication call Poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol® , Oncovir ) , adjuvant . Adjuvants medication design boost body 's immune response result vaccine . The investigator want test whether Poly-ICLC adjuvant effective HIV-infected patient . A vaccine give study , investigate adjuvant , Poly-ICLC , determine whether may safe useful future vaccine could use treat HIV , call therapeutic vaccine . One goal future therapeutic vaccine reduce virus remain persistently inside cell dormant rest state despite treatment HIV medication . This persistent pool term `` latent virus pool '' `` viral reservoir '' . One tactic reduce viral reservoir first stimulate HIV start replicate order force hiding . Once viral replication occur , infected cell may recognize kill cell immune system . Therefore , also want see effect Poly-ICLC virus life inside cell . Specifically , investigator want look whether Poly-ICLC increase level virus inside cell also improve immune system 's response . The investigator research hope find new way treat HIV infection may reduce exposure medication call antiretrovirals . Antiretrovirals medication use treat HIV infection . They effective side effect take every day cure HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement Poly-ICLC During HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) dramatically alter morbidity mortality associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) infection . Nevertheless , current treatment paradigm lifelong antiviral therapy near perfect patient adherence avoid emergence drug resistant HIV remain less ideal therapeutic approach clear limitation . In addition long term toxicity associate currently prefer therapy , combination therapy HIV-1 infection address issue viral persistence . HIV-1 persists blood tissue despite long-term suppression antiretroviral agent ( ARVs ) . Eradication strategies HIV-1 likely require multi-faceted approach reduce latent reservoir , key component focus upon disruption viral latency enhancement cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) function promote kill infected cell . In order successfully achieve objective , agent safely stimulate replication latent reservoir AND explore approach enhance HIV-specific adaptive immunity augment CTL function must investigate . The investigator propose may accomplish single therapeutic modality devise appropriately . Certain adjuvant may possess immunostimulatory property trigger transient activation viral transcription simultaneously enhance HIV-specific CTL function , thus , may play important role vaccine . Here , investigator propose proof concept clinical trial determine ability Poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol® , Oncovir ) , safely activate latent viral reservoir enhance innate immunity administer HIV-infected individual . This randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study administer two dose Poly-ICLC HIV-infected individual virologically suppress combination anti-retroviral therapy ( cART ) . The investigator hypothesize Poly-ICLC safe well-tolerated transiently disrupt viral latency enhance innate immune response . Should case , Poly-ICLC would ideal modality combine therapeutic HIV vaccine reduce number latently infect CD4+ T cell treat HIV-1 infected individual .</detailed_description>
