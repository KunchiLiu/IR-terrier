	<brief_title>Comparing Nautilus NeuroWaveTM TCD DSA Detection Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , comparative , non-randomized study subject subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing surveillance vasospasm . The study conduct one center . The primary objective Phase I non-significant risk study proof principle . During phase goal build library Jan Medical NNW system recording patient moderate severe vasospasms . A signature detect vasospasms develop use signal vasospasm epoch patient 's individual baseline record confirm presence vasospasm comparison Jan Medical NNW system data TCD , available Digital Subtraction Angiography ( DSA ) . The number patient required Phase I estimate 20 patient confirm moderate severe vasospasm minimum 10 patient least one severe vasospasm record confirm TCD DSA . Daily record take . During Phase II Jan Medical NNW system independently utilize signature identify Phase I identify presence absence moderate severe vasospasm blind recording . This recording compare TCD DSA , DSA available , analysis sensitivity specificity . Up 50 subject enrol Phase II . When possible , multiple recording obtain subject include recording without vasospasm . Duration subject 's enrollment study limit period time Jan Medical NNW system recording perform . No additional test procedure perform participation study data collect ( include TCD DSA ) base available evaluation conduct part patient 's standard care . Upon complete last Jan Medical NNW system record data collection expect , subject exit study .</detailed_description>
