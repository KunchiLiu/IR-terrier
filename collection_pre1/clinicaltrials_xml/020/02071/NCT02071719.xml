	<brief_summary>The rapid development agent block kinase establish use molecularly target therapy preferred treatment approach patient metastatic renal cell cancer ( RCC ) . Five kinase inhibitor ( sunitinib , everolimus , temsirolimus , sorafenib pazopanib ) approve clinical use . Response rate differ among agent , importantly depend line treatment . In first-line treatment sunitinib result 47 % objective response rate , second-line cytokine 34 % responds . Thus far , unclear patient advance renal cell cancer respond target therapy . In order select patient targeted therapy , several profile approach explore date adequate reliable test available . It assume response target agent depend specific receptor protein signal activity tumor tissue . Therefore , propose protein phosphorylation profile phosphoproteomics may potential clinical diagnostic tool predict tumor response target therapy .</brief_summary>
