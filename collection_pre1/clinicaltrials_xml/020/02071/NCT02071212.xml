	<detailed_description>This singe-center , randomize , assessor-blinded , active control , parallel-group trial consist 'acute ' 'chronic ' period , aim compare ticagrelor versus clopidogrel reduction arterial stiffness wave reflection patient CAD . This Investigator-Sponsored Study ( ISS ) support AstraZeneca . 60 subject fulfil study-specific eligibility criterion initially recruit 'acute ' study period 24-hour duration . Subjects undergo ad hoc PCI continue subsequent 'chronic ' study period 30-day duration . In order 60 subject 'chronic ' study period ( since 'acute ' period undergo PCI ) , additional subject schedule elective PCI recruit sample size 'chronic ' study period reach 60 subject . The study period [ Figure 1 , Flow Chart ] follow : For 24-hour ACUTE period , 60 subject indication elective CA without PCI include study . Three ( 3 ) hour CA subject randomize two study treatment arm : Ticagrelor arm : 30 subject receive - 180 mg load dose ticagrelor , - 1st maintenance ticagrelor dose 90 mg 12 hour . Clopidogrel arm : 30 subject receive - 600 mg load dose clopidogrel . Study measurement ( arterial stiffness , central blood pressure endothelial function ) study treatment arm perform : - baseline ( 0 hour - prior load dose administration ) - 3 hour ( load dose regimen CA ) , - 24 hour ( administration 2nd maintenance dose ticagrelor 1st maintenance dose clopidogrel ) . For 30-day CHRONIC period , 60 subject undergo PCI ( stent implantation ) study . Part 'chronic ' period population consist subject include 'acute ' period proceed ad hoc PCI . The remainder subject schedule elective PCI , enrol completion recruitment 'acute ' study period . Approximately 30 subject allocate ticagrelor load dose maintenance dose ( 90 mg BID ) thereafter approximately 30 subject allocate 600 mg clopidogrel maintenance dose ( 75 mg QD ) thereafter . Study measurement subject 'acute ' period enter 'chronic ' period perform : - 30 day post-PCI ( prior administration morning maintenance dose assign treatment regimen day study visit ) . Study measurement additional subject indication elective PCI enrol directly chronic study period perform : - baseline ( 0 hour - prior administration load dose treatment regimen 3 hour PCI ) - 30 day post PCI ( prior administration morning maintenance dose assign treatment regimen day study visit ) . All study-related procedure carry accordance institutional guideline common practice .</detailed_description>
