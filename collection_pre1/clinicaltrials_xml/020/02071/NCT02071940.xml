	<brief_summary>KIT ( receptor tyrosine kinase ) mutation occur 15 % acral mucosal melanoma . PIANO single arm , phase II , open-label , multicentre study evaluate efficacy safety ( plus molecular basis effect ) KIT inhibitor PLX3397 ( develop Plexxikon ) advance KIT mutate acral mucosal melanoma . In trial total 24 patient ( 9 first stage 15 second stage ) receive treatment 24 month recruitment period . Following consent successful screening , patient receive PLX3397 capsule 1000mg/day monotherapy , remain therapy long derive clinical benefit . Patients see every 4 week treatment monitor response toxicity . Routine blood test carry visit pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics sample ( 1 x 8 milliliter ( ml ) whole blood sample ) do pre-dose Day 1 Day 15 , frozen store locally send Plexxikon 's vendor central analysis end study . Imaging carry every 12 week monitor response . The first 9 patient also receive two [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET scan ( baseline Day 15 ) . From specific name participating site , 12 patient provide additional ( optional ) consent take part translational research . 5 patient fresh tumour biopsy take baseline , day 15 upon disease progression . The 5 patient plus additional 7 patient ( give total 12 patient ) also donate blood sample baseline , 2 week , 12 week disease progression evaluation circulate tumour cell circulate free tumour DNA . All patient follow every 6 month death 12 month last patient discontinue study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PIANO trial open-label , single-arm , multicentre phase II trial PLX3397 advance acral mucosal melanoma . All eligible patient receive PLX3397 1000mg/day monotherapy remain treatment long deriving benefit ( treat Investigator 's discretion ) . The primary objective study assess efficacy PLX3397 review number patient progression-free 6 month . Additional objective include assess safety PLX3397 , overall survival ( sub-set patient ) biomarker research . A maximum 24 eligible patient may treat study . In order recruit 24 patient , expect total approximately 240 patient need consent screened KIT mutation , KIT mutant patient eligible ( estimate 10-15 % patient population ) . An interim analysis Independent Data Monitoring Committee do 9 patient recruit less 2 9 patient demonstrated progression free survival 6 month trial terminate . As KIT mutant patient eligible inclusion , first step follow consent patient ' KIT mutation status test . Only patient KIT mutation eligible . Wherever possible , archival tissue sample take time diagnosis request suitable sample available follow test result obtain additional fresh tumour sample would collect via biopsy . The tissue sample send specialist laboratory KIT test result test take 1-2 week . If patient find KIT mutation associate PLX3397 resistance , return clinic complete follow study parameter investigation upto 4 week prior start treatment except examination mark ( * ) ; - Demographic detail - Medical surgical history include discussion current medication - Tumour evaluation accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria v1.1 use CT MRI scan thorax , abdomen pelvis within 28 day schedule start treatment - Vital sign standard physical examination ( include blood pressure , pulse , temperature , height weight ) * - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status* - Laboratory investigation : full blood count , biochemistry ( Urea &amp; Electrolytes , creatinine , calcium , albumin , liver function test , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , glucose , phosphate ) clot screen* - Women childbearing potential urine serum pregnancy test ( within 72 hour study entry ) - Electrocardiograph ( ECG ) * If patient undergoes protocol-specified screening procedure part Standard Care procedure occur within 4 week data may use screening purpose test would need repeat . If screening visit confirm patient still eligible take part study , would return clinic `` baseline visit '' follow procedure would occur : - Physical examination ( include blood pressure weight ) - Urine serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential - Electrocardiograph ( ECG ) - ECOG Performance status - Laboratory investigation : full blood count , biochemistry ( U &amp; Es , creatinine , calcium , albumin , liver function test , LDH , glucose , phosphate ) clot screen - 1 x 8ml whole blood sample ( Pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics ( PK/PD ) analysis ) send Plexxikon 's vendor central analysis - Adverse event ( include treatment toxicity ) assessment ( see section 9.1 definition adverse event ) . - Review concurrent medication - PLX3397 prescription - PET scan ( first 9 patient ) - If baseline visit &lt; 7 day since screen investigation need repeat . The patient would return clinic day 15 , day 29 ( week 4 ) , week 8 every 4 week year 1 every 8 week thereafter ( discontinuation PLX3397 ) . All visit window +/- 3 day . The following procedure would do visit : - Physical examination ( include blood pressure weight ) . - Electrocardiograph ( ECG ) - ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) - Laboratory investigation : full blood count , biochemistry ( U &amp; Es , creatinine , calcium , albumin , liver function test , LDH , glucose , phosphate ) clot screen . - 1 x 8ml whole blood sample ( PK/PD analysis ) Day 15 ( send Plexxikon 's vendor central analysis ) - Adverse event ( include treatment toxicity ) assessments 30 day discontinuation PLX3397 . - Review concurrent medication . - Assessment compliance study medication . - CT MRI scan thorax , abdomen pelvis week 12 , week 26 every 12 week thereafter . - Urine serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential every visit ( except day 15 treatment ) . - PET scan 2 week therapy ( day 15 ±3 day ) - first 9 patient When patient discontinue PLX3397 enter follow-up phase study . Patients follow death 12 month last patient discontinue study treatment . Patients follow telephone call every 6 month assess current status subsequent therapy . Alternatively follow-up clinic especially case complaint may indicate late toxicity . Translational Research A subset patient name site ( The Christie National Health Service ( NHS ) Foundation Trust The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust ) also ask provide additional , optional consent take part translational research . 5 patient biopsy take 3 timepoints ( baseline , day 15 disease progression ) blood sample take 4 timepoints ( baseline , day 15 , week 12 disease progression ) . In addition , 7 patient give blood sample ( give total 12 patient give blood sample ) . Wherever possible translational blood sample take time standard trial blood sample confirm patient still eligible study inclusion .</detailed_description>
