	<brief_summary>The aim study learn pathophysiology acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) evaluate mechanism responsible action benefit ticagrelor . Ticagrelor oral reversible inhibitor P2Y12 receptor . Few information available action ticagrelor molecule involve thrombogenesis platelet activation ACS . The aim study evaluate mechanism ticagrelor action vivo . It observe patient myocardial infarction high blood level microparticles patient unstable angina stable angina . The investigator assume ticagrelor benefit represent reduction microparticle level , marker endothelial dysfunction patient cardiovascular disease , modification microRNAs pattern , fragment mRNA regulatory action various cellular process ( proliferation , differentiation , growth cellular death ) represent new biomarkers ACS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor oral , reversibly bind P2Y12 receptor inhibitor yield , dose-dependent fashion , great consistent inhibition platelet aggregation standard regimens clopidogrel patient stable atherosclerotic disease ACS . However , little information available regard complex effect thrombogenesis platelet activation acute coronary syndrome set . It widely demonstrate potential role MP several biologic process know take part pathophysiology coronary syndrome , inflammation , coagulation apoptosis . Recent study focus miRNAs ' regulatory activity several cellular process , proliferation , differentiation , development , cell death , role biomarkers ACS . The investigator suppose observed major efficacy ticagrelor related action MP microRNAs . Considering major clinical effectiveness show ticagrelor comparison clopidogrel , investigator hypothesize pronounced MP level reduction possible mechanism ticagrelor clinical benefit . Moreover , basis last evidence microRNA involvement ACS pathophysiology , investigator aim assess effect ticagrelor microRNA expression , order provide evidence pleiotropic action drug , could partially explain major efficacy reduction cardiovascular event ACS patient . In summary , principal hypothesis study : - Considering ticagrelor strong P2Y12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel , investigator suppose increase inhibition P2Y12 receptor ticagrelor could reduce circulate level platelet endothelial MP . - In consideration observe role microRNAs expression P2Y12 receptor , investigator speculate patient 's susceptibility P2Y12 receptor inhibitor could influence microRNAs level . Moreover , investigator suppose ticagrelor could influence microRNAs level , consider marker cardiovascular risk Aims study : - ass MP level variation Non ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( NSTE-ACS ) patient treat ticagrelor addition low high acetyl-salicylic acid ( ASA ) , comparison clopidogrel+ASA treatment , demonstrate major clinical efficacy ticagrelor could partially attribute influence release MP , important role coronary instability . - evaluate microRNAs level variation Non ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( NSTE-ACS ) patient treat ticagrelor addition low high ASA , comparison clopidogrel+ASA treatment , study possible correlation microRNAs MP level , suppose ability ticagrelor reduce MP level could relate microRNAs expression .</detailed_description>
