	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well eltrombopag olamine work improve recovery platelet count old patient acute myeloid leukemia undergo induction ( first treatment give disease ) chemotherapy . Platelet count recover slowly old patient , lead risk complication delay post-remission therapy . Eltrombopag olamine may cause body make platelet chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eltrombopag Olamine Improving Platelet Recovery Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I.To determine whether eltrombopag lead early platelet recovery old AML patient ( ≥ 60years ) attain morphologic remission day 14 ( range , day 14-17 ) bone marrow assessment follow remission induction chemotherapy ( IC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect eltrombopag megakaryopoiesis - median time reach platelet count ≥50,000 /μL ≥100,000 /μL , number day platelet transfusion , rate platelet transfusion-independence median time reach platelet transfusion independence . II . To determine effect eltrombopag rate clinically significant bleed event ( CSBE ) . III . To determine effect eltrombopag erythropoiesis median time red blood cell transfusion independence . IV . To determine effect eltrombopag granulopoiesis- time take reach absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500 /μL . V. To determine safety tolerability eltrombopag AML patient undergo remission IC - incidence severity eltrombopag-related adverse event . VI . To determine rate complete remission ( CR ) , rate partial complete remission ( CRp ) , time attain CR , time initiation postremission consolidation therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) platelet count reach ≥50,000/uL 8 week , whichever come earlier . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
