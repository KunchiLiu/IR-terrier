	<brief_title>The Effect Non-pharmacological Novel Cognitive Interventions Motor-Cognitive Function Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) common neurobehavioral disorder affect child . ADHD currently treat combination medication behavioral therapy aim reduce negative symptom . Pharmacologic treatment method , use Methylphenidate ( MPH ) many drawback include high cost side effect . Non-pharmacological treatment approach teach strategy aim improve behavior environmental management . Evidence efficacy treatment lack literature support 'parental education ' approach . Motor aspects disorder tend undertreated . Studies show persistent use MPH positive effect motor output time coordination child ADHD . Thus non-pharmacological intervention aim improve attention likely also improve aspect disorder motor problem thus explore . Various computerized remediation program develop non-pharmacological alternative child ADHD . The program present exercise require sustained attention response set rule often grade task complexity accord user 's ability . Virtual Reality ( VR ) simulation real world use computer graphic require interaction , immersion active participation user . VR application show effective improve attention child adolescents behavioral problem , teach focus task exist cognitive training program . VR walk demonstrated improvement motor cognitive function old adult patient neurodegenerative disease suggest beneficial effect motor cognitive function . However treatment test yet ADHD . The study investigate follow aim : 1 . To compare effect computerized cognitive remediation VR attention gait child ADHD . 2 . To examine long term effect computerize cognitive remediation VR attention gait child ADHD . 3 . To compare , exploratory analysis , effect non-pharmacological training paradigms standard care treatment attention gait child ADHD .</detailed_description>
