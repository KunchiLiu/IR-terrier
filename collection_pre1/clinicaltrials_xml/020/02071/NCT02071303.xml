	<brief_title>Tramadol Versus Celecoxib Reducing Pain Outpatient Hysteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysteroscopic examination currently informative investigation patient abnormal uterine bleeding infertility . Outpatient hysteroscopy involve use miniaturize endoscopic equipment directly visualise endometrial cavity , without need formal theatre facility , general regional anaesthesia . Outpatient hysteroscopy increasingly use cost-effective alternative in-patient hysteroscopy general anaesthesia . Like outpatient gynaecological procedure , however , potential cause pain severe enough procedure abandon . Several drug use reduce pain procedure . Celecoxib highly selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ( COX-2 inhibitor ) whereas Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) like Ibuprofen , Diclofenac , Naproxen inhibit COX-1 COX-2 . COX-1 isoenzyme find platelet , play role protection gastrointestinal mucosa , renal hemodynamics , platelet thrombogenesis . In theory , selectivity allow celecoxib COX-2 inhibitor reduce inflammation pain minimize gastrointestinal adverse drug reaction . COX-1 involved synthesis prostaglandin thromboxane , COX-2 involve synthesis prostaglandin . Therefore , inhibition COX-2 inhibits prostaglandin synthesis without affect thromboxane , offer cardioprotective effect nonselective NSAIDs . Opioid analgesic widely use control moderate severe pain . Tramadol hydrochloride , synthetic opioid orally active , clinically effective centrally act analgesic low incidence respiratory depression , cardiac depression , side effect smooth muscle abuse potential compare typical opioid agent . The study conduct outpatient hysteroscopy clinic Cairo university hospital . All patient attend outpatient hysteroscopy clinic invite participate study . The invitation include clear full explanation study patient provide oral consent . Written inform consent need since procedure intervention carry almost risk patient patient receive anesthesia fully conscious . Only patient consent verbally participate included trial . Tramadol , celecoxib placebo enclose sealed envelope number use computer generate random table . Neither patient physician aware drug use . 210 woman categorize 3 group : Group I receive Tramadol 100mg ( Trama SR® , Global Napi ) orally 1 hour procedure , group II receive Celecoxib 200mg ( Celebrex® 200 , Pfizer ) 1 hour procedure , group III receive placebo act control group . Full history take follow general local examination . The procedure do lithotomy position . Hysteroscopy do use 5mm out diameter continuous flow hysteroscope French work channel 30 degree direction view provide Techno GmbH CO . The hysteroscope introduce use vaginoscopy technique , speculum use . The cervix detect external o identify use hysteroscope . The hysteroscope introduce uterine cavity . Saline use distension medium pressure set 100mm Hg . The anterior wall , posterior wall tubal ostea visualize , polyp , adhesion septa , congenital malformation submucous fibroid note . Base line characteristic perception pain compare .</detailed_description>
