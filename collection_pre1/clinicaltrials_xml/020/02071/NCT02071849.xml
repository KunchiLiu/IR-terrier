	<brief_title>HAART 200 Aortic Valve Annuloplasty Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic valve disease common valvular heart disease approximately 200,000 patient per year undergoing conventional aortic valve replacement North America Europe . Around 60 % valve Aortic Stenosis ( AS ) 40 % Aortic Insufficiency , failure aortic valve close completely diastole , cause blood flow aorta back left ventricle . Bicuspid valve morphology present fourth third patient come surgical intervention , constitute important subset . Several condition associate bicuspid disease , include ascend aortic root aneurysms third . Traditional management aortic valve root disease aortic valve replacement , without root replacement ( Bentall Procedure ) . However , observed patient mitral valve repair , option maintain one 's reconstruct native valve versus replacement , either bioprosthetic mechanical , multiple benefit . The advantage repair include : avoidance prosthetic valve relate complication structural degeneration bioprosthetic valve 10-15 year elimination need anticoagulation relate problem mechanical valve young patient . The significantly low rate endocarditis repair major impetus increase performance BAV reconstruction . Thus , aortic valve repair currently establish excellent option patient BAV . However , connective tissue disorder inherent feature BAV , outcomes less stable long-term trileaflet repair , primarily late annular redilatation BAV disease . Therefore , study design evaluate safety effectiveness annular stabilization bicuspid annuloplasty ring patient undergo repair bicuspid aortic valve predominant aortic insufficiency .</detailed_description>
