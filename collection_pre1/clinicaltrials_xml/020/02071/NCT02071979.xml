	<brief_summary>This study examine difference process wound-healing patient treat platelet rich plasma ( concentration proteins derive patient blood ) apply wound gel ; inject wound surround tissue ; ; compare patient treat usual medical treatment . This study seek enroll patient 18 old non-healing skin wound least 30 day old . Only patient Diabetic Foot Ulcers , Venous Ulcers , Pressure Ulcers include study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Trial Effectiveness Platelet Rich Plasma Chronic Non-Healing Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose investigation design solicit large number patient ( N=1,500 ) non-healing wound ( Diabetic Foot Ulcers , Venous Ulcers , Pressure Ulcers ) respond standard wound care previous 30 day . A prospective , interventional , single-blinded , control , registry trial use . Data analyze compare patient receive PRP therapy ( PRP gel application , PRP injection , ) standard wound care ( usual customary care ) patient receive standard wound care ( usual customary care ) , . Wound size , rate healing , quality life , recurrence wound measure 20-week period usual office visit one-year post-enrollment , respectively . Hypotheses test : 1 . Treatment chronic wound standard care autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) increase velocity heal ( rate wound closure ) twenty week period compare patient receive standard wound care ( Control Group ) , result patient 's ability return previous function resumption normal activity . 2 . Treatment chronic wound standard care autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) result complete wound heal within twenty week , whereas complete wound heal observe within twenty week patient receive standard wound care ( Control Group ) .</detailed_description>
