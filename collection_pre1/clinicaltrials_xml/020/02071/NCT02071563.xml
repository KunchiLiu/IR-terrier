The study Burkina Faso test relative effectiveness cost effectiveness four supplementary food prevention MAM stunt normal programmatic setting . The aim study : 1 . To compare effectiveness four alternative supplementary food commodity prevent stunt wasting , promote linear growth child 6 - 23 month context preventive supplementary feeding program Burkina Faso . 2 . To estimate relative cost implement supplementary feeding program use commodity 3 . To estimate relative cost/effectiveness implement program use commodity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase II FAQR Burkina Faso ass recommend improvement four arm study : CSB14 prepare FVO , RUSF1 , CSB+ , SC+ . The study cluster-randomized , effectiveness trial . The study use mixed method technique quantitative qualitative data collection . The design study quasi-experimental : food distribution site ( FDPs ) ( community serve ) group four cluster geographically contiguous sufficiently distant Beneficiaries unlikely contact . The four group food distribution point randomly assign one four arm , define specific food provide : 1 . Corn Soy Blend 14 ( CSB14 ) ( whey protein concentrate enhance micronutrient profile ) , prepare fortify vegetable oil ( FVO ) ; 75g CSB14/day , 22.5g FVO/day 2 . Ready-to use supplementary food 1 ( RUSF1 ) ; 100g RUSF/day 3 . Super Cereal Plus ( SC+ ) ( enhanced nutrient profile , non-fat dry milk , oil already embed CSB ) ; 122g SC+/day 4 . Corn Soy Blend Plus ( CSB+ ) prepare FVO ; 75g CSB+/day , 22.5g FVO/day The CSB+ arm act control The intervention implement use food distribution point provide supplementary food ( CSB14 , CSB+ , RUSF , SC+ ) child reach six month age , child 6 23 month . This study enroll child turn six month age follow 23rd month age . Variables track include : age , sex , arm study/commodity receive , Mid-Upper Arm Circumference ( MUAC ) , height age , weight age , weight height , month-to-month linear growth weight gain , incidence stunting ( height age -2 Standard Deviations ( SD ) ) , incidence wasting ( weight height - 2 SD ) . At 24 month , child stop receive supplementary food . The study continue monitor variable least additional 6 month ( age 30 month ) . The study collect information follow additional variable Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers , Health Nutrition Promoters ( HNPs ) , Community Health Agents ( CHAs ) , store owner sell product comparable distribute , PVO staff member . - Mothers ' knowledge , attitude , practice respect compliance instruction preparation use supplementary food - Time money cost Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers participate feed program - Household Characteristics - Environmental characteristic - Community characteristic - Perceived barrier factor facilitate Title II program effectiveness - Logistics cost procuring , warehouse distribute food food distribution point Data Collection Time Points Data collection ongoing . It expect order reach sample size , study need enroll child roll basis turn 6 month old one year . All child receive food ration 18 month , turn 2 year old . During time period , study collect growth measurement ( height , weight , MUAC ) every enrol child monthly interval . Throughout study , qualitative quantitative data also collect Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers , Health Nutrition Promoters ( HNPs ) , Community Health Agents ( CHAs ) , PVO staff member describe . We conduct qualitative open end interview PVO staff member professional capacity , learn challenge strengths implement procurement distribution new commodity . We also randomly select small subsample Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers in-home observation . The purpose observation observe aspect family 's preparation consumption ration would unlikely able report focus group individual interview , respondent may conscious action . Examples include : give taste ration child cook ; quickly ration cover feeding ; whether child able take taste leftover ration . We would follow commonly use model ask family guest observer stay week waking hour . The observer would collect information aspect preparation consumption method observable behavior ( e.g . many time day ration make , whether covered cooking , cooking , serve ) . We collect small ( 2 tablespoon ) sample prepared ration individually interview Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers . This used laboratory assessment proportion FVO porridge validate estimate CSB : Oil ratio report mother . The objective study highlight food product best prevents stunt MAM , cost effective way , thereby ultimately affect future effective efficient policy food aid program .</detailed_description>
