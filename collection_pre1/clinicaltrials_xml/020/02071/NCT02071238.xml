	<brief_title>Factors Affecting Risk Recall Open Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective study The investigator ' study objective see additionally provide write document along discussion surgical risk improve risk recall patient see consultation open carpal tunnel release , effect overall satisfaction procedure . To accomplish goal , investigator intend provide patient write document outline risk discuss consultation investigate recall risk improve compare patient receive discussion alone . The investigator also see whether risk recall affect patient participate group format inform consent discussion compare standard individual discussion . The investigator propose two-part prospective randomize control trial patient new referral Halifax Infirmary Plastic Surgery Clinic . Background The informed consent process The risk benefit operation procedure typically discussed part inform consent process initial surgical consultation . Informed consent legal requirement surgery base component disclosure , comprehension , competence voluntary choice . Despite , patient often unable recall specific risk review . Additionally , failure understand possible risk failure communication common reason patient seek legal action . Patients historically report wished received information operation prior surgery . Increased understanding procedure risk show give patient realistic expectation , increase cooperation result high satisfaction . Traditionally , obtain informed consent surgical procedure involve oral discussion , may insufficient oral information tend poorly retain . Previous research field otolaryngology show write documentation addition oral discussion increase recall general knowledge procedure specific risk procedure . Siau et al . ( 2010 ) find effect even pronounce recall risk associate operation subjectively patient find happy received pamphlet find helpful . Early research subject general surgery suggest optimal time provide additional information regard procedure time initial consultation least one week prior surgery . The investigator ' research important could show provide write document conjunction standard oral discussion improve patient ' risk recall inform consent process open carpal tunnel surgery . In addition , investigator wish look whether turn increase satisfaction procedure . Though past research drawn link comprehension satisfaction , little research conduct specifically topic . In future research could extend surgical practice . Due large volume patient require open carpal tunnel release , wait time follow referral vary 30 151 day Nova Scotia , average wait time 59 day ( Patient Access Registry NS , July-September 2013 ) . While open carpal tunnel release surgery brief procedure extremely low rate post-operative complication ( Ono et al. , 2010 ) , presurgical consultation patient take large proportion time spend patient surgeon address disease . To address similar problem involve extensive information require prior surgery , UHN breast reconstruction program Toronto process pilot educational group intervention , include seminar-style lecture group discussion , order improve share decision make woman undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction ( Platt et al. , 2013 ) . We seek implement similar program patient schedule undergo open carpal tunnel release . According Weiss model medical stigma ( Weiss et al. , 2006 ) , Carpal Tunnel Syndrome could consider disease minimal stigma attach . As one would correspondingly expect , offer opportunity participate group seminar style presurgical consult , many patient express positive opinion willingness participate . If difference risk recall general satisfaction patient part group consultation compare traditional consult , group consultation may viable tool shorten wait time patient undergo specific kind medical surgical procedure . Hypothesis The investigator test whether provide write document conjunction standard oral discussion improve patient ' risk recall inform consent process open carpal tunnel release increase patient ' subjective satisfaction operation . In addition , investigator test whether group consultation format provide model large-volume , low-variation , low-urgency surgery without reduce ability recall risk surgery overall satisfaction . Patient Selection The investigator study two-part prospective randomize study , 100 consecutive patient see open carpal tunnel release consultation Halifax Infirmary . Inclusion criterion : The sample size chosen base previous study investigate risk recall power calculation hypothesis mean 4 item recall , standard deviation 2.5 ( alpha 0.05 , beta 0.95 ) , give u sample size give hypothesis ( n = 40 per study group ) .</detailed_description>
