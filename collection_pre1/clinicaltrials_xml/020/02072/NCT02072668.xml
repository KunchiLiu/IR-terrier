	<brief_summary>The primary study hypothesis inhibition factor Xa rivaroxaban reduce inflammation , coagulation endothelial cell activation , improve microvascular blood flow patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) non-crisis , steady state . To test hypothesis , study evaluate effect rivaroxaban : - plasma marker inflammation ; - plasma marker endothelial activation ; - plasma marker thrombin generation ; - microvascular blood flow assess use laser Doppler velocimetry ( LDV ) post-occlusive reactive hyperemia ( PORH ) . In cross-over design , subject receive rivaroxaban 20 mg/day placebo 4 week , separate 2-week washout phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Rivaroxaban Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist Screening Phase , two Treatment Phases , Wash-Out Phase , Follow-up Phase . The Screening Phase occur within 28 day randomization include inform consent , physical examination , complete medical history include determination sickle cell genotype current medication . Clinical laboratory test perform include : Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) differential reticulocyte count ; Prothrombin time ( PT ) / activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ; serum chemistry ( BUN , creatinine , total direct bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase , LDH ) . A chest x-ray MRI/MRA brain also do Screening rule underlie disease . If patient find screen process eligible , 1st Treatment Phase begin . Baseline safety assessment measurement biomarkers complete , subject randomize receive rivaroxaban placebo . After 4 week treatment , 2-Week Wash-Out Phase . After Wash-Out Phase , another set baseline study perform 2nd Treatment Phase begin . For Phase study , subject `` cross '' receive whatever treatment - rivaroxaban placebo - receive 1st Treatment Phase . After take assigned study drug 4 week , 2nd Treatment Phase end . The subject return 2 week last dose study treatment Follow-Up Phase , consist single end-of-study visit safety assessment repeat .</detailed_description>
