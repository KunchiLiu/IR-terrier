	<brief_summary>In general , patient Human Papilloma Virus Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HPVOPC ) curable , young live prolong period . They high risk long-term toxicity mortality therapy . While long-term consequence chemotherapy surgery head neck cancer relatively constrain , high-dose radiotherapy ( RT ) chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) substantially impact local tissue organ function result significant rate late mortality morbidity patient . Studies design reduce impact RT CRT patient . Patients intermediate stage HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer screen poor prognostic feature undergo robotic surgery . Patients pathology demonstrates good prognosis feature follow without postoperative radiotherapy . Patients subsequent recurrence treat either surgery postoperative radiotherapy postoperative chemoradiotherapy alone . Patients poor prognostic feature ( ECS , LVI , PNI ) receive reduce dose radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy base pathology . It expect 50 % patient treat surgery curative treatment avoid radiation therapy entirely long-term survival change withhold radiation therapy good prognosis patient surgery . There exploratory biomarkers risk recurrence collect study . There currently trial examine role de-escalation use surgery alone intermediate early T-stage HPV related disease . New surgical technique broaden range patient capable achieve complete resection functional outcome patient outstanding . Furthermore , sensitivity HPVOPC chemotherapy radiotherapy raise possibility delay salvage treatment early stage patient would highly effective , would result similar survival outcome radiotherapy could apply much small population current standard call . Looked different perspective , need post-operative radiotherapy younger , HPV+ functional population validate clinical trial date .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients may screen consented display clinical feature consistent p16 positivity , p16+ yet test p16 IHC HPV PCR meet eligibility criterion . They enter experimental postsurgical portion study surgery perform MSSM surgical specimen biopsy proven p16+ IHC test HPV+ PCR test Participants must histologically cytologically confirm identify resectable primary squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx HPV 16 positive positive high risk HPV subtype ( i.e. , 18 , 33 , 35 , etc . ) determine PCR central laboratory . Patients must p16+ status determine IHC perform reviewed central laboratory prior consent . Both p16 HPV status must determine prior postsurgical adjuvant treatment assignment . Tissue primary site must available biomarker study surgery . Stage 1 , 2 , 3 early intermediate stage IVa ( T1N02B , T2N02B ) ( Level 2 , nonmatted ) disease without evidence distant metastasis extracapsular extension . Primary site must lateralize functional dissection . Age &gt; 18 year . No previous surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy SCCHN ( biopsy tonsillectomy ) allow time study entry . ECOG performance status 0 1 . No active alcohol addiction ( assessed medical caregiver ) . No active tobacco use ( &gt; 10 year tobacco free interval , &lt; 20pk/yr . history ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants must adequate bone marrow , hepatic renal function define : 1 . Hematology : Neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/l . Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/l . Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl ( may achieve transfusion ) . 2 . Renal function : &gt; 60 ml/min ( actual calculate CockcroftGault method ) follow : CrCl ( mL/min ) = ( 140age ) ( weight kg ) 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) N.B . For female , use 85 % calculate CrCl value . Or Creatinine &lt; upper limit normal Patients &lt; age 18 . Pregnant breast feed woman . Previous current malignancy site , exception adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , thyroid cancer , cancer curatively treat surgery current evidence disease least 5 year . Other serious illness medical condition include limited : 1 . Unstable cardiac disease despite treatment , myocardial infarction month prior study entry . 2 . History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder include dementia seizures 3 . Active clinically significant uncontrolled infection 4 . Active peptic ulcer disease define unhealed clinically active 5 . Active drug addiction include alcohol , cocaine intravenous drug use define occur within 6 month precede diagnosis 6 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , define associate hospitalization pneumonia respiratory decompensation within 12 month diagnosis . This include obstruction tumor 7 . Autoimmune disease require therapy , prior organ transplant , know HIV infection 8 . Interstitial lung disease 9 . Hepatitis C history 10 . Concurrent treatment anticancer therapy . 11 . Participation investigational therapeutic drug trial within 30 day study entry . Advanced Stage III , IV ( N2C , N3 ) surgically unresectable disease disease fully resect , obvious radiologic ECS , supraclavicular mat metastatic disease , &gt; 3 cervical node . ( These patient place Quarterback trial due advance state disease poor prognostic feature ) HPV negative OPSCC determine determine PCR .</criteria>
