	<brief_summary>In study , study lipoprotein abnormalities-related variable risk factor development cardiovascular disease patient renal replacement therapies.We study 96 dialyzed patient , 62 male 34 female , mean age 62.1 year old 24 healthy controls.We conclude metabolic acidosis activate inflammation lipoprotein oxidation influence dyslipidemia cardiovascular morbidity patient renal replacement therapies.Dialysis adequacy positively associate cardioprotective HDL.Peritoneal dialysis hold good acidosis level lower oxidized lipid hemodialysis modality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood sample obtain venipuncture peritoneal dialyzed patient control group twelve hour fast state.In hemodialyzed patient blood drawn start mean weekly dialysis session also twelve hour fast state vascular access . All sample receive baseline time ( start study ) . Peripheral systolic diastolic blood pressure calculate average 10 measurement renal replacement treatment month start time study . Also , electrocardiographic examination , echocardiography calculation ankle-brachial blood pressure index become start study .</detailed_description>
