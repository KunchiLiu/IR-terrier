	<brief_title>Improved Diagnostics Celiac Disease Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence celiac disease steep rise Western country , due difficult diagnosis majority patient remain unrecognized . Undiagnosed celiac disease cause incremental burden health care predispose severe complication . On hand , increase screen at-risk group celiac disease frequently detect seropositive subject obvious symptom and/or still normal small-bowel mucosal morphology . At present natural history benefit early diagnosis individual poorly know . Further , endoscopic demonstration small-intestinal damage require diagnosis unpleasant , expensive often mislead . New serology-based diagnostic criterion suggest prospective data lack . Aims present study improve diagnostic yield accuracy current diagnostic method develop novel non-invasive method biomarkers early detection celiac disease . In addition , investigator evaluate natural history celiac disease screening-detected asymptomatic child positive serology normal histology , form large database future clinical translational study . The study patient collection conduct pediatric clinic Finland Romania . All child refer due suspicion celiac disease gluten sensitivity ask participate study . Patient sample clinical information collect routine visit study include additional visit endoscopy . The total duration study 10 year data analyze on-line .</detailed_description>
