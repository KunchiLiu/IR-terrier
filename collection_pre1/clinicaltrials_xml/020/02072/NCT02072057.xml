	<brief_title>Study Ruxolitinib Treatment Cachexia Patients With Tumor-Associated Chronic Wasting Diseases .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cachexia multifactorial syndrome characterize tissue wasting , loss body weight , particularly lean body ( muscle ) mass ( LBM ) less extent adipose tissue , metabolic alteration , fatigue , reduce performance status , often accompany anorexia lead reduce food intake . Cachexia accompany end stage many chronic disease especially cancer therefore also term `` cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome '' ( CACS ) . Clinically , cachexia define unintentional 5 % resp . 10 % loss body weight 6-month resp . 12-month period directly associate underlying disease . The progressive loss adipose tissue skeletal muscle despite adequate feeding result weakness , reduce ambulation , diminish quality life , poor response therapy , often death due respiratory failure infection . At time cancer diagnosis , 80 % patient upper gastrointestinal cancer 60 % patient lung cancer already substantial weight loss . Currently , approve effective treatment treatment cachexia . Understanding molecular mechanism responsible muscle waste necessary develop target therapy play central role signal transduction initiate cytokine ( e.g. , interleukin interferon signal ) , growth factor , hormone vulnerable patient . Key feature CACS increase rest energy expenditure ( REE ) , increased level circulate factor produce host immune system response tumor , proinflammatory cytokine , tumor , proteolysis-inducing factor . Inflammation unify mechanism entire cluster sickness behaviour ( asthenia , increase slow-wave sleep , mood alteration , lethargy , depression , anorexia , fever , anhedonia , cognitive impairment , hyperalgesia decrease social interaction ) , include lipolysis muscle proteolysis . Inflammation generate brain , tumor , tissue locale tumor diversity host cell include skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , cell immune system , liver . The specific identity inflammation mediator participate cancer cachexia emerge . Both host tumor-derived factor show experimentally contribute muscle waste . There evidence chronic , low-grade , tumor-induced activation host immune system , share numerous characteristic `` acute-phase response '' find major traumatic event , septic shock chronic inflammatory disease excessive production proinflammatory cytokine , involve CACS . Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor-alfa ( TNF-a ) play central role pathophysiology CACS , although mechanism might induce muscle waste unknown . A goal anorexia-cachexia therapy interfere response inflammation restore positive energy balance promote gain skeletal muscle mass . Understanding specific management initiate inflammatory pathway crucial end . Recently study report `` Signal Transducers Activators Transcription ( STAT ) '' protein ( STAT3 ) activation common feature muscle wasting , activated muscle IL-6 vivo vitro , different type cancer , sterile sepsis . Moreover , STAT3 activation necessary sufficient cause muscle wasting . Conversely , author show inhibit STAT3 pharmacologically Janus kinase ( JAK ) STAT3 inhibitor genetically reduce muscle atrophy downstream IL-6 cancer . Epidemiological study suggest many 25 % cancer may due chronic inflammation . The connection inflammation cancer consist extrinsic pathway , driven inflammatory condition increase cancer risk , intrinsic pathway , drive oncogenic alteration result creation inflammatory microenvironment resolve neoplasias . Immune cell play key role connect inflammation cancer produce various growth angiogenic factor , proteinase , chemokines , cytokine create pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment . This milieu stimulate cell migration , proliferation , survival , angiogenesis , metastasis , facilitate subversion adaptive immunity , thus favor cancer progression . These theoretical consideration well pharmacological result data animal model indicate JAK/STAT pathway primary mediator muscle waste cancer cachexia condition high IL-6 family signal . Thus JAK/STAT pathway could represent novel therapeutic target preservation skeletal muscle cachexia . On basis rationale , want carry open label phase II study aim test efficacy safety treatment base pharmacologic inhibition JAK/STAT3 pathway Ruxolitinib patient CACS . Ruxolitinib represent novel orally bioavailable , potent , selective inhibitor JAK1 JAK2 develop primarily treatment Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( MPNs ) . A key feature MPNs dysregulation JAK/STAT signaling .</detailed_description>
