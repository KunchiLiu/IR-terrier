	<brief_summary>Background Women undergo Caesarean Section ( CS ) increase risk postpartum infection compare woman undergo vaginal delivery . In Denmark incidence post-CS infection 7-10 % . The common infection endometritis , Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) wound infection ( WI ) . Prophylactic antibiotic effective prevent postoperative infection national guideline recommend antibiotic administer single dose immediately surgical incision . CS exception pre-incision administration approach . National guideline recommend administration antibiotic umbilical cord clamp avoid exposure child antibiotic birth . Recent study antibiotic prophylaxis CS suggest prophylactic antibiotic administer incision compare umbilical cord clamping may reduce post-CS infection 50 % . Two Cochrane review 2012 criticize type study lack data outcomes baby late infection mother . At birth , mammal must rapidly adapt intake complex milk nutrient via gut simultaneously tolerate invasion billion microbes . This require rapid maturation digestive immune function avoid gut disorder infection . Full-term , breast-fed infant normally adapt well , factor caesarean birth , high hygiene level , antibiotic treatment formula feeding may inhibit immune development short long term . Birth caesarean section high-hygiene hospital environment , widespread use antibiotic , factor reduce gut microbiota density diversity newborn time birth . On hand , high-hygiene environment antibiotic essential tool combat infection , especially weak newborn infant . This pilot study feasibility study original study , examines effect change time prophylactic antibiotic rate post-CS infection ( endometritis , UTI WI ) . The pilot study focus antibiotic change gut microbiota newborn infant . The feasibility study include pregnant woman Odense body mass index 30 , plan cesarean section .</brief_summary>
