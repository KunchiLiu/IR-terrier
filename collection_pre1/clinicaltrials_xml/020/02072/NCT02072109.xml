	<brief_summary>Early initiation enteral feeding , achievement full enteral feed cessation parenteral nutrition extremely important premature infant . This way possible achieve good post-natal growth developement minimize metabolic infectious complication parenteral feeding . There n't much information literature regard impact enteral feed intestinal blood flow intestinal regional oxygenation preterm infant . There also consensus regard best regimen deliver enteral nutrition - bolus feed continuous feeding . The aim study compare intestinal regional oxygenation two feeding regimen - bolus feed continuous feed - clinically stable preterm infant bear 32 week gestation . The evaluation perform use NIRS technology ( Near Infrared Spectroscopy ) . The study may help assess feed regimen gentle immature intestine ( i.e . alters less splanchnic blood flow oxygenation ) therefore preferred way feed preterm infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early initiation enteral feeding , achievement full enteral feed cessation parenteral nutrition extremely important premature infant . This way possible achieve good post-natal growth developement minimize metabolic infectious complication parenteral feeding . There n't much information literature regard impact enteral feed intestinal blood flow intestinal regional oxygenation preterm infant . There also consensus regard best regimen deliver enteral nutrition - bolus feed continuous feeding . The aim study compare intestinal regional oxygenation two feeding regimen - bolus feed continuous feed - clinically stable preterm infant bear 32 week gestation . The evaluation perform use NIRS technology ( Near Infrared Spectroscopy ) . The investigator intend assess 20 clinically stable , appropriate gestational age preterm infant , bear 32 week gestation receive full enteral feeding least 1 week prior enrollment sign feed intolerance . All 20 participant evaluate constitute 2 study group : 1 . Group 1 = Bolus feed - one bolus feed 2 . Group 2 = Continuous feed - one continuous feeding . The study may help assess feed regimen gentle immature intestine ( i.e . alters less splanchnic blood flow oxygenation ) therefore preferred way feed preterm infant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Born 23+0 31+6 week gestational age . Appropriate gestational age . Clinically stable . Full enteral feed least 1 week prior enrollment . Bolus feed . No sign feed intolerance . Major congenital anomaly ( severe heart cerebral disease , chromosomal abnormality , malformation disease gastrointestinal tract ) . Previous diagnosis necrotizing enterocolitis spontaneous intestinal perforation . Need blood transfusion 1 week prior enrollment . Need vasopressor therapy 1 week prior enrollment . Cutaneous disease allow placement NIRS probe .</criteria>
