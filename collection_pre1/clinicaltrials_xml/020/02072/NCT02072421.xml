	<detailed_description>The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study ( `` Cohort Study '' prospective , multi-center , single-arm study non-emergency PCI perform non-SOS hospital patient myocardial ischemia ( STEMI ) . The Cohort Study design allow non-SOS hospital continue perform non-emergency PCI enrollment MASS COMM trial complete 30-day 12-month result available . Specifically , eligible subject , enrollment MASS COMM randomize control trial complete final result available decision reach MA-DPH , consent enrolled Cohort Study .

	<criteria>Candidates study must meet ALL follow criterion : Subject least 18 year old . Subject require single multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) de novo restenotic target lesion ( include instent restenotic lesion ) . N.B . stag procedure consider meet endpoint component repeat revascularization either follow precatheterization procedure qualify clinical laboratory value meet : eGFR le 60 ml/min creatinine great 1.5 mg/dl Subject 's lesion ( ) ( ) amenable stent treatment currently available FDAapproved bare metal drug elute stent . Subject acceptable candidate nonemergency , urgent emergency CABG . Subject clinical evidence ischemic heart disease term positive functional study , document symptom . Documented stable angina pectoris [ Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification ( CCS ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] , unstable angina pectoris document ischemia ( Braunwald Class IBC , IIBC , IIIBC ) , nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction , document silent ischemia . Subject treat physician agree subject comply followup evaluation . Subject informed nature purpose study agree provision provide write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee respective clinical site . Angiographic Inclusion Criteria The target lesion ( ) ( ) de novo restenotic ( include instent restenotic ) native coronary artery lesion ( ) great equal 50 less 100 % stenosis ( visual estimate ) , target lesion acute ( less 1 month ) total occlusion evidence clinical symptom . If Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) measure , target lesion ( ) ( ) evidence hemodynamically significant stenosis determine FFR measurement ( FFR le equal 0.8 ) . Target lesion ( ) ( ) locate infarct ( treated primary PCI ) noninfarctrelated artery 70 % great stenosis ( visual estimate ) great 72 hour follow STEMI . Lesions treat PCI great 72 hour follow STEMI would subject protocol inclusion/exclusion criterion list exception target lesion 70 % great stenosis may treat without symptom abnormal stress test ) . Subjects exclude participation Cohort Study ( nonemergency PCI may perform patient nonSOS site ) ANY follow condition apply : The patient pregnant breastfeeding . Evidence ST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 72 hour intend treatment infarct relate noninfarct related artery . Cardiogenic shock presentation current hospitalization . Left ventricular ejection fraction le 20 % . Known allergy : aspirin , clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , prasugrel ( Effient ) , ticlopidine ( Ticlid ) , heparin , bivalirudin , stainless steel , contrast agent ( adequately premedicated ) . A platelet count le 75,000 cells/mm3 great 700,000 cells/mm3 WBC le 3,000 cells/mm3 . Acute chronic renal dysfunction ( creatinine le 2.5 mg/dl less 150Âµmol/L ) . Subject currently participate investigational drug device study complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint . ( Note : Trials require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial ) . Prior participation MASSCOMM Trial , unless patient complete 12month followup Trial , and/or prior participation Cohort Study , unless patient complete 30day followup Cohort Study . Within 30 day prior index Cohort Study procedure , subject undergone previous coronary interventional procedure kind . Note : This exclusion criterion apply postSTEMI patient . Stroke transient ischemic attack within prior 3 month . Active peptic ulcer upper GI bleeding within prior 3 month . Subject active sepsis . Unprotected leave main coronary artery disease ( stenosis great 50 % ) . Subject evidence hemodynamically insignificant stenosis determine FFR measurement ( FFR great 0.8 ) . In investigator 's opinion , subject comorbid condition ( ) could limit subject 's ability participate study comply followup requirement impact scientific integrity study . Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Subject normal insignificant coronary ( i.e. , coronary lesion ( ) less 50 % stenosis ) . Any target vessel evidence : 1. excessive thrombus ( e.g. , require target vessel thrombectomy ) 2. tortuosity ( great 60 degree angle ) make unsuitable proper stent delivery deployment , 3. heavy calcification . Any target lesion require treatment device PTCA prior stent placement ( e.g . limited , directional coronary atherectomy , excimer laser , rotational atherectomy , etc. ) . Any lesion locate saphenous vein graft , however , lesion locate within native vessel access graft eligible . The target vessel `` last remaining '' epicardial vessel ( e.g. , &gt; 2 nontarget epicardial vessel bypass grafts territory [ present ] totally occlude ) .</criteria>
