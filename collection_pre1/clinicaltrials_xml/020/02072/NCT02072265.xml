	<brief_summary>Permanently implantable venous port ( Port-A ) important patient receive chemotherapy . It provide reliable route administrate intravenous drug , also require minimal care use . However , catheter relate blood stream infection ( CRBSI ) one serious complication Port-A . The diagnosis CRBSI relies limit tool , include blood culture symptom sign active infection . In stage CRBSI , Port-A removal necessary pose risk patient re-implant Port-A . Thus , crucial early detect infection give appropriate treatment . Among pathogen , pathogen related skin contaminant . Before systemic spreading , pathogen may colonize cause minor infection subcutaneously . This investigation utilize non-invasive dual spectrum infrared image system evaluate Port-A wound detect infection . Aim : 1 . To build database infra-red thermal image Port-A wound heal . 2 . To investigate thermal image skin contamination relate CRBSI compare thermal image CRBSI unknown focus</brief_summary>
