	<brief_title>A Trial Positively Smoke Free Group Therapy HIV-infected Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 1.1 million person live HIV ( PLWH ) US , 60 % smoke cigarette , 75 % interested quitting . Almost none currently access smoke cessation intervention design meet specific need concern . Cigarette smoke responsible 24 % death among PLWH , 30 % non-AIDS defining malignancy . It drive alarm rise cardiac event lung cancer highly vulnerable population . The lack access proven , effective , culturally appropriate tobacco cessation service represent health disparity first order . The psychosocial profile PLWH-smoker community , characterize high rate psychiatric comorbidity , drug alcohol use , low level social support , suggest achieve high cessation rate great challenge . Positively Smoke Free ( PSF ) intensive , multisession , group cessation program specifically develop PLWH smoker . A pilot study PSF yield promising result . This proposal aim ( 1 ) perform definitive efficacy study PSF compare 6-month biochemically confirm abstinence rate subject randomize PSF vs. standard care cohort 450 PLWH smoker , ( 2 ) determine sociobehavioural moderator mediator associate successful cessation , ( 3 ) complete careful cost analysis PSF order estimate incremental cost per quit associate program participation . If PSF proven effective establish new treatment option PLWH smoker . Determination moderator mediator program success provide insight mode action intervention help guide development additional treatment strategy future . Finally , cost analysis provide critical information feasibility program dissemination implementation .</detailed_description>
