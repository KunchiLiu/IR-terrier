	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Efficacy Anaferon Children® Treatment Influenza Acute Respiratory Viral Infections Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study shall enroll outpatient subject sex age 3-12 year clinical manifestation influenza/Acute Respiratory Viral Infections ( ARVI ) , include fever least 38.0 С , seek medical aid within first day illness onset . Тhe doctor shall collect medical history information , perform objective examination , record concomitant therapy , obtain nasal swab specimen rapid diagnostic influenza test . If swab positive , doctor shall obtain swab specimen nasal cavity oropharynx ( nasopharyngeal swab ) subsequent real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) determine viral load influenza A and/or B virus . If swab negative influenza doctor shall collect nasopharyngeal swab subsequent PCR test respiratory virus . If inclusion criterion meet non-inclusion criterion absent visit 1 ( Day 1 ) , patient enrol trial randomize one two group : group 1 patient take Anaferon children® follow 5-day regimen ; group 2 patient receive Placebo use Anaferon children® 5-day regimen . The parent/adopter patient receive diary record child 's axillary temperature data morning bed time , score severity symptom . The subject monitor 14 day ( screen , randomization - 1 day , treatment - 5 day , follow-up − 1 day ; late-scheduled `` telephone '' visit − day 14 ) . At Visits 2-4 , doctor document objective examination data ; obtain nasopharyngeal swabs subject positive influenza test subsequent real time RT-PCR determine viral load reduction course treatment ; monitor prescribe concomitant therapy , check patient 's diary data . The `` telephone '' visit make elicit information parent regard patient 's general health , presence/absence secondary bacterial/viral complication , use antibacterial drug . Interim statistical analysis stipulate study protocol . Interim analysis perform use data obtain examination treatment protocol-defined number patient complete study . Based expected effect , minimum required Particular Per Protocol ( pPP ) sample size 254 patient ( 127 subject group - Anaferon child Placebo ) .</detailed_description>
