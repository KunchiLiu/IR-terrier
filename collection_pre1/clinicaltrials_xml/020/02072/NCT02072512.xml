	<brief_title>The Study Goserelin Plus Fulvestrant Comparing With Goserelin Plus Anastrozole Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premenopausal advance breast cancer patient fail tamoxifen treatment possible good candidate ovarian ablation/suppression aromatase inhibitors.Fulvestrant study little premenopausal woman despite attractive mechanism action . Based rationale , introduce high-dose fulvestrant LHRH agonist randomize trial comparing AI plus LHRH agonist . To assess efficacy goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg compare goserelin plus anastrozole first line endocrine therapy pre- perimenopausal HR+ advance breast cancer term progression-free survival ( PFS )</detailed_description>

Patients life expectancy 3 month . 5 . Patients metastatic locally advanced disease amenable therapy curative intent . 6 . Histological/cytological confirmation breast cancer . Patients must either positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor determination IHC competitive binding assay advance disease , perform advanced disease positive result primary breast cancer specimen ( Positivity define Allred score 3 8 IHC least 1 % positive tumor nuclei sample presence expect reactivity internal external control [ 35 ] ) . 7 . Patients recur completion adjuvant tamoxifen therapy ( without GnRHa ) . Toremifene could substitute tamoxifen adjuvant setting . 8 . Duration adjuvant tamoxifen ( toremifene ) treatment least 48 week . 9 . Patients measurable lesion baseline , Patients bone lesion , lytic mixed ( lytic + sclerotic ) , absence measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion 10 . Patients may receive irradiation bony sit disease pain control prevention fracture . 11 . For woman childbearing potential , agreement use one highly effective form nonhormonal contraception two effective form nonhormonal contraception patient and/or partner continue use duration study treatment 6 month last dose study treatment . 1 . Presence lifethreatening metastatic visceral disease , define extensive hepatic involvement , degree brain leptomeningeal involvement ( past present ) , symptomatic pulmonary lymphangitic spread . Patients discrete pulmonary parenchymal metastasis eligible , provided respiratory function compromise result disease . 2 . Postmenopausal woman , define woman fulfil 1 follow criterion : Age .60 year Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age &lt; 60 year amenorrheic 12 month absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , toremifene , ovarian suppression FSH estradiol postmenopausal range ( accord local site ) . If take tamoxifen toremifene , age &lt; 60 year , FSH plasma estradiol level postmenopausal range ( accord local site ) . 3 . More one regimen chemotherapy advance disease . 4 . Previous endocrine therapy advance disease . 5 . Prior treatment aromatase inhibitor fulvestrant . 6 . Prior treatment GnRHa within 3 month . 7 . Treatment nonapproved experimental drug within 4 week randomisation . 8 . Current prior malignancy within previous 3 year ( breast cancer adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin insitu carcinoma cervix ) . 9 .
