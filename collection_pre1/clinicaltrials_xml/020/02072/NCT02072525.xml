	<brief_title>A Protocol Collect Human Serum Samples From Healthy Adults Use Quality Controls Samples GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' Assays</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol source human serum plasma healthy adult use control sample assay support clinical development GSK Biologicals ' vaccine prevention invasive infection cause Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani Bordetella pertussis . At final visit , small volume whole blood obtain addition plasma , allow head head comparison serum obtain whole blood ( off-clot serum ) plasma ( serum derive re-calcified plasma ) . In addition , serum generate clinical trial could potentially use control sample vaccine program help assure quality analytical method . Subjects 18 49 year age ( yet achieve 50th birthday ) randomize receive Menveo + Boostrix subject 50 55 year age randomize receive either Pneumovax 23 Prevnar 13 serve donor human serum study .</detailed_description>
