	<brief_summary>The present project aim describe vestibular signal contribute multisensory mechanism bodily self-consciousness . There large body data regard sensory neural mechanism self-consciousness , study far demonstrated contribution visual , tactile proprioceptive signal bodily self-consciousness . Thus , study neglect contribution vestibular system , major sensory system spatial bodily representation . The vestibular system sensitive head motion space head inclination respect gravity therefore contribute significantly several bodily experience . This contribution put neuroscientific scrutiny . We believe current neuroscientific model bodily self-consciousness incomplete incorporate contribution vestibular signal . The present project specifically aim test hypothesis accord vestibular signal significantly influence bodily self-consciousness , particular first-person third-person perspective take internal body model ( i.e . body schema body image ) . The present project also aim describe cortical vestibular processing modify experimental change perspective take viewpoint . In addition , present project describe whether vestibular disorder change performance third-person perspective take task modify internal body model . This help understand bodily symptom vestibular-defective patient . To end , combine approach psychophysics electrophysiology ( electromyography , electroencephalography ) healthy volunteer behavioral approach patient vestibular disorder . These study understand brain process vestibular signal , date poorly understood . In addition , outcome present project help understand multiple complex symptom report patient vestibular disease , therefore improve treatment .</brief_summary>
