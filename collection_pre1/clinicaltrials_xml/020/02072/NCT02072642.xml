	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease , degenerative disorder dopaminergic system , combine motor symptom also non-motor , depression , sleep disorder circadian rhythm impair cognitive function . Difficulties balance dopaminergic treatment patient emphasize need find effective adjuvant therapy . Light therapy ( LT ) represent one innovative therapeutic approach . Although light obvious visual pathway within brain , today know additionally exert non-visual effect throughout body . Recently team show non-visual , non-circadian light play major role regulation sleep , well cognitive brain function general . The retina , primary conduit transmission light information weaken thin Parkinson 's patient . The dopamine system know enhance process light information intraocular injection L-dopa animal model Parkinson 's disease , reverse associate motor symptom . This allow possibility LT would strengthen dopaminergic tone central nervous system . However , date effectiveness alleviate Parkinson 's symptom suggest two study , poorly control . Thus , convergence basic clinical data , study examine effect LT directly people Parkinson 's disease symptom , whilst control effect sleep , circadian system , mood , cognitive functioning , extreme importance . With information hope determine polymorphism allow predictive model response LT treatment .</brief_summary>
