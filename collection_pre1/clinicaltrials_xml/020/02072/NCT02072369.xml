	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor chronic hemiparesis upper extremity undertake 18 one-hour training session 6-week period . Participants receive occupational therapy focus grasp-and-release use task-oriented protocol develop Rehabilitation Institute Chicago Dr. Mary Ellen Stoykov . Over 90 % repetition perform session focus functional activity , oppose active exercise . The skill strategy develop therapy implement activity identify goal participant , don sock . Difficulty task , activity , exercise progress participant provide optimal challenge enhance skill . Subjects assign one two group cast lot . One group ( VAEDA Glove ) perform task wear custom Voice And EMG-Driven Actuated glove , VAEDA Glove . The group ( No-Glove ) perform type task without use VAEDA Glove . The VAEDA Glove portable active-assistance glove , design assist digit extension order allow repeat practice specify task . The glove contain cable traverse dorsal side digit order provide extension resist flexion . Forces transmit cable servomotor locate remotely digit . The servomotor control torque displacement cable . Along digit , cable traverse custom plastic block , serve guide cable prevent joint hyperextension . The VAEDA Glove control 3 channel electromyography ( EMG ) . For study , electrode place flexor digitorum superficialis ( FDS ) extensor digitorum communis ( EDC ) . The group use J-Glove could receive assistance hand opening , appropriate EMG activity detect . The EDC EMG activity reach prescribe threshold extension assistance would provide . Similarly , FDS EMG activity surpass threshold level hand close user allow flex digit . Feedback muscle activity available user custom graphical user interface .</detailed_description>
