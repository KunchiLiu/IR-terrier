	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study sorafenib tosylate treating patient liver cancer remove surgery . Sorafenib tosylate may block enzyme need tumor cell growth . Blocking enzyme may also help immune system work well . Granzyme B biomarker use measure well immune system work . A biomarker biological molecule find blood , body fluid , tissue sign normal abnormal process , condition disease . Studying granzyme B level patient receive sorafenib tosylate may help doctor learn effect sorafenib tosylate immune system may help predict well sorafenib tosylate work treat patient liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether proportion cytotoxic T lymphocytes produce granzyme B ( denote pGrzB ) measure ~28-35 day initiation sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) therapy correlate overall survival , define number month start sorafenib treatment death cause . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether high pGrzB level correlate good sorafenib tolerance , manifest few dose reduction , dose interruption adverse event . II . To determine whether improved immune function may also result great recognition hepatitis viral antigen . OUTLINE : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study , patient follow 30 day 6 month time point continue sorafenib tosylate periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
