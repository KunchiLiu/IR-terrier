	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study radiolabeled glass bead ( yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ) treat patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . Internal radiation therapy use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Using radiolabeled glass bead kill tumor cell may effective treatment liver cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Provide oversight treatment TheraSphere eligible patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) liver surgical resection candidate . II . Evaluate patient experience , toxicity overall survival associate TheraSphere treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially ( IA ) day 0 , may receive second dose within 30-90 day initial treatment . Patients may receive additional treatment 4-12 week initial treatment discretion study physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-6 week annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
