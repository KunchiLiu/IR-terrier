	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma ( GBM ) comprise 16 % malignancy nervous system 50 % glioma . Standard care newly-diagnosed GBM combination surgical debulking follow concurrent radiotherapy chemotherapy temozolomide . Efforts improve second-line therapy GBM meet marginal success large unmet medical need new therapy . G-202 ( mipsagargin ) example prodrug chemotherapy . It activate Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen ( PSMA ) , express cancer cell blood vessel solid tumor , include GBM , normal cell blood vessel normal tissue . It believe activation prodrug G-202 allow drug kill cancer cell . This study evaluate activity , safety CNS exposure G-202 patient recurrent progressive GMB receive G-202 intravenous infusion three consecutive day 28-day cycle .
