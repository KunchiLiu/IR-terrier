	<brief_summary>An exploratory `` Fit &amp; Function '' study Continuous Real Time ( CRT ) ShuntCheck , non-invasive method monitoring change cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) shunt flow hydrocephalus patient . The device test 10 pediatric patient ( Johns Hopkins Hospital ) 10 adult patient ( LifeBridge Health ) result use optimize device design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CRT ShuntCheck `` Fit &amp; Function '' Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An exploratory `` Fit &amp; Function '' study Continuous Real Time ( CRT ) ShuntCheck , non-invasive method monitoring change CSF shunt flow hydrocephalus patient . This study gather information refine design CRT ShuntCheck sensor . Our Aim I product work yield clinic-ready prototype adheres well human skin , conforms curve surface clavicle provide safe level skin cool extended period time . Many clinical us CRT involve patient movement - stand investigate suspect overdrainage , simple fidget child undergo monitoring . The Aim II Fit Function test importantly identify movement-related product performance issue . If identify cause `` signal noise '' , modify sensor design make less susceptible `` motion artifact '' . Additionally test identify age/size specific issue - sensor small enough use young child , loose skin old adult generate move motion artifacts signal . These study include 10 pediatric 10 adult asymptomatic patient willing undergo CRT ShuntCheck test one hour period . Test result use guide patient care test interfere delay patient test care .</detailed_description>
