	<brief_summary>SAKK 21/12 stratify , multicenter Phase II first in-human trial transdermal CR1447 ( 4-OH-testosterone ) direct patient endocrine responsive-HER2neg TN-ARpos metastatic locally advance breast cancer . The trial conduct Switzerland max . 90 patient . CR1447 good safety tolerability profile combine two mechanism action , interaction AR aromatase enzyme may higher activity drug single mechanism might offer possibility non-chemotherapy base endocrine therapy limit treatment option TN-ARpos BC . Transdermal application CR1447 might advantage continuously release 4-OHT blood stream , thus omit first pas effect . In Phase II main objective ass activity determine efficacy tolerability CR1447 . Phase II consist two stratum , patient stratify accord hormonal receptor status : Stratum A patient endocrine responsive-HER2neg disease , regardless AR status Stratum B patient triple-negative determined ARpos disease . Patients triple-negative disease test negative AR exclude trial . In strata patient treat 400 mg CR1447 disease progression , patient ' wish physician ' decision end treatment . Biopsies one define metastatic lesion patient give inform consent perform baseline within third week treatment CR1447 . Measurement AR expression , expression downstream target ERα , ERβ , PR , AR , angiogenesis translational study describe protocol help confirm hypothesis increase benefit CR1447 due dual action , efficacy topical application , tolerability decide whether one proceed large randomize trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CR1447 Endocrine Responsive-HER2neg TN-ARpos Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer frequently diagnose cancer heterogeneous disease tumor categorization base molecular characteristic beyond currently use marker estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , HER2 , make tumor categorization treatment demand task . The treatment prevention relapse breast cancer mainly base I ) surgery primary tumor , II ) radiotherapy , III ) chemotherapy , IV ) endocrine therapy , V ) specific intervention . Although advance breast cancer therapy three four woman breast cancer cure , one four patient relapse present metastatic disease time first diagnosis hence incurable die disease . The endocrine responsive breast cancer define immunohistochemical detection ER ( estrogen receptor ) and/or PR ( progesterone receptor ) least 1 % tumor cell tissue sample variable degree offer possibility treatment use endocrine strategy 80 % patient . Endocrine responsive breast cancer may also express HER2 . The triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) define lack expression ER , PR , HER2 . The analysis make pathological tumor tissue sample . While ER PR , threshold less 1 % tumor cell express receptor , HER2 negativity define immunohistochemical score 0/1+ tumor score 0/1+ 2+ lack HER2 gene amplification situ hybridization . Approximately 15 % breast cancer find triple-negative . However , due biologically aggressive behavior tumor , patient group suffer type disease overrepresented within first five year initial diagnosis . Recently , androgen receptor ( AR ) target therapy gain new interest due fact AR abundantly express sex hormone receptor breast cancer ( approx . 70 % breast tumor ) , importantly , 20 % ( range 10 % 50 % depend respective reference ) triple-negative breast tumor . The threshold ARpos breast cancer &gt; 0 % tumor cell express AR . In addition , significant association find AR expression longer overall survival breast cancer patient . Androgens induce proliferative change breast cancer cell line , testosterone act tumor promoter several animal model breast cancer . Endocrine responsive breast cancer Anti-estrogen therapy include ovariectomy , remove primary source female sex hormone premenopausal woman , application luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists , decrease release LH prevent gonadal estrogen synthesis . These therapy induce postmenopausal status . The hormonal treatment choice premenopausal woman ER positive metastatic breast tumor use ER antagonist tamoxifen . Tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor , prevent final conversion androgen estrogens , main endocrine treatment option postmenopausal woman metastatic breast cancer . The persist estrogen level postmenopausal woman mainly due aromatase activity extragonadal source breast tissue , skeletal muscle adipose tissue . Thus , ER blockade tamoxifen inhibition estrogen synthesis inhibit growth signal breast cancer cell express ER . Aromatase , key enzyme estrogen production woman , express around breast tumor , ovary , skeletal muscle adipose tissue postmenopausal woman . Several aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) develop . The first generation aromatase inhibitor include testolactone aminogluthetimide replace potent second generation inhibitor fadrazole formestane ( 4-hydroxy-4-androstenedione , 4-OHA ) , later even potent third generation inhibitor exemestane , letrozole anastrozole . 4OHA exemestane steroidal AI irreversibly block aromatase non-steroidal AI letrozole anastrozole reversible inhibitor . Importantly , seem exist cross-resistance two aromatase inhibitor class , 4-OHA exemestane may still show efficacy relapse upon letrozole/anastrozole treatment . In summary , great demand novel improve therapeutic strategy , especially overcome resistance chemotherapy presently available endocrine therapy postmenopausal woman . While patient ER and/or PR positive tumor treat endocrine therapy patient HER2pos disease treatment direct HER2 trastuzumab , lapatinib , trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination therapy , endocrine target anti-HER2 directed therapy exist patient suffer triple negative disease . For patient , chemotherapy therapeutic option . Unfortunately , tumor tend aggressive quickly grow high relapse rate even intensive adjuvant chemotherapy . Due absence estrogen receptor , endocrine therapy base anti-estrogen intervention strategy must fail . There currently suitable treatment option patient metastatic triple-negative breast tumor whose disease fail respond chemotherapy . Thus , great demand novel improve therapeutic strategy patient group patient acquire resistance combat breast cancer . Testosterone already use extensively 1930s 1960s breast cancer treatment , anecdotal tumor response ( especially bone metastasis ) see 20 % treated woman . Side effect hirsutism aggressive behavior sign virilization treat woman evidence testosterone may easily convert estrogen body lead discontinuation use . CR1447 ( 4-hydroxytestosterone [ 4-OHT ] ) steroidal small molecule two distinct property , act steroidal aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) bind AR high affinity ( IC50 4.4 nM ) . In vitro study indicate human breast cancer cell line inhibit CR1447 growth express androgen receptor , knock AR abolishes effect . A significant proportion 4-OHT convert 4-OHA ( 4-hydroxyandrostenedione , formestane ) . In vivo 4-OHT 4-OHA , form redox system . 4-OHA 17-beta-oxidized isoform CR1447 . 4-OHA previously approve aromatase inhibitor treatment BC via intramuscular ( i.m . ) injection ( Formestane , Lentaron® ) injection , discontinue Novartis due development oral aromatase inhibitor . Unlike testosterone , compound , 4-OHA 4-OHT , converted estrogen vivo . Due high first pas effect oral dosing , 4-OHA administer parentally e.g . intramuscular injection . While regimen clinically effective , local side effect dose limit issue . A clinical feasibility study transdermally apply 4-OHA show significant amount 4-OHA absorbed skin . Intramuscular transdermally ( twice daily ) apply 4-OHA achieve comparable plasma level day 3 .</detailed_description>
