	<brief_summary>Clinical Retina research study often collect aqueous sample hop estimate level drug cytokine vitreous . Little known well vitreous aqueous correlate . This study collect vitreous aqueous sample time evaluate compare drug cytokine level . The overall objective study evaluate molecular concentration growth factor , cytokine chemokines human aqueous humor vitreous sample collect individual undergo par plana vitrectomy tractional retinal detachment secondary proliferative diabetic retinopathy , exudative tractional retinal detachment secondary macular degeneration , macular hole neovascular glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , pilot study intravitreally administer ranibizumab subject undergoing par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) repair tractional retinal detachment secondary proliferative diabetic retinopathy , exudative serous retinal detachment , macular hole neovascular glaucoma . Consented , enrolled subject eligible receive single open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer prior undergoing PPV Retinal Specialists opinion could benefit disease procedure ranibizumab therapy . The propose study analyze aqueous humor vitreous sample draw time vitrectomy evaluate level growth factor , cytokine chemokines patient undergo planned par plana vitrectomy part retinal care . For patient receive ranibizumab , serum sample also collect assess PK . Patients split three group base diagnosis : Group 1 : ( ranibizumab ) proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( tractional retinal detachment ) , macular degeneration exudative tractional retinal detachment , macular hole neovascular glaucoma . Group 1 may receive one injection intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5mg prior vitrectomy . The injection administer least 1-14 day prior vitrectomy . Group 2 serve control group receive intravitreal ranibizumab prior surgery . Aqueous humor , vitreous serum sample obtain measure compare growth factor , cytokine , chemokine level ranibizumab level ( receive ) . Undiluted core vitreous biopsy take start victrectomy . Aproximately 1 mL undiluted vitreous fluid obtain closed infusion line manual aspiration cut vitrectomy probe 2.5 mL syringe connect along aspiration line . The sample frozen immediately store -80°C . Approximately 100 microliters aqueous humor collect prior start vitrectomy anterior chamber paracentesis peripheral clear cornea use 27 gauge needle tuberculin microsyringe central papillary area . Aqueous transfer vial placed liquid nitrogen upon removal anterior chamber . Aqueous humor sample immediately frozen -80°C within 2 hour collection transfer outside laboratory analysis . Serum sample obtain patient Group 1 baseline ( Day 0 ) prior treatment intravitreal ranibizumab day surgery prior start vitrectomy . Serum sample process accord Genentech standard operating procedure sample frozen immediately -80C analysis ready begin .</detailed_description>
