	<brief_summary>Kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) naturally occur chemical brain . Studies rodent indicate level KYNA impact level neurotransmitter glutamate dopamine . One way reliably increase KYNA level ingest amino acid tryptophan . Tryptophan normal part human diet . Tryptophan get metabolized/changed chemical body- include KYNA . By give people 6 gram tryptophan , investigator able increase KYNA level control way . The investigator able study effect KYNA neurotransmitter use cognitive test magnetic resonance image technique ( measure brain activity brain chemistry use MRI magnet ) . They test people use tryptophan also use placebo look difference . The investigator test healthy control people schizophrenia look difference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There emerge evidence suggest disturbance kynurenine pathway may relate pathophysiology schizophrenia . Several post-mortem study document specific abnormality kynurenine pathway , include increase level kynurenine kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) prefrontal cortex people schizophrenia ( 1-4 ) . Increased level kynurenine KYNA also observe cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) people illness ( 5 ) . In addition , post-mortem study document change key enzyme , include increase expression tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase ( 2 , 6 ) ( TDO ) , convert tryptophan kynurenine , reduce activity kynurenine 3-monooxygenase ( KMO ) ( 4 ) , may shift metabolism towards enhance KYNA formation . Finally , number genetic study implicate KYNA pathway disease . Wonodi et al . ( 7 ) find decrease KMO gene expression frontal eye field people schizophrenia , Holtze et al . ( 8 ) recently report association KMO SNP CSF level KYNA . Notably , although exact mechanism underlie KP impairment people schizophrenia unknown , immune stress mechanism implicate ( 7,9 ) . Increased KYNA may number adverse consequence importance schizophrenia . In particular , KYNA antagonist α7 nicotinic NMDA glutamate receptor . Dysfunctions receptor link cognitive impairment symptom manifestation observe people schizophrenia . The purpose propose project examine impact increase brain KYNA performance cognitive task related neuroimaging measure people DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia , schizophreniform , schizoaffective disorder patient healthy control . In addition , investigator secondarily investigate relationship peripheral inflammatory marker glucocorticoid level part HPA stress axis examine relationship shift Type 2 immune response schizophrenia . Using tryptophan load increase KYNA level , study test hypothesis , base complementary preliminary study rodent , disease-related cognitive deficit people schizophrenia preferentially susceptible ( ) elevation KYNA level . The investigator hypothesize tryptophan-induced elevation brain KYNA level : 1 ) acutely impair performance measure verbal visual memory , attention , work memory , process speed people schizophrenia ; 2 ) alter dorsolateral-hippocampal activation connectivity , underlies performance relational memory task ; 3 ) decrease mPFC MRS measure glutamate , consistent preclinical microdialysis data . In exploratory framework , investigator hypothesize increased brain KYNA level alter default network activation connectivity , effect may mediate action KYNA α7 nicotinic and/or NMDA receptor . The investigator also investigate extent cytokine HPA axis peripheral measure related effect tryptophan-induced elevate KYNA level cognitive performance fMRI MRS measure . Comparisons result healthy control determine participant schizophrenia aberrant exaggerated response increase KYNA level .
