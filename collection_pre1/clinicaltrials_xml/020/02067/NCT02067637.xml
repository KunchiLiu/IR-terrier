	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To compare marker ovarian reserve cancer survivor healthy control . Hypothesis : Cancer survivor low serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone ( AMH ) antral follicle count ( AFC ) , high Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) healthy control . Specific Aim 2 : To compare cardio-metabolic , endocrine bone profile cancer survivor control use combination anthropometric measure , fast serum marker , urinary marker bone health . Hypothesis : Cancer survivor higher total cholesterol lower 25-OH vitamin D healthy control . Specific Aim 3 : To evaluate potential association ovarian reserve marker metabolism , obesity , tumor bone health young female cancer survivor . Hypothesis : As BMI total cholesterol increase , serum AMH decrease . Specific Aim 4 : To compare quality life marker , assess validated instrument , cancer survivor control use recommend score technique . Hypothesis : Cancer survivor low quality life marker compare control . The investigator conduct prospective study characterize quality life cardio-metabolic , endocrine , bone profile female cancer survivor use combination anthropometric , serum , urinary , ultrasonographic marker combination QOL instrument .</detailed_description>
