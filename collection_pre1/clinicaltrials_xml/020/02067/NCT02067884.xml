	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography Measuring Response Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish quantitative prediction rule accurate early prediction pathologic tumor response assess post-surgery , use change contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) assess tumor size perfusion characteristic ( baseline ) 2-3 week follow initiation neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) . II . To assess agreement CEUS base classification rule pathologically determine treatment response ( baseline versus pre-surgical scan ) . III . To establish quantitative prediction rule accurate early prediction pathologic tumor response assess post-surgery , use change propagation velocity shear mechanical wave tissue ( baseline ) 2-3 week follow initiation NAC . IV . To assess agreement shear wave elastography ( SWE ) base classification rule pathologically determine treatment response ( baseline versus pre-surgical scan ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore role combine CEUS + SWE feature obtain early treatment phase ( 2-3 week follow initiation NAC ) , accurately predict pathologically determine tumor response . II . To investigate agreement assessment therapy response NAC CEUS versus contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( CE MRI ) SWE versus CE MRI baseline versus pre-surgery scan identify discordant case use scatter plot contingency table . OUTLINE : Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image shear wave elastography baseline , 2-3 week initiation chemotherapy , surgery .</detailed_description>
