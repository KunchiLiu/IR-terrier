	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Abatacept Patients With Primary Sjögren 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Primary Sjögren 's syndrome ( pSS ) chronic inflammatory lymphoproliferative disease autoimmune feature . pSS characterise progressive lymphocytic infiltration exocrine gland , notably lacrimal salivary gland . The main clinical feature progressive dryness eye , mouth , vagina skin . Furthermore , various extraglandular manifestation may develop restrict fatigue common . Patients may restrict activity participation society , result reduce health-related quality life impair socioeconomic status . The latter result low employment rate disability compare general population . The estimated prevalence pSS general population 0.5-2 % , make pSS , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , common systemic autoimmune disease . Most traditional anti-rheumatic drug use RA systemic lupus erythematosus try pSS limited result . Currently , biological agent introduce various systemic autoimmune disease . These biological agent enhance replace conventional immunosuppressive therapy . In contrast RA systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , biological agent yet approve treatment pSS . Abatacept fully human soluble co-stimulation modulator selectively target CD80/CD86 : CD28 co-stimulatory signal require full T-cell activation , T cell dependent activation B-cells . We recently show phase II open label study Abatacept treatment pSS patient promise efficacy result , reflect significant decrease disease activity indices EULAR Sjögrens Syndrome Disease Activity Index Patient Reported Index ( ESSDAI ESSPRI ) ( Meiners et al. , 2014 ) . Importantly , also show Abatacept safe side effect limit pSS patient . For reason large randomize clinical trial Abatacept warrant . Objective : Primary : evaluate efficacy weekly subcutaneous ( SC ) administration Abatacept vs placebo disease activity assess ESSDAI patient pSS . Secondary : ass efficacy Abatacept clinical , functional , laboratory , subjective , histological parameter 48 week patient pSS . To evaluate safety abatacept , monitor serious adverse event ( SAE ) , adverse event ( AE ) relate SAE AE , treatment discontinuation relate SAE AE , lab abnormality 48 week patient pSS . Exploratory : ass efficacy laboratory parameter 48 week patient pSS . Study design : The first stage 24-week randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III study ass efficacy safety Abatacept ( weekly SC administration 125 mg Abatacept placebo ) patient pSS . The primary endpoint ( ESSDAI ) evaluate 24 week . The second stage compose 24-week open-label period Abatacept placebo treat patient receive Abatacept 24 week . The total study duration 48 week study open . Study population : 88 adult pSS patient Intervention : Weekly subcutaneous administration 125 mg Abatacept 48 week . Main endpoint : The primary endpoint difference ESSDAI score Abatacept placebo group 24 week . Secondary endpoint clinical , functional , laboratory , subjective , histological parameter prevalence adverse event , treatment discontinuation laboratory abnormality .</detailed_description>
