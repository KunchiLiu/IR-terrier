	<brief_summary>This study compare toric intra-ocular lens ( IOL ) limbal relax incision ( LRI ) correct astigmatism patient undergo standard cataract surgery . Astigmatism unequal curvature eye ; eye oval rather spherical . Uncorrected astigmatism great approximately 0.75 diopter ( D ) cause visual blurring , ghost image halo . Over 20 % patient undergoing cataract surgery astigmatism likely correct spectacle . Cataract surgery involves replacement natural opacify crystalline lens clear artificial plastic intra-ocular lens ( IOL ) . The lens power select correct patient 's glass prescription . The widely use IOLs correct glass one distance i.e . either near distance . Residual astigmatism cataract surgery need glass correction undesirable many patient . Limbal relax incision ( LRI ) circumferential partial thickness cut clear window eye ( cornea ) surgery . These LRIs correct corneal astigmatism additional risk complication . Alternatively , toric IOLs available correct astigmatism inside eye . They available routine use last year ; technology markedly improve lenses become cheap . Studies suggest toric IOLs provide good vision cataract surgery regular IOLs . Toric IOL widely use private practice increasingly National Health Service ( NHS ) . LRIs cost effective treat astigmatism however predictability believe low toric IOLs . As randomised control trial compare outcome LRIs toric IOLs . This research address gap knowledge accordingly research future practice able provide treatment patient information best outcome .</brief_summary>
