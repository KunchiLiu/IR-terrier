	<detailed_description>Ingrown toenail common among adolescent young adult big toe commonly affect . The exact incidence unknown . An ingrown toenail occur nail traumatizes surround skin , result swell , infection , generation granulation tissue . This cycle cause nail embed even surround tissue , lead additional swell infection . Many treatment propose condition . Non-surgical option include soak , wear loose shoe , antibiotic , specialized brace . While treatment often provide short-term symptomatic relief , many people ingrown toenail eventually need surgery . The common surgical treatment wedge excision ( removal ingrown part nail ) . Most clinician perform partial matricectomy time ( destruction part underlie nailbed chemical surgical instrument ) . This prevent recurrence ( toenail becomes ingrown ) . The rate recurrence wedge excision matricectomy report 12-50 % . An alternative surgical technique Vandenbos procedure , skinfold excise allow heal secondary intention period approximately 6 week . This approach theoretically involve pain , high risk post-operative bleeding ( initially open wound ) , long recovery time . Proponents technique argue short-term morbidity justify give low rate recurrence excellent long-term result . The original case series publish Vandenbos 1959 find recurrence rate 0 % . Two recent case series publish doctor Ontario report finding , unclear many patient series lose follow-up . Other study report positive result recurrence rate 7-20 % . Thus , true effectiveness procedure remain unclear . Furthermore , high quality evidence support one technique . Even recent Cochrane review 24 randomize control trial could reach definitive conclusion procedure ( among surgical option ) effective . Previous trial show significant heterogeneity none assess Vandenbos procedure specifically . As result , many clinician continue use wedge excision matricectomy .</detailed_description>
