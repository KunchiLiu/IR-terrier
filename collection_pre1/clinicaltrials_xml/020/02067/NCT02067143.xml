	<brief_summary>This study conduct different centre study adult patient Philadelphia chromosome-negative ( Ph- ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . The study treatment include induction/consolidation therapy incorporate pegylated Asparaginase ( Peg-ASP ) lineage-targeted high-dose methotrexate plus antileukemic drug , achievement early negative minimal residual disease ( MRD ) status . The MRD study support risk/MRD-oriented final consolidation phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim clinical study adult ALL improve , risk category , overall disease-free survival relation achievement early MRD negative status follow induction/consolidation Peg-ASP , lineage-targeted methotrexate infusion disease-specific therapeutic element , without application allogeneic autologous SCT depend risk class MRD study result . A survey severe infection occur along entire chemotherapy stem cell transplant program 2 year achievement CR perform aim increase knowledge complication evaluate impact antileukemic program long term outcome underlying malignancy . The prospective survey severe infection perform ancillary observational objective present study .</detailed_description>
