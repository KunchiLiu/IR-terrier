	<brief_summary>This study propose conduct non-interventional , multi-center trial look C-peptide result one two Mixed Meal Tolerance Tests ( MMTT ) participant receive anti-CD3 treatment placebo Abate ITN027AI trial . Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody humanize antibody commonly use prevent organ rejection . It give order determine whether anti-CD3 mAb treatment halt progression newly diagnose type 1 diabetes . The overall hypothesis study less change c-peptide level previously treat group versus control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose conduct non-interventional multi-center trial look C-peptide result one two Mixed Meal Tolerance Tests ( MMTT ) participant receive anti-CD3 treatment placebo Abate ITN027AI trial . The first subject go trial late 2005 last subject enrol 2009.The mixed meal tolerance test coincide approximately 4 year 6 year post ITN027AI study completion participant . Those participant , complete ITN027AI study 2007 2008 , single MMTT . We plan enroll approximately 77 subject 5 site previously active ITN027AI.. Both drug treat control group participant invite participate . Along Yale University sit include , University California-San Francisco , University Colorado-Barbara Davis , Benaroya Research Institute , Pacific Northwest Research Institute -University Washington . The investigator sit ask contact patient originally ITN027AI study . Subjects contact via email phone see would interest participate Abate follow-up study . Eligible participant come Yale University Church St. Research Unit participate ITN study site either 1 2 mixed meal tolerance test determine current c-peptide status . The available site participant go include : Yale University , University California-San Francisco , University Colorado-Barbara Davis Center , Benaroya Research Institute Pacific Northwest-University Washington . This first visit consist follow : explanation study , assessment inclusion/exclusion criterion documentation inform consent . If subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , complete medical history obtain , physical examination include vital sign , urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential assessment concomitant medication . The subject Mixed Meal Tolerance Tests ( MMTT ) possible 2nd MMTT C-Peptide glucose measurement year later base long since ITN027AI Study.The subject also 4 hour urine collection C-peptide creatinine MMTT . If repeat MMTT do year later another 4 hour urine sample MMTT collect C-peptide Creatinine measurement .</detailed_description>
