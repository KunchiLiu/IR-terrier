	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research evaluate outcomes tumor response early stage non-small lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient undergo Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) use four dimensional ( 4D ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Computed Tomography ( CT ) , Cone-Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) , Real-Time Position Management ( RPM™ ) body immobilization system ( see figure 1 ) . Specifically , effect image-guided SBRT treatment clinical tumor response rate , local control progression-free survival study . This study examine target volume relevant margin determine assessment use 4D PET repeat 4D CT . These data allow u evaluate determine impact body immobilization system plan target volume ( PTV ) margin , patient 's breathing pattern , target motion , inter-treatment target shift .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient must age 18 year . Histologic confirmation primary NSCLC lung tumor must complete prior SBRT treatment . The following stage NSCLC patient would eligible study : Stage I : T1 N0 M0 T2 N0 M0 ( Size ≤ 5 cm ) Stage II : T3 N0 M0 ( Chest wall invasion , Size ≤ 5 cm ) Staging Tumor size characteristic : determine PETCT scan Nodal disease : Patients chest CT scan demonstrate hilar mediastinal node &lt; 1cm and/or PET negative would consider N0 disease . Patients hilar mediastinal node &gt; 1 cm PET scan negative may consider N0 disease . If PET scan demonstrate suspicious uptake abnormal uptake , patient would eligible , direct biopsy ( mediastinoscopy , Chamberlein procedure modality transbronchial biopsy , CT guide biopsy ) negative . Metastases : Evaluated PETCT scan biopsy indicate The patient must ECOG/Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . In order consider medicallyinoperable , patient must meet least one major criterion meet minimum 2 minor criterion describe . MAJOR CRITERIA : FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict postoperative FEV1 &lt; 40 % DLCO &lt; 50 % predict postoperative DLCO &lt; 40 % Exercise induce maximal exercise oxygen consumption ( MVO2 ) &lt; 15 ml/kg/min Thoracic surgery consultation obtain Board Certified Thoracic surgeon collaboration radiation oncologist determine patient medically operable This criterion would mandatory MINOR CRITERIA : Age &gt; 80 Pulmonary hypertension ( define pulmonary artery systolic pressure great 40mm Hg ) Oxygen requirement ( use Medicare criterion home oxygen requirement [ i.e. , room air oxygen saturation 88 % less ] ) Congestive heart failure ( three follow must document : dyspnea , peripheral edema , chest xray interstitial edema cardiomegaly , rale , congestion ) Poor leave ventricular function ( define ejection fraction 40 % less ) Severe cerebral ( CVA recent TIA ) severe peripheral vascular disease Diabetes Mellitus severe organ damage EndStage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) , Blindness , Vascular disease . CBC , Diff platelet , Comprehensive metabolic panel within 28 day registration meeting follow criterion leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( hemoglobin may support transfusion erythropoietin approve hematopoietic growth factor ) platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Females childbearing age must use reliable form birth control . The patient must provide sign dated write informed consent PRIOR registration prior undergoing studyrelated procedure . The patient must provide write authorization allow use disclosure protect Health information . Conditions Patient Ineligibility The patient 's weight exceed tolerance institution 's imaging treatment platform/couch . The patient receive thoracic radiation therapy region current SBRT plan treatment area . The patient complete chemotherapy within 30 day treatment . T2 : Tumor size &gt; 5 cm , T3 tumor ( except T3 virtue chest wall invasion ≤ 5cm ) , T4 tumor . Presence N1 , N2 N3 disease per previously describe criterion would also exclude . Pancoast tumor would exclude . Current distant metastatic disease ( M1 ) ( preferably biopsy proven ) . The patient female childbearing potential refuse obtain serum pregnancy test prior initiation treatment . The patient pregnant female nursing infant . The patient plan undergoing systemic therapy within 2 week last fraction radiation The patient active systemic pulmonary infection .</criteria>
