	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer well cervical preneoplastic abnormality ( CIN2+ ) cause human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection . These abnormality historically detect cervical cytology , recent evidence show HPV test superior cytology detect cervical lesion eventually progress cancer . Despite evidence , conventional cytology ( Pap ) remain primary screen test Colombia HPV test recommend triage test woman atypical squamous cell undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) setting around world . Women ASC-US low risk CIN2+ high healthy population , therefore important provide appropriate clinical management . However , consensus deal woman ASC-US therefore still three strategy purpose : 1 ) immediate colposcopy , 2 ) repeat conventional cytology 6 12 month 3 ) HPV test . The main objective study compare effectiveness efficient among strategy well evaluate acceptability HPV test real-life setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study compare effectiveness efficiency immediate colposcopy ( IC ) , repeat conventional cytology 6 12 month ( RC ) HPV triage ( HPV ) ( QIAGEN-The digene HPV TestÂ® ) clinical management woman ASC-US insure healthcare management organization ( HMO ) within Colombian health security system . This study randomize 2,661 20-69 year old woman ASC-US , insured HMOs Medellin-Colombia 3 arm : IC , RC HPV . All woman schedule visit 2 year recruitment include HPV-test/cytology colposcopy either HPV+ ( RLU &gt; =1 ) abnormal cytology ( &gt; =ASC-US ) . This colposcopy perform trained colposcopist woman followed-up accord well-defined algorithm . The few high-grade cervical neoplasia ( CIN2+ ) rate end follow determine effective arm . The efficiency arm reach major effective minimum resource ( cytology , colposcopies histology ) consume . The resource consume retrieved HMOs . This study also pretend evaluate acceptability HPV testing . This study allow u know within Colombian health security system , HPV test remain superior repeat cytology and/or inmediate colposcopy demonstrate randomize controlled trial carry outside setting .</detailed_description>
