	<detailed_description>Vulvar cancer rare disease , strike 2 3/100,000 woman annually . Dissemination vulvar cancer predominantly lymphatic ; contiguous invasion also occur , though much less frequently , whereas hematogenic dissemination quite rare , especially absence lymphatic spread . Approximately 25 % - 35 % patient early stage disease metastasis . The standard treatment initial stage consist radical excision vulvar tumor uni- bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy . The latter procedure necessary , non-removal lymph node , even disease seem undetectable node , may fatal . Treatment effectiveness good , likelihood recurrence disease inguinal-femoral lymph node 1 % - 10 % . The determinant prognosis lymph node metastasis , tumor size stage , depth tumor invasion , lymphovascular involvement . In locally advanced stage disease , involvement inguinal-femoral lymph node chain consistently demonstrate important predictive factor survival patient . In last 30 year , change surgical treatment , separate incision performance inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy vulvectomy , preservation saphenous vein , conservative excision primary vulvar lesion , reduce morbidity . Despite advance surgical treatment , postoperative complication still paramount . The locally advanced disease generates great morbidity It involve urethra , anus , rectum , wide resection , urinary derivation , even pelvic exenteration require order obtain adequate surgical margin . Such procedure entail mutilation patient also high morbidity rate . A concomitant chemotherapy radiotherapy ( CT-RT ) regimen advocate patient purpose downsize initial disease , thereby enable less mutilating complementary surgical treatment . A study Gynecologic Oncology Group use preoperative chemoradiation combine cisplatin / 5-fluouracil stage III IV patient . After treatment , 2 ( 3 % ) 71 patient remain residual disease show sign shrink . A study use data 63 patient advanced vulvar cancer ( stage III IV ) underwent either surgery ( 30 patient ) first CT-RT follow surgery ( 33 patient ) , compare disease-free interval survival recurrence rate disease . The patient receive CT-RT treatment surgery young large vulvar growth less lymph node metastasis . An important point positive lymph node rate patient prior surgery 83 % initially treat surgery 54 % treat CT-RT plus surgery . This show , advanced case , CT-RT reduce mass positive lymph node , disease persist 50 % patient original site . Thus , excision lymph node necessary obtain much control disease possible . As inguinal-femoral lymph node status important prognostic factor vulvar cancer , crucial ass lymph node condition prior therapy order select best approach strategy disease . At present , non-invasive technique detection lymph node metastasis insufficiently accurate.The low accuracy non-invasive technique detect inguinal-femoral lymph node , importance diagnosis lymph node metastasis patient vulvar cancer early stage , lymphadenectomy morbidity open way development minimally invasive technique , sentinel lymph node biopsy . Most advantage accrue adoption sentinel lymph node biopsy relate less morbidity mortality surgical procedure reduce aggressiveness . Nevertheless , desire information concern metastatic potential primary tumor gain . In case malignancy , breast cancer melanoma , sentinel lymph node false negative rate low ( 0 % -29 % ; 7.3 % mean ) .A multicentric study analyze 403 patient early-stage vulvar cancer ( tumor 4 cm ) show sentinel lymph node excision safe surgical procedure . A total 259 patient negative sentinel lymph node merely kept observation surgery . Recurrence inguinal region 2.5 % survival rate 3-year span 97 % . For patient positive sentinel lymph node , systematic inguinal-femoral lymph node excision perform . These patient benefit high accuracy rate identification micro-metastases predictive value close 100 % . A multicentric , observational study ( GROINSS-V ) subsequent study Van der Zee et al . examine evidence 403 patient determine relationship metastasis size sentinel lymph node metastasis risk non-sentinel lymph node disease-free survival early-stage vulvar cancer . It impossible establish cutoff point likelihood non-sentinel lymph node metastasis would close zero , thus insignificant . What find , though , large spread sentinel lymph node , great probability lymph node metastasize . Besides , size sentinel lymph node large 2 mm , prognosis bad . The present study main purpose outline new strategy vulvar cancer treatment , combine sentinel lymphoscintigraphy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery way yet untested . Objectives : Analysis complete pathological response patient anatomicopathologic diagnosis invasive vulva cancer , ( stage II IVa - FIGO ) , treat surgery , chemiotherapy radiotherapy follow proposal : nodal debulking groin , chemoradiation vulvectomy . Materials method : Patient enrollment : Twenty one consecutive patient Outpatient Clinic Gynecological Oncology , Cancer Institute , São Paulo State ( ICESP ) diagnosis vulvar carcinoma ( early advance stage ) study long agree participate sign inform consent statement . All patient tumor 4 cm great diameter , uncompromised urethra anus , lymph node small 15 mm great diameter scan image consider early-stage case . Any case deem advanced . In first phase include 21 patient . If seven complete clinical pathological response ( patient underwent surgical biopsy surgical excision primary tumor site ) , study continue inclusion 30 patient . Preoperative evaluation : Biopsy anatomicopathologic , exam vulvar lesion , MRI pelvis vulvar region . Clinical evaluation surgical risk assessment : Patients early-stage tumor : After sentinel lymph node analysis , patient early-stage tumor undergo systematic uni- bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy . In addition , intraoperative frozen-section examination sentinel lymph node ( ) conduct . On eve surgery , peritumoral infusion make dextran-70 marked technetium-99 ( radiopharmaceutical Nuclear Medicine Service , Radiology Institute , School Medicine , USP ) , volume 0.1 ml per injection point ( 0.3 millicurie technetium syringe ) total activity 1.2 mCi 4 point . Following injection peritumoral infusion , patient undergo lymphoscintigraphy day order locate record inguinal lymph node mark radioactive substance . On next day , patient inject patent blue infusion peritumoral area immediately inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy . With aid gamma-probe ( endoprobe model 2002 , France ) , supposedly compromise lymph node remove first others . Finally , excision perform margin around primary vulvar lesion . After identification excision , sentinel lymph node dispatch intraoperative anatomicopathologic exam classify positive , negative , suspicious neoplastic cell . It handle immediately excision , isolate , subjected transverse cut 1.5-mm-intervals . All fragment embed paraffin , cross-sectioned obtain 3- µm-thick cut , stain hematoxylin eosin . initial section every paraffin block test negative , lymph node additionally submit serial cut 50- µm-intervals 6th level . From interval fragment block , 2 section take , one stain hematoxylin eosin mount silane-coated slide , immunohistochemical analysis . The initial section block transverse cut lymph node 1.5-mm-intervals immunohistochemically examine detection cytokeratins anion exchanger 1 3 ( clone AE1/AE3 , Dako ) . If sentinel lymph node disease-free , surgical procedure continue resection vulvar lesion leave 1-cm-wide margin least ( ideal margin=2 cm ) reach deep plane . An intraoperative anatomicopathologic evaluation surgical margin also carry , patient exclude study . If sentinel lymph node test positive , case advanced-stage tumor , surgery stop time chemoradiation . Patients advanced-stage tumor : Patients advanced-stage tumor , superficial fascia incise , palpably enlarge node remove sent frozen section . If proven positive metastatic spread , groin dissection undertaken . If negative , full inguina-femoral lymphadenectomy perform , patient exclude study . After nodal debulking groin , patient receive cisplatin 40 mg/m2 week 7 week throughout radiotherapy , perform 45-50-Gy dose , 1.8 Gy/day , 5 time week . A dose reinforcement 5-10 Gy may give depend number compromise lymph node size extracapsular extension lesion . The presence obvious metastatic disease require inclusion inguinal lymphatic drain also pelvic drain ( even iliac lymphatics ) radiotherapy field . If reevaluation surgery , lesion show sign shrink , dose reinforcement 60 Gy 66 Gy total dose administer . Surgery - resection vulvar lesion 1-cm-margin least ( ideal margin = 2 cm ) include deep plane evaluation surgical margin mean intraoperative anatomicopathologic exam - perform 30-120 day end chemoradiotherapy . Data analysis : The follow data analyze : Perioperative data : % → Fisher 's test ; Immediate late complication ; Disease-free interval ; Survival .
