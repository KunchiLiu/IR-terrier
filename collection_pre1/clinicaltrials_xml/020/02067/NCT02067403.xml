	<brief_summary>Pressure support ( PS ) commonly use mode ventilation trigger base upon patient 's inspiratory effort . For part , pressure support well tolerated patient . However , trigger pressure support inspiratory effort patient , result support constant , ventilator response `` sync '' patient 's need . The problem patient-ventilator asynchrony document large approximately one quarter patient require mechanical ventilation . Asynchrony associate increase abnormal work breathing ( WOB ) prolong duration mechanical ventilation . Diagnosing asynchrony bedside challenge . Electrical activation diaphragm ( Eadi ) record provide clinician accurate picture patient-ventilator synchrony may thus result decreased asynchrony decrease normalized work breathe patient . The purpose physiologic study evaluate role protocolized pressure support ventilation ( base upon Eadi ) comparison standard pressure support ventilation .</brief_summary>
