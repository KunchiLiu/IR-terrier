	<brief_title>Observational Prospective Study 2-chloroprocaine Hydrochloride 1 % Safety Intrathecal Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : Incidence neurological complication ( Transient Permanent complication ; e.g . transient neurological symptom , arachnoiditis , cauda equina syndrome ) .Two follow-up questionnaire foreseen , 24 h 7 day time spinal injection ( Tsp ) , gather possible neurological complication , particular attention Transient Neurological Symptoms ( TNS ) Cauda Equina Syndrome ( CES ) .Patients schedule elective surgery inform aim , procedure possible risk study ask sign inform consent form inclusion trial , day -14 day surgery ( visit 1 , Day 0 ) .This observational study plan collect data patient undergoing surgery intrathecal anesthesia chloroprocaine hydrochloride , primarily assess occurrence possible neurological adverse event ( particular attention TNS CES ) . The mandatory follow-up study 24 h 7 day ( -1/+2 ) anaesthesia . In case sign neurological complication , patient undergo medical visit hospital relevant specialist ( anaesthetist , surgeon , neurologist ) . In order characterise occur adverse event , complete analysis evaluation conduct , CT , MRI , Electromyography , etc . follow indication specialist . In case persistent neuropathy patient need accurately follow accord internal hospital procedure . In meantime , full screen patient 's clinical history together detailed analysis relevant variable , potentially related adverse event , carry . Therefore , physician take appropriate measure ensure safety patient , notably he/she follow outcome Adverse Events ( clinical sign , laboratory value , etc . ) return normal consolidation patient 's condition . In case Serious Adverse Event , patient follow clinical recovery complete laboratory result return normal , progression stabilize . The follow-up continue patient leave study .</detailed_description>
