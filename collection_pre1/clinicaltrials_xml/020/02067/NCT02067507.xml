	<detailed_description>The primary aim project increase HPV vaccine receipt rate among low-income , ethnic minority adolescent ( girl boys 9-17 year age ) Los Angeles County . We accomplish goal implement rigorously evaluate intervention multiple venue serve target population , include Los Angeles County Department Public Health ( LACDPH ) two large Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHCs ) . Our hypothesis : Primary hypothesis : 1 . The intervention group high rate HPV vaccine initiation follow-up compare control group . Secondary hypothesis : 2 . The intervention group high vaccine completion rate ( 3 dos ) follow-up compare control group . Recruitment Venue 1 : Los Angeles County Department Public Health . At LACDPH , multi-component intervention direct caregiver age-eligible adolescent ( 11-17 year ) include brief individually-tailored telephone education ( `` intervention script '' ) , referral clinic offering low cost/free vaccine , mailed brochure . The control group receive usual care standard Centers Disease Control Prevention HPV vaccine fact sheet . The study also seek characterize HPV relate knowledge , beliefs barrier target population , understand mediator ( e.g. , knowledge , barrier reduction ) moderator ( e.g. , acculturate ) intervention effect . Additional secondary hypothesis recruitment venue include : 1 . The intervention group high knowledge HPV vaccine control group . 2 . The intervention great effect acculturate less acculturated participant ( moderator effect ) . 3 . The intervention exert effect vaccine receipt increase knowledge reduce barrier ( mediator effect ) . This recruitment venue utilize two-arm time-randomized ( on-off ) control design ass effect multi-component intervention target mother father , increase HPV vaccine uptake among adolescent ( age 11-17 ) . Hotline user randomize intervention control condition alternate ( on/off ) weekly schedule . Eligible participant complete baseline telephone interview . Immediately follow baseline interview , participant call intervention week receive individually-tailored multi-component intervention , include tailor education clinic referral . A tailored print intervention also mail intervention participant . All participant re-contacted 3 month 9 month telephone follow-up interview . Control group participant receive intervention 9-month follow-up . Prior implementation study protocol , approximately 25-50 individual recruit pre-test baseline survey different language ( English , Spanish , Chinese , Armenian ) ensure baseline questionnaire similar content across language question clear participant . The protocol pre-testing baseline survey address . The study site enroll men woman diverse racial-ethnic background Office Women 's Health ( OWH ) woman 's health telephone hotline database .

Upon receive incoming call , operator first respond caller 's request use routine hotline protocol include screening income eligibility ( &lt; 200 % poverty ) county service . Following , operator invite caller screen study eligibility . Eligible participant ask complete baseline interview . Callers randomize intervention control condition alternate week ( on-off time randomize design ) ( Shadish 2002 ; Potter et al . 2009 ) . This randomization scheme select close consultation OWH ensure integrity randomization process minimize disruption routine hotline operation . The telephone intervention deliver immediately follow baseline telephone interview participant call intervention week . The intervention base health behavior framework ( HBF ) finding pilot study incorporate individual-level tailoring . The three segment telephone intervention include : 1 ) basic information HPV vaccine participant ; 2 ) individually-tailored information address participant 's primary concern regard vaccine ; 3 ) individually-tailored referral local clinic free/low cost vaccine available . Baseline interview ( 10-15 minute length ) conduct immediately follow eligibility screener verbal inform consent ( approved University California-Los Angeles [ UCLA ] LA County IRB ) , via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing System ( CATI ) . All eligible subject complete baseline interview receive brief ( &lt; 10 min ) 3 9 month follow-up telephone interview , use CATI System . Following 3-month telephone interview , half intervention participant receive `` booster '' intervention wherein repeat clinic referral procedure/language give intervention baseline . Intervention participant randomize `` booster '' `` booster '' condition base order complete baseline survey . Prior recruit participant study , pre-test English baseline survey well translated baseline survey 5-10 individual language ( Spanish , Chinese , Korean , Armenian ) group incorporate feedback satisfactory , comparable material develop language . Only comparable translate material develop implement baseline survey languages . The pre-testing process involve participant complete baseline survey would participant regular study protocol . Following completion baseline survey , participant ask series follow-up question regard 5-8 specific survey question . The follow-up question cover participant interpreted question , area could clarify , difficulty answer question . The specific 5-8 question ask decide pre-testing base participant respond survey pre-test . The baseline pre-testing subject recruit manner regular participant study except receive educational component follow-up survey . Instead ask end interpretation subset study question .
