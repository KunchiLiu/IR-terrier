	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate postoperative analgesic effect combine Saphenous nerve block Obturator nerve block local infiltration analgesia tissue around knee surgery knee replacement . In combined nerve block use mixture Bupivacaine , Adrenaline , Clonidine Dexamethasone ( `` protract mixture '' ) local infiltration consist Ropivacaine , Adrenaline Toradol . Our hypothesis combine nerve block protract mixture prolongs block duration , reduce pain reduces need morphine thus reduce side effect nausea , vomit lethargy compare current treatment local infiltration analgesia . Background : Nerve block analgesic treatment orthopedic surgery recognize proven procedure . The nerve block disadvantage anesthetize sensory nerve fiber also nerve fiber muscle leg . The Saphenous nerve block cause stun sensory nerve knee region . The Obturator nerve block cause stun sensory nerve knee region thighs inward leading muscle , affect patient 's mobilization capacity . Both block know good addition analgesic treatment . Bupivacaine well-known local anesthetic . Adrenaline , Clonidine Dexamethasone also use study , addition local anesthetic agent , show prolong effect nerve block . Saphenous Obturator nerve block four drug Bupivacaine , Adrenaline , Clonidine Dexamethasone systematically investigate knee replacement surgery , know whether method provide good pain treatment . Method The patient receive one three treatment , determine randomly : - A. Saphenous Obturator nerve block active anesthetic ( Bupivacaine , Adrenaline , Clonidine , Dexamethasone ) local block around knee joint placebo medicine ( normal saline ) . - B. Saphenous block active anesthetic Obturator nerve block local block around knee joint placebo medicine ( normal saline ) . - C. Both block placebo medicine ( normal saline ) local block around knee joint effective local anesthetic . Neither patient , investigator staff around patient knowledge treatment patient receive . The block inject operation local infiltration around knee joint give surgeon operation .</brief_summary>
