	<brief_title>Family Nutrition Physical Activity Tool Use During Well Child Visits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Significance : Although much research aim prevent childhood obesity focus community , environment , school-based initiative , significant potential healthcare system primary care provider aid prevent obesity . All child , one-third overweight , multiple well-child acute encounter provider . Provider counsel regard Body Mass Index ( BMI ) strongly correlate parent 's perception child 's weight , parent perceive BMI health problem 10 time likely make healthy lifestyle changes.As result , practice intervention aim improving behavior change goal employ well-child encounter provide optimal opportunity physician impact family lifestyle behavior hopefully reduce trajectory obesity rate patient population . To knowledge , little publish evidence regard use validate , brief , screen coaching tool pair MI-enhanced conversation related obesigenic behavior health supervision visit . The propose project , practice-based intervention pair Brief Action Planning ( BAP ) focus target obesigenic behavior identify Family Nutrition Physical Activity ( FNPA ) tool , address many barrier exist current practice approach enable provider implement focus conversation establish realistic behavior change goal . The study bring primary care provider forefront obesity prevention allow patient direct path behavior change . The intervention include patient-centered approach proven feasible acceptable among provider patient . The potential impact project increase provider patient collaboration goal-setting , result reduction obesigenic behavior . Evidence investigation give provider specific feasible method counsel behavior associate obesity . Procedures : Practice Recruitment : For 3 month , practice recruitment meeting hold office three healthcare network research protocol explain , roles responsibility research staff practice outline , write agreement sign . At baseline , practice complete practice provider demographic questionnaire characterize baseline procedures documentation practice relate obesity prevention well previous provider training obesity prevention MI ( questionnaire available request ) . Practices match randomly assign . Practice training : Practitioners four-month period undergo three 1.5-hour training session learn principle MI BAP get familiar use FNPA tool . Research staff trainer license clinical professional counselor ( LCPC ) certify BAP lead training . A PhD psychologist researcher develop curriculum oversee trainer . Competency measure successful certification BAP encounter correctly interpret three FNPA tool . Trained research staff teach office staff correct technique anthropometrics FNPA score . Competency measure three accurate measurement correct score three FNPA tool . Scales stadiometers enrol practice calibrate consistency measurement across site . Subject Recruitment : Subject recruitment occur one month implementation . Eligible subject schedule well-child visit receive letter sign provider PI ( Amy Christison , MD ) . The letter briefly describe study offer opportunity enroll . They give opt-out phone number call within one week mail letter want participate . If research coordinator receive call , he/she contact family phone answer question send consent form family . The subject consider enrol obtain sign write consent family . Implementation Period : The FNPA tool routinely use health supervision visit implementation practice 6 month , regardless patient enrol . During schedule well child visit , treatment group practice implement FNPA tool use BAP . Parents/guardians patient , age 4 11 , ask answer FNPA child questionnaire , patient , age 12 17 , parent answer FNPA adolescent questionnaire . The practice staff score , provider 1 ) engage family patient-centered discussion patient 's body mass index ( BMI ) percentage ,2 ) discuss healthy obesigenic behavior identify tool , 3 ) mutually decide goal change , 4 ) determine patient 's confidence change , 5 ) offer follow-up phone appointment regard state goal , 6 ) offer follow-up appointment focus counsel patient identify overweight obese per American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommendation . Goals follow-up plan document FNPA tool , copy give family retain chart . For healthy weight child , follow-up phone call chosen , implemented time select patient clinical research staff train BAP lack support staff particular site call confound variable . Control group practice provide usual well-child care per AAP recommendations.Their patient complete FNPA assessment questionnaire directly appointment purpose compare baseline end point measure . Importantly , approach prevents possibility provider comment result . Both treatment control group parents/guardians patient attend appointment provide demographic data include parent-reported parent weight height , income range . Age , sex , patient calculate BMI z-score abstract medical record . Outcomes Measurement Procedures : 1 . Treatment group patient rate impression FNPA tool end appointment . If patient adolescent ( 12 year old ) , patient attend parent complete survey . Parents young child complete survey patient . 2 . A research assistant blind treatment group perform phone survey . At 1 month , patient group ask rate patient center encounter . Behavior change survey perform 1 month 6 month follow encounter . 3 . All subject ask return practice weight height measurement 6 month initial encounter fill second FNPA tool . This perform un-blinded research staff use blind set would feasible . 4 . Audit chart regard goal set documentation , successful identification overweight obese patient , compliance recommend follow-up appointment perform group . 5 . Treatment group provider baseline two random encounter audio record midway end intervention period . They score fidelity BAP-approach train blind coder . This do understand effectiveness BAP training provider . They also receive feedback coding result give refresher need . Control group providers one baseline encounter record scored fidelity comparison treatment group provider . 6 . Providers survey regard satisfaction FNPA intervention end 6-month intervention time . Analysis : Analysis do Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) 9.3 late version . A significance level p &lt; =0.05 accept significant . Descriptive statistic ( mean , median , mode , range ) examine data set clean . To compare two study group univariate analysis , t-tests compute interval variable , Mann-Whitney U ordinal variable , Chi-square nominal variable . Generalized Linear Mixed Models employ multivariate analysis repeat measure multi-level effect . Subjects drop lose follow-up compare complete subject difference related demographic , socioeconomic status , BMI .</detailed_description>
