	<brief_summary>In patient hereditary anemia ( e.g . thalassemia ) , defective red blood cell produce due error gene , DNA , provide instruction synthesis . As result , hereditary anemia characterize chronically low hemoglobin , contain inside red blood cell carry oxygen throughout body . In severe case , patient dependent frequent blood transfusion replenish hemoglobin . The body limited ability get rid excess iron . However , repeat blood transfusion , iron level body build red blood cell contain iron heme . Over time , high level iron accumulates organ heart , liver , pancreas cause heart problem , liver failure , diabetes . As result , patient receive multiple blood transfusion need monitor iron overload , start medical therapy timely fashion prevent organ damage . Liver usually first affected organ iron accumulation , knowledge iron concentration provide estimate total body iron load . Liver biopsy gold standard measure iron concentration liver , invasive perform routine basis . MRI another option ass liver iron concentration non-invasively , currently recommend monitoring iron load yearly basis . However , MRI high cost easily accessible Canada . The investigator aim determine transient elastography ( Fibroscan ) , form ultrasound measure liver stiffness , accurately assess liver iron concentration . Hypothesis : Fibroscan reading correlate MRI serum ferritin estimate hepatic iron concentration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criterion : All adult patient ( age 19 great ) hereditary anemia require chronic blood transfusion St. Paul 's Hospital invite participate study . The majority patient β-Thalassemia Major . They give pamphlet contain detail study contact research assistant clinic nurse information interested . Exclusion criterion : Patients know Hepatitis B positive , know Hepatitis C positive , know HIV positive , know liver cirrhosis , know primary liver disease Wilson 's disease hereditary hemochromatosis exclude study . Written consent obtain participant clinic nurse/research assistant prior enrollment . Study procedure : Data collect retrospectively patient chart ( St. Paul 's Hospital 's EMR/Sunrise Clinical Manager paper chart ) include : baseline demographic data ( age , gender , hematological condition ) , medical comorbidities complication related iron overload ( Diabetes , hypothyroidism , cardiomyopathy/arrhythmia congestive heart failure , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , osteopenia osteoporosis syndrome..etc ) , current medication include use iron chelators desferrioxamine , deferasirox , deferiprone combination therapy , viral hepatitis status ( B C ) date test , liver cirrhosis status ( stage ) , liver biopsy result ( iron concentration ) date procedure . Patients chronic transfusion requirement usually undergo annual MRI begin year estimate hepatic iron concentration per standard practice . This year ( 2013 ) , R2 MRI ( FerriScan ) also available first time patient BC part routine monitoring iron overload . Details/results technique ( i.e . image collect one scan , analyze differently use R2 T2* algorithm ) collect .</detailed_description>
