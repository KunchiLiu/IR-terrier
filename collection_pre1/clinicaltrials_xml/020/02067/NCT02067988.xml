	<detailed_description>Acronym : Holmium Embolization Particles Arterial Radiotherapy Plus 177Lu-dotatate Salvage NET patients- HEPAR PLUS-trial . Rationale : Patients gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour ( NET ) often die intrahepatic disease exclude liver-directed treatment extrahepatic disease . Adjuvant liver-directed treatment warrant control intra- extrahepatic disease . Objective : Primary objective : - To evaluate efficacy adjuvant 166Ho-radioembolization ( 166Ho-RE ) systemic 177Lu-dotatate non-comparative phase II study . - To establish safety toxicity profile adjuvant 166Ho-RE systemic treatment 177Lu-dotatate . Secondary objective : - To evaluate Quality Life ( QoL ) . - To evaluate biodistribution / dosimetry . Study design : Interventional , treatment , non-randomized , open label , non-comparative , phase II study . Study population : Patients liver metastasis NET include study ( n = 30-48 ) . These male female patient must age ≥18 year . All NET histology acceptable , provided standard therapeutic option available , chemotherapy surgery . Intervention : 166Ho-RE performed via catheter angiography . Study endpoint : Primary endpoint : - Tumour response 3 month . - Safety toxicity profile 166Ho-RE adjuvant treatment 177Lu-dotatate . Secondary endpoint : - Changes tumour marker . - Quality Life ( QoL ) . - Biodistribution / Dosimetry . Duration treatment : The study consist screen phase approximately 2 week follow treatment phase approximately 2-3 week . Patients follow liver specific tumour progression death occur , maximum 12 month . Methodology : A first cohort 30 patient treat 166Ho-RE . After first cohort , 3 additional cohort 6 patient treat 166Ho-RE . The total number patient treat HEPAR PLUS trial therefore least 30 48 patient , depend observed number response . Early termination response interim analysis ( 30 , 36 42 patient ) determine pre-defined boundary number observe response . The boundary favour treatment effect may cross 30 patient reach , study continue least 30 patient allow estimation key secondary endpoint . Number study center : Single center ( UMC Utrecht ) . Adverse event : All adverse event record throughout study . Inclusion period : January 2014 - January 2017</detailed_description>
