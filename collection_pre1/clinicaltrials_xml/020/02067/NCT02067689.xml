	<brief_summary>This study evaluate influence non-invasive brain stimulation different element cognitive function healthy person age 18-90 year . It specifically use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) evaluate relationship certain brain structure cognitive ability , like attention , work memory , visual search , etc .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Stimulation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research team conduct research procedure perform several test . Investigators ask participant participant right leave hand , far participant go school , job , medical history include brain nervous system disorder , psychiatric disorder , heart related disorder , significant disorder . Investigators ask participant current medication . Investigators ask participant history cognitive function . If participant woman child bear potential , Investigators perform pregnancy test result must negative receive stimulation . Prior stimulation , Investigators participant complete pre-stimulation computerized cognitive test involve task participant ask respond image sound presented computer . Investigators also collect measure physiological function test session , specifically heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance , respiration rate , pupillary response . These measure use record electrode attach fingertip , arm , chest respiration band around chest . A small camera record change pupil size . Investigators also collect measure brain structure function use magnetic resonance imaging . Investigators also ask participant fill questionnaire describe experience study session . If participant decide take part study , participant ask participate four different test session separate least 24 hour . In test session , participant ask receive either electrical stimulation placebo stimulation different test session . Placebo stimulation look like performed way electrical stimulation , stimulation stop effect . Placebo stimulation use research study show effect treatment compare receive low level stimulation nothing . Studies show , however , 1 3 person take placebo effect , short time . Participants know whether participant receive placebo stimulation electrical stimulation , information available need . In remainder description do , electrical stimulation placebo stimulation call `` stimulation . '' Stimulation complete Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator . This experimental device currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment . Participants receive stimulation 20 minute . To perform stimulation , Investigators either apply two salt-water soak sponge head five small gel cover disk electrode . Gel-covered disk electrode place specially design holder hold cap fit head . Caps fit head size comfort . Following stimulation , Investigators remove sponge electrode participant perform series computerize test assess cognitive ability . These involve task participant respond image sound presented computer screen headphone . Participants may also ask undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain , , undergo transcranial direct current stimulation . Investigators use MRI safe Transcranial Direct Current Stimulator perform stimulation evaluate brain respond stimulation . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure allow doctor look inside body use scanner sends strong magnetic field radio wave . This procedure use routinely medical care safe people , participant monitor entire MRI scan case problem occur . The risk MRI : The MRI scanner contain strong magnet . Therefore , participant may able MRI participant type metal implant body , example , pace device ( heart pacer ) , metal eye , certain type heart valves brain aneurysm clip . Someone ask participant question participant MRI . There much room inside MRI scanner . Participants may uncomfortable participant like close space ( `` claustrophobia '' ) . During procedure , participant able talk MRI staff speaker system , , event emergency , participant tell stop scan . The MRI scanner produce loud hammer noise , produce hearing loss small number patient . Participants give earplug reduce risk .</detailed_description>
