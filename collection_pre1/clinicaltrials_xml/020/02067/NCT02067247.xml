	<brief_title>Comparison BMD Measurement DEXA BeamMed Speed-of-Sound Measurement Forearm Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) current gold standard clinical diagnosis osteoporosis base measurement bone mineral density ( BMD ) [ Baim et al , 2006 ] . As DXA technology continue evolve , new instrument technology introduce [ Shepherd et al , 2005 ] , make necessary document advance compare prior densitometer . The purpose study ass bone mineral density ( BMD ) comparability precision use standard Hologic DXA unit quantitative ultrasound-driven speed-of-sound ( SOS ) BeamMed technology . The physical mechanical property bone measure SOS different bone density measure DXA reflect bone strength elasticity [ Goossens et al , 2008 ] . The cohort patient Gaucher disease [ Zimran &amp; Elstein , 2010 ] currently request undergo BMD evaluation bi-annually [ Mistry et al , 2011 ] , partly radiation DXA scan ( admittedly low relative standard X-rays CT ) . Patients Gaucher disease add risk osteonecrosis pathological fracture date biomarker technology able predict patient imminently risk . Because option disease-specific costly enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) [ Barton et al , 1991 ] predicate estimate risk severe disease , predict skeletal damage ( especially osteonecrosis femoral neck , FN ) osteopenia osteoporosis clinically relevant ramification [ Mistry et al , 2011 ] . Additionally , show correlation low BMD lumbar spine ( LS ) anemia patient Gaucher disease [ Khan et al , 2012 ] , correction anemia ERT hop amelioration BMD value , would worth perform close interval . The least inconvenient short evaluation BMD forearm . For approximately year , patient Gaucher disease DXA forearm evaluation undergo routine testing . It intention study prospectively compare forearm SOS result [ Olszynski et al , 2013 ] standard DXA equipment possibility use SOS quantitative measure bone integrity regular basis . The strategy measure forearm BMD DXA SOS BeamMed comparison accuracy comparability secondarily assess value achieve forearm relative standard DXA evaluation FN LS . Patients arrive Gaucher Clinic routine monitoring include DXA evaluation BMD FN , LS , forearm request consent undergo SunBeam evaluation forearm well . The DXA hardware software ( Hologic , Bedford , MA ) use examination employ Gaucher Clinic since August 2011 . The SOS technology develop BeamMed Company ( originally , Sunlight Ultrasound Technologies , Israel ) base physical property ultrasound wave travel faster bone soft tissue . The bone sonometer measure time elapse axially transmit sound generate inaudible high-frequency pulse acoustic signal center frequency 1.25 MHz first reception signal travel select bone . This record SOS m/sec . The ultrasonic wave transmit received transducer embed ultrasound probe . As ultrasound wave travel , speed , dispersion , attenuation signal influenced density , elasticity , cohesiveness medium , great density elasticity medium , fast speed propagation [ Ashman et al , 1984 ] . The device consist desktop main unit 3 probes different size . The small probe ( 1.4cm x 2.7cm x 11cm ) , 900-1000 KHz use study . Calibration perform day use standardized calibrating plastic provide company . The SOS determine mean 3 scan find statistically similar ( coefficient variation 1.2 % ) , calculate software provide device . Based 3 reading , 95th percentile measure SOS determine used statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
