	<detailed_description>Metastasis lead cause cancer relate death also one poorly understood aspect cancer progression . During metastatic outgrowth , cancer cell primary tumor locally invade surround tissue , undergoes intravasation enter hematogenous circulation translocates distant tissue extravasation , survive adapts foreign microenvironment lead formation macroscopic secondary tumor ( Figure 1 , Chaffer Weinberg ( 2011 ) ) . Several cancer therapy introduce last decade cytotoxics target agent . However , therapy fail modulate growth metastatic tumor cell often resistant , cancer patient succumb metastatic disease . There key need understand metastatic disease order develop new therapy . A central somewhat unaddressed question whether acquisition malignant traits occur inevitable consequence tumor progression accidental product thereof . A widely accept well proven model primary tumor formation suggest cancer cell acquire sequence genetic epigenetic alteration , confers one another form increase fitness . Figure 1 : The metastatic cascade . Metastasis envision process occurs two major phase : ( ) physical translocation cancer cell primary tumor distant organ ( ii ) colonization translocate cell within organ . ( A ) To begin metastatic cascade , cancer cell within primary tumor acquire invasive phenotype . ( B ) Cancer cell invade surround matrix toward blood vessel , intravasate enter circulation , serve primary mean passage distant organ . ( C ) Cancer cell travel circulation Circulating free DNA . They display property anchorage-independent survival . ( D ) At distant organ , Circulating free DNA exit circulation invade microenvironment foreign tissue . ( E ) At foreign site , cancer cell must able evade innate immune response also survive single cell ( small cluster cell ) . ( F ) To develop active macrometastatic deposit , cancer cell must able adapt microenvironment initiate proliferation . It somewhat accept tumor clonally derive unregulated growth single cell likely accumulate necessary number type heritable genetic genomic alteration . Despite monoclonal origin cancer , investigator see many tumor display large amount genetic , genomic signal heterogeneity . This heterogeneity also believe one main driver metastasis . This heterogeneity implications understanding disease progression landscape one hand diagnosis treatment decision . It therefore direct clinical importance study similarity difference primary tumor metastatic variant</detailed_description>
