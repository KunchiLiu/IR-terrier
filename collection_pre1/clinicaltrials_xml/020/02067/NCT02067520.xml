No randomized control study evaluate intrathecal ( IT ) hydromorphone post C/S pain . Methods : This randomize double-blind control trial utilize up-down sequential allocation method1,2 find best dose IT hydromorphone provide pain relief follow C/S .

	<detailed_description>SpecificAims Cesarean section ( C/S ) usually perform spinal anesthesia preservative free morphine add pain relief , currently investigator severe shortage formulation morphine . Hydromorphone narcotic use spinal acute postoperative pain relief pain pump relief chronic pain . The investigator hypothesize dose 25 200 mcg IT hydromorphone provide pain relief least 16 hour follow C/S , need minimal rescue medication , therefore may reasonable alternative IT morphine . Background Significance Cesarean section usually perform spinal anesthesia use bupivacaine . Intrathecal preservative free morphine often add decrease postoperative pain 12-24 hour need minor rescue medication ( significant intravenous oral opioid spar effect ) . This allow early mobilization interaction family/infant hypercoagulable patient . With critical shortage formulation morphine , must find alternative medication . Hydromorphone narcotic act peripherally centrally decrease pain . It use spinal anesthetic acute postoperative pain relief pain pump relief chronic pain . Currently hydromorphone approve intrathecal administration FDA , pain practitioner commonly prescribe hydromorphone intrathecal pump year . The recent Poly Analgesic Consensus Conference ( PACC ) 2012 include IT hydromorphone acceptable opioid chronic use . Its inclusion management neuropathic nociceptive pain infers hydromorphone 's relative neurologic safety , use much high dos cesarean section . The investigator review literature learn IT hydromorphone use post C/S pain relief , , dose . A retrospective chart review compare IT hydromorphone fentanyl C/S case report IT hydromorphone repeat C/S investigator found.3,4 No randomized control study exist . Our study find optimal dose IT hydromorphone pain relief follow cesarean section well delineate incidence severity side effect long drug last . This information critical viable alternative currently exist replace IT morphine capacity . Preliminary Studies/Progress Report The spinal anesthetic include IT hydromorphone perform competent anesthesia resident attending ( resident obstetric anesthesia service , principal investigator , one co-investigators ) . Our C/S rate 31 % 2100 delivery per year ( &gt; 80 % ) do spinal . Research Design Methods This randomize double-blind control trial utilize up-down sequential allocation method ( continual reassessment ) 1,2 find best dose IT hydromorphone provide pain relief follow C/S . Spinal anesthetic containing specify dose IT hydromorphone administer OR anesthesia resident attend . After consent obtain , first patient assign dose 200 mcg IT hydromorphone . Although dose IT hydromorphone equivalent IT morphine post cesarean section pain know , source suggest 50 - 100 mcg IT hydromorphone may similar 100 - 200 mcg IT morphine5-8 . After preliminary observation use vary dos IT hydromorphone post C/S analgesia , investigator observe average median morphine consumption follow 16 hour markedly decrease dose 200 mcg IT hydromorphone reach ( 40 observational patient date , increase side effect ) . The investigator use dose routinely labor delivery investigator choose start dose . The spinal anesthetic also include 15mg hyperbaric bupivacaine . All patient provide morphine patient control analgesia ( PCA ) pump post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) additional pain relief . At 4 , 8 , 12 24 hour follow C/S , patient rate pain , degree nausea , itch verbal numeric rating scale , ( pain : 0 - 10 , nausea itching : 0 - 5 ) investigator record incidence vomiting . These verbal numeric rating scale commonly use Thomas Jefferson patient use IV PCA pump postoperative pain . The investigator also obtain ( validate ) `` quality recovery scale '' patient . Standard nursing order include monitor respiratory rate every 1 hour 6 hour , every 2 hour 6 hour , sign respiratory depression , use pulse oximetry , administration naloxone need . These order currently standard patient receive IT preservative free morphine order set Jeff Chart . The PCA pump query next day evaluate number attempt actual use morphine first 16 hour postoperatively . The data compile analyzed statistician . Success define median dose less equal 1mg/hour morphine usage follow 16 postoperative hour . If patient determine success , next patient assign dose IT hydromorphone 10 mcg less previous patient . ( If first patient success , second patient receive 190 mcg IT hydromorphone ) . If patient deem failure , next patient receive dose IT hydromorphone 10 mcg high previous patient . ( If first patient failure , second patient receive 210 mcg IT hydromorphone ) . Our goal stop study investigator get 5 point success use low concentration IT hydromorphone result median dose less equal 1mg/hr morphine consumption 16 hour post-operatively . Statistical Methods This randomize double-blind control trial utilize up-down sequential allocation method Dixon Massey.1,2 On basis previous non-probability sequential dosing study binary outcome ( success v failure ) , investigator estimate enrol 40-50 patients.9-11 Using referenced study , investigator estimate minimum 10 independent negative-positive up-and-down deflection study . Our goal stop study investigator get 5 point success use low concentration IT hydromorphone result less equal 1mg/hr morphine consumption 16 hour post-operatively . All data analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS software , Version 21.0 ( IBM Corporation ) . The continuous data report mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) . Tests significance include test independent sample , Wilcoxon rank-sum test non-parametric data Chi-square Fisher 's exact test frequency count data . Repeated measurement ( pain score , nausea score ) analyze repeated measure analysis variance normally distribute , paired comparison time interval perform use t-test . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . A dose response curve also create determine effective dose 95 % patient ( ED95 ) effective dose 50 % patient ( ED50 ) patient population . 1 . The investigator would like enroll least 40 - 50 patient need . 2 . PCA pump attempt usage 16 hour , pain medication adjunct use , verbal numeric rating score nausea , itch pain , incidence vomiting , respiratory rate ( record every one hour ) obtain . 3 . The patient approach meet inclusion criterion admit labor floor morning schedule C/S . The study explain , possible risk , benefit , alternative discuss , give opportunity ask question agree , consent sign . The dose IT hydromorphone determine make statistician physician . The spinal anesthetic administer patient operate room C/S proceed usual . Data collect next 16 hour accord research design . 4 . Risks narcotic medication include analgesia , drowsiness , mental clouding , change mood , euphoria dysphoria , respiratory depression , cough suppression , decrease gastrointestinal motility , nausea , vomit , increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure , increase biliary pressure , pinpoint constriction pupil , increase parasympathetic activity transient hyperglycemia . There also risk study drug ineffective control post C/S pain . 5 . Standard nursing order include monitor respiratory rate every 1 hour 6 hour , every 2 hour 6 hour , sign respiratory depression , use pulse oximetry , administration naloxone need . These order currently standard patient receive IT preservative free morphine order set Jeff Chart . They allow early recognition and/or minimize risk respiratory depression occur . Also , dosages investigator use well document safe dos drug IT route . All patient provide morphine patient control analgesia ( PCA ) pump postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) additional pain relief whether study drug effective . 6 . Potential benefit study pain relief postoperative period follow C/S ( Our usual medication currently unavailable critically limited supply ) . 7 . The side effect profile standard drug , IT morphine study drug IT hydromorphone similar . Delayed respiratory depression itch notable IT morphine describe IT hydromorphone may beneficial . The duration action IT hydromorphone may long IT morphine . This study pose minimal risk . This dose finding study . The dosage investigator use well document safe dos drug IT route .</detailed_description>
