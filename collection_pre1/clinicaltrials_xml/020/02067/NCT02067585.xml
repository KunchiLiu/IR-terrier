	<detailed_description>Background : Bariatric surgery evidence-based approach efficacious sustainable weight loss . It estimate one third patient undergo bariatric surgery type 2 diabetes , high rate resolution diabetes post-operatively : 84-98 % gastric bypass 48-68 % purely restrictive procedure ( 1 , 2 ) . Other cardiovascular risk factor lipid profile inflammatory marker also , significantly improve . 25 % population Alberta obese 2,7 % morbidly obese , one third type 2 diabetes . Bariatric surgery patient translate cure type II diabetes , dramatic improvement quality life , improve longevity lower health care cost system . Morbid obesity lead elevate plasma free fatty acid ( FFA ) subsequently excessive accumulation triglyceride peripheral tissue . Excessive triglyceride accretion independent risk factor insulin resistance , type II diabetes cardiovascular complication . Bariatric surgery associate dramatic improvement comorbid disease ( 2 ) . Purely restrictive procedure ( laparoscopic adjustable gastric band - LAGB ) may differ hybrid procedure ( laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass - LRYGB ) effect diabetes cardiovascular disease . The LAGB less complex surgical procedure do day surgery basis extremely low peri-operative mortality rate . The LRYGB much complex low important rate anastomotic leak mortality . LAGB LRYGB vary average percent excess weight loss ( % EWL ) ( 2 ) . This may contribute disparity impact comorbid disease . However , improvement insulin sensitivity glucose homeostasis occur early LRYGB , precede significant weight loss ( 3 ) . Postoperative change absorption metabolism lipid induce malabsorptive procedure may responsible beneficial change . The relationship improve insulin sensitivity change lipid metabolism need clarify order understand vary impact LAGB LRYGB comorbid disease associate obesity . The initial decreased caloric intake follow Bariatric surgery improve response adipose tissue manifest favorable change adipocytokines . The postoperative rise adiponectine ( 4 , 7 ) ( anti-inflammatory mediator ) observe . These change correlate weight loss improvement insulin resistance . In obese insulin-resistant subject , insulin attenuate hydrolysis store triglyceride adipose tissue consequently lead excessive free fatty acid release circulation increase delivery fatty acid muscle , liver pancreas . Excessive uptake fatty acid tissue exacerbate hepatic muscle insulin resistance impairs insulin secretion pancreatic beta cell . Bariatric surgery improve insulin sensitivity lead inhibition hydrolysis adipose triglyceride decrease release free FFA circulation . Recently show increased baseline FFA also alter clearance FFA normalize LRYGB ( 8 ) . Also , postoperative reduction fat intake absorption lead decrease level FFA blood . After malabsorptive , weight-reducing procedure beta cell glucose fatty acid sensitivity double early diabetic patient , lead decrease insulin secretion ( 9 ) . Beside contribution insulin resistance , severe obesity also associate elevate inflammatory state . In obese type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome , highly sensitive C-reactive protein ( CRP ) serum concentration , inflammatory marker , increase correlate severity glucose intolerance severity inflammation ( 10 ) . Following bariatric surgery , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) decrease . It show gastric bypass reduces biochemical cardiac risk factor , particularly , CRP 80 % addition triglyceride , total cholesterol , LDL , lipoprotein A ( 7 , 11 ) . These change lipid glucose metabolism see restrictive hybrid procedure vary extent . Given different mechanism action , technical complexity safety profile LAGB LRYGB , crucial clarify impact co-morbid disease . Hypothesis : 1 . Postprandial reduction serum level free fatty acid lipid follow LRYGB ( malabsorptive procedure ) great follow LAGB ( purely restrictive procedure ) . 2 . Reduced serum level free fatty acid lipid follow LRYGB lead improvement insulin resistance . Rationale : Clinical evidence suggest purely restrictive procedure ( LAGB ) affect lipid absorption metabolism differently compare hybrid restrictive/malabsorptive procedure ( LRYGB ) . This may due malabsorptive component LRYGB ingest food bypass duodenum upper jejunum , important lipid digestion absorption . Design : A cross-sectional study characterize lipid absorption metabolism follow bariatric surgical procedure base Weight Wise Clinic Royal Alexandra Hospital , Edmonton . Venous blood collect overnight fast , standardize lipid meal , analyzed appropriate biochemical index . The study cohort comprise patient LAGB , LRYGB , period weight stabilization , 12+ month follow bariatric surgery . Controls comprise preoperative patient manage without pharmacologic intervention obesity . Methods : Recruitment physical examination conduct Weight Wise Clinic . Studies begin Clinical Investigation Unit , University Alberta Hospital , 7 AM consume night study meal 12-h-overnight fast . Liquid meal consist 240 ml Hormel Great Shake Plus liquid nutritional supplement , 203 Kcal/100mL ; 49 % calorie fat , mostly unsaturated fatty acid soy origin ; 38 % calorie carbohydrates , 13 % calorie proteins . Weight measurement perform nurse . Fasting baseline blood drawn subject consume second portion study meal . The test meal drunk straw within 15 minute . Blood withdrawal carry 10 , 20 , 30 , 90 min , 4 6 hrs start ingestion standardize meal . Subjects allow walk sit , exercise test . Drinking water without sugar permit . Blood collect venous in-dwelling catheter place cubital vein . Laboratory analysis : The plasma total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , nonesterified fatty acid concentration degree unsaturation , ApoB-48 ( intestinally-derived lipoprotein ) apoB-100 ( liver-derived lipoprotein ) , insulin , glucose , CPR , adiponectin , HbA1c , albumin , AST , ALT , ketone body measure . Primary outcome : postprandial change serum free fatty acid , lipid ( cholesterol total , LDL HDL , triglyceride ) apoB patient bariatric surgery relationship insulin sensitivity ( glucose , insulin , HOMA index ) . The investigator expect great reduction postprandial serum free fatty acid lipid ( cholesterol , triglyceride ) LRYGB associate great decrease insulin resistance ( HOMA index expect decrease ) , compare LAGB . Insulin , plasma glucose ketone body expect decrease . Secondary outcome : Changes HbA1c , AST , ALT , albumin , CRP , adiponectin level compare change fatty acid , lipid insulin resistance . The investigator expect reduce serum free fatty acid level associate decrease marker inflammation ( CRP ) , HbA1c , AST , ALT , increase anti-inflammatory mediator ( adiponectin ) procedure , pronounce LRYGB . Sample Size Calculation : Sample size calculate base review literature show decrease post-bariatric procedure free fatty acid . A power analysis perform beta 0.20 alpha 0.05 . Assuming 30 % difference level FFA exist morbidly obese operate operated patient , 16 subject need arm , total 48 LAGB , LRYGB control group . Thus study would provide 80 % chance difference would detect one exist . Data analysis : Multivariate Analysis test statistical significance improve serum free fatty acid , ApoB lipid level correlation insulin sensitivity ( glucose , insulin ) among multiple group data perform statistician .</detailed_description>
