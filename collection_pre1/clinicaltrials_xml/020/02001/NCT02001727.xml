	<brief_summary>Aims : 1 . Evaluate long-term effect screen eradication Helicobacter Pylori prevalence dyspepsia , , secondary outcome , assess effect dyspepsia relate health-care consumption quality life . 2 . To investigate symptom gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) , dyspepsia combination condition effect quality life , prognosis dyspepsia-related health care expenditure . Methods : In 1998-99 20.000 individual , age 40-65 year , identify civil registration number , allocate computerized randomized procedure HP-screening group control group . All participant receive questionnaire inclusion , 1-year 5-year 12 year follow-up assessing prevalence dyspepsia quality life . In addition obtain information register , comorbidity , use endoscopy prescription medication . An economic evaluation do alongside randomize trial . The primary unscreened group invite HP test ( 13C-urea breath-test ) order analyze effect HP-screening accord HP-status Expected result : The study provide information long-term effect HP-screening eradication population . The study provide information long-term effect incidence peptic ulcer age population likely increase consumption ASA NSAID . Furthermore study generate knowledge long-term prognosis dyspepsia reflux population ( dyspepsia reflux . Preliminary result 5-yr follow-up ( 13 ) show great influence quality life dyspepsia-related health care consumption , whether individual solely reflux , solely dyspepsia combination symptom . Long-term follow-up analysis finding could great impact management treatment individual symptom . It important focus group ; symptom great influence quality life individual . This find displayed study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HEP-FYN 12-Years Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Questionnaire : Information abdominal symptom ( GRSR : Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale , rate symptom , quality life ( SF-36 , EQ-5D-5L ) , consumption ulcer drug include counter drug , hospital admission , dyspepsia-related sick leave day , consultation comorbidity ) . A reminder send 2 week first contact . Register data : OPED ( Odense Pharmaca-epidemiological Database ) : Information reimbursable ulcer drug , ASA , NSAID HP-eradication therapy . The Regional Hospital discharge Register : Information base International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) . Information ulcer-related admission , out-patient ulcer diagnosis comorbidity , use upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . HP-test unscreened group : Invitation primary unscreened group HP test ( 13C-urea breath-test ) order analyze effect HP-screening accord HP-status . Instruments : automate breath 13Co2 analyser- Isotope ratio mass spectrometer . Almost person infect HP childhood . Infection bacteria adulthood rare . Only person spontaneously turn HP-negative . From OPED know individual prescribe HP-eradication treatment . Thus participant control group , HP-positive 12-yr follow-up , infection whole period . Provided receive HP-eradication treatment , test HP-negative whole period .</detailed_description>
