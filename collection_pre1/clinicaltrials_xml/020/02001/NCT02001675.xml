	<brief_summary>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) emerge suitable tool restoring , maintain and/or enhance muscular performance . From practical point view , NMES elicit contraction either direct activation motor axon ( i.e . peripheral mechanism ) recruitment motoneuron spinal cord depolarization sensory axon ( central mechanism ) . It noteworthy NMES parameter widely affect balance transmission along two pathway . Conventional NMES usually deliver use short pulse duration ( 0.05-0.4 m ) , low stimulation frequency ( 15-40 Hz ) high stimulus intensity large antidromic volley motor axon ensure evoked contraction drive largely direct depolarization motor axon beneath stimulation site little involvement central nervous system . On contrary , NMES deliver use wide pulse width ( 1 m ) high frequency ( 100 Hz ) ( WP-HF NMES ) , portion evoke contraction arises central mechanism correspond force ( recently refer `` extra force '' ) significantly ( three time ) large conventional NMES-induced force . This extra force suppose represent central contribution recruitment spinal motoneuron evoke afferent volley give additional force observe complete anesthetic block nerve proximal stimulation site . Despite obvious difference term activation neuromuscular system conventional WP-HF NMES , functional , metabolic cortical response associate protocol remain determined</brief_summary>
