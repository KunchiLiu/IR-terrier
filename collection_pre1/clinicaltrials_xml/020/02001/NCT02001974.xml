	<detailed_description>The CSC ( Cancer stem cell ) concept important implication understand carcinogenesis well development cancer therapeutic . According concept , tumor initiate maintain cellular subcomponent display stem cell property . These property include self-renewal , drive tumorigenesis , differentiation ( albeit aberrant ) , contribute tumor cellular heterogeneity . The existence CSCs describe variety hematologic solid tumor include breast , brain , colon , pancreas , lung , liver , head neck . In addition driving tumorigenesis , CSCs may contribute tumor metastasis well tumor recurrence treatment . One therapeutic strategy pursue target CSCs involve inhibition self renewal survival pathways cell . These pathway include NOTCH ( Notch signal pathway ) , Hedgehog , WNT ( Wnt signal pathway ) . Such strategy may limited role pathway normal stem cell function , could result systemic toxicity pathway inhibition . In addition intrinsic pathway regulate stem cell function , normal malignant stem cell regulate extrinsic signal generate microenvironment CSC niche . In breast , niche compose immune cell , mesenchymal element include fibroblast , endothelial cell , adipocytes , extracellular matrix component . These component play important role normal breast development carcinogenesis . If cellular microenvironment play important role regulation CSC growth survival , strategy aim interfere interaction represent rational approach target breast CSCs . There limited data impact treatment tailor base CSCs detection . Gene profile CSCs could lead identification therapeutic target CSCs ( e.g . hormone receptor , HER-2 [ Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ] expression , EGFR [ Epidermal growth factor receptor ] expression ) , could represent tumor biopsy `` real time '' . Several group show frequent discordance HER-2 status primary tumor CSCs , case report show clinical utility use trastuzumab-based therapy base HER-2 CSCs status . Similarly , hormonal status CSCs could different primary tumor , could lead increase number patient suitable endocrine therapy , also could explain endocrine therapy fail subset hormone receptor-positive patient . The study provide vivo demonstration CXCR-1 ( Chemokine receptor 1 ) target specific block antibody reparixin associate reduced systemic metastasis . The experimental data provide another therapeutic target metastatic disease warrant pilot study investigation human explore effect reparixin breast CSCs tumoral microenvironment . Reparixin seem good candidate use breast cancer patient acceptable toxicity profile show Phase I II clinical trial conduct far , along observed activity vitro breast cancer cell line vivo tumor xenograft mouse . It potentially address another therapeutic target metastatic disease . The current pilot study thus aim explore safety PK profile orally administer reparixin HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patient effect breast CSC marker .</detailed_description>
