	<brief_summary>Antiangiogenics mainstay treatment patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Conventional clinical end-points , use measure efficacy chemotherapeutic agent , helpful monitoring efficacy antiangiogenic therapy . Increasing number predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers investigate useful surrogate clinical response also identify patient early benefit class agent . This valuable avoid unnecessary toxicity patient also reduce cost implication expensive group drug . The investigator wish explore variability baseline metabolomic profile blood urine patient mRCC characterise inter-subject intra-subject variability . The study baseline level perform cohort previously . This extremely important interpret emerge data change level various biomarkers various trial . This turn help development future target therapy , especially Phase I/II study early demonstration target modulation vital . This study also help identify number patient required appropriate statistical evaluation pharmacodynamic study assess biological activity , optimisation dosing , investigation potential mechanism resistance . Study urinary blood metabolomic profile conjunction give u insight potential use urine diagnostic prognostic tool . OBJECTIVES GOAL The main objective study determine change baseline metabolomic profiling patient clear cell renal cell carcinoma 1 month nephrectomy antiangiogenic treatment 2 month</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN . Observational , Prospective , Exploratory , Single centre . STUDY POPULATION Common Inclusion criterion Patients must older 18 year age . Written Informed Consent obtain . Patients previously inform objective . Patients histologically confirm renal clear cell carcinoma . Patients surgery confirm renal cell carcinoma suspect . RCC must confirm surgery . Exclusion criterion Presence separate malignant diagnosis , last two year , except non-melanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Prior anti-cancer treatment RCC nephrectomy ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Determination change baseline metabolomic profiling Secondary outcome Time progression Progression free survival ( PFS ) /Overall survival ( OS ) Determination metabolomic level monitor period Radiologically measure tumour response ( accord investigator assessment ) Toxicities Outcome Measures Primary The primary outcome measure change baseline metabolomic profiling 1 month nephrectomy antiangiogenic treatment 2 month Cohort 1 . The primary clinical outcome measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) , interval first line therapy first evidence progression disease death RCC . Cohort 2 . The primary clinical outcome measure find difference metabolomic profile sample nephrectomy . Secondary The main objective study determine metabolomic basal level patient renal cell carcinoma clear cell try find prognostic profile Metabolomic profile change follow . Tumour progression PFS , i.e . time surgery/first line treatment progression RCC specific survival time , i.e . time first line treatment death RCC Overall survival , i.e . time first line treatment death cause , include RCC Best response Toxicity association metabolomic profile evaluation . Metabolomic characteristic resect primary RCC . Tumour sample examine relevant metabolomic profile , association outcome study . Definitions PFS define time first day treatment drug ( sunitinib , pazopanib , etc . ) date radiological progressive disease ( PD ) , clear clinical evidence PD , death . Patients progressed database closure censor final follow-up . If date PD unknown , investigator censor PFS last tumour assessment . Overall survival define time first day `` drug '' treatment date death last date follow-up . Objective response assess treat doctor , accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 , classify complete response , partial response , stable disease , PD . Timing assessment dictate individual institution policy . All adverse effect grade attend doctor accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4•0 . The investigator initially select mucositis , hypothyroidism , hand-foot syndrome , hypertension , anaemia , thrombocytopenia analysis basis clinical relevance grade objectiveness , together grade 3-4 adverse event . The investigator also record adverse toxic event lead dose reduction date occur . The investigator test metabolomic profile PFS overall survival Cox-regression analysis RECIST response logistic regression analysis . The investigator shall perform multivariable analysis include clinical factor associate PFS , overall survival , response covariates ( clinical factor associate p &lt; 0•1 specific variable use covariates specific variable ) . The investigator allocate patient favourable , intermediate , poor prognosis group accord Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) prognostic classification , include variable multivariable analysis . The investigator analyse metabolomic profile associate PFS overall survival multivariable analysis Kaplan-Meier method . The investigator assess metabolomic levels/profile associate increased risk drug dose reduction cause toxicity Cox-regression modelling number day drug treatment reduction dose . Patients dose reduction censor final follow-up . For multivariable analysis , investigator use clinical factor associate p &lt; 0•1 dose reduction covariates , investigator analyse metabolomic level associate drug dose reduction multivariable analysis Kaplan-Meier method . The investigator study association specific drug toxicity metabolomic profile logistic regression analysis , toxicity development dichotomous endpoint . The multivariable logistic regression analysis include clinical factor associate correspond outcome covariates ( factor p &lt; 0•1 ) . The investigator test genotype additive genetic model . The investigator retain miss data miss apart MSKCC prognostic factor . The likely value , base data rest series , assigned patient . There general descriptive variable include study . Distributions present absolute relative frequency qualitative variable , measure central tendency dispersion ( mean standard deviation , median , minimum maximum ) quantitative variable . They present confidence interval 95 % major outcome . No miss data impute leave miss . The hypothesis test perform bilateral significance level 0.05 . For variable conform normal distribution ( parametric ) use non-parametric test analysis contingency table comparison proportion / frequency distribution , use chi -square ( Fisher 's exact appropriate ) . Statistical analysis data study conduct Hutchison/MRC ( Medical Research Council ) Research Center . Specific aspect statistical analysis Analysis goal : Cohort 1 : `` To determine baseline metabolomic profile urine/blood patient renal cell carcinoma clear order find prognostic/predictive model '' Appropriate regression model well univariate multivariate statistical test use . Cohort 2 : `` To determine change metabolomic profile 1 month nephrectomy '' Univariate multivariate statistical test pair set apply reveal change .</detailed_description>
