	<brief_title>Low-dose Statins Nutraceuticals High-intensity Statin-intolerant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical trial show patient atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , reduction low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) level beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( ie , statin ) associate significant reduction mortality rate major cardiac event . Accordingly , current guideline recommend high-intensity statin therapy—such rosuvastatin 20 40 mg atorvastatin 80 mg—should use achieve least 50 % reduction LDL cholesterol unless otherwise contraindicate . In real world clinical practice , however , high-intensity statin treatment often discontinue patient due side effect . As alternative , nonstatin drug , ezetimibe , often prescribe association moderate-to-low intensity statin . It remain unknown , however , whether association moderate-to-low intensity statin therapy nutraceuticals ( i.e . compound derived food cholesterol lower action ) therapeutic role high-intensity statin-intolerant patient .</detailed_description>
