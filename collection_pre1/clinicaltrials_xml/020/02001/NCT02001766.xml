	<brief_summary>Type II diabetes ( T2D ) characterize endothelial dysfunction , result poor tissue perfusion function well increase risk cardiovascular event . ATP , release red blood cell , contributes regulation blood flow study show red blood cell take T2D patient impaired ability release ATP . However , know whether change ATP system underlie cause poor tissue perfusion observe T2D . The purpose project 1 test hypothesis deterioration blood flow T2D cause reduced release ATP red blood cell , test pharmacological manipulation cAMP normalize ATP release , plasma ATP level thereby blood flow . Furthermore , epidemiological study show clear link regular exercise reduce risk serious cardiovascular disease . The extent physically active lifestyle may improve endothelial function T2D unknown . Regular physical activity improve vascularization induces anti-inflammatory environment . Both angiogenic anti-inflammatory effect physical activity part mediate substance release active muscle . These muscle-derived substance classify myokines paracrine , autocrine endocrine effect may thereby affect distant tissue . The purpose project 2 investigate whether high intensity interval training may reverse endothelial dysfunction T2D increase release ATP myokines . In individual T2D determine blood flow muscle tissue use advanced ultrasound . In addition , use intravascular intramuscular microdialysis determine ATP level blood muscle interstitium .</brief_summary>
