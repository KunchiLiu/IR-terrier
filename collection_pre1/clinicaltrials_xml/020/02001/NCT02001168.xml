	<brief_summary>- Lung cancer one cause malignant tumor-associated death global scale , surgery effective approach patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . As present , total postoperative 5-year survival rate NSCLC 40 % , 4 % ～15 % patient benefit adjuvant chemotherapy [ 1 ] . American National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) manual recommend adjuvant chemotherapy perform NSCLC patient phase Ⅱ～ⅢA . - In order assure necessity adjuvant chemotherapy NSCLC patient phase ⅠB kind patient would benefit establishment new staging , multi-subject group lung cancer set perspective , randomize , open clinical trial explore whether adjuvant chemotherapy effective NSCLC patient phase ⅠB new staging policy , collect characteristic patient could benefit treatment well adjuvant drug operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy With/Without Rh-endostatin Non-small Cell Lung Cancer PhaseⅠB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy , navelbine plus platinum ( NP ) , commonly use therapeutic protocol , advantage 3 generation new drug plus platinum . With continuous implementation individual therapy lung cancer , new drug become selective pathological pattern gene type , unclear whether drug would effective conventional drug postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy . The first- second-generation drug observe survival advantage except third generation , conclusion would make select individual chemotherapeutic drug accord pathological pattern ? In study , Pemetrexed plus Platinum adopt postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy patient adeno-carcinoma , Docetaxel plus Platinum perform non-adeno-carcinoma . - Apart individual chemotherapy basis different pathological pattern , anti-angiogenesis therapy quickly develop recent year , become effective approach improve chemotherapeutic efficacy . The main mechanism anti-angiogenesis drug include inhabit tumor angiogenesis postpone inhabit recurrence residual tumor reconstruct balance anti-angiogenesis prevent growth micro-metastasis keep resting stage . The effect adjuvant chemotherapy promote increase drug sensitivity , survival time prolong though delaying time decrease rate postoperative recurrence metastasis tumor anti-angiogenesis therapy combine adjuvant chemotherapy . As attention increasingly give anti-angiogenesis drug postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy present , Endostar , anti-angiogenesis drug study independently China , favorable effect treat advanced lung cancer combine chemotherapy . Therefore , study protocol gather effect Endostar improve survival early lung cancer patient observe effect partial NSCLC patient treatment group combine therapy . - A total 392 NSCLC patient phase ⅠB select perspective , randomize , open control clinical trial , 262 130 patient serve research control group respectively 2:1 . Patients 4-8 week operation divide accord different high risk factor . A total 4-week different chemotherapy ( 21 course ) give patient different pathological pattern research group , adeno-carcinoma group non-adeno-carcinoma group treat Pemetrexed plus Cis-platinum Docetaxel plus Cis-platinum , respectively . Then , two group randomly divide two subgroup respectively 1:1 , subgroup 1 treated original chemotherapy subgroup 2 add rh-Endostatin therapy . - High risk factor include poor differentiation ( include neuro-endocrine carcinoma ) , blood vessel invasion , wedge incision , tumor diameter ＞4 cm , visceral pleura involvement , ambiguous N stag incisal edge ＜1 cm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose NSCLC pathologically T stage T2a postoperative pathological staging . No lymph node distant metastasis observe surgical method include wedge incision , segmentectomy right lung lobe . Age : 18～70 year ECOG PS score : 01 score patient diagnose high risk factor follow : poor differentiation ( include low differentiation , undifferentiation neuroendocrine differentiation ) , blood vessel invasion , wedge incision , tumor diameter ＞4 cm , visceral pleura involvement , incomplete clear lymph node incisal edge ＜1.0 cm . Patients diagnose without tumor recurrence adjuvant chemotherapy . Informed consent sign . Patients unexpected pathological pattern receive new adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients active malignant tumor history beside NSCLC treatment except nonmelanoma skin cancer , primary cervical cancer cure early prostate cancer . Patients chemotherapeutic contraindication , white blood count ＜4.0×109/L , blood platelet count ＜80×109/L severe anemia ( Hb＜80 g/L ) ; obvious liver dysfunction ( increased transaminase bilirubin ＞2.5 fold normal level ) ; unmanageable hypertension , diabetes , arrhythmia , repeat heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could influence ventilation function ; active stage disease infect bacteria , fungi virus ; patient pregnancy lactation period . Patients unrecovered poor chemotherapy 8week treatment , receive 8week treatment treatment . Patients poor obedience improper symptom .</criteria>
