	<brief_summary>The treatment CML expect survival revolutionise since introduction tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) nilotinib . Despite effectiveness , drug never totally remove CML affected cell body . In order achieve goal , potentially enable CML patient live without daily need TKIs , feature patient 's immune system may need harness . One possibility use externally administer interferon ( IFN ) augment response induce TKI . This study assess response term length survival , detection minimal disease level time disease worsen patient chronic phase CML take nilotinib pegylated Interferon . Patients commence take nilotinib 3 month , tolerate , simultaneously treat injected pegIFN 2 year . Patients continue take nilotinib beyond time provide receive benefit . Options available patient decrease increase dose switch another TKI , imatinib , ensure balance drug effectiveness minimal side effect achieve .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All following criterion must satisfy enrolment study . 1 . Postpubertal male female patient age 18 year . 2 . Newly diagnose ( within Three month study entry ) Ph+ CMLChronic Phase quantifiable `` breakpoint cluster region Abelson murine leukemia '' ( BCRABL ) transcript 3 . No prior therapy CML current antileukaemic therapy ( prior current treatment hydroxyurea anagrelide ) . 4 . No sign extramedullary leukaemia , except hepatosplenomegaly . 5 . Documented chronicphase CML define : . &lt; 15 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow ii . &lt; 30 % blast promyelocytes peripheral blood bone marrow iii . &lt; 20 % basophils peripheral blood iv . Platelet count &gt; 100 × 109/L ( Note : Patients consider chronic phase platelet count ≤ 100 x 109/L result treatment hydroxyurea anagrelide provide criterion chronic phase CML meet ) . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score ≤2 ( see Appendix 2 ) 7 . Patients must follow laboratory value : 1 . Potassium level &gt; Lower Limit Normal ( LLN ) 2 . Calcium ( correct serum albumin ) &gt; Lower Limit Normal ( LLN ) 3 . Magnesium level &gt; Lower Limit Normal ( LLN ) 4 . Phosphorus &gt; Lower Limit Normal ( LLN ) 5 . ALT AST &lt; 2.5 × ULN &lt; 5.0 × Upper limit normal ( ULN ) consider due tumour 6 . ALP &lt; 2.5 × Upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless consider due tumour 7 . Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × Upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless due Gilbert 's syndrome 8 . Creatinine &lt; 1.5 × Upper limit normal ( ULN ) 9 . Amylase lipase &lt; 1.5 × Upper limit normal ( ULN ) Note : Biochemical abnormality resolve corrective measure pose impediment rescreening . ) Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within one week prior study entry OR amenorrhoeic least 12 month . b ) All patient reproductive potential must agree use birth control duration study . This required long patient reproductive potential . The type birth control decision make treat clinician patient . 9.Life expectancy 12 month . 10.Patient give write , inform consent participate study ( include consent obtain sample correlative study except rare case site capacity participate correlative study ) . Presence follow criterion exclude subject enrolment study . 1 . Patients previously receive radiotherapy &gt; 25 % bone marrow . 2 . Patients undergone major surgery within 4 week prior study entry recover earlier surgery . 3 . Impaired cardiac function , include follow : 1 . Inability monitor QT/corrected QT intervak ( QTc ) interval ECG 2 . Long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome . 3 . Resting bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) suspect secondary cardiac pathology 4 . QTc &gt; 450 msec baseline ECG ( use QTc formula ) . If QTc &gt; 450 msec electrolyte within normal range , electrolyte correct patient rescreened QTc 5 . Other clinically significant uncontrolled heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension ) 6 . History presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias , include atrial fibrillation 4 . History arterial vascular disease include coronary artery disease ( Angina , myocardial infarction ) , cerebrovascular disease ( Transient ischaemic attack stroke ) , peripheral vascular disease , retinal artery thromboses mesenteric arterial thromboses . 5 . Treatment agent ( warfarin ) prolong QT interval inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , unless judge clinically essential . 6 . Another primary malignant disease , except condition currently require treatment , lesion completely excise ( eg Skin Cancers ) neoplasms significantly affect long term survival patient 7 . Significantly impaired GI function GI disease may alter nilotinib absorption . 8 . Other concurrent uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled unstable thyroid disease , active uncontrolled infection , acute chronic liver renal disease ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . 9 . History confirm acute chronic pancreatitis . 10 . Cytopathologically confirmed Central Nervous System ( CNS ) infiltration . [ In absence suspicion CNS involvement , lumbar puncture require . ] 11 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol patient history noncompliance inability grant inform consent . 12 . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 13 . Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation 14 . Patients pregnant breast feed adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . Male female patient childbearing potential must agree employ effective method birth control throughout study . The type birth control decision make treat clinician patient 15 . Known history uncontrolled depression psychiatric disease likely exacerbate study treatment . A formal psychiatric assessment baseline require . 16 . Current participation another therapeutic clinical trial ( participation clinical trial involve active intervention exclusion study . ) 17 . Previous adverse reaction trial drug/s</criteria>
