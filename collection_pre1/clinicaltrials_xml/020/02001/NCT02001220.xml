	<brief_summary>During wean work breathing transfer ventilator back patient . Approximately 40 % time ventilator spend wean . Studies support use screening protocol test patient 's ability breathe spontaneously ( SBTs ) identify wean candidate . Once daily screen current standard care . With respiratory therapist ( RTs ) Canadian intensive care unit ( ICUs ) , significant opportunity exist screen patient frequently , conduct SBTs , reduce time spend ventilator ICU . The study seek identify optimal screening frequency minimize patient ' exposure invasive ventilation . The RELEASE Trial evaluate simple simple construct : frequent screen result In early identification wean candidate , frequent SBT 's , less time spend ventilator ICU . More frequent screen appeal intervention sensible , low risk , represent cost effective use current resource . This simple intervention hold promise strategy could change clinical practice , enhance care deliver critically ill adult , improve clinically important outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Frequency Trial Identify Weaning Candidates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient ( &lt; 65 year age ) randomly assign 1:1 either 'once daily ' 'at least twice daily ' screen wean readiness . After randomization , RTs participate ICUs inform allocate study arm bedside nurse complete checklist document practice related sedation , analgesia , delirium , mobilization screen period study arm . RTs conduct wean readiness assessment either 'once daily ' 'at least twice daily ' per group assignment . The checklist , complete bedside nurse , merely record current practice sedation , analgesia delirium management , whether patient passively actively mobilize SBTs . In 'once daily screen arm ' , RTs screen invasively ventilate patient approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hour daily . If yet complete , RTs prompt RNs complete 'practices checklist ' . In 'at least twice daily ' screening arm patient screen minimum approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hour 13:00 - 15:00 hour daily . If screening period miss inadvertently due investigation intervention ( operation/procedure ) necessitate absence ICU , may conduct later day ideally within 6 hour schedule screening period . Additional screening trial 'at least twice daily ' screening arm permit discretion clinical team ( RTs physician ) . Regardless group assignment , SBT screen assessment pass , SBT conduct . In event study inclusion 10:00 , study arm initiate day randomization . For patient randomized 10:00 , one assessment require study arm day one . Similarly , patient breathe spontaneously PS trigger spontaneous breath volume pressure AC , volume pressure SIMV ± PS , PRVC , PAV , VS , APRV 10:00 , allocate screen protocol resume . However , patient return mode permit spontaneous breath ( PS ) support trigger breath ( volume pressure AC , volume pressure SIMV ± PS , PRVC , PAV , VS , APRV ) 10:00 , screen conduct daily treatment arm day return resume per treatment allocation thereafter . To pass 'readiness wean screen ' undergo SBT , follow criterion must meet : 1 . The patient must capable initiate spontaneous breath Pressure Support ( PS ) trigger breaths volume pressure Assist Control ( AC ) , volume pressure Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation ( SIMV ) ± PS , Pressure Regulated Volume Control ( PRVC ) Airway Pressure Release Ventilation ( APRV ) , 2 . The ratio partial pressure arterial oxygen fractional concentration inspire oxygen ( PaO2/FiO2 ) great equal 200 mm Hg , 3 . Respiratory rate ( RR ) less equal 35 breaths/min , 4 . Positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) less equal 10 cm H2O , 5 . Heart rate ( HR ) less equal 140 beats/min , 6 . The ratio respiratory frequency tidal volume ( f/VT ) &lt; 105 breaths/min/L 2 minute assessment .</detailed_description>
