	<brief_summary>Preliminary study support background efficacy local standard anti-malarial medication treatment uncomplicated knowlesi malaria , however current WHO treatment guideline infection . There health cost benefit rapidly act agent , due difficulty microscopic identification may effective treatment malaria specie align treatment guideline could support . We currently conduct separate RCT use similar protocol evaluate artesunate-mefloquine versus chloroquine uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria . However artemether-lumefantrine also compare chloroquine due fact also first line anti-malarial recommend Malaysia , potential difference efficacy due different administration , absorption half-life artemether-lumefantrine . The investigator aim test whether fixed combination artesunate-mefloquine superior chloroquine order define optimal treatment uncomplicated P. knowlesi infection adult child region .</brief_summary>

Current rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) malaria distinguish falciparum Current rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) malaria distinguish falciparum Plasmodium species sensitivity 99 % parasite count &gt; 1,000/ μL [ 20 ] , knowlesi specific antigen develop current antibody panel unable differentiate P. knowlesi mixed Plasmodium spp . infection [ 21 ] .

Artemether-lumefantrine ( A-L ) common widely available ACT , along artesunate-mefloquine ( AS-MQ ) one 2 first line WHO recommend option treatment uncomplicated P.falciparum infection register Malaysia produce accord international good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) standard . ACTs current mainstay malaria eradication effort 28 , mechanism action result rapid reduction parasite mass resolution clinical feature , long act component eliminate residual parasite delay development de novo resistance 29,30 . Initial report use A-L knowlesi malaria retrospective study tertiary referral hospital Sabah , small sample size 8 34 patient PCR confirm uncomplicated P.knowlesi infection treat oral artemether-lumefantrine . Median microscopic parasite clearance time 1 day ( range 0-3 ) , significantly faster receive chloroquine ( median 2.5 day , range 1-3 ) , also result few day hospitalization health sector associate cost . The proportion remain parasitaemic day 1 33 % 16 . Our subsequent prospective study site document 109 knowlesi malaria patient successfully treat A-L , recurrence identify . Unpublished data study show patient uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria enrol , 51 receive A-L monotherapy , median parasite clearance time 2 days31 . Evaluation A-L required addition AS-MQ , number pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic difference may affect clinical outcome . In contrast AS-MQ , adequate oral absorption A-L require co-adminstration fatty food , twice daily dosing28 . The longer acting partner drug A-L lumefantrine , half life 3 day compare mefloquine AS-MQ 21 day . Therefore may differences P. knowlesi recurrence day 28 42 follow time recommend WHO anti-malarial efficacy monitoring study 32 . Chloroquine primaquine initially suggest favourable treatment outcomes uncomplicated P. knowlesi human infection retrospective review patient Kapit Hospital Sarawak 2004 15 . Following single prospective observational study conduct site 2006-7 administer chloroquine total base dose 25mg/kg primaquine gametocidal agent 73 patient uncomplicated PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi malaria , result show median fever clearance 26 hour , mean time 50 % 90 % microscopic parasite clearance 3.1 10.3 hour respectively , median PCR adjust clearance time 3 day . The proportion remain parasitaemic day 1 55 % . None 60 patient complete 28-day follow demonstrate evidence resistance , re-infection recrudescence 25 .</detailed_description>
