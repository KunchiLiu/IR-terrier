	<brief_summary>This project examine relationship physical activity level , brain structure memory function adult Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) age 60 75 . The study follow 30 adult age-associated memory impairment MCI course 18 month . During time , subject ' physical activity level measure regularly related thickness hippocampus memory performance . Subjects recruit screened major health problem UCLA . Physical activity track two week use accelerometer baseline every 6 month study . At baseline end study , subject undergo structural MRI brain scan measure hippocampal thickness , well neuropsychological evaluation measure memory function . The study seek determine relationship physical activity level , hippocampal thickness memory performance old adult age-associated memory impairment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Agreement participate study 6089 year age Diagnostic criterion Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis : subjective memory complaint , Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 26 , intact instrumental activity daily live ( Smith et al. , 1996 ) OR subjective ageassociated memory complaint Cohabitation adult capable ensure correct usage physical activity monitor study verify selfreports activity level . Adequate visual auditory acuity allow neuropsychological testing . Screening laboratory test EKG without significant abnormality might interfere study . If screening laboratory test EKG show abnormality , PI may request clearance primary care physician subject continue study . Comorbid condition impact mobility Current , untreated depression : BDIII score &gt; 13 Diagnosis probable Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) dementia ( e.g. , vascular , Lewy body , frontotemporal ) . Evidence neurological physical illness produce cognitive deterioration . Volunteers history head trauma , stroke , TIA , carotid bruits , lacunes MRI scan exclude . Contraindication MRI include claustrophobia , metal body , surgery within 60 day , certain medical implant previous abnormal MRI result .
