	<brief_summary>Modern modular foot-orthoses system allow integration cost efficiency benefit afford use pre-formed semi-rigid FOs component , simultaneously allow high degree individualisation prescription . Such system , popular , still remain unproven . Recent study paediatric rheumatology make contribution develop guideline regard pharmacological intervention arthritic child . In addition , specific drug therapy protocol publish effectively help general practitioner , physiotherapist ophthalmologists successfully treat child JIA patient ( BSPAR 2006 ; Hull 2001 ; NICE guideline 2002 ) . A Cochrane systematic review treatment pe planus , highlight child JIA exclude group study ( Ashford et al . 2005 ) . At present little evidence exist podiatric management child affect disable pathology , especially orthotic management . This research provide evidence support use readily available off-the-shelf FOs treat JIA child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Foot Orthoses ( FOs ) Pain , Quality Life Gait With Children Diagnosed With JIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction - Currently limit evidence support podiatric treatment child JIA . The foot orthoses ( FOs ) prescribe JIA child far appear expensive require long time manufacture fitting . This randomise control trial ( RCT ) aim determine whether pre-formed FOs prescribe chair side , impact pain , quality life ( primary outcome ) and/or gait-parameters ( secondary outcome ) child affect JIA . Methods - The study take place Gait Analysis laboratory Queen Margaret University - Edinburgh TORT Centre , Ninewells Hospital-Dundee . Children JIA diagnose accord ILAR criterion . Intervention blind patient . The trial group receive Slimflex-plus FOs , addition chair side correction control FOs supply make leather board ( 1mm thick ) . Both FOs black EVA top cover . Primary outcome investigate use validated questionnaire ( VAS , CHAQ PedsQL ) . Tekscan™ equipment ( F-Scan™ HR Walkway® ) measure secondary outcome in-shoe pressure force data without FOs intervention . Multiple foot strike repetitive gait pattern compare pre post-treatment . Primary secondary outcome measure record baseline , 3rd 6th month 's period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed JIA accord ILAR criterion . All subject low extremity joint involvement disease onset range 5 18 year old . Previous failure orthotic management , patient worn FOs period least 3 month . Ability walk minimum 15 metre without assistive device . Six month start DMARD therapy . Inability walk barefoot shod . Concomitant musculoskeletal disease , central peripheral nerve disease endocrine disorder , especially Diabetes Mellitus . Previous foot surgery . Currently use foot orthosis . Where supply orthotics contraindicate : ( Less 12 degree subtle joint ; Fully compensate ankle equine ; Osseous anomaly note low limb and/or vertebrae physical evaluation ; Inappropriate footwear fit orthoses ) .</criteria>
