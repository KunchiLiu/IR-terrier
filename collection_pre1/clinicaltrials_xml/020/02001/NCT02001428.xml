	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effectiveness different malaria control strategy first year life . The effectiveness deliver intermittent screen treatment programme dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHP ) , link local immunization programme , compare current practice passive case detection malaria . This study two objective : 1 . To assess effectiveness intermittent screen treatment dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHP ) administer 2 , 3 , 4 9 month age compare current practice passive detection treatment malaria area high drug resistance level P. falciparum P. vivax . 2 . To evaluate safety , efficacy population pharmacokinetics DHP child 1 year age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infant malaria major public health issue Timika , Papua ( Indonesia ) risk start birth majority malaria , mostly asymptomatic , first 3 day life . Malaria infection associate severe complication , severe anaemia respiratory distress , fatal . The emergence multidrug resistant malaria pose significant health risk vulnerable group . In addition , due non-specific symptom malaria find age group , diagnosis often miss . Early detection prompt treatment effective antimalarial drug key prevent adverse outcome malaria first year life . The first line treatment uncomplicated malaria Indonesia Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHP ) , ACT show highly efficacious region , although experience use infant less one year old limited . Although World Health Organization recommend antimalarial drug efficacy trial infant , ACT efficacy study include child age one year older . Drug population pharmacokinetic study enrol young infant age 5-6 month old , whereas Intermittent Preventive Treatment Infants ( IPTi ) study usually start infant young 3 month old . In view challenge identify effective malaria treatment infant Indonesia , propose study design evaluate effectiveness deliver early detection prompt treatment DHP 2 , 3 , 4 9 month age , link local immunization programme deliver village health post ( Posyandu ) , area high drug resistance level P. falciparum P. vivax . The effectiveness approach compare current practice passive case detection . We also define efficacy pharmacokinetic profile DHP infancy monitor safety toxicity use . The propose study enrol 756 infant across 5 health centre Papua , Indonesia . Infants recruit pregnant mother enrol participant concurrent STOPMiP trial - clinical research study aim evaluate intermittent screen treatment ( IST ) intermittent preventive therapy ( IPT ) DHP pregnant woman Indonesia . The trial result inform policy maker Indonesia , internationally , effectiveness different malaria control strategy first year life .</detailed_description>
