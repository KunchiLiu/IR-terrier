	<brief_title>IRS ( Irradiation Stent ) vs. CS ( Conventional Stent ) Insertion Inoperable Malignant Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant biliary obstruction common condition cause various carcinomas.The clinical process usually silent insidious , 10-20 % patient surgically remove obstructive jaundice occurred.The long-term survival rate resection remain dismal.Relief obstructive jaundice play major role prognosis patient without surgical indications.For unresectable patient , stenting biliary obstruction consider preferred palliation modality relieve pruritus , cholangitis , pain jaundice.Although number new technique treatment malignant biliary obstruction develop , significant difference survival quality life compare surgery bypass versus plastic stent insertion , metal stent insertion versus plastic stent insertion , cover stent versus uncover stent insertion patients.Our previous unicentric clinical trial demonstrate safety technical feasibility biliary intraluminal irradiation stent insertion patient biliary obstruction cause adenocarcinomas , treatment seem benefit relieve jaundice extend survival compare conventional biliary stent.However , small sample size , population distribution two group influence final result obtain powerful statistical conclusion overall survival stent patency two groups.Therefore , multicentric study design prospectively compare response treatment irradiation biliary stent versus conventional biliary self-expandable stent patient inoperable malignant biliary obstruction .</detailed_description>
