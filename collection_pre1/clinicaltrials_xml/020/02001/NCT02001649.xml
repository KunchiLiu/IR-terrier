	<brief_title>Genetic Variants Associated With Adolescent Suicide Attempts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France , suicide second lead cause death among 14-22 year population . Suicide behavior ( SB ) span spectrum range suicidal ideation suicide attempt complete suicide . Several factor likely determine predisposition SB , include biological factor psychosocial stressor . For biological factor , convergent evidence adoption , family , twin study suicide strongly suggest genetic contribution liability SB . Although genetic factor play role SB , identify specific gene involve prove challenge . Molecular-genetic technology make great advance past decade , include genome- wide search disease-causing gene linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) approach . Despite major public health problem youth population , genetic association study regard suicidal behavior adolescence still rare . Genes code protein involve regulate serotonergic neurotransmission thus major candidate gene association study SB . Among , gene serotonin metabolism ( tryptophan hydroxylase , TPH ) , serotonin transport ( 5-HTT ) , serotonergic 2A ( 5-HT2A ) receptor receive research attention . The identification relevant genetic variant SNPs others gene involve neurobiological pathway ( alteration may contribute suicidal behavior ) help advance knowledge genetic base suicide also identify new therapeutic target . On basis review literature , investigator identify candidate gene report associated suicidal event . The investigator target gene related central serotonergic noradrenergic neurotransmission , monoamine metabolism ( MAOA ) . The investigator also study gene involve glutamatergic neurotransmission ( GRIK2 , GRIA3 ) HPA axis ( FKBP5 ) gene code neurotrophic protein ( BDNF ) . DNA obtain saliva . All genotyping carry use standard polymerase chain reaction-based technique routinely use Human Genetics Laboratory . DNA segment contain target variable site amplify use unique sequence flank primer . Tests association genetic variant suicide attempt conduct use Chi square Armitage Trend Tests . Logistical regression analysis perform evaluate contribution individual genetic variant prediction suicide attempt , examine SNPs potential gene-gene gene-environment interaction .</detailed_description>
