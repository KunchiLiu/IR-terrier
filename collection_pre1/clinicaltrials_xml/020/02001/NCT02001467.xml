	<brief_title>The Effects Simulation-based Ultrasound Training Continuity Care Managing Pre-mature Onset Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman symptom premature onset labor typically manage midwife obstetrician shift responsibility patient care may result lack continuity care . This may , turn , result threat patient safety delay initiation treatment due long wait time . This study examine effect simulation-based ultrasound train management woman symptoms pre-mature onset labor . 12 midwife randomize simulation-based ultrasound training focus cervical assessment training ( control ) . The midwife intervention group train expert criterion high-fidelity transvaginal ultrasound simulator . Once level attain , continue clinical training proficiency perform cervical scan independently . Proficiency determine use previously validate assessment instrument ( Objective Structured Assessment Ultrasound Skills ) send picture Fetal Medicine Foundation certification programme . The number responsible health care practitioner provide care pregnant woman acute onset symptom premature onset labor register along time arrival hospital medical assessment treatment commence . Differences patient treat two group midwife compare period 6 month . During period patient symptoms premature onset labor include , small proportion admit examination treatment . The vast majority expect scheduled ambulatory follow-up .</detailed_description>
