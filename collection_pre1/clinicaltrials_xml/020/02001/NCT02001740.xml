There general agreement favour one form treatment , response particular treatment varies different series . A randomize controlled trial appear literature . Most showed improvement steroid use , result always statistically significant . One randomize control trial report superior result favor arthrographic joint distension steroid compare saline placebo . To knowledge similar randomize trial support result . The objective study determine arthrographic distension shoulder joint steriods effective treatment modality adhesive capsulitis compare injection local anesthetic contrast alone .
