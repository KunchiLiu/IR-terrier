	<brief_title>Effect Protein Supplementation After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery become major treatment option severe obesity adult . It proven efficiency regard weight loss benefit concern improvement even remission obesity relate comorbidities . Additionally , bariatric surgery procedure perform laparoscopically , decrease complication rate reduces postoperative pain . Despite advantage bariatric surgery , attention need pay possible risk follow surgical treatment . Postoperative risk often concern nutritional status . It show , beside different micronutrient deficiency , bariatric surgery also lead increase risk develop protein malnutrition . Discussed reason malabsorption nutrient restrict food intake surgery , may lead reduce protein consumption . Postoperative occurrence vomit different food intolerance may support effect . Accordingly , inadequate supply persists , protein deficit occur , turn , may lead undesirable reduction muscle mass plasma protein level . Based background , numerous study indicate increase incidence protein malnutrition bariatric surgery detect decrease level albumin prealbumin , significant reduction lean body mass , well inadequate protein intake surgical treatment . Dietary protein show play important role body weight regulation . There evidence protein-rich diet suppose facilitate weight loss , support successful weight maintenance , attain satiety preserve lean body mass . Therefore , use protein supplement bariatric surgery may minimize risk develop protein malnutrition hence optimize postoperative care . The primary aim randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind pilot study evaluate influence postoperative protein supplementation body weight reduction , body composition protein status .</detailed_description>
