	<brief_summary>Background Purpose : Fitness foundation health quality life individual . Recent change lifestyle eat habit Taiwan significantly increase prevalence metabolic syndrome may lead poor fitness subsequent coronary artery disease , cardiovascular disease diabetes . Although worker National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) undertake regular health fitness examination , examination include posture movement analysis exercise intervention provide metabolic syndrome . This study therefore aim conduct comprehensive health fitness examination worker NTUH examine whether exercise intervention could decrease risk factor enhance fitness risk metabolic syndrome . Methods : This study consist two part . In first part , 1102 worker NTUH administer comprehensive fitness examination ( body mass index , waist circumference , muscle strength , flexibility , balance , cardiopulmonary test , posture movement analysis ) assess Physical Activity Readiness Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain Scale International Physical Activity Questionnaire . Those worker risk metabolic syndrome ( N=240 ) assign control , home-based exercise , intensive exercise group 80 group . The home-based exercise group receive exercise instruction biweekly three month ; intensive exercise group receive moderate aerobic exercise strengthen exercise three time week three month . The worker insufficient fitness status ( N=240 ) assign control , home-based exercise , intensive exercise group . The home-based exercise group receive exercise instruction biweekly month ; intensive exercise group 80 group receive moderate aerobic exercise strengthen exercise three time week month . Descriptive statistic use estimate prevalence 1 , 2 ≧3 metabolic risk factor , poor fitness . One-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use examine relation metabolic syndrome risk factor fitness . One-way ANOVA use compare demographic characteristic control , home-based exercise , intensive exercise group . Two-way ANOVA repeat measure use examine metabolic syndrome risk factor fitness three group across time . Clinical relevance : Our result help understand health fitness worker NTUH assist establish effective exercise program risk metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
