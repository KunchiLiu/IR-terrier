	<brief_summary>This cross-sectional , observational study . Null hypothesis : There difference amount extracellular volume ( ECV scar ) hearts patient heart failure compare control subject . Heart failure occur heart muscle become weak work properly . It associate increase amount connective tissue ( collagen ) replace dead heart muscle cell ( scar ) . Currently biopsy muscle way measure amount scarring . This invasive rarely do child . Because , difficult measure amount scar particular patient disease process , important improve understanding treatment disease . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) non-invasive image tool routinely use look area local scar heart muscle . Because scar widespread paediatric patient , able use method previously . Now new image technique allow u look widespread scarring yet validate child . We plan use late gadolinium enhancement ( T1 mapping ) measure amount scar patient heart failure ( evidence heart biopsies show increased amount scar tissue ) child MRI scan reason . We use measure function include echocardiography 6 minute walk test compare amount scar . This help u know whether amount scar clinically useful . We look amount various protein blood patient control subject relate scar cell death process . We already use blood test monitor heart failure test may help u refine test improve timing treatment ( e.g . transplantation ) . This study help u design research field .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient care Great Ormond Street Hospital . Patient Groups : There three main patient group : 1 . Heart Failure Patients ( MRI Clinically indicate ) 2 . Heart Failure Patients ( Voluntarily recruit clinic ) 1 . 8-16 year age 2 . Non-GA 3 . Control subject ( Clinically indicate brain MRI contrast ) Patient recruitment We include Great Ormond Street patient trial know heart failure team diagnose DCM least 3 month . They establish diagnosis heart failure regular follow . Where possible , attempt align research study review date patient 's regular annual review . We include patient cardiac MRI scan contrast clinical reason . These patient age scan GA appropriate , In addition , recruit patient heart failure clinic due scan clinical reason . These patient 8-16 year allow cooperation MRI scan protocol without need general anaesthetic ( GA ) . Age-matched control patient routine MRI contrast non-cardiac MRI scan . They also blood test cardiac biomarkers time insertion cannula contrast injection . These patient identify require gadolinium contrast neurological imaging . They include patient awake sedate GA . These patient mainly routine brain MRI contrast epilepsy . Both group fully consent . Heart Failure Patients : We recruit patient refer cardiac MRI scan clinical reason well invite patient volunteer MRI . Patients require cardiac MRI clinical reason age 8 year allow cooperation MRI without general anaesthesia . Patients follow heart failure team contact primary care consultant first instance introduce study invite patient participate . It make clear obligation join study treatment unaffected decision . They free withdraw consent time . The patient invite phone study coordinator ( DP ) ask question , express willingness participate decline . Non-responders send one letter invitation . Control subject : Patients refer MRI department Great Ormond Street Hospital identify allocated neurological MRI protocol gadolinium enhancement . The radiologist allocate patient contact patient ' primary consultant inform study request permission contact family . The family contact permission give , first phone information sheet provide . The patient invite phone study coordinator ( DP ) ask question , express willingness participate decline . Non-responders send one letter invitation . Travel cost reimburse incur specifically participation study . Consent : Written , inform consent obtain participant choose take part study . Information sheet also provide patient ' GP cardiology physician , separate cardiology follow-up . Patients free withdraw time . Risks &amp; Burdens study protocol The main risk arise study relate insertion IV line administration gadolinium-based contrast agent . Such contrast agent widely use clinical practice extremely safe administer within standard dosage guideline . There , however , potential complication allergic reaction development Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) . Such allergic reaction rare occur , majority mild . To mitigate risk exclude patient previous history allergic response gadolinium-containing agent well severe atopic history history renal impairment . There know case NSF patient normal renal function ( 1 ) . We measure renal function patient within 1 month study . For patient scan specifically study , select patient 8 year age , avoid need general anaesthetic . We attempt select mainly patient require MRI scan contrast clinical indication . The control group consist MRI clinical indication . In case , burden increase time scanner around 20 minute obtain sequence require . Evidence institution show increase duration general anaesthetic harmful lead complication adverse event . We obtain blood sample serum bio-marker measurement haematocrit time IV line insertion represent additional intervention patient . We use local anaesthetic cream spray request patient use play distraction technique minimise distress . There potential adverse effect properly conduct transthoracic echocardiogram . The 6 minute walk test employ patient able willing participate . There potential adverse effect properly conduct MRI scan . The magnetic field RF pulse know cause physical harm properly select subject . Such selection involve careful screen patient ' medical history surgery accident might introduce metal body e.g . cerebral artery aneurysm clip metal foreign body eye . This require review patient 's note consent give write checklist time MRI scan . Such patient scan standard clinical practice would also exclude study . Therefore , realistic potential pain , discomfort , distress , inconvenience detrimental change lifestyle anticipate participant MRI scan . 1 . Dillman , J.R. , J.H . Ellis , R.H. Cohan , P.J .

Unexpected clinical finding If new abnormality medical issue come light result study investigation , patient 's GP hospital consultant inform .
