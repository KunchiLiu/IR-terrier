	<brief_summary>The investigator wish compare active runner healthy untrained control subject number parameter . The project aim understand underlie mechanism physical inactivity cause disease . This investigator study full spectrum physical activity , inert active people . The investigator already collect muscle biopsy establish stem cell people Type 2 diabetes , obese healthy normal weight healthy . In study , investigator establish cohort highly physically active marathon runner . In case-control design , investigator compare muscle stem cell function across entire spectrum physical activity / inactivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There never much focus run day . With knowledge investigator today , reason believe healthy run physical sense , perhaps also term brain function . However , previously carry extensive comparative study active runner healthy untrained control subject . In project investigator characterize degree training subject investigator carry various form physiological study subject ' fitness level . The investigator examine whether linkage training level brain function . The investigator also examine muscle function molecular level . The investigator isolate stem cell ( satellite cell ) muscle biopsy establish primary muscle cell culture . By electrical stimulation cell vitro , investigator emulate muscle contraction physical activity . The investigator test overall hypothesis physical activity affect stem cell function . The investigator study whether epigenetic phenomenon ( methylation ) select DNA sequence sensitive train level .</detailed_description>
