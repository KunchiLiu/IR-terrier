	<brief_summary>The Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid ( Baha ) system consist implanted part sound processor . The system provide hear solution subgroup patient sufficiently profit conventional hearing aid . Disadvantageous high rate ( 40 % ) associate peri-implant dermatitis . This research project part attempt reduce amount peri-implant dermatitis . Besides attempt Holgers identify skin flora relation infection around abutment use standard culture yield limited clinically relevant result , little known microbiome abutment interaction commensal skin flora . Moreover , conventional culture sensitive identify bacteria . In 2010 , Budding et al . introduce IS-pro . Is-pro novel 16S-23S rDNA interspace ( IS ) - region-based profiling method . This technology devise enable high-throughput molecular fingerprinting microbioma . Since IS-pro quick relatively inexpensive , environment also monitor time repeat test . This pave way research microbiome abutment could enable clinically objective follow treatment vivo use human host . This technique allow researcher even discover unknown , previously unidentified bacteria . Additionally , Scanning Electron Microscopy use assess spatial distribution composition bacteria abutment . The first step , use technique , determine bacteria inhabit abutment also relation surround skin . Additionally , relationship skin-implant infection effect treatment monitor . Depending primary scientific result , subsequent study devise study ( experimental ) treatment randomize , control fashion . Objectives study : 1 . To identify bacterial flora abutment phylum/species classification . 2 . To assess relationship commensal skin flora flora abutment study clinical sign peri-implant skin infection subsequent treatment associate change bacterial composition . 3 . To assess exists relationship skin hygiene transient skin flora .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . The patient least 18 year old 2 . The patient Cochlear Baha . A potential subject meet follow criterion exclude participation study exist : 1 . Participation Cochlear CBAS5439 study . 2 . The new abutment compatible current future hearing aid . 3 . Patients include arm ( control vs. case ) fill . 4 . A condition may impact outcome investigation judge investigator ( e.g . severe wound heal impairment ) . If reason note . In general , patient potentially could severe wound heal impairment base medical history exclude . This would include : Unregulated Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) . This base prolonged elevate HbA1c ( 3 month &gt; 7 % ) patient report difficulty regulate glucose and/or presence infectious disease related DM . Any systemic immunosuppressant usage ( e.g . corticosteroid ) . The usage topical systemic antibiotic could affect skin ( e.g . excludes systemic antibiotic urinary tract infection ) . Skin diseases ( e.g . case psoriasis , eczema skin disease past currently involve skin head , tendency arise disrupt skin well predictable location recurrence ) .</criteria>
