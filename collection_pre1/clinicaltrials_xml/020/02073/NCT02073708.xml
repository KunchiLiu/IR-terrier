	<brief_summary>One ten adults 20 % child Northern Europe diagnose asthma . Patients onset disease childhood patient adult-onset asthma common symptom aggravate exposure workplace . Work exacerbate asthma ( WEA ) define worsen asthma due condition work common median prevalence 22 % . However , additional research need improve understanding risk factor , mechanism outcomes WEA . Studies difference response exposures subgroup asthma patient may provide new insight also phenotypic heterogeneity asthma . The primary aim study estimate incidence rate asthma relation age , sex , socioeconomic factor occupational exposure prospective study . Recently , data respiratory symptom physician diagnose asthma collect 16.300 inhabitant Telemark County ( baseline study ) . A random sample baseline sample 1000 asthma case 1000 control ask participate medical examination blood pressure , lung function Fraction exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) measure . In addition , blood sample collect form analysis inflammatory marker gene sequence . The case-control study repeat five year ten year , found ( 5- 10-year follow-up ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Population-based Investigation Asthma Telemark Region Norway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses choice method : 1 . In large random sample population Telemark investigator estimate occurrence child-onset adult-onset physician diagnose asthma . Childhood asthma define person history physician-diagnosed asthma age &gt; 18 year . The case-control study allow identification specific exposure may associate increase decreased occurrence asthma exacerbation disease give opportunity compare difference outcomes child-onset adult-onset asthma . Previous study mainly use crude measure self-reported exposure biological dust , mineral dust , gas fume assess occupational exposure . This lead loss precision characterize exposure . In case-control study asthmatic two control receive comprehensive questionnaire mail ask answer additional question regard occupational exposure , nutrition physical activity . On basis questionnaire , job exposure matrix ( JEM ) establish participant . For participate medical consultation , questionnaires JEMs update review together patient structural interview . An occupational hygienist ass occupation expose , expose `` uncertain low expose '' validate use JEM ensure participant correctly classify . The JEM base Nordic matrix ( NJEM ) [ 1 ] change adaptable exposure condition Telemark , one main onshore industrial center Norway . This provide comprehensive exposure information . The use JEM expect also reduce risk information bias , specifically bias reporting exposure . Research indicate participant respiratory symptom over-state exposure without symptom understate exposure , bias effect estimate away null [ 2 ] . The use JEM provide objective less biased exposure estimate self-reports alone [ 3 ] . This allow good identification group risk . Whereas medical examination allow assessment severity disease provide basis study mechanisms WEA . 2 . In case-control study lung function , FeNO level inflammatory marker blood analysis heritability gene sequence perform . These outcome compare patient child- adult-onset asthma control . More 100 asthma candidate gene identify genome wide association study ( GWAS ) . However , causality variant detect GWAS questionable many asthma candidate gene replicate . This may part explain fact common genetic variant detect GWAS . Another possible explanation signal dilute phenotypic heterogeneity . Asthma know heterogenic disease , lack clinical description include asthma case genetic study recognize . The investigator meet challenge perform medical examination participant combination novel genetic method ( Next-Generation gene Sequencing ) . Rare variant detect Next-Generation gene Sequencing ( NGS ) asthma candidate gene may thus explain `` miss heritability '' asthma . A panel asthma candidate gene design , NGS exon flank intron sequence perform . 3 . The consumption health care service associate asthma estimate collection information case-control study participant ' relation use health service , hospital admission , consultation , surgery , medication , etc . The regional ethic committee give permission connect national register disability , sick leave unemployment make calculation , disability sick leave . The investigator study asthma-related sick leave disability relation occupation analyze data stratum gender , age , ethnicity , different level education occupation . The participant finn-inn questionnaire regard health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) baseline case control pre-defined time interval . Further , investigator measure occurrence cardiovascular disease , fatigue , chronic fatigue , anxiety depression since variable know influence patient ' HRQoL . The study provide unique opportunity report patient asthma experience treatment cope every-day life . Further , comparison HRQoL make patient work-related asthma without work-relation . The data analysis allow also identification subgroup poor perceive health help guide intervention improve situation .</detailed_description>
