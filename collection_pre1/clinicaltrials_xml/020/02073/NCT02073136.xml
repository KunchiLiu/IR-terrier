	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease struggle eliminate phosphate renal function deteriorates , result accumulation phosphate body . This show increase patient ' risk cardiovascular disease death . Even dialysis treatment patient excrete enough phosphate reach phosphate balance . The patient therefore recommend restrictive diet reach dialysis stage . It therefore important find way prevent accumulation phosphate body early disease process possible , without compromise nutritional status . Because phosphate occurs naturally many food , meat , fish dairy product , difficult reduce intake phosphate , without also reduce intake energy protein . Over past couple year increase focus use phosphate contain additive food industry . A reduction intake phosphorus contain additive may reduce accumulation phosphate body . This achieve decrease intake process food product . Because also time consume inconvenient patient keep strict diet , patient reasonable claim know effect achieve diet . This therefore seek explore follow study . The study conduct randomise crossover trial predialysis patient stage 3-4 .</brief_summary>
