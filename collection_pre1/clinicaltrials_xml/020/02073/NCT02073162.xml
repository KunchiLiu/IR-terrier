	<brief_summary>Physicians differ approach surgical fluid therapy , prefer high volume others low volume . Each approach potential advantage disadvantage . Currently , compel evidence one approach well . This study test whether give volume low end usual amount ( `` restrictive management '' ) different rate complication compare volume high end usual amount ( `` liberal management '' ) . This study compare liberal restrictive fluid management determine effect major complication abdominal surgery . Those take part study visit five time surgery hospital . Once discharged hospital , participant call 4 time telephone . Preadmission Clinic/Preoperative Visit - Sign consent document - Have blood draw standard preoperative test ( standard care ) - Have electrocardiogram ( standard care ) - Complete questionnaire disability ( research ) Day Surgery - Have blood drawn already do first visit ( standard care ) - Have electrocardiogram already do first visit ( standard care ) - Be randomly assign either restrictive liberal fluid management ( research ) Post-op Day 1 - Have electrocardiogram do ( research ) - Have blood draw standard test ( standard care ) - Have wind inspection , change dressing ( standard care ) - Complete questionnaire recovery ( research ) Post-op Day 3 - Have blood draw standard test ( standard care ) c-reactive protein , indicate infection ( research ) . - Have wind inspection , change dressing ( standard care ) - Complete questionnaire recovery ( research ) Day Discharge - Have wind inspection , change dressing ( standard care ) 30-Day Follow-up Phone Call - Complete questionnaire recovery ( research ) - Complete questionnaire disability ( research ) 3 Month , 6-Month , 12-Month Follow-up Phone Calls - Complete questionnaire disability ( research )</brief_summary>
