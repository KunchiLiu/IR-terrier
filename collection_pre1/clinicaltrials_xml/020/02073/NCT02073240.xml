	<brief_summary>Study Design : Stratified , match , cluster-randomized , controlled trial Unit Randomization : Healthcare facility Study Duration : 3 year ; prevalence latent Tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) healthcare worker ( HCWs ) measure baseline , LTBI incidence measure among susceptible HCWs 12 24 month . Secondary outcome measure 0 ( pre-intervention ) 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . In year three , result analyze disseminated . Study Components : Assessment institutional safety culture ; observations/audits Tuberculosis ( TB ) patient flow ( wait time ) HCW TB infection control ( IC ) practice ; documentation time interval process sputum smear initiation TB treatment ; facility assessment ; random allocation implementation enhance Tuberculosis infection control ( TB IC ) package ; test HCWs determine LTBI 0 , 12 , 24 month ; cost evaluation intervention . Sample Size : For cluster randomize design , estimate 11 cluster per group allow 77 percent ( % ) power identify 30 % reduction LTBI incidence intervention vs. control cluster . This assume LTBI incidence 5 % per year control group , design effect cluster 2.0 , cluster size 300 ( average 600 HCW per cluster 50 % LTBI prevalence baseline ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TB remain cause substantial morbidity mortality , affect estimate 13.7 million person result 1.8 million death worldwide . TB transmission well-documented wide variety healthcare setting . Moreover , global expansion HIV care program may inadvertently increase TB transmission healthcare setting congregate highly susceptible individual likely TB disease . The urgency reduce TB transmission healthcare facility intensify emergence drug-resistant TB strain , include extensively resistant TB strain , high mortality strain people live human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Healthcare worker higher risk TB infection disease compare general population , estimate 63-94 % TB infection 89 % TB disease population due occupational exposure . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) identify institutional TB IC one core `` 3 I 's '' intervention require reduce burden TB among people live HIV . Although TB IC guideline exist `` package '' intervention show successfully interrupt TB outbreak U.S. hospital , limited information feasibility , impact cost TB IC program middle- low-income country TB burden high nosocomial TB transmission well-documented . Currently recommend TB IC strategy complex multi-faceted include : administrative control ( e.g. , early identification , treatment , isolation cohorting infectious TB patient ) ; effective engineering/environmental control ( , general ventilation ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ) ; appropriate use respiratory protection ( N-95 particulate respirator ) protect HCWs . Implementation many recommend measure require administrative/managerial support sustain behavior change frontline staff ; require substantial healthcare expenditure . There urgent need simple , evidence-based cost-effective strategy help guide implementation TB IC program reduce institutional TB transmission resource-limited setting TB HIV endemic . A recent call address gap TB IC evidence base identify key priority include operational research investigate efficacy cost-effectiveness TB IC measure , behavioral research develop effective strategy inform , motivate provide skill HCWs implement sustain effective airborne IC procedure practice . This study directly address identified priority . At root , ensure good implementation TB IC procedures challenge HCW behavior change . Even appropriate use simple environmental control measure , require substantial element behavior change ensure effectiveness ; example , keep need window open , ensure need fan direct appropriately , ensure performance routine maintenance check equipment . In evaluation , propose intervention package focus tool technique support development institutional culture safety HCW behavior change regard TB IC practice . The theoretical framework intervention package base evidence show certain intervention favorably impact HCWs ' IC practice related patient outcome , specifically 1 ) audit feedback IC performance outcome data , 2 ) participation IC collaborative ( include mentor ) , 3 ) use standardize IC checklist . Audit feedback performance use decade strategy improve implementation adherence clinical practice guideline . Performance feedback similarly show effective intervention improve IC practice . Also , grow body evidence support use simple , evidence-based checklist effective IC strategy . When study , use checklist foster adoption best practice , result significant sustain reduction target healthcare-associated infection ( , surgical site infection catheter-related bloodstream infection ) . Checklists intend practical , easy-to-use tool design improve recall , prompt provider perform recommend infection prevention step , make clear minimum expectation IC . While checklist approach use widely aspects hospital IC , yet use widely airborne IC . Lastly , collaboratives use address variety health care issue study randomized trial , efficacy range -16 % 70 % . In Thailand , IC collaboratives associate low rate healthcare-associated infection well IC practice . In study , propose use robust study design implement multi-faceted TB IC package assess impact implementation TB transmission hospital clinic care provide patient TB potential airborne respiratory infection .</detailed_description>
