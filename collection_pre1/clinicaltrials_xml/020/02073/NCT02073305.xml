	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea prevalent end stage renal disease patient general population , may participate increase cardiovascular mortality observe group patient . Despite significant increase knowledge harmful effect obstructive sleep apnea general population , prognostic impact sleep apnea end stage renal disease population yet investigate . The purpose trial investigate hypothesis moderate severe sleep apnea increase risk major cardiovascular event patient end stage renal disease . The severity sleep apnea measure inclusion patient follow 3 year assess cardiovascular end-points . The result sleep study communicate treat physician decision whether treat sleep apnea leave treat physician , independently study protocol . The comparison include three group : patient without sleep apnea , untreated patient moderate severe sleep apnea treat patient sleep apnea .</detailed_description>
