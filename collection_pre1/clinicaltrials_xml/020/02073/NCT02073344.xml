	<brief_title>Effect Beginning Renal Replacement Therapy Obstructive Sleep Apnea End Stage Renal Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obstructive sleep apnea increase progress renal insufficiency . Recent observation suggest causative relationship overnight fluid displacement legs neck soft tissue severity obstructive sleep apnea . We suspect pathophysiologic mechanism could explain increased prevalence obstructive sleep apnea patient fluid overload , include chronic renal failure . The begin renal replacement therapy modify fluid balance end stage renal disease patient could therefore impact severity sleep apnea population . The purpose trial investigate hypothesis transition untreated end stage renal disease renal replacement therapy decrease severity sleep apnea , reduction fluid overload nocturnal rostral fluid shift . The severity obstructive sleep apnea measure two attended polysomnographies ( PSG ) , baseline PSG perform follow-up PSG perform 6 month begin renal replacement therapy . Overhydration leg fluid evaluate bioimpedance , perform begin end polysomnography . Patients yet begin renal replacement therapy 6 month baseline PSG re-assessed analyze control group</detailed_description>
