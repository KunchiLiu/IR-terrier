	<brief_title>HARMONEE - Japan-USA Harmonized Assessment Randomized , Multi-Center Study OrbusNEich 's Combo StEnt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 50 site propose Japan United States enroll 286 subject ( 271 evaluable ) 2 arm , total sample size 572 subject ( 542 evaluable ) admit hospital plan ( elective urgent ) percutaneous coronary artery intervention procedure . After stent implantation , subject contact follow-up 30 day ; 6 month ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year . At 12 month clinical evaluation complete cardiac catheterization angiographic assessment . Rationale : This study intend demonstrate Combo stent platform show superiority imputed BMS performance goal , noninferior effectiveness safety v best-in-class second-generation everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) ( Xience V , Xience Prime , Xience Xpedition stent ; [ Abbott Vascular/Abbott Vascular Japan ] ) , evidence mechanistic activity anti-CD34-Ab EPC capture technology healthy level intimal tissue coverage superior best-in-class EES . To ensure robustness interpretability result , current proposal include number unique design feature : - Largest randomize DES study ever perform Japan - Enriched population , include stabilize non-STEMI ( NSTEMI ) subject great likelihood plaque rupture associate clinical syndrome - Collaboration Japan United States `` Proof Concept '' program auspex Harmonization Doing Initiative , WG 1 , include concomitant enrollment U.S.A. sit FDA-approved IDE study - Head-to-head randomization state-of-the-art EES platform control , analyze clinical noninferiority - Statistical analysis v impute BMS analyze clinical superiority - Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) follow-up 100 % subject enrol , provide clinically relevant physiologic assessment subject 1 year ischemia-driven TVR analysis - Mechanistic OCT imaging observation 140 subject use 6 French catheter follow : - Cohort A ( 30 subject , 1:1 Combo EES ) : Mechanistic imaging observation provide serial 6 month 1 year OCT evaluation healthy intimal tissue coverage , intracoronary thrombosis , stent malapposition quantitative coronary angiographic ( QCA ) analysis ass 1 year late loss . - Cohort B ( 110 subject , 1:1 Combo EES ) : Mechanistic imaging observation assess 1 year OCT evaluation healthy intimal tissue coverage , intracoronary thrombosis , stent malapposition , QCA analysis ass 1 year late loss . Combined 12 month image Cohort A , study provide OCT QCA observation 1 year 140 patient , half Combo half EES . - Cohort C : 432 subject ( 216 subject per arm ) undergo clinical follow-up assessment FFR angiographic assessment 12 month . Cohort C last cohort enroll . - In 110 subject Cohort B , 30 day 1 year human antimurine antibody ( HAMA ) titer also collect .</detailed_description>
