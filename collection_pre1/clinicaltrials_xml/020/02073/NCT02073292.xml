	<brief_summary>Nerves body transmit signal brain cell body . In event injury disease , nerve transmit pain . Sometimes , injury n't heal , chronic pain develop . One way treat chronic pain interrupt pain signal . One method use Radio frequency ablation ( RFA ) . Radio frequency ablation ( RFA ) medical procedure heat generate high frequency electrical current order lesion ( burn ) nervous tissue . Radiofrequency ablation use treat many condition several area body include cardiac ( heart ) well chronic pain . Probes ( needle ) insert body specific location electrical current pass needle . This electrical current create heat body form small lesion burn specific place . Doctors use tool , fluoroscopy ( x-rays ) injection locate specific nerve transmit pain use electrical current destroy nerve . Equipment use include generator , build nerve stimulator , different needle probe water cool system case cool RFA . There several type probe needle use transmit energy create lesion . This study go compare 2 type - standard radiofrequency 'cooled ' radiofrequency . The difference 'cooled ' radiofrequency probe water run probe tip , keep tip cool allows large lesion make . Since doctor ca n't actually see nerve try target , large lesion theoretically improve chance hit . The 'cooling ' water also allow temperature low need standard RF . In study , investigator would like compare difference standard RFA ( 90°C ) `` cool '' RFA ( 60°C ) ablation technique determine one good pain relief . All probe use perform radiofrequency ablation FDA approve commonly use treat patient chronic back pain . Participating study involve randomly assign receive either standard cool RFA . The procedure standard cool RFA basically . The difference standard RFA , doctor may perform 2 lesion , instead 1 use cool RFA . Both study group receive local anesthetic prior procedure . The treat doctor use machine call C-Arm take x-ray . These x-rays guide doctor sure probe right place . Once probe placement confirm , doctor turn generator create lesion . This process repeat depend many lesion need create . After procedure follow visit 1 , 3 6 month . Level pain , health recovery information collect .</brief_summary>
