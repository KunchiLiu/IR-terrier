	<brief_summary>Drug serum concentration measure several time-points inflammatory disease patient treat anti-TNF agent . The purpose determine patient clinically benefit either discontinue treatment , adjust dose , switch another anti-TNF agent different class medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Crohn´s disease ulcerative colitis disease proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNF ) play important role . Anti-TNF agent use treatment . However , patient respond response rate declines time . The cause may immunogenicity agent , agent´s failure neutralize TNF another biological pathway lead inflammation . Anti-TNF agent administrate fixed dos certain frequency may optimal patient , recent study indicate correlation efficacy serum drug concentration level ( trough level ) . Our preliminary data suggest trough level early treatment course may predictive later trough level . By multiple measurement , assess . The study also investigate biological marker serum blood cell may predictable trough level . Finally , compare different method measure serum drug concentration .</detailed_description>
