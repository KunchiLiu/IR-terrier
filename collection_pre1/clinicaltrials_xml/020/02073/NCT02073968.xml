	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well intensity modulate radiation therapy adjust positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan together combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . In intensity-modulated radiotherapy , multiple beam angle dozens beam segment use deliver highly conformal radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving PET-adjusted IMRT together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET-Adjusted Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy ( base post-treatment PET finding ) dose-painted intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) concurrent chemotherapy locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( LA-NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy ( base clinical endpoint include locoregional control [ LRC ] , disease-free survival [ DFS ] , overall survival [ OS ] ) dose-painted IMRT concurrent chemotherapy LA-NSCLC . II . To evaluate safety dose-painted IMRT concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy LA-NSCLC . III . To evaluate utility post-treatment PET/computed tomography ( CT ) image predictor clinical outcome follow treatment novel approach . IV . To explore , preliminary manner , whether metabolomic marker blood urine prior course treatment associate treatment response , clinical endpoint , treatment-related adverse event radiation pneumonitis . OUTLINE : RADIATION THERAPY : Patients undergo PET-adjusted IMRT proton beam radiation therapy five day week 5 week . CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 6 week begin week 1 thoracic radiotherapy . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Beginning approximately 4-6 week completion radiation therapy esophagitis chemotherapy-induced neuropathy grade 1 less , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500 , platelet count &gt; 100,000 , patient may receive carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment may repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12-16 week , 19 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month total 5 year .</detailed_description>
