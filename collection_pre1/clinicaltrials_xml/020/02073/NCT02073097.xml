	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose carfilzomib give together rituximab combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth find cancer cell help kill . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It known carfilzomib combination R-CHOP good bad R-CHOP alone treat patient diffuse large b-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Rituximab , Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety carfilzomib combination rituximab-cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine , prednisone ( R-CHOP ) ( CR-CHOP ) patient newly diagnose diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) identify recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) . ( Phase I ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine CR-CHOP improves rate 1-year progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) non-germinal center ( non-GC ) DLBCL patient relative historical control treat R-CHOP ( Phase II ) II . To determine response rate ( complete partial remission ) non-GC DLBCL patient treat CR-CHOP compare historical control treat R-CHOP compare historical control treat R-CHOP . III . Because proportion ( ~10 % ) patient classify non-GC immunohistochemical ( IHC ) algorithm may activate B-cells ( ABC ) subtyped DLBCL , exploratory secondary objective compare PFS , OS response rate ABC subgroup patient DLBCL determine Gene Expression Profiling overall group non-GC DLBCL . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study carfilzomib follow phase II study . Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) least 90 minute , cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 3-5 minute , vincristine sulfate IV 1 minute day 1 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Patients also receive carfilzomib IV 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 9 . Courses repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 6 , 12 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
