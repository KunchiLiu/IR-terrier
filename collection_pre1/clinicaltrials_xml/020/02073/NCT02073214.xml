	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety probiotic foodstuff influence emergence development natural intestinal flora clinical status premature low birth weight neonate . The study also intend investigate reduction colonisation pathogenic bacteria estimate incidence gastrointestinal disorder . Probotic bacteria contain investigational product administer directly birth beneficial development normal gut microflora prevent significantly limit gastrointestinal colonisation pathogenic bacteria development pathogenic flora hospital setting . Permanent colonisation commensal flora early life improve gastrointestinal function premature neonates reduce onset decrease severity sign symptom feed intolerance generalise bacterial infection , include sepsis necrotizing enterocolitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oral Probiotic Supplementation Clinical Status Very-low-birth-weight Preterm Neonates .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates define low birth weight ( VLBW ) find number condition typical period life body weight birth . Perinatal neonatal infection relatively common baby , attribute immunological immaturity ( immature cellular humoral immune responsiveness ) insufficient gastrointestinal tract colonisation non-pathogenic bacteria , presence depend type delivery , feed environment neonate nurse . Neonates admit neonatal intensive care unit , particularly low birth-weight neonate bear prematurely congenital disorder , susceptible . Probiotics administer neonate know compete pathogenic bacteria essential nutrient receptor site , enzymatically modify toxin receptor . They also know produce antimicrobial substance , acidify intestinal environment stimulate immune system , help reach full maturity . These reason intestinal microflora normalisation help probiotic beneficial VLBW neonate , especially require intensive medical care . In review clinical study use probiotic NEC prevention neonate , demonstrate beneficial effect probiotic group VLBW neonates compare placebo . There scientific reason believe probiotic administer neonate modulate composition gut flora colonise intestinal tract beneficial development maturity immune system . In hitherto clinical study , specific probiotic strain find provide beneficial effect limit infection neonatal period , include necrotizing enterocolitis VLBW neonates . The purpose multicentre , randomize study investigate whether use probiotic preparation contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL53A Bifidobacterium breve PB04 influence emergence development natural intestinal flora clinical status premature low birth weight neonate reduction colonisation pathogenic bacteria estimate incidence gastrointestinal disorder . The study take place April 2012 July 2013 eight study centre Poland . It conduct accordance original protocol accord ICH-GCP requirement . The duration subject 's participation trial approximately 49 day , withdrawn discharge hospital , whichever come earlier , prior day 49 . As trial concern medicinal product foodstuff ( food special medical purpose ) require Authority approval subject relevant Ethics Committee approval . The study include neonate fulfil eligibility criterion , obtain informed consent parents/legal guardian , baby enrol study randomize one two study group : probiotic placebo . Investigational product administer first 48h life , time enteral feed . Efficacy evaluation determine whether investigational product positively influence emergence progressive development natural gut flora clinical status preterm VLBW neonates . As part efficacy evaluation , also examine whether probiotic agent capacity inhibit pathogenic colonisation reduce incidence gastrointestinal disorder , compare placebo . Safety evaluate determine whether investigational product VLBW preterm neonates increase AE/SAE incidence influence type adverse event serious adverse event compare placebo .</detailed_description>
