	<brief_title>Study IDO Inhibitor Combination With Checkpoint Inhibitors Adult Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence melanoma increase . Based upon data obtain 2004 2006 , lifetime probability develop melanoma United States estimate 1 37 men 1 56 woman . In United States , melanoma fifth lead cancer men seventh woman . Locally confine , fully-resectable disease may curable current therapy ; Stage IV metastatic disease ( relapsed/recurrent disease ) highly refractory therapy . Thus , experimental clinical trial provide accept treatment option metastatic relapsed/refractory melanoma . The current study design prospective trial evaluate combination indoximod checkpoint inhibitor adult patient metastatic melanoma . Ipilimumab , pembrolizumab nivolumab use recommend approved dos indication . The current trial do two phase : Phase 1b dose escalation indoximod combination ipilimumab , start half recommend single-agent dose , establish recommend Phase 2 dose combination . This follow three arm expansion study test fix dose indoximod ( recommended Phase 2 dose ) combine standard-dose ipilimumab , pembrolizumab nivolumab . Treatment administer outpatient basis . No investigational commercial cancer direct agent therapy describe may administer . Safety assessment follow guideline provide National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) Version.4.03 . Patients follow clinically radiographically start 12 week initiation treatment every 8 week tumor evaluation . Post-treatment scan compare baseline scan response assess base use mWHO immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) describe Wolchok et al . ( Wolchok et al. , 2009 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma . Patients must measurable disease , define lesion accurately measure 2 perpendicular diameter least one diameter &gt; 20mm &gt; 10mm conventional CT MRI 10mm x 10 mm spiral CT. No systemic treatment previous 28 day . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ipilimumab indoximod patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Patient adequate bone marrow organ function define follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL INR ≤ 2 x ULN Potassium , calcium , magnesium ≤ Grade 1 per CTCAE Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum Bilirubin , amylase lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( patient know Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN , direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ) AST ALT ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤ 5.0 x ULN hepatic metastasis present ) Serum Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL Patients must normal pituitary function define : free T4 , TSH within normal institutional limit ACTH within normal institutional limit Patients know brain metastasis eligible tumor treat definitive resection and/or radiotherapy neurologically stable least 1 month steroid . The effect indoximod develop human fetus unknown . For reason indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance fetus , sexually active woman childbearing potential must agree use two form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Use contraception abstinence continue minimum 1 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , discontinue study drug inform treat physician immediately . A pregnancy test require prior study enrollment monthly treatment indoximod woman childbearing potential . Also men discourage father child treatment . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients molecular target therapy ( include vemurafenib ) radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients prior therapy immune checkpoint inhibition indoximod exclude trial . Pretreatment immune modulators allow phase 1 component study . For Phase II component , patient exclude prior therapy immunestimulating agent include interleukin2 , interferon , CTLA4 PD1 antagonist , CD40 CD137 agonist , cancer therapeutic vaccine prior line metastatic disease . Interferons use adjuvant setting allow ( Phase 1 2 component ) . Patients know active , uncontrolled brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ipilimumab tryptophan contain substance . This would include Ltryptophan 5hydroxytryptophan supplement . Also patient history know hypersensitivity reaction mouse humanize monoclonal antibody exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( especially toxoplasmosis , could potentially worsen indoximod ( Divanovic et al. , 2012 ) ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study indoximod immunoregulatory agent potential abortifacient effect due fetal rejection maternal immune system . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother indoximod , breastfeed discontinue mother treated indoximod . Known HIVpositive patient acquired/inherited immunodeficiency ineligible due possibility affect response indoximod , high risk active opportunistic infection . Any cancer , unless patient diseasefree ≥5 year ( except treat cure basalcell squamouscell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , treat carcinoma situ cervix , breast , bladder treat localized prostate cancer undetectable PSA 2 year ) . Patients laboratory evidence pancreatitis exclude . Patients autoimmune disease ( e.g. , psoriasis , extensive atopic dermatitis , asthma , IBD , M.S. , uveitis , vasculitis ) , chronic inflammatory condition , condition require concurrent use systemic immunosuppressant steroid reason exclude study . Patients isolated vitiligo remain eligible . Any patient allotransplant kind would exclude well , include xenograft heart valve . Mild , intermittent asthma require occasional betaagonist inhaler use mild localized eczema exclude . Chronic use immunesuppressive drug ( ie , systemic corticosteroid use management cancer noncancer relate illness , eg , COPD ) . Patients receive investigational agent .</criteria>
