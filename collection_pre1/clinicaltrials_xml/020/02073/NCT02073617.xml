	<detailed_description>Calcific degenerative aortic valve disease one common valvular disease among elderly , life expectancy continue increase , major source burden current healthcare . Although patient aortic stenosis ( AS ) remain asymptomatic prolonged period , eventually develop symptom , include angina , exertional syncope heart failure , associate 5-year , 3-year , 1-year , respectively , 50 % mortality . The American College Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline place symptomatic severe AS class I indication aortic valve replacement . Currently , surgical replacement aortic valve standard care . However , recently approve Edwards-Sapient TAVR device ongoing investigation use CoreValve TAVR device , patient ineligible high risk open-heart surgery eligible undergo TAVR . Currently , patient select TAVR undergo EKG-gated cardiac Multislice CTA evaluate aortic valve anatomy aortic root dimension device size . Patients also undergo coronary angiography define coronary anatomy . Both test utilize contrast medium visualize anatomy , may result contrast-induced nephropathy anywhere 7.5 % 50 % patient depend associated clinical risk factor . Contrast-induced nephropathy , turn , lead dialysis and/or increase mortality . There need consolidate pre-operative test whenever possible , real-time 3-dimensional visualization aortic valve root anatomy use DynaCT cardiac acquisition cath lab angiography suite coronary angiography , may benefit reduce contrast load ( 20 35cc DynaCT , 100cc CTA ) . DynaCT conduct fully automatic aortic root segmentation overlay 3-dimensional structure onto 2-dimensional fluoroscopy second ( ~5 second , 60 frames/second rotational angiography ) . The software automatically recognize represent aortic root , detect indicate coronary ostia low cusp point aortic valve ( nadir point ) , reconstruct commissure line aortic valve . Due cardiac motion , 3-dimensional image without motion correction cardiac gate look blur . Therefore , DynaCT reconstruction motion correction software use . The DynaCT motion correction software new algorithm correct motion apply reconstruction- allow user spin without use rapid pacing . However , first , comparison aortic valve root measurement use CTA DynaCT must make affirm accuracy DynaCT v CTA gold standard . Study Design This pilot study evaluate patient undergo TAVR New York University ( NYU ) Langone Medical Center . Patients undergo standard CTA protocol invasive coronary angiography perform part pre-operative assessment TAVR . However , patient study also undergo DynaCT coronary angiography , utilize 1 acquisition sweep 20 35cc contrast medium . Measurements major aortic annulus diameter , orthogonal minor aortic annulus diameter , aortic annulus perimeter , maximum ascend aorta diameter 40mm annulus , sinus Valsalva diameter , sinus Valsalva height , aortic root angulation make use CTA DynaCT protocols radiologist blind patient identity study reach target recruitment . Based measurement , train interventional cardiologist select appropriate TAVR size similarly blind fashion study reach target recruitment ( i.e . data collect use DynaCT use clinical decision make process ) . Data compare modality use appropriate test reproducibility correlation . Study Technique CTA perform per standard method part standard pre-TAVR evaluation . Coronary angiography perform via femoral artery access ( minimum 6Fr ) per standard pre-TAVR evaluation . After coronary angiography perform , 6Fr pigtail catheter place aorta 40cc 50 % contrast medium dilute normal saline deliver use standard automate injection dynaCT cardiac image acquisition . As per standard care , intravenous access obtain participant hydrate CTA , coronary angiography , dynaCT procedure .</detailed_description>
