	<brief_summary>A primary focus University Florida ( UF ) Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center ( OAIC ) build comprehensive understanding cause consequence decline physical function disability development among old adult . To date investigator largely focus sarcopenia , age-related decline skeletal muscle mass strength , primary contributor physical decline . However , recent finding indicate change central and/or peripheral nervous system may play large role previously think development functional limitation . These field hold extensive promise identify novel contributor age-related functional decline . Therefore , overarch aim project develop ability RC1 ass novel neural contributor mobility overall physical function . Importantly , development technique provide RC1 tool evaluate potential involvement central peripheral nervous system age-related functional decline disablement . The primary aim project develop technique quantify peripheral motor unit number size well spinal cord integrity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As part participation , subject attend 4 visit . During visit follow testing may occur : - Vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure ) , height weight measure . - Tests assess mobility question physical function . These test list conducted particular order , take approximately 1.5 hour complete . - Walking test , - Tests physical ability include : 1 . Standing chair different height 2 . Lying floor rise stand position 3 . Kneeling floor rise stand position 4 . Climbing flight stair 5 . Lift weight laundry basket place shelf - Muscle strength test perform legs arm . - Questionnaires address physical function . - Muscle nerve test do . - During test , sensor wear forehead use invisible light indirectly measure blood flow blood oxygen content brain . In addition , sensor may wear finger measure skin conduct electricity . A chest strap measure heart beat also wear . These measure safe provide information nervous system respond physical and/or mental challenge . - Tests do measure memory , attention , vocabulary , problem solving , plan skill . - A bone density body composition measure ( scan ) machine call DEXA . DEXA scan , like x-ray , painless , involve exposure small amount radiation . - Images brain take use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure allow doctor look inside body use scanner sends strong magnetic field radio wave . All test do study use diagnose treat medical problem . The expected length participation approximately six hour total , course 4 separate visit .</detailed_description>
