	<brief_summary>The present proposal aim ass whether combined rehabilitation approach use virtual reality base therapy motivational feedback , levodopa pharmacotherapy standard rehabilitative occupational therapy physiotherapy lead signifcantly good outcome stroke recovery . It randomise control trial blinding assessor . It preceeded Phase 1 pilot trial VR physiotherapy standard therapy . Recruited in-patient rehabilitation ward patient recently suffer stroke randomize , computer-based random number generator , either one two treatment arm : 1 . Control occupational therapy + pharmacotherapy 2 week 2 . Assisted Virtual-Reality physiotherapy + pharmacotherapy 2 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design single-blinded randomized control trial , preceeded Phase 1 pilot trial VR physiotherapy standard therapy . Phase 1 comprise recruitment 5 patient recently suffer stroke inform receive ten 15- 30 minute VR therapy addition standard stroke therapy . They receive pharmacotherapy period . At start end VR phase , clinical assessment ( Fugl-Meyer score , Action Research Arm Test ) make patient blind clinician investigator . From data , calibration VR program make ensure reproducibility effectiveness movement assess . Subsequently , main phase trial , recruit in-patients recently suffer stroke randomize , computer-based random number generator , either one two treatment arm : 1 . Control occupational therapy + pharmacotherapy 2 . Assisted Virtual-Reality physiotherapy + pharmacotherapy Each patient receive initial functional Magnetic Resonace Imaging ( fMRI ) scan prior start study . The initial pilot single-centre study run Singapore General Hospital Rehabilitation Ward across 2-week period , participant undergo daily 15-30 minute VR base therapy addition physiotherapy/occupational therapy session receive daily . The VR therapy session consist subject interact computer-based program guide avatar gather item use flexion extension gesture affect upper limb . VR therapy session last 15-30 minute depend subject 's tolerance participation . For patient unable overcome gravity fully , still participate therapy rest arm table . Patients receive single dose 100mg levodopa combination benserazide 2-3 hour additional half hour occupational therapy weaker arm VR therapy session , depend assign group . At start end trial , clinical assessment ( Fugl-Meyer score , Action Research Arm Test Functional Independence Measure ) make patient blind clinician investigator . At final ( 10th ) session , patient undergo final fMRI scan . MRI scan analyse blinded assessor .</detailed_description>
