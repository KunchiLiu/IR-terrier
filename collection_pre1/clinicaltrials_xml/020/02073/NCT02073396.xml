	<brief_summary>Patients coronary artery disease ( CAD ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increase risk stroke heart attack . Such event usually cause increased stickiness blood cause blood clot block artery ( thrombus ) heart brain . The aim study assess stickiness blood ( global thrombotic status ) patient CAD AF baseline clinical stabilisation see disease state clinical treatment affect stickiness blood ( thrombotic status ) . This single centre study . Patients diagnose CAD AF blood sample take baseline clinical stabilisation . Blood stickiness test Global Thrombosis Test . The result evaluate assess effect disease process clinical state blood stickiness gain understanding condition form basis future study aim identify patient high risk future cardiovascular event , base increase blood stickiness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Thrombotic Status Patients Risk Cardiovascular Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired thrombotic status associate adverse cardiovascular event . Patients coronary artery disease ( CAD ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increase risk thrombotic event . It know whether thrombotic status differs patient , thrombotic status alters response clinical stabilisation treatment . The aim study ass global thrombotic status ( stickiness blood ) patient coronary artery disease atrial fibrillation baseline clinical stabilisation . This small , pilot , hypothesis-generating study . Design Single centre , hypothesis-generating study . Patients diagnose coronary disease ( n=70 ) atrial fibrillation ( n=70 ) recruit amongst in-patients out-patients , blood draw presentation clinical stabilisation . Blood test assess global thrombotic status . The recruitment period 3 year .</detailed_description>
