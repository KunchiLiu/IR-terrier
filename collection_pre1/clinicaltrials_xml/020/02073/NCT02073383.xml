	<brief_summary>The brachial plexus block anesthetic technique often use surgical procedure upper limb . The brachial plexus block axilla ( BPVA ) one techniques commonly use obtain regional anesthesia upper limb , perform anesthesia terminal branch brachial plexus , would ulnar , median , radial musculocutaneous nerve . With aid ultrasound , two technique use perform BPVA . The first , know multiple puncture technique , local anesthetic deposit around nerve want block . This technique commonly use perform BPVA . The second technique , know 2 injection , local anesthetic deposit axillary artery around musculocutaneous nerve . This technique propose try reduce execution time anesthesia . Studies actually show technique 2 injection show less time perform block , success rate . However , technique 2 injection show long latency high rate vascular puncture . ( 14 ) In order perform procedure short execution time , without change latency , success rate ensure patient safety , investigator design protocol evaluate three technique perform ultrasound- guided axillary brachial plexus block .</brief_summary>
