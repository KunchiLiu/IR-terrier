	<detailed_description>Constipation common condition . Perception healthy bowel movement varies widely within among population Rome III Criteria standardise tool diagnosis functional constipation basis follow symptom last 3 month symptom onset least 6 month prior diagnosis : 1 .

Loose stool rarely present without use laxatives 3 . Insufficient criterion irritable bowel syndrome Additional extremely uncomfortable , untreated constipation lead faecal impaction ( result faecal incontinence ) , particularly elderly confuse people believe risk factor haemorrhoid ( pile ) diverticular disease .

The daily use laxative long term often advise make body dependent , cause bowel long function normally . Stool soften physician 's first step management chronic constipation . Psyllium show soften stool increase stool water content , far common dietary fibre . It form soft gel ease stool along low digestive tract ready evacuation . This bulkier faeces press wall intestine , stimulate muscle contract force content forward , process know 'peristalsis ' . If insufficient fibre diet , faeces move slowly time water absorb ingest food rest body , leave faeces small harder , turn difficult move . Psyllium advantage much gentler common fibre ( wheat bran ) irritate sensitive bowel . Studies use psyllium range dose 7g 24g day show positive result relation increase stool frequency weight , improve stool consistency , turn improve associate abdominal pain discomfort . These result applicable adult elderly . Although psyllium work much gentle natural way , study see superior comparative commonly use laxative . Probiotics add advantage improve stool frequency consistency accompany abdominal pain , likely positive effect gut microflora often see imbalanced constipation . These effect see infant , adult elderly adverse event induce loose stool . Lastly , inulin range dose 1.5g 50g day see improve beneficial bacteria count also bowel transit infant , adult elderly one study see effective common laxative without side effect . This study aim increase body scientific data psyllium way randomise , placebo-controlled study .</detailed_description>
