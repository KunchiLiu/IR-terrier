	<brief_summary>Living donor liver transplantation ( LDLT ) , involve complex system process care particularly vulnerable medical error preventable complication . This ancillary study Adult-to-Adult Living Liver Transplantation Cohort Study ( A2ALL ) focus conduct proactive , systematic , comprehensive assessment vulnerability system process LDLT care reduce medical error preventable complication thereby improve safety LDLT care . This project address important gap knowledge need achieve high quality safe LDLT care patient develop process : 1 ) proactively , systematically comprehensively identify area vulnerability LDLT care result medical error , 2 ) design implement solution mitigate weakness , 3 ) evaluate effectiveness solution improve safety LDLT care measure clinical process outcome solution implementation across four A2ALL participate transplant center</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A2ALL-Patients Safety System Improvements Living Donor Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational well time-controlled study conduct four participate A2ALL Deux Transplant Centers ( TCs ) . The study divide three phase : observational phase ( Aim 1 ) conduct comprehensive proactive patient safety risk assessment describe preventable complication , near miss event , medical error hazardous condition delivery standard care live donor liver transplant ( LDLT ) donor recipients time admission LDLT surgery discharge LDLT surgery . The depth observational phase continue throughout study schedule complete end study ( May 2015 ) . In phase 2-solution development implementation phase ( Aim 2 ) : two high priority area care identify depth assessment solution development . The selection two high priority area LDLT standard care guide identification vulnerability system process care high incidence severity relate preventable complication medical error across four participate A2ALL Deux TCs . To date , multiple priority area identify , base ongoing review medical record ( e.g. , transition care , glucose control , donor pain management , preoperative OR set-up ) . The participate A2ALL Deux TCs agree focus depth assessment two area demonstrate high incidence high severity preventable complication medical error : 1 ) donor pain management 2 ) preoperative OR set-up process . 1 . Donor Pain Management : Upon investigation , identify live liver donor experience significant amount pain , early postoperative period also especially day donation . Data four participate A2ALL Deux TCs reveal 20 % incidence , overall , respiratory complication ( e.g . re-intubation , requirement application Naloxone , etc . ) directly relate opioid use present LDLT standard care donor pain management . Based data , clinician four participate A2ALL Deux TCs , consultation international pain expert particular expertise transplantation ( Paul White , MD University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas , Dallas , Texas ) , develop evidence-based donor pain management solution aim reduce preventable complication well improve donor pain experience . This evidence-based donor pain management solution develop month in-person telephone meeting transplant surgeon , hepatologists , anesthesiologist acute pain specialist four participate A2ALL Deux TCs , addition research team . Consensus reach key element evidence-based donor pain management solution four participate A2ALL Deux TCs poise begin implementation . 2 . Preoperative OR Set-up Process : Preventable complication , near miss event , medical error hazardous condition related preoperative OR set-up process identify . The four participate A2ALL Deux TCs need engage additional review detail assessment standardization optimization preoperative OR set-up process , collaboratively design standardized process four month period ( expect conclusion mid February 2014 order incorporate occur Collaborative site overall ) . Solutions design collaboratively reduce incidence severity relate medical error preventable complication together TCs staff . The measurement solution impact reduce preventable complication medical error ( Aim 3 ) involve implementation two collaboratively developed solution : ( 1 ) Evidence-based donor pain management solution ( 2 ) Standardization optimization preoperative OR set-up process . During phase relevant metric pre- post-implementation compare assess effectiveness implemented solution .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A. Clinicians 1 . Clinicians gender , race/ethnicity include . Only clinicians unwilling participate exclude . 2 . Clinicians staff involve care LDLT donor recipient ( e.g. , nurse , surgeon , anesthesiologist , hepatologists , unit secretary medical surgical unit , ICU , transplant coordinator , pharmacist ) four participate A2ALL Deux TCs . B . Patients 1 . Every donor ( â‰¥ 21 year ) recipient involve LDLT four participate A2ALL Deux TCs 20042015 , enrol A2ALL cohort study Un and/or Deux . ( However , date medical record review perform patient involve LDLTs 2008 later . Observations initiate December , 2011 ) . After enrollment patient A2ALL Deux cohort study end ( anticipate May 2014 ) , LDLT donors recipient four participate A2ALL Deux TCs approach enrollment ancillary A2ALL R01 patient safety study . 2 .
