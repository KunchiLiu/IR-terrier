	<brief_title>Optimizing Prevention Healthcare-Acquired Infections After Cardiac Surgery ( HAI ) _2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 400,000 coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) procedure perform every year United States ( U.S. ) . Patients undergo CABG surgery risk number adverse sequela , many impact survival contribute overall health-care cost . Healthcare-acquired infection ( HAIs ) , include pneumonia superficial deep sternal wound infection , occur among 16 % CABG patient elevate patient 's risk mortality add excess upfront long-term expenditure health care system . A number barrier prevent wide-scale improvement HAl rate within set CABG surgery . While number HAl prophylaxis measure develop , measure fully encompass set practice may impact patient 's risk HAl . Identifying cardiac surgery specific risk factor would serve foundation target quality improvement strategy . In absence definitive data concern best practice , HAl prophylaxis variable across surgeon institution , result unnecessary morbidity cost . Prior work show value implement evidence-based protocol general intensive care unit set . To extent implementation cardiac surgery specific standardized practice result low HAl rate uncertain . An understanding effectiveness approach would certainly assist surgeon institution provide safer care patient population . Rates HAIs vary 0-26 % across 33 institution perform CABG surgery Michigan . This application seek reduce rate identify subsequently implement standardized practice , evaluate impact HAl rate . This study base prospective data regional quality improvement activity infrastructure Michigan Society Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative ( MSTCVS-QC ) . The investigator evaluate effectiveness standardized practice reduce HAIs regionally relative national rate time period . The investigator conduct qualitative interview hospital personnel regard HAI prevention practice , use cod data interview assist develop standardized practice .</detailed_description>
