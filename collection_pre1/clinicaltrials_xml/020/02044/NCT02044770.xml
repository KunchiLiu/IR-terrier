	<brief_title>ENSEAL® G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer Laparoscopic Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ENSEAL® G2 Tissue Sealer sterile , single-patient use surgical instrument use coagulate transect vessel include 7mm diameter tissue and/or vascular bundle . In preclinical research use ENSEAL tissue sealer , burst pressure 51 % high perpendicularly seal vessel angle seal ( p &lt; 0.001 ) seal length primary variable determine burst pressure ( Voegele AC , 2013 ) . These result suggest strong possible seal may obtain vessel approach perpendicularly angle . However , desire angle vessel seal always obtain surgical field , especially laparoscopic surgery due mostly fixed nature abdominal wall cannula lack adequate articulating hemostatic tool . Since strong vessel seal important adequate homeostasis , value articulate vessel-sealing device primarily reside ability maneuver around corner behind structure confine space . An articulate vessel-sealing device would maximize ability approach vessel bundle perpendicular manner provide great seal strength . ENSEAL ART first articulate advanced bipolar device facilitate laparoscopic surgery 5mm port . The instrument shaft , achieve 110 degree articulation ( improve visibility tip device 's jaw ) gain access tissue challenge anatomy , especially deep/tight space , facilitate additional angle transect seal tissue , vessel , vascular bundle . The articulation feature improve ergonomics ENSEAL ART may provide ability maneuver around corner behind structure , make easy capture full vessel single bite . These feature may lead reduction number port , instrument exchange port , need pas energy device assistant , number time surgical table tilt change certain laparoscopic surgical procedure ( e.g. , colectomy ) . This study focus primarily report initial user-centered interaction ENSEAL ART device . The users device board-certified colorectal surgeon , use actual clinical setting ( i.e. , laparoscopic colectomies ) . After obtain Institutional Review Board approval , study site begin recruitment study participant . At participate study site , 8 14 participant undergo laparoscopic colectomy use ENSEAL ART vessel dissection sealing , accord institution 's standard approach . Video recording laparoscope external camera capture device activation complete ENSEAL ART device use articulation vs. straight ( without articulate ) . After surgical case , PIs complete survey relate perceived advantage articulate feature ENSEAL ART context experience use non-articulation tissue sealer . PIs also complete assessment ( use validate tool ) perceive workload use ENSEAL ART device . The digital video record surgical procedure evaluate consultancy group - Design Science Consulting Inc. ( Philadelphia , PA ) , specialize conduct field research variables pre-established protocol . Design Science third party reviewer , associate study site . Subject-related data collect limited age , gender , diagnosis , Medical History , adverse event associate use device .</detailed_description>
