	<detailed_description>This study examine effect HIV clinic-based multi-component intervention HIV patient ' subsequent viral load status attendance HIV primary care . The intervention clinic-wide targeted component . The clinic-wide component give HIV patient attend clinic primary care include : ( 1 ) patient behavioral screening use provider clinical care patient ( 2 ) dissemination palm card contain message importance adhere antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , come clinic regularly , safe sex . The targeted component focus patient whose viral load exceed 1000 copies/mL . Targeted component include : ( 1 ) interactive computer-based intervention ( CBI ) complete twice ( separated 2-4 month ) patient clinic ( 2 ) referral one-on-one counseling train project Health Coaches patient 's viral load show 1-log reduction first CBI remain 200 copies/mL two administration CBI . Patients individually randomly assign arm . The multi-component intervention evaluate use group-randomized design . Clinics randomize either Panel A Panel B intent equate two panel percentage patient suppress viral load prior implement intervention . Three clinic ( Panel A ) begin intervention activity , three clinic ( Panel B ) delay onset intervention activity 16 month thus serve concurrent control group 16-month period . This enable between-panel comparison outcome time interval . The primary analytic cohort group-randomized analysis patient Panel A Panel B whose viral load exceeds 1000 copies/mL schedule primary care appointment 7-month enrollment period . Viral load eligible patient Panel A part analytic cohort regardless whether enroll CBI . These viral load eligible patient represent group patient target main intervention component ( CBI counsel ) , accordingly , comprise denominator ( estimate 2,794 ) primary analysis viral load clinic attendance outcome . Each cohort member Panel A follow 9 month purpose deliver intervention assess outcome . Each cohort member Panel B follow 9 month purpose assess outcome . Two secondary level analysis also perform . First , analysis perform focusing patient Panel A clinic viral load 1000 copies/mL receive least one administration CBI ( `` as-treated '' approach ) . Outcomes patient compare patient Panel B whose viral load exceeds 1000 copies/mL recruitment period . Second , analysis perform clinic-wide level include patient Panel A clinic regardless viral load level schedule primary care recruitment period . Outcomes patient compare patient Panel B schedule primary care visit recruitment period .</detailed_description>
