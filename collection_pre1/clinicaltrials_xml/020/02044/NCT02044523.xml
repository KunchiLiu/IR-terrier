	<brief_summary>Liver fibrosis important public health problem , substantial morbidity mortality due progression cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . All cause chronic liver disease may lead fibrosis . The traditional diagnostic approach require biopsy assess severity liver disease prior therapy . However , liver biopsy several limitation : cost , sample error , procedure-related morbidity mortality . Considering high prevalence viral hepatitis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , condition often associate obesity type 2 diabetes , urgent need noninvasive screening , diagnosis monitoring strategy chronic liver disease severity . Our team expertise investigate ultrasound-based magnetic resonance-based elastographic method noninvasive stag liver fibrosis . The primary objective cross-sectional study compare sensitivity elastographic method detect histology-determined significant fibrosis . The secondary objective compare diagnostic accuracy elastographic method influence potential confounders ( inflammation , steatosis iron deposition ) diagnostic accuracy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Noninvasive Staging Liver Fibrosis : MR v Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Liver fibrosis important public health problem , substantial morbidity mortality due cirrhosis ( end stage ) hepatocellular carcinoma . All cause chronic liver disease may lead fibrosis . The amount fibrosis determine prognosis influence response treatment chronic liver disease . Several elastographic method propose noninvasive detection stag liver fibrosis . Transient elastography ( Fibroscan ) widely use clinician . Acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI ) elastography technique recently integrate clinical ultrasound system may provide similar diagnostic performance transient elastography . Magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) new method integrate liver MRI study , would allow liver stiffness , steatosis , iron overload inflammation quantification chronic liver disease . Objectives : 1 ) To compare sensitivity MRE ARFI detect histology-determined significant fibrosis ( F â‰¥ 2 ) . Secondary objective : 2 ) To compare diagnostic accuracy MRE , ARFI Fibroscan predict histology-determined fibrosis stage . 3 ) To determine influence inflammation , steatosis , iron deposition diagnostic accuracy MRE , ARFI Fibroscan predict fibrosis . 4 ) To determine threshold optimize sensitivity ARFI Fibroscan screen patient optimize specificity MRE confirm liver fibrosis stage . Design : This cross-sectional imaging trial compare feasibility , diagnostic fibrosis stag accuracy stiffness measurement elastographic method 108 patient chronic liver disease , use histopathology reference standard . Paired index test ( MRE , ARFI Fibroscan ) perform research procedure close temporal proximity reference test ( liver biopsy ) . Inclusion criterion : consecutive adult patient know suspected chronic liver disease secondary hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) undergo liver biopsy clinical indication . Exclusion criterion : contraindication MRI , refusal participate provide informed consent , pregnant woman , cause chronic liver disease hepatitis B , hepatitis C NAFLD .</detailed_description>
