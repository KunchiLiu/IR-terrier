	<brief_summary>Although clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) remain mainstay ensure complete low-pressure bladder empty neurogenic bladder ( NB ) patient , form vehicle bacterial entry colonization urinary tract , lead recurrent urinary tract infection ( RUTI ) renal damage . Up 25 % NB patient CIC suffer RUTI daily , low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis widely prescribe prevent infection . Unfortunately , therapeutic option evidence-based associate high risk RUTI secondary development antibiotic resistance . In addition , many child suffer range adverse reaction emergence drug resistant organism . Moreover , recent study show antibiotic cause major disruption human microbiome , potentially lead long term major problem . Probiotics live microorganism , administer adequate amount confer health benefit host . There evidence probiotic restore microbial homeostasis vagina , reduce risk pathogen ascension bladder , modulate immunity well protect host . Probiotic strain , include Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 , Lactobacillus reuteri B-54 RC-14 , show safe efficacious oral formulation vaginal suppository improve microbiota profile vagina decrease risk RUTI . Various mechanisms appear involve , include modulate antimicrobial inflammatory defense , up-regulating protective mucin production reduce pressure pathogen acquire antibiotic resistance gene . A randomized trial compare probiotic antibiotic prophylaxis child vesicoureteric reflux show equivalent reduction incidence RUTI development new renal scarring . In addition , regulation inflammatory cytokine potentially favorably alter bladder function prevent bladder fibrosis . Investigators London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) opportunity acquire clinical data would strengthen case probiotic integrate pediatric urology practice manage CIC RUTI . This would first study pediatric NB patient . The main objective study determine whether use probiotic ( lactobacillus ) decrease impact adverse side effect antibiotic resistance see prolong use antibiotic patient neurogenic bladder condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Probiotics Used Prevention Recurrent UTI Paediatric Neurogenic Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From Dr. Dave 's practice 53 suitable patient use CIC manage NB disease , receive long term , low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis design prevent RUTI identify . On average , another 5 eligible patient would expect within six- month window . From pool , study enroll 36 adolescent â‰¥ 12 year age . They history RUTI past 12 month receive chemoprophylaxis least one month . The study design report conform CONSORT guideline . Patients enrol informed consent baseline evaluation include history physical examination , verification previous culture prove UTI . A urine sample obtain use clean catheterization subject : urinalysis , microbiome , metabolome , bacteriological culture antibiotic resistance assessment , assay marker inflammation . A stool sample also collect analyse gut microbiota drug resistance profile E. coli . Each patient receive counsel baseline 3 month follow ensure adequate fluid intake , proper clean intermittent catheterization technique frequency , the- counter treatment constipation . Post catheterization bladder scan perform ensure completeness bladder empty . Baseline bladder renal function assess . Investigators expect interest patients/parents practice least study entail check-up condition manage , u able provide additional information microbiota urine stool . Thus , patient wish randomize receive probiotic change probiotic regimen , still include control group remain prophylaxis ( 12 subject ) . Investigators would expect bacterial drug resistance profile intestinal side effect remain unchanged next six month . For 24 subject interested consider different approach care , randomize use computer generate randomization sequence balance block randomization ( block size= 4 ) , pre generate , allocation perform use sealed envelope third party preserve allocation concealment recruit physician . A 1 : 1 allotment perform 2 study group : 12 patient continue antibiotic prophylaxis also receive daily probiotic capsule , 12 randomize receive probiotic drug placebo six month washout period 1 week . Patient parent blind partially achieve patient take two pill day , placebo pill capsule resemble active product . The placebo drug use similar appearance sugar base pill active ingredient . The probiotic capsule contain food grade excipients present probiotic capsule . Patients supply pill capsule 3- month duration . In addition , laboratory technician outcome assessor ( data entry analysis ) blind patient allotment . Antibiotic prophylaxis consist Septra ( trimethoprim 2 mg/kg ; sulfamethoxazole ) ( 12 control 12 randomize antibiotic probiotic arm ) . Probiotic therapy comprise two capsule RePhResh Pro-B ( approve Health Canada sell Shoppers Drug Mart Canada ) , consist 5 billion total organism L. rhamnosus GR-1 L. reuteri RC-14 per capsule . The capsule add milk orange juice patient unable swallow . All 36 patients/parents ask keep diary record use medication ( OTC medication cold , flu , others ) ask take probiotic product ( include probiotic yogurt ) study duration . In addition , patient fill questionnaire week ( study duration 6 month first baseline visit conduct ) ass range potential adverse event ( constipation , diarrhea , bloating , nausea , pain , fever ) scale 1-10 . At three month follow-up compliance assess return empty product container , review diary . A second course three month treatment provide . At three six month 's clinical assessment , urine stool sample provide . At 6 month follow-up , patient receive renal ultrasound ass health upper renal tract , well post-catheterization bladder scan cystometry . During study , patient two episode UTI treated alternative antibiotic prophylactic regimen .</detailed_description>
