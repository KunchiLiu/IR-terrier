	<brief_title>Filgrastim , Cladribine , Cytarabine , Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-intensified mitoxantrone ( mitoxantrone hydrochloride ) part G-CSF ( filgrastim ) , cladribine , cytarabine , mitoxantrone hydrochloride ( G-CLAM ) regimen separately adults newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) relapsed/refractory AML receive first great salvage therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine , within limit phase 1/2 study , disease response duration remission separately patient newly diagnose relapsed/refractory AML . II . To describe , within limit phase 1/2 study , toxicity profile study regimen separately patient newly diagnose relapsed/refractory AML . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study mitoxantrone hydrochloride follow phase II study . INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY ( G-CLAM ) : Patients receive G-CLAM chemotherapy comprise filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 0-5 , mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1-3 , cladribine IV 2 hour daily day 1-5 , cytarabine IV 2 hour daily day 1-5 . Patients achieve complete remission incomplete peripheral blood count recovery ( CRi ) , partial remission , persistent disease may receive second course induction chemotherapy . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) CR incomplete platelet count recovery ( CRp ) may continue Consolidation Chemotherapy . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY ( G-CLA ) : Beginning within 6 week achieve CR/CRp/CRi , patient receive G-CLA comprise filgrastim SC day 0-5 , cladribine IV 2 hour daily day 1-5 , cytarabine IV 2 hour daily day 1-5 . Treatment continue 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
