This Project compare effectiveness `` blend '' telephone-delivered collaborative care intervention treat HF depression : ( 1 ) collaborative care HF-alone ( `` enhance usual care '' ; eUC ) ; ( 2 ) doctor ' `` usual care '' depression ( UC ) .

	<brief_title>Blended Collaborative Care Heart Failure Co-Morbid Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) important public health problem affect approximately 6.6 million Americans . Despite improvement cardiac care , remain leading cause hospitalization among Medicare patient major cardiovascular disease whose mortality rate remain essentially unchanged past decade . This failure improve HF outcome may due , part , unrecognized and/or inadequately treat depression highly prevalent HF patient . Yet new HF treatment guideline advocate routine screening depression , recommendation unlikely widely adopt without trial evidence depression care improve outcomes efficient method provide . `` Collaborative care '' strategy increasingly utilized improve care HF chronic medical condition , recently demonstrate clinical cost-effectiveness treat depression follow coronary artery bypass graft surgery . Yet may impractical health care delivery system support separate treatment program HF depression . Thus encourage emerge evidence indicate `` blend '' collaborative care strategy target psychiatric physical condition produce great improvement mood symptom control cardiovascular risk factor program focus solely depression propose test novel adaptation could provide routine care . The Specific Aims Project : ( 1 ) evaluate effectiveness telephone-delivered `` blend '' collaborative care intervention treat HF depression could adopt routine clinical practice proven effective ; ( 2 ) advance understanding moderator mediator depression treatment clinical outcome . We screen hospitalized patient systolic HF depression , randomize 625 screen positive least moderately elevated level depressive symptom two-weeks follow hospital discharge either : ( 1 ) collaborative care treat HF depression ( `` blend '' ) ; ( 2 ) collaborative care treat HF alone ( enhanced usual care ( eUC ) ) ; ( 3 ) doctor ' `` usual care '' ( UC ) . Additionally , enroll 125 non-depressed HF patient well evaluate benefit derive treat depression ( total N=750 ) . Our co-primary hypothesis test whether `` blend '' collaborative care produce 12-months follow-up : ( A ) 0.50 effect size ( ES ) great improvement health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) vs. UC ; ( B ) 0.30 ES great improvement HRQoL vs. eUC . Secondary hypothesis evaluate effect `` blend '' intervention mood , functional status , adherence guideline-consistent care , incidence cardiovascular event , health care utilization , cost . Improving chronic illness care medically complex patient one major challenge face medicine today . We propose test effectiveness innovative , efficient , scalable , sustainable intervention could transform way HF cardiovascular disorder treat routine practice .</detailed_description>
