	<brief_summary>Taxotere current standard first-line chemotherapy mCRPC may use second-line therapy good responder first-line ( Taxotere rechallenge ) . Jevtana demonstrate survival benefit versus mitoxantrone patient progress Taxotere standard second-line chemotherapy . Taxotere Jevtana different toxicity profile . Many patient receive Jevtana second-line treatment indicate prefer agent Taxotere regard general tolerance ( namely peripheral neuropathy , nail change , asthenia ) . This expect since Jevtana post-Taxotere setting associate grade 3-4 adverse event febrile neutropenia diarrhea Taxotere first-line setting . The study design CABA-DOC similar PISCES trial evaluate patient preference two standard treatment first-line metastatic kidney cancer . Despite similar PFS improvement placebo phase III trial , result clearly show patient preferred pazopanib sunitinib . A randomized phase III study currently compare efficacy Taxotere Jevtana first-line set overall survival primary end-point . Assessing patient preference Jevtana Taxotere would contribute identify difference two taxanes clarify one two taxanes use second-line chemotherapy perhaps first-line chemotherapy future . Assessing patient preference two taxanes might less biased first-line setting patient previous experience taxane .</brief_summary>
