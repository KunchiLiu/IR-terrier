	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( ) measure brain structure , metabolism ( brain use energy ) , function predict response electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) treatment depression ; ( b ) measure ECT change brain metabolism function . We ask undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) three session : ( 1 ) prior first ECT therapy session , ( 2 ) 4-6 ECT therapy session , ( 3 ) approximately two month follow first ECT therapy session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim study potential MR image biomarkers derive f-MRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) , DTI ( diffusion tensor image ) , proton MR ( magnetic resonance ) spectroscopy patient undergo ECT severe depression related major depressive disorder ( MDD ) bipolar disorder ( BD ) . Subjects undergo MR imaging session 1.5 hr duration 3 time point : A ) prior initial ECT therapy ; B ) within 24 hr follow initial ECT therapy ; C ) 60-days follow initial ECT therapy . Imaging measure correlate clinical measure disease severity time point A B order ascertain potential utility image biomarkers prediction therapy response . Our goal identify MR image biomarkers may convey prognostic information could useful management depression . Secondarily , multi-modality MR image approach yield functional connectivity data ( rest state use emotional regulation paradigm ) , white matter tract-based spatial statistic , proton MR spectroscopy-derived metabolic information facilitate exploration physiologic mechanism ECT therapy . Twelve subject recruit clinical population already diagnose depressive episode require ECT . Patients invited participate study consent ECT . Written consent obtain study procedure conduct . Patients meet exclusion criterion exclude participate study . Collected data include : ) measure depression severity ( HAM-D , BDI ) b ) multi-modality image data ( fMRI , diffusion tensor imaging , proton MR spectroscopy , anatomic MR imaging ) .</detailed_description>
