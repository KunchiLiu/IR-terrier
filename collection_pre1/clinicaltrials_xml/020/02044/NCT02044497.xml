	<brief_summary>Oxycodone oral opioid analgesic commonly prescribed management pain post-operative patient Boston Children 's Hospital . Oxycodone widely use adult child relieve post-operative pain . However , pharmacokinetics ( body ) pharmacodynamics ( work ) well establish child . Some child , specific genetic make-up , may metabolize drug quickly therefore may risk side effect commonly prescribe dose . We would like find drug absorb , metabolize excreted child . In order study aspect , would like give oxycodone surgical patient Boston Children 's Hospital measure metabolic activity also perform genetic analysis . The genetic testing specifically analyze follow genotype : cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , represent difference cytochrome P450 metabolism oxycodone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxycodone commonly use analgesic management moderate severe postoperative pain . The efficacy Oxycodone potent opioid confirm child . The principal metabolic pathway oxycodone humans N-demethylation via enzyme CYP3A4 generate inactive noroxycodone . [ 6 ] A small amount ( approximately 11 % ) O-demethylated cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 become oxymorphone , active potent metabolite exhibit 40 time affinity 8 time potency Î¼-opioid receptor compare mother substance . Approximate frequencies cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 phenotypes Caucasian population : poor metabolizers 5 - 10 % , extensive/intermediate metabolizers 65-90 % , ultra-rapid metabolizers 5 - 10 % . Kirchheiner colleague notice codeine-related sedative side-effects ultra-rapid metabolizers . In study investigate extensive poor metabolizers , codeine side-effects seem relate CYP2D6 genotype . However , clinical investigation CYP2D6 genotype postoperative pain set show conflict result , well-designed prospective study lack . Taken together , result demonstrate need careful pharmacokinetic study child receive pharmacologic agent , oxycodone , metabolize enzyme CYP2D6 . The population PK oxycodone metabolites fully establish oral oxycodone pediatric patient . In addition , group ultra-rapid metabolizers ( approximately 4.5 % population , high 20 % particular ethnic group ; East African Saudi Arabian population ) may risk serious side effect commonly prescribe dose ( extrapolated adult recommendation ) . Given BCH switch ( codeine ) oxycodone common opioid prescribed postoperative patient recent concern serious side effect codeine . It important investigate oral oxycodone optimize dose recommendation .</detailed_description>
