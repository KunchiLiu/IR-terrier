	<brief_title>Current Practice Pattern Effect Training Upper Endoscopic Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endoscopic examination indicate diagnosis variety gastrointestinal disease screen neoplastic lesion . Especially , Korea stomach cancer prevalent area , high-quality endoscopic examination require overlook pathologic lesion . Endoscopic biopsy gold standard confirmation endoscopic diagnosis . It usually decide base abnormal morphology lesion color change mucosa . Diagnostic accuracy know improved training use optical technique chromoendoscopy . With development endoscopic image technology narrow band imaging ( NBI ) , confocal image magnify technique , diagnostic accuracy enhance . However , inspection conventional white light endoscopy still prevalent basic form screen surveillance endoscopy . Thus , detect lesion meticulous inspection accurate approach target biopsy important diagnosis pathologic lesion . However , optimal number biopsy detection rate neoplastic lesion establish . This study aim evaluate current practice pattern effect train conventional upper endoscopic biopsy .</detailed_description>
