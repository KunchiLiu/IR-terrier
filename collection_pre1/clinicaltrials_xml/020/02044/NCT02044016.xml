	<brief_title>The Achilles Tendon Length Measure ( ATLM ) - Development Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show Achilles tendon elongation compare un-injured leg negatively associated clinical outcome strength gastrocnemius muscle . Despite knowledge , lack valid score system measure length Achilles tendon daily clinical practice . Patients , follow rehabilitation program Department Physiotherapy , also Achilles tendon examine lengthening physiotherapist , evaluate heel progress plan . Of concern , examination base measure , thoroughly validate . The ATLM test use test position lower limb use Matles test . Besides observe foot 's position , measure distance point reference foot examination coach . Reproducibility responsiveness ATLM examine , concurrent validity examine ultrasound goniometry measure . The ultrasound consider precise , secure objective measure . The ATLM goniometer measure conduct 8 16 week injury . At 8 week two physiotherapist conduct measure ( investigate inter-tester reliability ) . The ruler goniometer number hide . A third physiotherapist read result 8 16 week , physiotherapist blind towards result . A person blind result conduct ultrasound .</detailed_description>
