	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate experimental malaria vaccine ability prevent malaria infection disease blood-stage challenge model ( volunteer infect malaria parasite use malaria-infected red blood cell ) . The vaccine test protein call FMP2.1 , give adjuvant ( substance improve body 's response vaccination ) call AS01B . The aim use protein adjuvant help body make immune response part malaria parasite . This study enable assessment : 1 . The ability vaccine prevent malaria infection . 2 . The safety vaccine healthy participant . 3 . The response human immune system vaccine . This do give participant three vaccination expose malaria infection transfuse small number red blood cell infect malaria carefully regulate condition . Participants follow closely observe develop malaria . If vaccine provide protection malaria , participant take long develop malaria usual develop malaria . The study enrol 15 participant vaccinate challenged malaria addition recruit 15 individual control subject .</brief_summary>

Female subject child bear potential must willing ensure practice continuous effective contraception duration study Able ( Investigator 's opinion ) willing comply study requirement Willing allow General Practitioner consultant , appropriate , notified participation study Agreement permanently refrain blood donation , per current UK Blood Transfusion Tissue Transplantation Services guideline ( 73 ) . Reachable ( 24 hour day ) mobile phone period CHMI completion antimalarial treatment . Willingness take curative antimalaria regimen follow CHMI . Answer question inform consent questionnaire correctly . History clinical malaria ( specie ) . Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month significant risk malaria exposure . Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day CHMI ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . History sickle cell anaemia , sickle cell trait , thalassaemia thalassaemia trait haematological condition could affect susceptibility malaria infection . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment previous severe adverse reaction blood transfusion . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( malaria infection ) . Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Use medication know cause prolongation QT interval exist contraindication use Malarone . Use medication know potentially clinically significant interaction Riamet Malarone . Contraindications use three propose antimalarial medication ; Riamet , Malarone Chloroquine . Any clinical condition know prolong QT interval . Family history congenital QT prolongation sudden death . Positive family history 1st 2nd degree relative &lt; 50 year old cardiac disease . History cardiac arrhythmia , include clinically relevant bradycardia . An estimate , ten year risk fatal cardiovascular disease â‰¥5 % , estimate Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) system . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . In event abnormal test result , confirmatory repeat test may request discretion Investigator . Absolute value exclusion confirm abnormal result show Appendix A . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 standard UK unit every week . Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Seropositive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) screen . Any significant disease , disorder , find may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data . Volunteers unable closely follow social , geographic psychological reason .</criteria>
