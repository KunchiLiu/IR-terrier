In PGP , endurance capacity standing , walk sit diminish . The diagnosis PGP reach exclusion lumbar cause must reproducible specific clinical test . While various pain mechanism include mechanical , hormonal , inflammatory , neural propose development PGP , etiology pathogenesis poorly understood . It possible musculoskeletal change influence hormonal ( Relaxin ) elevation pregnancy predispose pregnant woman acute musculoskeletal injury present clinically PGP . An inflammatory response acute musculoskeletal injury well described3 may also occur pregnancy related PGP particularly give musculoskeletal vulnerability time . Though PGP common pregnancy , study date investigate efficacy anti-inflammatory treatment pregnancy relate PGP order well establish contribution inflammation etiology pregnancy relate PGP .</detailed_description>
