	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Tripterygium Glycoside Treatment Crohn 's Disease Induction Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease characterize inflammation ulceration small intestine colon . Patients commonly experience abdominal pain , diarrhea，malnutrition malaise result decrease quality life increase risk chronic disability unemployment . Tripterygium Glycosides ( T2 ) chloroform/methanol extract Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F ( TWHF ) , traditional Chinese medicine , use rheumatoid arthritis nephritis . It immune-modulatory anti-inflammatory activity . Our previous animal study reveal major component T2 , triptolide , could prevent development chronic colitis interleukin-10 deficient mouse . The phase I clinical trial institute also demonstrate T2 efficient induction remission patient mild moderate active crohn 's disease . The common adverse effect T2 leucopenia , liver renal toxicity , oligospermia amenorrhea . The purpose study assess effect safety Tripterygium Glycosides treatment Crohn 's disease induction remission compare therapeutic effect patient receive mesalazine .</detailed_description>
