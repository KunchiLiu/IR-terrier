	<brief_summary>Approximately 20,000 child per year North America present hospital severe shock . Children develop condition low blood pressure result may suffer damage internal organ may even die . Some child condition may significantly benefit use steroid steroid patient may also potential side effect . Therefore important study use steroid carefully child . The STRIPES research program examine effectiveness safety steroid child . Before conduct large , randomize control trial ( RCT ) , pilot study ( STRIPES Pilot Study ) conduct multiple site across Canada . The STRIPES Pilot Study allow test STRIPES study protocol small group patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steroid Use Pediatric Fluid Vasoactive Infusion Dependent Shock - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-centre pilot RCT determine feasibility full trial effect steroid versus placebo child fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock . The principal investigator colleague recently publish two article topic select Feature Article Feature Review June edition Pediatric Critical Care Medicine . Both publication strongly support interest area accompany editorial strongly support need well-designed RCT . RATIONALE : Approximately 20,000 child per year present emergency department , pediatric ward intensive care unit North America fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock . This severe type shock result significant morbidity carry 2-10 % mortality rate depend setting occurs . This form shock think arise dysfunction hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis variety mechanism refer relative adrenal insufficiency critical illness relate adrenal insufficiency . Many clinician believe corticosteroid improve outcome patient therefore use confront critically ill child fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock . However , effectiveness safety steroid replacement therapy pediatric shock remain demonstrate . OBJECTIVES - PILOT STUDY : Before embark multi-centre definitive trial address question list , STRIPES Pilot Study 3 specific feasibility objective : 1 ) To estimate rate patient recruitment understand barrier recruitment ; 2 ) To assess adherence specific treatment protocol ; 3 ) To document frequency understand reason open label steroid use . OBJECTIVES - FULL RCT : Following successful completion STRIPES Pilot Study , next phase large , multi centre RCT answer follow question : 1 ) What effect hydrocortisone versus placebo time discontinuation vasoactive agent among pediatric patient fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock ? ; 2 ) In patient fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock , effect hydrocortisone versus placebo ) pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) mortality ; ii ) duration mechanical ventilation ; iii ) new onset organ dysfunction ; iv ) PICU length stay ; v ) incidence adverse event ? RESEARCH PLAN : The STRIPES Pilot Study design pragmatic , multi-centre , double blind , RCT intravenous hydrocortisone versus intravenous placebo fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock . This study aim enroll 72 patient 7 pediatric centre across Canada one year period . Patients recruit Emergency Department PICU within 6 hour star vasoactive agent . Research ethic board approval obtain participate centre application defer consent make 5 site . Health Canada approval require hydrocortisone approve use child dos indication use study . As part pragmatic design , prescriptive component protocol limited administration wean study drug . The requirement intubation , mechanical ventilation , sedation analgesia , use hemodynamic trigger endpoint , red cell transfusion , antibiotic fluid bolus leave discretion treat physician . The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Flowchart attach study protocol easy reference treat physician use mandate ; however , use vasoactive infusion therapy record . The proposed duration treatment range minimum 20 hour maximum 7 day study drug . Outcome data , include survival status frequency adverse event , collect daily discharge hospital . Although primary focus pilot study determine feasibility conduct clinical outcome base RCT steroid versus placebo shock , pilot also provide excellent opportunity perform exploratory mechanistic study . These include 1 ) comparison total free cortisol level patient shock ; 2 ) measurement stratification biomarkers ; 3 ) determination 25 hydroxyvitamin D 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D level admission . Patients access blood sample consent obtain blood sample send mechanistic study . Patients randomize hydrocortisone placebo arm use web-based , centralized permute block randomization , stratify centre . All study personnel ( overall study research coordinator , research assistant , site investigator , principal investigator , co-investigators , data management personnel , statistician ) , member health care team ( treat physician , bedside nurse , clinical pharmacist ) patients/families blind study group assignment . SIGNIFICANCE : Results STRIPES Pilot Study provide essential feasibility data plan conducting large , multi-centre trial help establish role steroid child fluid vasoactive infusion dependent shock . There special challenge patient recruitment critically ill pediatric population , adherence treatment protocol limitation open label use steroid , STRIPES Pilot study help address . Success STRIPES Pilot Study base ability achieve three feasibility objective list . If pilot study demonstrate feasibility , major protocol change need , safety concern raise Data Safety Monitoring Board , result pilot study roll full trial . However , criterion meet , protocol re-evaluated feasibility result pilot study publish independently .</detailed_description>
