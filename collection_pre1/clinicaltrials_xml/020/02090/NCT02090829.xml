	<brief_summary>: The objective study determine tolerability therapeutic potential oxytocin child adolescent Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) pair computer game intervention design enhance face perception skill . We designate two measure primary outcome , base prior publish work intervention , propose sample base power analysis prior result . A second objective study learn breadth possible positive effect combination therapy might child ASD . To end , include host exploratory measure assess aspect social motivation attention , social perception , social cognition . Thus , second objective conduct `` signal finding '' study - gather outcome data range dependent variable theoretically related oxytocin 's effect social process , prior data . The signal finding aspect study provide preliminary data need design target follow study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind placebo-controlled trial intranasal oxytocin 52 child adolescent ASD . Diagnosis confirm use Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM ) criterion , support Autism Diagnostic Interview Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule . Subjects randomize 24 IU intranasal oxytocin placebo 5 day period concomitant game play FaceStation computer game , develop CHOP . Measures social function cognition administer game play period . Two measure social function serve primary endpoint ; measure treat exploratory variable , significance test correct multiple comparison . Recognizing face critical social functioning , improve individual ASD use intervention software form appropriately design computer game . The effect type social intervention may amplify concurrent use oxytocin . Furthermore , learn effect may impact social skill general translate level individual 's everyday social behavior .
