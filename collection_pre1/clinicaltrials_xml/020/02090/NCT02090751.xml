	<brief_summary>Age Related Macular Disease ( AMD ) easily lead cause blindness old people develop country . It affect 30 50 million individual worldwide , around 30 % 65 's show early sign disease . Severe AMD devastate impact quality life ; cause extensive visual impairment , make read difficult drive impossible . Patients lose independence become major burden public health system . Present treatment option limit . Many new therapy development need evaluation use test high specificity sensitivity early AMD . The present application develop instrument . The prototype fund previous i4i FS ( feasibility study ll-FS-0110-14036 ) . The new device measure sensitivity dim flicker light use principle establish european conformity mark ( CE mark ) instrument . The original method involve light different wavelength high intensity . The instrument study ass night vision , selectively damage early stage AMD . In low lighting , investigator vision depend specialized rod photoreceptors . Cone photoreceptors , provide daytime vision , remain normal early stage disease . By time patient complain reduce ( cone-based ) visual acuity , disease many year lose many thousand photoreceptors .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Device Measure Dark Adaptation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical environment dark adaptation ( DA ) measure expose patient brief bright light measure sensitivity flicker light . This sensitivity recovery typical appearance ; early rapid recovery mediate colour vision system ( cone photoreceptors ) slow recovery low light system ( rod photoreceptors ) . If measurement make black background bi exponential model suitable , however dim luminous background use recovery well model exponential bi linear model . We use exponential bilinear model , seven parameter . The parameter follow ; exponential cone phase model cone threshold , cone coefficient , cone time constant . The S2 rod phase model commencement time . This time rod system become sensitive cone system , sometimes call cone-rod break point ( alpha ) slope subsequent threshold . The late rod phase ( S3 ) similarly model transition time rod-rod breakpoint ( beta ) slope . If initial bright light sufficiently intense recovery rod phase ( S2 ) term rate limit . There evidence recovery rate useful measure health light sense layer eye adjoin tissue , retina , retinal pigment epithelium choroid . It tissue think affected age relate macular disease . In study measure rate rod recovery sometimes call S2 phase . We want see whether measurement use identify patient without early macular disease .</detailed_description>
