	<brief_summary>Sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) patient experience organ damage begin early age result significant morbidity early mortality . Although SCA patient share genetic mutation , clinical complication highly variable patient experience frequent severe complication , others serious complication . If SCA severity could predict early life , patient great risk complication could receive treatment prior onset organ damage . No general SCA severity predictor one informative early life exists . The investigator preliminary research identify absolute reticulocyte count ( ARC ) potential early predictive risk marker SCA complication pediatric patient . A high ARC age 2 6 month age associate increase risk hospitalization first 3 year life ; mean ARC 36 patient hospitalize SCA complication significantly high remain 23 hospitalize . Moreover , total hospitalization nearly three time high age 2 year infant ARC &gt; 200 infant whose ARC &lt; 200 . The propose study determine ARC use risk-stratifier asymptomatic infant SCA ascertain value target hydroxyurea therapy infant high risk SCA sequela .</brief_summary>
