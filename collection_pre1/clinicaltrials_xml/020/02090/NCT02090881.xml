	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) affect haemoglobin - molecule blood cell carry oxygen . It cause red blood cell become abnormal crescent ( sickle ) - shape . Sickled red blood cell travel small blood vessel easily normal red blood cell lead blockage . This mean oxygen may prevent get need . Individuals sickle cell disease also suffer form abnormality line blood vessel , contributes damage . Damage blockage occur blood vessel brain mean child sickle cell disease significant risk suffer stroke . Research show transcranial Doppler ultrasonography use set identify child risk get stroke . Ultrasound therefore used child sickle cell disease measure blood flow vessel brain . This research form basis National Health Service ( NHS ) Standard Care Sickle Cell Disease United Kingdom ( UK ) use transcranial Doppler ultrasonography year screen child sickle cell disease age 2 16 . Ultrasound use portable , use ionise radiation x-ray , non-invasive give good result . However , result dependent operator . This mean screening service provide centre excellence experience scanning staff visit clinic small hospital portable machine . There lack research comparing use portable machine laboratory-based machine . This important screening identify child high risk stroke may use clinical staff make decision care child .</brief_summary>
