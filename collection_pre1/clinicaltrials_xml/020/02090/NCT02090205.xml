	<brief_summary>Background There unanimous opinion lung-protective strategy cardiac surgery . Small randomize clinical animal trial suggest ventilation cardio-pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) could protective lung . This evidence base surrogate end-points study limit elective coronary surgery . According available data , optimal strategy lung protection CPB recommend . The purpose CPBVENT study investigate effectiveness different ventilation strategy CPB post-operative pulmonary complication . Trial design The CPBVENT study single-blind , multicenter , randomize control trial . We go enroll 780 patient undergoing elective cardiac surgery plan use CPB , aortic cross-clamping two lung ventilation . Patients randomize three treatment group : 1 ) ventilation CPB ; 2 ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) 5 cmH2O CPB ; 3 ) ventilation 5 acts/minute tidal volume 2-3 ml/Kg PEEP 3-5 cmH2O CPB . The primary end-point incidence PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200 time discharge ICU . The secondary end-points incidence post-operative pulmonary complication 30-days mortality . Patients followed-up 12 month date randomization . Summary The CPBVENT Trial determine whether different ventilation strategy CPB improve pulmonary outcome patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Respiratory failure ( RF ) common complication cardiac surgery , global incidence 20-25 % . Its clinical manifestation range mild form respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) require prolonged mechanical ventilation ( MV ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay . The pathophysiologic mechanism RF quite complex , know cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) play main role determine lung injury . A number factor contribute injury : atelectasis , hyper-oxygenation cause release free radical CPB-related systemic inflammatory response . It 's common practice suspend ventilation CPB , since lung function carry extracorporeal gas-exchanger . Moreover absence lung movement clearly facilitate surgery . However , interruption MV CPB associate development micro-atelectasis , hydrostatic pulmonary edema , reduce lung compliance surfactant diffusion . A recent observational study identify duration CPB important risk factor development microbiologically-documented pneumonia . During last year ' several preventive lung protective strategy investigate propose : ultrafiltration remove neutrophil , control hemodilution ( hematocrit higher 23 % ) , steroid MV setting CPB , application Positive End-Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) 5-15 cmH2O , low tidal-high frequency ventilation ( 100 acts-per-minute ) , application 100 % oxygen inspire fraction ( FiO2 ) , bilateral CPB , involve lung blood-oxygenation . A recent meta-analysis base sixteen clinical trial find increase oxygenation reduction shunt fraction immediately wean CPB CPAP apply CPB . Similar result obtain lung recruitment maneuver end CPB . Furthermore , maintain MV whole duration extracorporeal circulation would reduce CPB-related inflammatory response tissue damage . Unfortunately , although adequately plan , study power enough recommend maintain MV CPB evidence-based strategy prevent respiratory complication , major indicator clinical outcome ( i.e. , duration postoperative MV , length ICU hospital stay , long-term follow-up ) investigate . Therefore , accord available data literature , unquestionable standardize strategy lung protection CPB recommend . Objectives We design randomize control trial investigate effect three different ventilator strategy short , medium long term . We test hypothesis MV CPB would reduce lung damage , define incidence RF ( PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 ) post-operative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) . See Appendix 1 complete definition PPCs . METHODS Trial design The CPBVENT study non-pharmacological , multi-center , single-blind , randomize control trial . The study register ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT02090205 endorse Study Group Cardiothoracic Vascular Anesthesia SIAARTI ( Italian Society Anesthesia Intensive Care Medicine ) . Participants After Ethics Committee approval , go enroll patient age 18 undergoing elective cardiac surgery plan use CPB , aortic cross-clamping , median sternotomy two lung ventilation . All patient provide write informed consent inclusion trial . End-points The primary end-point reduction incidence PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200 discharge Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . The secondary end-points evaluation following : - readmission ICU RF , - need re-intubation , - need noninvasive ventilation , - duration mechanical ventilation , - length ICU hospital stay , - cardiovascular complication , - short-term long-term mortality , - post-operative infection , - Post-Operative Residual Curarization ( PORC ) : measure Train Of Four ( TOF ) define need pharmacological reversal . Interventions ( Randomization treatment protocol ) The randomization list create coordinate center dedicate software stratify per center , 1:1:1 ratio , block 30 . Once patient release informed consent , investigator log dedicate line portal obtain allocation arm . From moment impossible remove patient 's record card online platform , case , patient analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . Any deviation ventilation protocol , together reason deviation , record CRF . All patient keep blind allocation . Patients randomly assign receive one follow ventilator strategy : - First arm . No mechanical ventilation CPB : patient disconnect respiratory circuit . - Second arm . Patients receive CPAP PEEP 5 mmH2O FiO2 &lt; 80 % . To perform CPAP ventilator set manual/spontaneous mode , flow 1-2 L/min adjustable pressure valve ( APL ) set 5 cmH2O . The actual pressure check pressure gauge integrate ventilator pressure gauge connect proximal end endotracheal tube . - Third arm . Patient ventilate respiratory rate 5 per minute , tidal volume ( TV ) 2-3 mL/Kg Ideal Body Weight ( IBW ) PEEP 3-5 cm H2O . Before CPB patient receive lung-protective ventilator strategy , Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation ( IPPV ) mode along follow parameter : - Tidal Volume ( TV ) = 6-8 ml/kg IBW : - PEEP = 5 cmH2O - FiO2 &lt; 80 % - I : E = 1:2 ( inspiration : expiration ratio ) . During CPB goal maintain PaO2 200 250 mmHg , order avoid hyperoxia-induced lung injury ; moreover hematocrit maintain 24 % . During wean CPB perform single alveolar recruitment maneuver , airway pressure 40 cmH2O maintain least 7 second . Post-operative ventilation The anesthesiologist report Case Report Form ( CRF ) mechanical ventilation set use transfer patient operate theater ICU . In ICU apply IPPV parameter use operating room . Blood oxygen saturation constantly monitor pulseoxymeter . We report extubation-time , duration mechanical ventilation need re-intubation . Blood gas analysis perform clinician accord clinical need . Data collection Investigators collect data dedicate CRF insert information require online platform . The coordinator center directly receive information simple data flow , safe mechanism protection personal clinical information . The website us https format patient ' data collect anonymously . We also implement regular backup , order minimize risk data corruption . After discharge hospital , patient phone-called follow-up . We record re-admission hospital exitus . Follow-up perform 30 day , 60 day one year randomization . Statistical consideration Sample size Sample-size calculation base two-sided alpha error 0.05 80 % power . On basis respiratory insufficiency incidence cardiac surgery anticipate 25 % patient PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 ratio . We expect incidence parameter reduce 35 % . We calculate need sample size 263 patient per group . Including drop-out fraction 10 % , calculate need 870patients complete trial . Data analysis We analyze patient treatment group allocate . Data analyze professional statistical software . Data analyze accord intention-to-treat principle follow pre-established analysis plan . Dichotomous variable compare two-tailed Î§2 test , use Yates correction appropriate . Continuous variable compare analysis variance non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test , appropriate . Relative risk 95 % confidence interval difference median 95 % confidence interval ( use Hodges-Lehmann estimation ) calculate appropriate . Two-sided significance test use throughout . Subgroup analyse We infer subgroup effect interaction term treatment subgroup statistically significant P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
