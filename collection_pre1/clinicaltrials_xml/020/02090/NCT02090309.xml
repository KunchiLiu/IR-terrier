	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesis low ( low relatively situation ) cortisol level might causative factor whiplash injury post traumatic stress disorder follow road accident . In study investigator enroll patient sustain road accident . From patient blood sample withdrawn measure cortisol concentration . Than , patient divide 2 group : study group receive single injection intravenous Hydrocortisone 100 milligram ( synthetic steroid use routinely many year ) . The control group receive volume normal saline would use placebo treatment . The investigator assume patient low cortisol level would tend high incidence whiplash injury / post traumatic stress disorder , single bolus hydrocortisone may prevent untoward sequela trauma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study protocol Patients arrive day time ( 08:00 - 16:00 ) Soroka Hospital emergency department follow motor vehicle accident find eligible asked participate study . Following informed consent recruit patient randomly divide study group control group . From participant volume 5 milliliter peripheral blood withdrawn cortisol concentration determination prior study intervention . After withdraw blood sample patient receive single bolus intravenous Hydrocortisone 100 milligram ( study group ) normal saline ( 0.9 % ) similar volume study drug , 5 ml ( control group ) . Patients otherwise receive regular management trauma patient . The enrolled patient fill simple , short questionnaire include demographic data , neck disability index , ( NDI ) , numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) , Tampa scale kinesiophobia ( TSK-11 ) , PTSD questionnaire ( PDA ) , assess treat physician degree whiplash ( WAD 0-4 ) . The patient followed-up one investigator period 6 month . In visit patient assess mention tool . Sample size : 45 patient arm . Blinding randomization : triple blind use randomization software . Statistical assessment perform identify difference develop WAD ( whiplash associate disorder ) patient admission low level cortisol compare high normal level , also patient receive hydrocortisone compare receive placebo .</detailed_description>
