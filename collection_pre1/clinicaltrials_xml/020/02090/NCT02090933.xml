	<brief_title>Celecoxib Decreasing Damaging Effects Sunburn Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify change erythema response human subject expose range erythemic dose solar-simulated ultraviolet light celecoxib treatment . II . Collect blood genetic analysis marker likely modulate erythema response . This include cyclooxygenase ( COX ) , prostaglandin receptor , P53 excision-repair polymorphism . OUTLINE : Participants undergo ultraviolet ( UV ) -irradiation right buttock baseline , receive celecoxib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 10 day , undergo UV-irradiation leave buttock . Chromameter reading obtain 24 hour post UV-irradiation .</detailed_description>
