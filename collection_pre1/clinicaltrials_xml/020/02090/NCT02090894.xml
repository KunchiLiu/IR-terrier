	<brief_summary>The objective study examine ability dermal rejuvenation therapy protect geriatric skin ultraviolet light ( UVB ) -induced carcinogenesis . Skin cancer ( include basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma ) common type malignancy relate UVB exposure sunlight . UVB-irradiation skin cause specific DNA damage keratinocytes lead cancer-causing mutation allow persist proliferate cell . Moreover , incidence skin cancer much great elderly young individual . The objective present study build upon previous data test effect non ablative Nd : YAG laser ( LaserGenesis ) localize area skin dermal IGF-1 production UVB-mediated keratinocyte effect . Treatment skin use non ablative high-peak power microsecond pulse 1064 nm Nd : YAG laser ( Cutera 's LaserGenesisTM laser ) lead papillary dermal heating . The laser target microvasculature stimulate collagen production protect epidermis . Generally , Laser Genesis use clinically improve irregularity contour , texture , color skin . Laser Genesis also use help treat photoaging increase collagen formation , suggest stimulates fibroblast activity thus possibly increase level protective IGF-1 .</brief_summary>
