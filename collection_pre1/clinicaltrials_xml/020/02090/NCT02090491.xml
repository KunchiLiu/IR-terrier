The MENTIS platform contain several core component , include : ( 1 ) An electronic personal healthcare record , design specifically individual ASD caregiver ( parent , teacher , healthcare provider ) ; ( 2 ) Integrated physiological physical activity biosensors design objectively assess outcome important ASD , ; ( 3 ) A de-identified research data warehouse analytic tool well measure outcomes , assist sub-population identification , identify algorithms diagnosis treatment response detection . The MENTIS platform currently design , develop , prepared testing . During process highly desirable conduct feasibility usability research sample target population identify important system component feature , optimize design , reduce redundancy software development research time . The rapid pilot study describe herein propose gather incipient feedback select MENTIS system component feature stakeholder support individual ASD clinical setting . This pilot research help evaluate well current MENTIS system feature work apply set inform future direction MENTIS platform development .</brief_summary>
