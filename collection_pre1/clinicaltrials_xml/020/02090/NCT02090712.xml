	<brief_summary>At periphery city São Paulo , in-hospital mortality acute myocardial infarction estimate range 15 % 20 % due difficulty inherent delay answer large metropolis . As city 11 million inhabitant , distribution emergency service public hospital also heterogeneous , scarcity peripheral zone . That heterogeneity resource also involve quality medical care provide . The possibility standard care fast transfer thrombolysis tertiary backing system ECG interpretation , catheterization advance support could improve set . In project initiated 2010 , São Paulo Municipal Health Secretariat , Federal University Sao Paulo/Paulista School Medicine , Emergency Mobile Health Care Service arrange planed system thrombolysis peripheral hospital ambulance immediate transfer unique tertiary center early angiography angioplasty culprit artery . The protocol use recommendation Brazilian international guideline , adopt management ST elevation myocardial infarction Paulista School Medicine regard indication thrombolytic agent , primary rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) , pharmacoinvasive therapy . The hypothesis study network provide best care patient ST elevation myocardial infarction reduce mortality rate . The main purpose registry provide demographic , metric result experience , maintain complete record clinical , laboratory coronary angiography data patient allow short-term outcome analysis various variable large population . Additionally , follow-up outcome provide sub-group patient keep health care University able track . All clinical endpoint main interest assess single composite endpoint evaluation different time interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sao Paulo ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reperfusion Strategies ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Network - Sao Paulo Registry . Preparation implementation ST segment elevation myocardial network Sao Paulo : Initially , 2009 24-hour central office electrocardiogram ( ECG ) reading instal Hospital São Paulo - Paulista School Medicine receive EKG 's sent 126 SAMU ambulance , cover entire São Paulo city area . The ECGs transmit central office via mobile phone , fix phone Internet , immediately interpret team cardiologist , use guideline STEMI ECG diagnosis . The EKG report send back mobile phone transmit ambulance . With system place work adequately , Municipal Health Secretariat São Paulo make fibrinolytic agent tenecteplase ( TNK ) available initially four municipal emergency room ( ER ) large peripheral hospital , previous history receive large number patient AMI ( Ermelino Matarazzo ER , Campo Limpo ER , Tatuapé ER , Saboya ER ) . The medical nursing team hospital train updated clinical diagnosis acute coronary syndrome , ECG recognition STEMI , indication thrombolytic agent primary PTCA STEMI . A direct immediate contact , via exclusive mobile phone line , establish advanced ambulance ERs Coronary Unit Hospital São Paulo . Thus , patient diagnose STEMI , ER ambulance could catheterization laboratory le 90 minute contra-indication thrombolysis refer primary PTCA . If advanced ambulance far away estimate travel time patient one ERs long 90 minute , he/she would receive TNK ; thrombolysis , patient would immediately transfer Sao Paulo Hospital , would undergo either rescue PTCA , necessary , cardiac catheterization within 6 24 hour , clinically stable . The dose TNK range 30 mg 50 mg , meet know criterion indication contraindication fibrinolytic drug . In addition TNK , patient receive adjuvant therapy accord Brazilian international guideline recommend dos morphine , low molecular weight heparin ( properly correct weight renal function ) , IV nitrate oral medication , , aspirin , clopidogrel , statins beta-blockers . An expansion primary network make 2011 allow 3 ER 's included network ( Pirituba , Joao XXIII , Servidor Municipal ) one 2013 ( Vila Maria ) , sum moment 8 fix ER unit plus SAMU ambulance . After catheterization , patient maintain tertiary hospital advance Killip class leave main severe LV dysfunction refer back primary center 24 hour cath PCI stable , good LV function 1 2 vessel disease . Establishing formal registry : Since network 's conception , formal case report form ( CRF ) form develop collect demographic , metric ( time performance ) , clinical characteristic , laboratory result , coronary angiography result outcomes patient . This CRF include 100 variable fed exclusively one person ( administrator ) . Data collection make 2 appointed medical co-worker responsible completion CRF liberation register electronic sheet . CRFs keep file in-hospital ECGs copy . An electronic spreadsheet ( Excel® , Microsoft Corp. , Santa Rosa , Califórnia - EUA ) maintain dedicated central computer University update weekly administrator ( principal investigator ) . Data check inconsistency make weekly comparing result clinical evolution electronic data well information derive `` overlap '' column , establish advance , contain similar data ( EKG culprit cath culprit artery , PCI perform type number stent utilized , complication yes complication item fill ) . Source data verification ass accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data do compare data spreadsheet official medical record inconsistency suspect . A single , experienced PCI person fill Cath data report TIMI BLUSH flow . Periodic monthly meeting total group professional involve project , reassess cause rate death major complication hold previous send report Municipality variables also detail case come evolution till hospital discharge . Definitions : All variable include ( history element , risk factor , clinical presentation data , diagnostic procedure data element , invasive therapeutic intervention data element , medication data element , outcome data element ) comply definition `` 2013 ACCF/AHA key data element definition measure clinical management outcomes patient acute coronary syndrome coronary artery disease : report American College Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force clinical data standard ( write committee develop acute coronary syndrome coronary artery disease clinical data standard ) . J Am Coll Cardiol . 2013 Mar 5 ; 61 ( 9 ) :992-1025. doi : 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.10.005 . Epub 2013 Jan 28 . PubMed PMID : 23369353 '' . The two pathway establish route involve go directly cath lab receive TNK systematically cat perform 3-24 hour . Of go directly catheterization laboratory n't PCI perform find mild lesion contrary distal leave main and/or proximal three vessel disease . Additionally , primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) define initial mechanical reperfusion cardiac catheterization STEMI previous use fibrinolytic drug glycoprotein IIB/ IIIa inhibitor . Rescue PCI define emergency cardiac catheterization due suspicion ineffective thrombolysis , characterize persistence pain intensity least 50 % onset persistence least 50 % ST-segment elevation ECG lead maximally initially involved . Pharmaco-invasive strategy define use full-dose chemical thrombolysis , follow routine cardiac catheterization within 6 24 hour , even stable patient successful reperfusion , intention treat culprit lesion . After STREAM trial result June 2013 , patient older 75 year receive half dosage TNK . Statistical analysis : This study aim prospectively collect data , consecutively , large population , submit double route option STEMI treatment current standard medical practice apply organize network . There specific statistical test use plan study idea appropriate test would apply look specific information data collect . No patient date refuse Registry PCI hospital contact . Data dictionary : The variable include main one Registry , although expand sub-items allow information , like example , electrocardiographic result catheterization characteristic . As already mention , definition accord American College Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force European Society Cardiology clinical data standard .
