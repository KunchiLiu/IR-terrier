	<brief_summary>Dystrophinopathy disease continuum include Duchenne muscular dystrophy , develop boy . It cause mutation gene dystrophin , protein important maintain normal muscle structure function . Loss dystrophin cause muscle fragility lead weakness loss walk ability . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause dystrophinopathy approximately 10-15 % boys disease . Ataluren orally deliver , investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . The main goal Phase 3 extension study obtain long term safety ataluren boys nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy determine adverse event laboratory abnormality . The study also assess change physical function , pulmonary function important clinical laboratory measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Extension Study Ataluren ( PTC124 ) Patients With Nonsense Mutation Dystrophinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , open label safety efficacy study perform participate site worldwide . The study enroll ~ 220 boy nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy participate previous Phase 3 study ataluren ( Protocol # PTC124-GD-020-DMD ) . Patients receive 10 , 10 , 20 mg/kg ataluren TID morning , midday , even approximately 96 week . Study assessment perform clinic visit every 12 week .</detailed_description>
