	<brief_summary>Single-arm , single site , open label study effect parenteral testosterone follow enzalutamide abiraterone men metastatic CRPC previously progress either agent . The study enroll two cohort patient : men metastatic CRPC progress enzalutamide ( Cohort A ) ; men metastatic CRPC progress abiraterone acetate ( Cohort B ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RE-sensitizing With Supraphysiologic Testosterone Overcome REsistant ( The RESTORE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial enroll 60 patient , 30 cohort . Eligible patient continue androgen ablative therapy LHRH agonist ( i.e . Zoladex , Trelstar , Eligard Lupron ) surgically castrate suppress endogenous testosterone production . Patients also receive intramuscular injection either testosterone cypionate testosterone enanthate dose 400 mg every 28 day . This dosing scheme design produce rapidly fluctuate serum testosterone level supraphysiologic near-castrate range ( i.e . Bipolar Androgen Therapy [ BAT ] ) . Assessments response testosterone make approximately every 3 month . Upon display evidence progression , patient go receive either abiraterone enzalutamide ( whichever agent previously progress prior study enrollment ) .</detailed_description>
