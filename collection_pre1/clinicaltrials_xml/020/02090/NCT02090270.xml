	<detailed_description>Acute physical emotional stressor well know trigger cardiovascular event . However , clear whether association exist chronic stress . Data issue limit lack adequate clinical study inconclusive result . One possible explanation may absence reliable mode quantitative assessment chronic stress . To date , study effect chronic stress cardiovascular event use psychosocial questionnaire . These subject recall bias , event may stimulate patient strive harder identify previous stressor . Furthermore , study association chronic stress cardiovascular event focus acute coronary event , examine association stroke . Both physical emotional stress activate several neuroendocrine system , important hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis stimulate production secretion glucocorticoid ( especially cortisol ) adrenal cortex . Therefore , cortisol consider `` stress hormone '' high level serum cortisol observe patient acute stress present acute myocardial infarction stroke compare healthy control . Moreover , show serum cortisol level correlate severity disease adverse outcome patient present stroke . Cortisol level routinely determine blood , salivary urinary sample . However , method provide information long term cortisol secretion , account variability HPA axis activity . There grow pool evidence show Hair Cortisol Concentration ( HCC ) examination provide reliable retrospective estimation integrate cortisol secretion period several month . Hair grow rate 1 cm/month , thus 3 cm hair would give indication cortisol level previous 3 month . HCC evaluate several clinical setting activity HPA axis cortisol level period time interest . Studies demonstrate increased level hair cortisol chronic stress , well condition associate stress pregnancy , unemployment , PTSD , alcohol withdrawal chronic pain importantly , patient admit hospital acute myocardial infarction . Nevertheless , association hair cortisol level risk stroke yet study .</detailed_description>
