	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine whether dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) take 12 month effective reduce Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) -related fatigue , measure mean change Fatigue Scale Motor Cognitive Functions ( FSMC ) , participant relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . The secondary objective study : To investigate change Baseline FSMC fatigue severity ( Fatigue Severity Scale [ FSS ] ) 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month participant receive DMF ; To assess impact DMF patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) , include work productivity ( Work Productivity Activity Impairment-Multiple Sclerosis questionnaire [ WPAI-MS ] ) , health-related quality life ( Short Form Health Survey [ SF-12 ] ) , depression ( Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen [ BDI-FS ] ) , sleepiness ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ ESS ] ) 6 12 month participant receive DMF ; To examine whether association exist fatigue baseline demographic ( e.g. , age sex ) disease characteristic ( e.g. , disease duration , baseline disease activity , treatment history , expand disability status scale [ EDSS ] score , PROs ) ; To assess change fatigue-related medication use .</brief_summary>
