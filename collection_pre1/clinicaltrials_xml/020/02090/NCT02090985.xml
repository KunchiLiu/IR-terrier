	<brief_summary>In study technique call 'lipomodelling ' study find beneficial around stoma site patient difficulty secure stoma bag may lead leakage frequent soil believe reduces quality life . Patients colostomy ( stoma form bring large bowel surface abdomen ) , ileostomy ( small bowel ) urostomy ( urinary tract ) recruit study . Lipomodelling technique commonly use elsewhere body knowledge use purpose . This study pilot study may lead research area . Lipomodelling mean take fat lie beneath surface skin transfer another part body . The fat remove suction ( liposuction ) , normally thighs abdomen . In order use important part fat , put machine call centrifuge . This spin fat split three different section . The important section separate injected small quantity require area around stoma . It think cell encourage rejuvenation well help fill area inject . Peri-stomal mean area around stoma , include skin underlie tissue , fat scar tissue . After operation scar take time fully develop . Usually year scar tissue fully form . The scar tissue may cause skin around stoma irregular . This describe contour skin . The aim study see lipomodelling improve quality life reduce frequency change stoma bag , reduce leakage need extra-stomal appliance try help stoma bag fit body securely .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipomodelling Symptomatic Peri-stomal Skin Contour Abnormalities : Pilot Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE Symptomatic skin contour abnormality often lead frequent soil difficulty stoma bag fitting . The objective study evaluate effectiveness peri-stomal lipomodelling reduce number stoma bag change 24 hour overall quality life patient group . METHODS Patients identify stoma care nurse digestive disease urology clinic . They assess suitability study . If suitable , informed consent take . Quality life questionnaire complete participant prior procedure several interval follow procedure . Follow-up end 1 year post procedure . BACKGROUND Intestinal stoma formation faecal diversion defunctioning bowel , commonly establish procedure colorectal surgical practice [ 1-6 ] . It perform open well laparoscopic approach . However , placement ileoostomy colostomy abdominal wall skin surface associate many skin complication like skin ulceration arise excoriation scarring , skin retraction lead peri-stomal skin dimple irregular margin [ 7-13 ] . This may result stoma appliance fit properly skin lead frequent soil skin clothes . Soiling cause significant impact patient quality life [ 14 ] . Soiling skin clothes require frequent change stoma appliance , use various fitting around stoma stoma bag try avoid soil . Consequently , cost stoma management increase due extra stoma care stoma nurse additional use stoma appliance [ 15 ] . Stomas resited order try improve situation patient . This may require major operation include laparotomy ( open abdomen ) . Due previous surgery likely scar tissue inside abdomen make operation difficult hazardous risk damage bowel . This study aim identify whether possible reduce soil improve area around stoma stoma bag fit properly lipomodelling . A technique perform day case , local anaesthetic without major operation . Lipomodelling , also know autogenous fat transfer fat transplantation , use correct skin deformity elsewhere ( breast ) may useful correct peri-stomal skin deformity . We hypothesis peri-stomal lipomodelling improve peri-stomal skin contour abnormality therefore improve fit stoma bag skin reduce soil aim reduce number stoma bag change 24 hour thereby improve quality life . This technique apply correct skin defect patient undergo breast surgery , limbs surgery , buttock genitals [ 16-19 ] . Recent study demonstrate adipose tissue harvest lipomodelling rich source regenerative cell call adipose derived stem cell ( ADSC ) [ 20 ] . ADSCs capable self- renewal also secrete growth factor [ 21 ] . ADSCs report enhance elasticity scar tissue promote heal patient undergo radiotherapy breast cancer , complex Crohn 's fistulae [ 22-26 ] . In peri-stomal area hopefully lipomodelling fill defect , also improve elasticity scar tissue soften area . The objective prospective observational pilot study evaluate effectiveness peri-stomal lipomodelling correct peri-stomal skin contour defect aim reduce frequent leakage soiling , aim improve overall quality life . Sample size : 20 patient phase 1 pilot study</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients age 18 100 year old Patients able give inform consent Patients stoma ( colostomy , ileostomy urostomy ) &gt; 1 year Patients stoma likely permanent Patients stoma due reverse within follow year ( length study ) All patient stoma suffer frequent soil due difficulty stoma bag fitting assess . If due peristomal skin contour abnormality may suitable lipomodelling . Preoperative assessment base clinical history , clinical examination inspection peristomal area prior register participant trial . Patients unable give inform consent refuse participate study Patients stoma less 1 year Patients temporary stoma due reverse within year Patients stoma stoma bag fit securely leaking Patients allergy medication use local infiltration Patients underlie medical condition excludes study ( e.g . risk increase bleed patient warfarin . ) Patients evidence underlying infection .</criteria>
