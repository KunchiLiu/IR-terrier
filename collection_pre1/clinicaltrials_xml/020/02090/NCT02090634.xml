	<brief_summary>Adherence combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) critical successful HIV viral suppression . Nonadherence ART pose several potentially serious health consequence , include high viral load , fast progression AIDS , heighten risk viral mutation , treatment resistance HIV transmission . The prevalence serious mental illness ( SMI ) condition , include bipolar disorder ( BD ) , elevate among HIV-infected population associate poor ART adherence . HIV-infected individual co-occurring BD ( HIV+/BD+ ) , compare demographically similar HIV+/BD- person , demonstrate poor ART psychotropic medication adherence twice likely non adherent ART regimen use â‰¥ 90 % cutoff score . HIV+/BD+ individual particularly at-risk medication non adherence , critical need develop intervention improve adherence population . Poor psychotropic medication adherence also common among people SMI - estimate 40 % BD take mood stabilizer prescribe . Among person BD , nonadherence psychotropic medication lead great risk manic depressive episode , decrease quality life , suicide attempt , hospitalization . The utilization mobile health ( i.e. , mHealth ) technology improve everyday functioning grow . mHealth intervention capitalize technology already incorporated people 's daily life ( e.g. , cell phone ) assist people behavior modification disease self-management . Text messaging , particular , may support daily ART adherence deliver reminder precise time match individual ' dosing schedule . The initial evidence use text messaging improve ART medication adherence compelling . Researchers clinician also start employ technology-based approach improve treatment individual BD . Taken together , distinct need RCTs utilize text message improve medication adherence within at-risk HIV population warrant . Individualized Texting Adherence Building ( iTAB ) one intervention . The investigator propose intervention development study design address potential mechanism nonadherence follow Specific Aims : 1 ) To develop refine personalize , automate , real-time , mobile phone , text messaging intervention ( iTAB ) design improve adherence ART psychotropic medication among HIV+/BD+ person ; 2 ) To evaluate acceptability effectiveness brief psychoeducation plus text messaging intervention ( iTAB ) compare psychoeducation alone ( CTRL ) improvement objectively measure medication adherence among HIV+/BD+ person ; 3 ) To examine predictor within-person trajectory nonadherence use longitudinal data collect study . In order realize aim , investigator leverage infrastructure two unique UCSD resource increase likelihood study success , impact , innovation : 1 ) HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program ( HNRP ) , encompass multiple NIH-funded study focus effect HIV infection , 2 ) California Institute Telecommunications Information Technology ( Calit2 ) , conduct research state-of-the-art wireless mean health promotion . Initially , investigator refine iTAB intervention ensure user-centered tailored need HIV+/BD+ person via focus group rapid prototyping . Once refine , propose iTAB intervention use text message automate , scalable , personalize , interactive , flexible , motivate . The investigator assess acceptability effectiveness iTAB improve objectively measure adherence ( i.e. , MEMS cap ) 4-week period via pilot RCT 25 HIV+/BD+ assign iTAB intervention 25 HIV+/BD+ assign psychoeducational control . Predictors nonadherence include neuropsychological impairment , mood examine determine whether iTAB well able compensate factor associate nonadherence compare CTRL . Further refinement iTAB intervention make order pursue large-scale R01 use investigator tailor intervention .</brief_summary>
