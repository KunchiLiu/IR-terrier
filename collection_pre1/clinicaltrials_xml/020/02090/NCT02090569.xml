	<brief_title>High Resolution Imaging Cerebral Vasculature Functional Micro-Doppler Sonography During Brain Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three decade since comprehensive description ( Taylor et al. , 1971 ) , focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD ) remain enigmatic condition . FCD may cause severe refractory epilepsy directly life threaten . Preoperative neuroimaging usually include high-resolution MR imaging , reveal 60 80 % cortical abnormality patient FCD . When antiepileptic drug fail bring complete seizure freedom FCD patient , surgical resection FCD inevitable . Many patient , especially normal MR imaging result , undergo additional diagnostic procedure . Scalp EEG frequently use one important modality early surgical series . Approximately one half two third patient abnormal EEG finding regional ictal abnormality . In case , intracranial electrophysiological recording , commonly grid array , use . Chronic recording allow identification eloquent cortex area , addition define epileptogenic region . The `` eloquent brain '' refers part brain allow interaction process surround environment , via sens , motion , language , memory purposeful use tool . Nevertheless , technique either invasive spatiotemporal resolution poor identify precisely epileptic lesion deep brain . Hence , large resection lesion area , lobectomy even hemispherectomies , perform high risk side effect include aphasia , partial face paralysis hemiplegia depend localization lesion . Navigable three-dimensional ( 3D ) -MRI ( base Neuronavigation system ) currently use Sainte Anne hospital planning guide resection neurosurgeon often complain poor resolution non-real-time imaging . While use surgical navigation important advance brain surgery , utility limit phenomenon know brain shift . Whenever brain expose , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) lose . Additionally , start resectioning , position surgical field shift centimeter , compare pre-surgery position . Brain shift make potentially hazardous rely preoperative image determine location residual tumor . The way deal brain shift maintain accurate neuronavigation intraoperative imaging enhance resection pathologic tissue FCD . Previously , investigator demonstrate feasibility approach monitor hemodynamic response drug-induced epileptic seizure preclinical model use functional micro-Doppler Sonography ( fmDS ) . The investigator develop new tool combine navigable three-dimensional ( 3D ) -ultrasound interface correct real-time brain shift ( B-mode ) near-real-time identification unprecedented resolution dysplasia focus base specific hemodynamic signature abnormal neuron .</detailed_description>
