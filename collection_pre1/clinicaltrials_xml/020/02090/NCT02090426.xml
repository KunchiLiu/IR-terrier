	<detailed_description>The Camden Coalition Healthcare Providers ' Care Management Program , Link2Care , target `` super-utilizers '' health care system . These individual medically socially complex need frequent hospital admission . Specifically , Link2Care program target patient specific Camden hospital least two hospital admission last six month least two chronic condition . Such heavy utilizer hospital care account disproportionate share healthcare spending . For example , CCHP analyze hospital admission emergency department use three Camden hospital system 2002-2007 find 20 % patient account 90 % cost ( Green et al. , 2010 ) . As described , compare patient admit Camden hospital , year prior admission , typical patient target program 2.5 time admission prior six month due target . They also much likely readmitted hospital year follow hospital stay , accrue $ 73,000 hospital charge time compare $ 6600 patient . Link2Care provide intensive care management coordination 6 month follow hospital discharge . From October 2012 January 2014 , median length intervention complete 85 day . The approach aim improve self-sufficiency patient navigate healthcare social-service system . It potential reduce healthcare cost improve patient health , patient learn use primary care prevent escalation symptom lead rehospitalization . Participants assign multidisciplinary care team comprise registered nurse , license practical nurse , social worker , intervention specialist , community health worker , health coach . A representative care team engage patient bedside hospital admission plan immediate period follow discharge . Link2Care , whole , involve series home visit , schedule accompaniment initial primary care specialty care visit , support individual navigate various social service agency enroll public program include TANF , SNAP , program promote housing stability . The patient enrol program still hospital . Upon discharge , care team work visit patient home within 3 day discharge . The care team also work schedule primary care visit within 7 day discharge , appropriate specialist visit necessary At initial home visit , care team ( 1 ) performs medication reconciliationâ€”an inventory medication prescribe gauge appropriateness patient understanding , ( 2 ) conduct assessment patient 's perception discharge experience care coordination , medical/health need , activity/mobility , service need , stage readiness change , ( 3 ) collaboratively set goal individual , compliance discharge plan . The care team work closely patient achieve goal ; need , team assist patient schedule necessary physician visit , accompanies patient visit , completes applications social service , coach patient self-care . Subsequent home visit evaluate patient 's team 's progress . The end intervention determine base hospital utilization , individual factor ( health education/literacy , disease self-management , skill development , level engagement , self-efficacy ) systemic factor ( access , quality , care , social support , etc. ) . The person receive graduation certificate . The person expect meet healthcare need future primary care physician . In early , non-randomized evaluation , program find improve health outcome , decrease utilization emergency inpatient service , decrease cost cohort 36 `` high utilizer '' $ 1.2 million monthly $ 534,000 monthly , saving 56 % five year ( Green et al. , 2010 ) . Due staff financial constraint , Link2Care currently administer subset patient meet eligibility criterion , patient currently approach choose ad-hoc manner . This study would establish formal process determine - via random assignment - subset eligible individual offer intervention . This random assignment , reduce number individual benefit service , allow u isolate causal effect CCHP Link2Care Program .</detailed_description>
