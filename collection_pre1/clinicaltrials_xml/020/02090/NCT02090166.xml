	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate performance Extracellular Monitoring Metabolic Activity Profiles Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMC ) analysis method identify lung cancer . The analysis method describe protocol novel simple plausible immunological approach non-invasive , high throughput , real-time quantitative monitoring metabolic activity ( MA ) profile fresh Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMC ) response various reagent different concentration . Study Design Prospective , three group , open , comparative , control study . No . Sites One Study Population Man Women age 18 - 90 year old . No . Subjects A total 950 complete , evaluated subject enrol study . The group sample size follow : Group 1 - 75 subject Group 2 - 75 subject Group 3 - 150 subject Group 4 - 650 subject Primary End Point 1 . Positive negative diagnosis ( score 0/1 dichotomously ) accordance clinical data collect Data Analysis Statistics Multiple MA profile include huge number MA rate value obtain subject . In order develop dynamic clinical analysis update every new subject , extract pattern large data base , The research team design computer program use Data Mining tool , combine method statistic artificial intelligence database management . Blood test perform subject . The blood sample eah subject compare status : healthy non smoker , healthy smoker , COPD diagnose lung cancer .</detailed_description>
