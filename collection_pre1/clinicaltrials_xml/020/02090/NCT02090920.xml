	<brief_summary>This study look effect mother 's gene characteristic ( mother 's age , baby 's age , race , disease ) ability nifedipine end contraction prevent early delivery . This information use decide amount nifedipine woman need best treat preterm contraction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Dosing Nifedipine For Tocolysis Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study identify relationship amount nifedipine woman 's body effect end preterm ( early ) labor contraction delay delivery least 48 hour . The study also look effect gene ( material pass parent child determine make-up body ) characteristic ( example mother 's age , baby 's age , race , diseases drug ) ability nifedipine end contraction . We use information decide amount nifedipine woman need best treat preterm contraction . This study also examine effect pregnancy fast nifedipine remove woman 's body . This study conduct two phase . The first study woman start nifedipine treatment preterm labor . Nifedipine dose determine patient 's physician . Blood sample obtain mother determine concentration nifedipine metabolite , oxidize nifedipine , one dosing interval . A blood sample also obtain DNA isolation examine variant gene involve nifedipine pathway . We also collect data uterine contraction blood pressure clinical monitoring . After delivery , maternal umbilical cord blood sample obtain , along piece placenta . Women take part first phase ask return 6-10 week delivery . At time , take single dose 10 mg immediate release nifedipine mouth blood sample collect 6 hour . Blood pressure also monitor prior collection blood sample</detailed_description>
