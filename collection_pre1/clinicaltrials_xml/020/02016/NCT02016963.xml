	<brief_summary>This open-label study evaluate immunogenicity safety raxibacumab healthy adult male female subject . Subjects receive raxibacumab &gt; = 4 month ago enrol dosed follow : A maximum 25 subject ( include 3 evaluable female subject ) receive second dose raxibacumab equal previous dose &gt; = 4 month follow first dose . Subjects remain house Day 0 Day 1 follow 70 day receive second dose raxibacumab . Raxibacumab show provide improve survival rabbit monkey anthrax spore challenge study . Preliminary data rabbit pivotal efficacy study show significant survival benefit raxibacumab placebo . Exposure anthrax result clinical disease occur , especially individual develop protective immunity . Hence , clinically indicate treatment anthrax , may requirement repeat administration raxibacumab . The rationale study evaluate immunogenicity safety repeat administration raxibacumab &gt; = 4 month interval dosing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Enrolled treat raxibacumab another HGS protocol , &gt; = 4 month ago . Male female &gt; = 18 &lt; = 64 year age . Laboratory value Grade 0 modified Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) toxicity table . Subjects laboratory value Grade 1 consider clinically significant Principal Investigator may enrol follow consultation Medical Monitor . A female subject eligible enter study : Not pregnant nursing , Post menopausal , hysterectomy , documentation sterility , Of child bear potential ( ie , woman intact uterus ovary documentation oviductal uterine dysfunction would cause sterility ) . These woman must negative blood pregnancy test screen Day 1 prior dose agree 1 follow : ) Complete abstinence intercourse date screen duration followup , b ) Consistent correct use 1 follow medically accept method birth control , addition male partner correctly use condom sterile prior female subject 's entry study sole sexual partner female subject date screening duration followup , implant levonorgestrel ; injectable progesterone ; intrauterine device ( IUD ) document failure rate le 1 % per year ; oral contraceptive ( either combine progesterone ) ; double barrier method : condom , cervical cap diaphragm spermicidal agent ; transdermal contraceptive patch . All male sterile must agree either abstain intercourse consistently correctly use condom female partner agree use 1 appropriate medically accept method birth control list date screen duration followup . Have ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent ( include consent use disclosure researchrelated health information ) , comply study protocol procedure , agree return require study visit . History clinical evidence significant , acute , chronic disease ( ie , cardiovascular , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , neurological , infectious disease ) , could confound result study put subject undue risk . Prior immunization anthrax vaccine adsorb ( AVA ) , prior treatment investigational anthrax therapy ( raxibacumab &gt; = 4 month ago ) , prior treatment anthrax exposure , confirm anthrax infection . History Type I hypersensitivity reaction food drug , intravenous ( IV ) contrast dye , history urticaria . Previous hypersensitivity raxibacumab . Previous serious Grade 3 great raxibacumab related adverse event ( AE ) . Drug alcohol addiction within last 12 month . Subjects document addiction free period least 12 month clinical judgement investigator risk relapse may enrol study . Evidence active suspect malignancy history malignancy within last 5 year ( exception adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix ) . Participation clinical trial investigational compound within 60 day initiate study agent refusal refrain participation study .</criteria>
