	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether use I-Scan colonoscopy lead increase yield adenomas colon among population increase risk CRC . Primary Outcome : Adenoma Detection Rate ( ADR â€” No . colonoscopies one histologically confirm adenomas find divide total . colonoscopy perform time period ) right colon use High Definition White Light Colonoscopy Versus I-Scan enhance Colonoscopy . Secondary Outcomes : - Adenoma Detection Rate ( ADR ) High Definition White Light Colonoscopy Versus I-Scan colonoscopy entire colon . - Adenoma Detection Rate ( ADR ) right colon `` Second look '' , irrespective imaging modality . - Polyp Detection Rate ( PDR - No . colonoscopy one polyp find ( regardless histological type ) divide total . colonoscopy perform Same time period ) arm study Right colon throughout entire colon . - Mean number adenoma per procedure arm study right colon throughout entire colon . - Mean number polyp per procedure arm study right colon throughout entire colon . - Number neoplastic lesion arm study right colon throughout entire colon number neoplastic lesion miss 1st pas right colon . - Proportion patient diminutive lesion ( &lt; 5 mm ) arm study - Proportion patient Flat lesion ( height &lt; 1/2 diameter ) arm study - Proportion patient Sessile Serrated Adenoma arm study - Proportion patient invasive cancer arm study - Presence absence learn effect use technology give use I-Scan may train human eye well identify adenomas even without image enhancement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>I-Scan Vs High Definition White Light ( Main Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal Cancer third common cause cancer Canada estimate lifetime risk develop disease 6-7 % . Each year approximately 21,000 new case 9,100 death attributable disease . Colonoscopy one several method recommend Colorectal Cancer ( CRC ) screen current guideline . While colonoscopy invasive , offer high diagnostic accuracy ability therapy ( biopsy removal adenoma ) compare modality . The emerge evidence regard miss neoplastic lesion colonoscopy result quality initiative design improve colonoscopy performance . I-Scan ( Pentax , Montvale , NJ ) new method use post processing computer algorithms revise standard white light highlight pit pattern vascular surface patterns.The relevant I-scan setting colon I-scan 1 I-scan 2 . The primary objective study compare adenoma detection rate right colon use High-definition white light colonoscopy versus I-scan enhance colonoscopy . All patient refer screen colonoscopy Forzani MacPhail Colon Cancer Centre consider enrollment.All eligible patient part another research study approach enrollment study . During pre-assessment clinic study assistant contact eligible patient describe study provide `` Invitation participate Research study '' form . The study assistant obtain final consent agree . Those interested simply receive Centre 's standard protocol . There coercion sort . Following Informed Consent , treatment allocation computer generate randomization reveal . Patients allocate one three study arm ( HD Colon , I-scan 1 I-Scan 2 ) . Patients receive standard bowel preparation : Split dose Polyethylene Glycol ( PEG ) ( 2L noon + 2L 8 PM day ) morning procedure ( 2L 8Pm day 2L five hour procedure day colonoscopy ) afternoon procedure . certified gastroenterologist perform procedure assistance nurse . The plan `` second look '' right colon involve withdraw Cecum Hepatic flexure , re-inserting Cecum finally withdraw entire colon . The physician performing procedure fill `` Colonoscopy Report Form '' include number polyp detect , size , shape , polypectomy method cleanliness bowel . The investigator pilot study 150 subject check mean no.of adenoma per colonoscopy , no.of adenoma detect right colon second look estimate recruitment rate . Based result investigator start study large sample size . The investigator plan interim analysis recruit 450 subject ( 30 % total enrollment ) . The result analysis determine whether investigator complete recruitment initially approve sample size 1500 subject .</detailed_description>
