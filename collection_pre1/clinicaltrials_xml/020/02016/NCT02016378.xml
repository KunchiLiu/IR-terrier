	<detailed_description>Methodology Participants must receive treatment substance use disorder adolescent program University Michigan Addiction Treatment Services ( UMATS ) clinic . Participants must age 14-20 . The study entail five component 1 . Neurophysiological assessment . ( Baseline ) 2 . Assessment substance use psychiatric disorder . ( Baseline ) 3 . Bias retrain treatment protocol . ( baseline , 6 training session two week period ) 4 . Second neurophysiological assessment end treatment . ( 6 week baseline ) 5 . Six-month follow-up ass substance use psychiatric disorder . ( 6 month baseline ) Each component describe detail : 1 . Assessment substance use psychiatric disorder complete use well-validated structured interview questionnaire . Because work memory associate clinical improvement follow bias retrain , also conduct brief test work memory capacity ( e.g. , recall series number letter ) . This assessment take place soon participant schedule follow entry treatment UMATS clinic . 2 . Neurophysiological assessment entail several procedure reliably elicit brain response associate substance use disorder antisocial behavior . The first neurophysiological assessment take place soon participant schedule follow entry treatment UMATS clinic . The different task describe . Participants ask perform task involve respond letter picture computer monitor physiological response record continuously experiment . This achieve use sensor position head , forearm , palm , face . These sensor fill nonirritating paste attach skin use medical tape . The tasks follow : 1 . Picture Viewing Emotion Regulation Task-Duration : approximately 40 minute The subject present number different picture International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) include traditional unpleasant , neutral , pleasant image well image drug drug-related paraphernalia . Pictures present follow instruction cue ask person enhance ( upregulate ) diminish ( downregulate ) affective response . 2 . Go/No go task - Duration : 10 minute During procedure , participant respond two different letter select one two button associated letter . They ask inhibit response letter view letter view . It intend measure cognitive control . Drug-related picture also include distractors examine effect performance EEG/event-related potential ( ERP ) measure . 3 . Gambling/feedback task—Duration : 10 minute During procedure , participant see 2 square , side-by-side monitor front . Each square money amount display inside . Sometimes square show 5 cent , sometimes show 25 cent . The task simply choose one square trial , either one leave one right . After delay one second , participant tell lose amount money inside square chose . If select square turn GREEN mean participant amount money show inside square . If choose square turn RED mean participant lose amount money show inside square . At time , unselected also turn either green red , inform participant much would lose square select . 4 . Oddball task -Duration : 10 minute Participants view series oval represent head appear monitor front . Participants respond representation press correct button keyboard . Participants instructed pay close attention shape screen make correct response ; make easier focusing blue fixation point appear middle screen shape appear . One trial , participant see head ( oval triangle top bottom ) ear either point leave right . When ear show left side head , participant press leave button box indicate ear left . When ear show right side head , participant press right button box indicate ear right . On trial , head without ear nose present . A response require trial . 3 ) Bias retrain treatment protocol . In addition treatment usual UMATS clinic , participant randomize either bias retrain sham training condition . At pre-test session , participant complete approach-avoidance task ( AAT ) measure initial bias drug-related stimulus . The AAT complete laptop computer . The AAT include 20 picture drug-related stimulus 20 picture non-drug related stimulus . Pictures present equally landscape portrait format . After picture appear monitor , participant instruct use joystick either enlarge ( pull joystick closer ) shrink ( push joystick away ) picture . In task , require response unrelated content picture . Specifically , participant instruct pull joystick approach picture portrait format push picture landscape format . The difference median response time drug versus non-drug related picture use measure bias . The AAT take 5 minute complete . The bias retrain protocol utilize AAT . Participants instruct push pull joystick dependent upon whether picture portrait landscape formant . For participant experimental condition , drug-related picture landscape format , , participant experimental condition push joystick shrink drug-related picture . For participant control condition , drug-related picture present equally portrait landscape format . During training , participant correct error . Training session entail 200 trial short break halfway point . Each session take 15 minute complete . The pre-test assessment bias ( AAT ) take place soon participant schedule follow entry treatment UMATS clinic . The bias retrain protocol begin day follow pre-test assessment bias . Participants take part 6 training session ( require approximately 15 minute complete ) two week period . Prior follow administration AAT , participant complete rating current feeling crave use drug 6-point scale ranging I n't want use drug I would love use drug right . If participant endorse 4 high scale follow presentation AAT , query research staff train basic cognitive behavioral technique assist participant reduce feeling crave . As participant actively engage treatment substance use problem ( i.e. , consistently think talk drug use ) , unlikely word picture drug-related stimulus elicit sufficient craving trigger relapse . Also , participant either presence near parent and/or regular treatment provider , minimize risk procedure would elicit relapse . Participants also complete brief symptom inventory bias retrain session track progress course treatment . The participant 's primary therapist also ask make brief rating regard participant 's engagement progress end active treatment . Finally , provide objective measure treatment adherence , participant drug test . Drug test conduct randomly part UMATS treatment , request access result test . To augment testing , also conduct drug test part study ensure participant least 4 drug test entry treatment second neurophysiological assessment . 4 ) A second neurophysiological assessment take place 6 week follow baseline assessment , point participant transition active treatment ( e.g. , intensive outpatient ) . Participants repeat protocol first neurophysiological assessment order detect change brain response consequence treatment condition . Participants also complete AAT brief inventory symptom . 5 ) Six month entry treatment UMATS , participant ask complete questionnaire regard substance use psychiatric symptom well AAT . Statistical Design We predict symptom measure EEG/ERP measure assess baseline associate treatment response measure score brief symptom inventory administer training session , result drug testing , therapist rating . Multilevel model use estimate association baseline measure ( model fix effect ) repeat measure outcome variable ( repeat measure nest within individual ) . To examine effect treatment condition ( bias retrain versus sham training ) , group-based multilevel model ( similar repeat measure ANOVA ) use test group difference EEG/ERP measure assess baseline follow-up neurophysiological assessment . Similar group-based multilevel model ( similar repeat measure ANOVA ) also use test group difference substance use psychiatric symptom measure assess baseline 6-month follow-up , well measure treatment progress ( drug test , symptom measure , therapist rating ) assess baseline assessment second neurophysiological assessment end treatment . Power analysis target N recruitment . For regression multilevel model analysis dimensional outcome , n = 85 provide 80 % detect anticipate effect ( r = .30 , α = .05 ) . For group-based multilevel model , group 41 provide 80 % detect anticipated effect . Therefore , goal recruit enough participant group ( experimental control ) include least 40 participant baseline follow-up neurophysiological assessment . We anticipate 15 % attrition rate . Therefore , plan recruit 94 participant .</detailed_description>
