	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect safety pectin fecal microbiota transplantation patient inflammatory bowel disease . The investigator hypothesize patient take pectin promote migration probiotic intestine engraftment , reduce pathogenic agents'adhesion intestinal mucosa , cut inflammation , maintain intestinal flora diversity steady state long time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Pectin Flora Intestinal Colonization Maintenance After Fecal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic relapse disease , include ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Although etiology IBD unknown , evidence show inappropriate immune response intestinal commensal bacteria lead dysbiosis , pathogens act mucosal lymphoid tissue , cause IBD . Has yet determine specific one pathogens cause IBD , literatures confirm change diversity intestine flora.Based current awareness change intestinal flora IBD , fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) propose recent year rebuild intestine flora balance achieve therapeutic purpose . But fecal bacteria patient consistent donor 's long term transplantation therefore ideal way disease control . Maintaining diversity flora long time well controlled disease become breakthrough fecal microbiota transplantation treatment inflammatory bowel disease . Pectin soluble dietary fiber ( DF ) , produce gut flora series fermentation many metabolite short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) supply energy epithelial cell , regulate intestinal PH intestinal motility join effort immune regulation intestinal lymphoid tissue . Previous study show : water-soluble dietary fiber action intestinal flora cut inflammatory cytokine , prevent inflammation induce regulatory T cell , type dose dietary fiber use different different study , study confirm whether dietary fiber could adjust flora colonization ability patient IBD . We conceive pectin mechanism promote migration probiotic intestine engraftment , reduce pathogenic agent ' adhesion intestinal mucosa , cut inflammation , maintain intestinal flora diversity steady state long time , achieve goal continue ease IBD .</detailed_description>
