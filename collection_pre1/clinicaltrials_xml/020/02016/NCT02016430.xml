	<brief_title>Gut Flora Metabolite Reduction After Dietary Intervention ( GRADY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot human study characterize relationship gut flora-associated TMAO generation dietary intervention . The investigator hypothesize tailored dietary intervention may help reduce ability gut flora generate TMAO individual elevate TMAO level . Specific aim include : 1 . To investigate proportion subject persistently elevate circulate TMAO level . 2 . To compare amount TMAO generate gut flora use stable-isotope-labelled choline , carnitine , betaine subject elevate versus normal circulate TMAO level . 3 . To evaluate effect dietary intervention amount TMAO generate gut flora use stable-isotope-labelled choline , carnitine , betaine subject elevate circulate TMAO level .</detailed_description>
