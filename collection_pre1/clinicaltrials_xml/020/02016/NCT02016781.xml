	<brief_title>Allo v Hypomethylating/Best Supportive Care MDS ( BMT CTN 1102 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : MDS clonal disorder hematopoietic precursor stem cell , may evolve terminal phase resemble acute leukemia . A subject clinical urgency researcher , clinician , patient , health care underwriter Medicare , role allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT ) treatment old patient high risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The use reduce intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens extended HCT care older patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) lymphoma number retrospective phase II trial patient MDS show curative potential RIC alloHCT select patient . This protocol design evaluate relative benefit RIC alloHCT compare non-transplant therapy focus overall survival . This do patient biologically assign alloHCT arm hypomethylating therapy/best supportive care arm follow survival 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients fulfil follow criterion eligible entry study : 1 . Patients de novo MDS , previously , Intermediate2 High risk disease determine International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) . Current Intermediate2 High risk disease NOT requirement . 2 . Patients must acceptable MDS subtype : Refractory cytopenia unilineage dysplasia ( RCUD ) ( include refractory anemia ( RA ) ) Refractory anemia ring sideroblast ( RARS ) Refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB1 ) Refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB2 ) Refractory cytopenia multilineage dysplasia ( RCMD ) Myelodysplastic syndrome isolate del ( 5q ) ( 5qsyndrome ) Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , unclassifiable 3 . Patients must fewer 20 % marrow blast within 60 day consent . 4 . Patients may receive prior therapy treatment MDS , include limited : growth factor , transfusion support , immunomodulatory ( IMID ) therapy , DNA hypomethylating therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy prior enrollment . 5 . Age 50.075.0 year . 6 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) â‰¤ 1 . 7 . Patients eligible formal unrelated donor search activate prior date consent . A formal unrelated donor search begin time sample request potential National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) donor . Patients start sibling donor search find match sibling donor eligible . 8 . Patients physician must willing comply treatment assignment : 1 . No intent proceed alloHCT use donor source specify protocol , include human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) mismatch related unrelated donor ( &lt; 6/6 HLA relate match &lt; 8/8 HLA unrelated match ) umbilical cord blood unit ( ) . 2 . No intent use myeloablative conditioning regimen . 3 . Intent proceed RIC alloHCT match sibling match unrelated donor identify . There requirement timing transplantation . 9 . Patients must consider suitable RIC alloHCT candidate time enrollment base medical history , physical examination , available laboratory test . Specific test organ function require eligibility , available , test use judge eligibility . 10 . Signed informed consent Patients follow ineligible registration onto study : 1 . Therapyrelated MDS ( define occurrence MDS due prior exposure systemic chemotherapy and/or radiation malignancy ) 2 . Current prior diagnosis AML 3 . Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm ( unacceptable MDS subtypes ) ; uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection ( currently take medication progression clinical improvement ) time enrollment . 4 . Patients prior malignancy , except treat nonmelanoma skin cancer treat cervical carcinoma situ . Cancer treat curative surgery without chemotherapy/radiation therapy &gt; 5 year previously allow . Cancer treat curative surgery &lt; 5 year previously allow unless approve Protocol Officer one Protocol Chairs . 5 . Prior autologous allogeneic HCT 6 .
