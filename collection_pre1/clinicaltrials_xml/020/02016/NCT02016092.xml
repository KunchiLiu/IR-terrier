	<brief_summary>There approximately one million Americans live Parkinson 's disease 50,000 new case per year rate expect rise age population . The underlie pathophysiology disease understand PD still remain elusive due combination disease complexity lack predictive capability exist model . The Berg Interrogative Biology™ discovery platform demonstrate unique capability produce drug target biomarkers truly represent disease phenotype . It able catalyze molecule late stage clinical trial cancer many pre-clinical candidate therapeutic biomarkers endocrinology central nervous system ( CNS ) diseases . The platform able decipher normal versus disease signatures integration data set genome , metabolome , proteome , lipidome agnostic manner subject Bayesian Artificial Intelligence informatics . The result node put back wet-lab validation proceed proof-of-principle pre-clinical testing . By utilize clinical data specimen obtain medical specialist The Parkinson 's Institute , along Berg 's Interrogative Biology™ , study aim discover disease biomarker enable creation diagnostic test Parkinson 's disease .</brief_summary>
