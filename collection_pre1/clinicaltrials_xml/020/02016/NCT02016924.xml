	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) confirm dose cobicistat-boosted atazanavir ( ATV/co ) cobicistat-boosted darunavir ( DRV/co ) HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced , virologically suppress , pediatric participant age 3 month &lt; 18 year age . This study also evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy ATV/co DRV/co co-administered background regimen ( BR ) 48 week 5 year long-term treatment . There 2 part study . - Part A : Participants enrol sequentially age cohort evaluate steady state PK confirm dose ATV/co DRV/co . Following screening , enrol participant continue suppressive regimen either ATV/r DRV/r once-daily plus BR . On Day 1 , participant discontinue ritonavir initiate daily cobicistat ( COBI ) take ATV DRV plus BR . All participant enrol Part A participate intensive PK evaluation COBI ATV DRV Day 10 . Following completion intensive PK visit , participant continue receive COBI coadministered DRV ATV BR return schedule study visit . - Part B : Participants enrol evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy ATV/co DRV/co regimen . For cohort Part B , participant screen initiate sequentially age cohort follow confirmation appropriate COBI exposure PI exposures correspond age cohort Part A .</brief_summary>
