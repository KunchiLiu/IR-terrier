	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Sleep Disorders common pregnancy exact role causation pregnancy relate disorder yet determine . OSA complicate pregnancy give risk factor weight gain , upper displacement diaphragm , hormonal-induced hyperaemia nasopharyngeal passage . SDB confers risk hypertensive disorder pregnancy associate adverse maternal foetal outcome . The study would involve pregnant female would prospectively follow pregnancy post partum know prevalence sleep disorder pregnancy . Diagnosis sleep disorder would confirm overnight polysomnography ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . Pregnancy outcomes , maternal fetal would record relation sleep disorder pregnancy would analyse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To assess sleep quality pregnancy 2 . To know prevalence various sleep disorder pregnancy include restless leg syndrome , symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea etc . 3 . To study effect sleep disorder maternal fetal outcome 4 . To study relation obstructive sleep apnea pregnancy induce hypertension . Material &amp; Methods Study Design : Longitudinal prospective case-control study - Consecutive patient undergoing antenatal check Antenatal Clinic AIIMS hospital evaluate use questionnaire sleep quality . Preliminary screen question sleep disturbance pregnancy patient - Questionnaires use : Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( cover insomnia , RLS , snore sleep related breathing disorder ) ; Epworth Sleepiness Score ( Excessive daytime sleepiness ) ; Modified Wisconsin Score ; Modified Berlin Questionnaires - To association Obstructive sleep apnea pregnancy induce hypertension patient develop symptomatic OSA offer polysomnographic evaluation second/third trimester . - An offer similar service make pregnant female develop pregnancy induce hypertension similar gestational age . Case : patient OSA Control : patient without OSA - We propose determine proportion case expose sleep disorder proportion . - We also plan determine proportion control expose proportion . Cases control would match age , parity , BMI , previous h/o pre-eclampsia first trimester . Outcome parameters 1 . Prevalence various sleep disorder pregnancy 2 . Maternal outcome : Development pregnancy induce hypertension ( PIH ) , gestational diabetes mellitus , complicate pregnancy require admission , preterm delivery , ante-partum hemorrhage , delivery require intervention ( Caesarian section , forceps/ventouse application ) 3 . Fetal outcome : APGAR score 1 5 min , IUGR , IUD , low birth weight Sample Size : A sample convenience 200 patient ( respond questionnaire ) satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion follow prospectively assess effect sleep disorder pregnancy outcome.As per estimate literature sample size case control part would 20 case 40 control . Investigation specifically related project : 1 . Using Somnomedic system , GmbH polysomnography machine trained staff nurse technician : - Obstetrics ward , AIIMS hospital - Home base portable PSG non admit 2 . Ambulatory blood pressure Oscar 2™ system SunTech Medical , USA . The Oscar 2 clinically validate three internationally recognize standard . - British Hypertension Society1 ( A/A ) - European Society Hypertension International Protocol2 - AAMI SP103 Patient comfort The Oscar 2 Orbit™ BP cuff make patient comfort priority . - The SunTech Medical , Inc. patent Orbit cuff us innovative stretch-sleeve design maintain cuff placement promote patient comfort . - The Oscar 2 light , compact monitor use motion tolerant algorithms reduce re-inflates failed reading . The auto-intelligent inflation pressure also reduce measurement time , promote patient comfort control cuff inflation . 3 . Screening Polysomnography use Apnea linkTM PLUS - A quick easy sleep-screening tool design help identify patient risk obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . - A premium , compact device use home Additional Investigation Required - Routine clinical antenatal examination - Blood pressure measurement - Blood parameter ( do routinely ANC ) - Fasting blood sugar - Renal hepatic function test - Hemoglobin levels/s ferritin - Serum TSH level - Urine examination - Routine spot sample protein . - Sonography : To rule twin pregnancy molar gestation/IUGR/Anomalies . - These investigation routinely do ante natal clinic AIIMS . Data Analysis - Data collect pre-designed proforma . - Statistical analysis perform use STATA 11 Windows software ( intercooled version , Stata Corporation , Houston , TX , USA ) . - After assess approximate normal distribution , continuous variable summarize mean ± SD median ( interquartile range ) . - Categorical variable express n ( % ) . - The case control compare use unpaired t-test data normally distribute Mann-Whitney U test . - A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . - Confounding factor influence pregnancy outcome subject multivariate analysis determine significance .</detailed_description>
