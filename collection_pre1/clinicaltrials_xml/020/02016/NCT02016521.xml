	<brief_summary>In human , primary mean cool body exercise evaporation sweat skin surface . Clothing represent layer insulation hinders evaporation sweat surface skin . It follow clothing imposes least amount resistance evaporative heat loss may prove beneficial thermoregulatory , physiological perceptual response exercise , particularly elite endurance-trained athlete . Thus , purpose study examine influence wear sportswear garment make fabric ( 100 % nylon ) superior evaporative characteristic detailed thermoregulatory , cardiorespiratory , metabolic perceptual response maximal exercise test normal room temperature relatively humidity group 25 endurance-trained cyclist triathletes age 20-60 year . It hypothesize wear garment make 100 % nylon improve exercise performance ( e.g. , exercise endurance time ) improvement reflect improvement thermoregulatory , cardiorespiratory , metabolic perceptual response exercise . Athletes recruit via contact coach McGill University Cycling Triathlon team well contact coach competitive cycling triathlon teams/training group Montreal surround area . Initial contact consist thorough explanation study procedures pre-screening inclusion/exclusion criterion prior study consent Principal Investigator and/or delegate , either person telephone email . Eligible participant visit McGill 's Clinical Exercise &amp; Respiratory Physiology Laboratory 3 separate occasion period 10-14 day . Visit 1 include maximal incremental bicycle exercise test familiarization purpose determine maximal power output ( MPO ) . Visits 2 3 include constant-power-output bicycle exercise test 85 % MPO one two condition , randomize order : ( 1 ) wear garment make 100 % polyester , i.e. , placebo ; ( 2 ) wear garment make 100 % nylon , i.e. , cool fabric . At rest exercise visit 2 3 , detailed assessment core body temperature make use temperature sensor place esophagus , skin temperature physiological perceptual parameter measure use standard technique .</brief_summary>
