	<brief_summary>The study examine clinical radiographic outcome microfracture surgery ( common technique address isolate area cartilage loss ) knee use without unloader bracing . Randomly select patient wear unloader brace , design take pressure area knee underwent repair , several week surgery . Our hypothesis bracing may improve clinical radiographic outcome . The surgery perform patient The length follow schedule post-operative MRI patient . The difference group presence absence brace wear .</brief_summary>

Radiographic outcome assess via MRI scan post-operatively . Randomly select patient wear unloader brace , design take pressure area knee underwent repair , several week surgery . Our hypothesis bracing may improve clinical radiographic outcome . The surgery perform patient The length follow schedule post-operative MRI patient . The difference group presence absence brace wear .</detailed_description>
