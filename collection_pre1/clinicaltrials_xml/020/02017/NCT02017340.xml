	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ever-increasing public health concern among age population common form dementia affect 15 million individual worldwide around 5 million Europeans . The direct indirect cost AD dementias amount €440,000 million year ( www.alz.org , 2010 ) . Even modest therapeutic advance delay disease onset progression could significantly reduce global burden disease level care require patient . While symptomatic-based drug therapy available AD , medication prevent disease process . There therefore imperative develop new treatment AD disease modify effect . This double-blind placebo control study test efficacy safety nilvadipine 500 subject mild moderate AD treatment period 18 month . There strong scientific rationale study : Nilvadipine , license calcium channel enhance Aß clearance brain restore cortical perfusion mouse model AD . Nilvadipine safe well tolerated AD patient clinical study medication show stabilization cognitive decline reduce incidence AD , point symptomatic disease modify benefit . Male female patient mild moderate AD age 50 90 range medical morbidity frailty include study . If trial successful , nilvadipine would represent advance treatment AD patient would major impact health social care cost incur Europe neurodegenerative disorder . Furthermore , creation NILVAD network support future clinical trial research innovation AD across Europe .</brief_summary>
