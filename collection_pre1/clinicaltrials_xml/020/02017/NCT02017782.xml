	<brief_summary>The aim study provide information may help improve quality life person expose indoor environment Danish dwelling . The experiment document dust ozone contribute deterioration indoor air quality occurrence symptom health effect . The study aim test hypothesis presence ozone potentiate health comfort effect dust exposure indoor environment . Testing hypothesis base following question : Does house dust ozone concentration frequently encounter Danish dwelling cause unwanted health effect either interaction ? If , presence ozone potentiate expect irritative effect dust ? The challenge hypothesis make controlled experiment human climate chamber control exposure condition . This control human experiment able substantiate finding intervention study . Furthermore , ideally reflect something relevant general public therefore maximum public appeal application possibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study part broad research programme establish CISBO ( Centre Indoor air Health Dwellings ) . The purpose centre increase general knowledge provide information indoor air quality relate Health effect . The study may contribute basic information underlie pathophysiological mechanism involve human response pollutant interactive effect . The study include method technique detect minor change biomarkers suggest early effect exposure . These analysis give information high sensitive level exposure effect biomarkers array symptoms reaction . The study Group consitss 24 non-smoking person ( age 60-70 ) . A controlled , randomize balance Latin square cross-over design use participant control . The exposure arrange full-scale climate chamber participant expose 5½ hour control environmental condition . The exposure facility ( Climate chamber ) : The exposure arrange control experimental facility department include climate chamber exposure generator dust ozone . The exposure session take place control condition 79 m3 climate chamber make weld stainless steel optimize experiment gas particulate air pollutant . The chamber facility allow exposure control ventilation , temperature air humidity efficient mix ventilation air chamber air . All participant attend four diff . exposure session : Dust ( 250-300µg/m3 ) , Ozone ( 0,1ppm ozone ) , Dust+ozone ( 250-300µg/m3 + 0,1 ppm ozone ) , Filtered air ( &lt; 20µg/m3 ) . least 2 week exposure session eliminate hang‐over effect . The filtered air dust ozone contaminate session identical except air quality . The exposure unknown participant staff keep study double blind . The blind continued basic statistical analysis conduct . Selected subjective objective health outcome measure baseline follow-up predefined time point . Health assessment Measurements include : Subjective symptom , Respiratory outcomes ( lung function , FENO , exhale breath condensate , nasal lavage , Acoustic Rhinometri ) Blood sample ( inflammation biomarkers )</detailed_description>
