	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study JX-594 Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Ovarian Cancer Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm open-label Phase 2 study patient peritoneal carcinomatosis ovarian origin eligible curative treatment . Patients receive 5 weekly IV infusion JX-594 continue receive IV infusion JX-594 every 3 week radiographically determine progressive disease . Using 2 stage trial design , 2 first 15 patient show clinical response define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.10 criterion ( 3 15 stable disease define Modified Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 clinically ) , arm expand total 25 patient ( Stage 2 ) . In Stage 1 , patient allot 1:1 ratio undergo laparoscopy tumor biopsy 10 day dose 1 10 day Dose 5 . A decision whether laparoscopy perform Stage 2 reach conclusion Stage 1 . Patients monitor study evidence progression death 12 month post treatment</detailed_description>
