	<brief_summary>Stroke first fourth lead cause death United States China , respectively . Disruption cerebrovascular vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque major etiology ischemic stroke . Therefore , early detection treatment vulnerable plaque occur feed artery brain ( cerebral artery ) helpful prevention stroke . Atherosclerosis systemic disease usually affect multiple vascular bed . Previous study show high risk lesion different segment cerebral artery ( intracranial extracranial artery ) might racially specific . It report , stroke patient , intracranial vulnerable plaque prevalent Asian population whereas atherosclerosis frequently involve extracranial carotid artery American subject . However , finding base angiographic image approach via measure arterial luminal stenosis . Because atherosclerotic plaque often appear outward expansion , namely positive remodel progression , measure luminal stenosis underestimate disease severity . Hence , directly view plaque vessel wall strongly suggest order objectively evaluate cerebrovascular vulnerable plaque . High resolution , black-blood magnetic resonance ( MR ) image widely use accurately characterize carotid vulnerable plaque last two decade . The aim use MR black-blood technique suppress blood signal ( black ) enhance signal contrast vessel wall blood arterial lumen . Excellent agreement achieve MR image histology identification plaque component , intraplaque hemorrhage lipid core . For assess carotid plaque , MR image superior compute tomography ultrasound image technique due advantage include noninvasive imaging , lack ionizing radiation , excellent soft tissue resolution , multi-parametric image acquisition . The Investigators hypothesize specific characteristic carotid vulnerable plaque Chinese patient ischemic cerebrovascular event ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . This study seek investigate characteristic vulnerable plaque carotid artery use high resolution , black-blood MR imaging patient recent TIA ischemic stroke . This cross-sectional , multicenter study . A total 1000 patient recruit 10 different hospital across China within 3 year . All patient undergo MR image brain carotid artery within two week symptom onset . The prevalence carotid vulnerable plaque correlation brain ischemic lesion , traditional risk factor , regional distribution China determine .</brief_summary>
