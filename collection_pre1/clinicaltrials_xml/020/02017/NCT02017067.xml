	<brief_summary>Previous study demonstrate resistance training ( RT ) beneficial increase muscle strength , improve functional ability ability rapidly produce force , know contractile rate force development ( RFD ) old adult . However , much less research focus effect RT low extremity muscle strength , contractile RFD impulse middle-aged old people musculoskeletal condition , especially osteoporosis ( OP ) ( osteopenia ) knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) . Therefore , purpose study investigate effect RT low extremity muscle strength , RFD impulse middle-aged old people musculoskeletal condition , especially OP knee OA ( KOA ) . The investigator hypothesize training program would lead induce specific muscle strength enhancement also increment contractile RFD impulse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Exercise Training Community-dwelling Adults With Chronic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis ( OP ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) two common musculoskeletal condition older adult , cause high healthcare cost negative effect quality life . Previous study report OP OA strong association sarcopenia , term define age-related involuntary loss skeletal muscle mass strength function.A decline muscle mass strength old adult may limit variety activity daily live ( ADLs ) increase morbidity mortality . However , many ADLs often involve faster limb movement contraction time 50 - 200 m ( i.e . sit-to-stand performance avoid fall ) . Therefore , addition muscle mass strength , ability rapidly produce force , know contractile rate force development ( RFD ) , area force-time curve , define contractile impulse , seem important adequately characterize performance ADLs old adult . Typically , resistance training ( RT ) often prescribed increase muscle strength , improve functional ability eliminate much age-associated muscle atrophy weakness healthy population . Other study also show implementation RT help improve RFD healthy young elderly individual follow RT . However , still unclear effect RT contractile RFD impulse middle-aged old people musculoskeletal condition . Therefore , aim study examine effect low extremity muscle strength , contractile rate force development ( RFD ) , impulse middle-aged old people osteoporosis ( OP ) ( osteopenia ) knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) 12 week resistance training .</detailed_description>
