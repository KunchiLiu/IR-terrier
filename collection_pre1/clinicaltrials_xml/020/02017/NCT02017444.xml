	<brief_summary>Assessing safety effectiveness 11-βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor ( AZD4017 ) , placebo control trial , acute idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) IIH condition young , overweight woman characteristic raise intracranial pressure ( pressure around brain ) lead papilloedema ( swell nerve supply eye ) , visual loss headache . Medical literature ( Cochrane review ) demonstrate little evidence treatment use IIH . Weight control appear effective method improve symptom weight loss difficult maintain . 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11β-HSD1 ) enzyme regulate local steroid level previous research suggest may influence production brain fluid ( cerebrospinal fluid CSF ) . 11β-HSD1 level fall weight loss associate decreased intracranial pressure . Our primary outcome determine whether AZD4017 , inhibitor 11β-HSD1 , reduce pressure brain consequence improve IIH . Patients eligible enter study 18-55 year old acute ( &lt; 6 month ) IIH , sign active disease ( papilloedema raise CSF pressure ( &gt; 25 cmH20 ) ) , major illness plan pregnancy study period . This MRC fund single centre , phase II , double-blinded , randomised control drug trial . It conduct University Hospital Birmingham University Birmingham act Sponsor . Eligible participant randomly assign AZD4017 placebo ( 'dummy ' active drug ) 3 month follow month later . Investigations study include blood , urine sample , pregnancy test , lumbar puncture , DXA scan small fat/skin biopsy . Participants benefit increased monitoring potential improvement condition . We hypothesise specific inhibition 11β-HSD1 decrease intracranial pressure consequently treat patient IIH , thus open new entirely novel therapeutic avenue .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision inform consent prior study specific procedure . Female patient 18 55 year Diagnosis IIH Modified Dandy criteria1 : 1. acute ( &lt; 6 month ) , 2. active disease ( papilloedema ( Frisen grade great equal 1 ) , 3. significantly raise ICP &gt; 25cmH2O ) 4. normal brain image previous routine diagnostic work ( evaluate either magnetic resonance venography computerise tomography venography ) . Patients must willing use one form highly effective nonhormonal contraception . This would include : 1. vasectomised partner ( sole partner ) tubal occlusion 2. copper contain IUD use addition diaphragm cervical/vault cap barrier contraceptive ( condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/suppository ) 3. true abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Women stable chosen method birth control minimum 2 month enter trial . Patients must agree undergo βhCG pregnancy test urine dipstick test screen urine dipstick test trial visit ( include final follow visit 4 week discontinuation study treatment ) . Note : use contraception pregnancy test would require screen LH/FSH level demonstrate patient postmenopausal . Participants able continue medication treat IIH e.g . acetazolamide , diuretic dose must remain fixed throughout study . Patients take aspirin therapy ask discontinue aspirin 3 day prior fat skin biopsy clinically safe . Placebo treatment duration study must consider detrimental patient . Must able understand consent form comply study requirement . Optic nerve sheath fenestration . Patients undergo CSF shunt insertion ( elective pre plan ) study , result deterioration withdrawn study . Abnormal neurological examination ( aside papilloedema consequent visual loss VI nerve palsy ) . Subjects secondary cause raise intracranial pressure exclude ( venous thrombosis , anaemia , drug cause ( lithium , vitamin A , tetracycline others deem responsible condition ) . Abnormal CSF content ( except compatible traumatic LP ) . Unable perform visual field reliably . General Positive hCG urine dipstick pregnancy test planning conceive 4 study month . Have eGFR calculate MDRD equation &lt; 60ml/min/1.73m2 . Have endocrine disorder , e.g . thyroid dysfunction . This exclude PCOS know association IIH . Suspicion known Gilbert 's disease .
