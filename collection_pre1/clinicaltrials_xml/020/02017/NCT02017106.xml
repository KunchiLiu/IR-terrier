	<brief_title>Concomitant Sequential Phlebectomy After Endovenous Laser Therapy Varicose Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endovenous laser therapy ( EVLT ) varicose vein associate high initial occlusion rate , minimal complication low recurrence rate 5 year . Randomized trial meta-analyses confirm efficacy EVLT comparison surgery endovenous technique . There also evidence may associate early quality life ( QoL ) benefit compare surgery . The general efficacy EVLT therefore demonstrate current research focus refinement procedure . A fundamental question concern management residual varicosity follow truncal laser ablation . One approach leave varicosity regress untouched , minimize procedure time surgical trauma6 . This approach , however , associate significant number secondary tertiary intervention ( sclerotherapy and/or ambulatory phlebectomy ) . Another option combine single procedure ambulatory phlebectomy initial truncal laser ablation ( EVLTAP ) . The aim randomize control trial ass advantage perform ambulatory phlebectomy concomitant procedure truncal laser ablation .</detailed_description>
