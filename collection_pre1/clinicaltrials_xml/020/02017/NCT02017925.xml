	<brief_title>Pulmonary Rehabilitation Improving Lung Function Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) patient locally advance unresectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) undergo definite chemotherapy radiation therapy . II . To measure exercise capacity respiratory symptom lung cancer patient receive chemotherapy radiation pulmonary rehabilitation . III . To compare difference symptom relief , exercise capacity , cancer treatment tolerability perform pulmonary rehabilitation chemo-radiation versus completion lung cancer treatment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Beginning within 2 week start chemoradiation , patient undergo individualized rehabilitation program comprising aerobic exercise strength training , include treadmill walking , stationary bicycle , NU-Step , upper body resistance train breathe retraining , 3 time per week 8 week ( 36 session ) . ARM II : Beginning 1 month completion chemoradiation , patient undergo individualized exercise rehabilitation program Arm I .</detailed_description>
