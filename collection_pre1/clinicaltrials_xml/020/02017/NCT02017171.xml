	<brief_summary>Despite improvement past 20 year blood glucose blood pressure control , diabetic kidney disease remain one important cause health problem patient diabetes . Novel treatment complement blood glucose blood pressure control urgently need . The goal study see whether medication call allopurinol may help prevent loss kidney function among people type 1 diabetes . Allopurinol use many year decrease high blood uric acid treat gout - disease characterize arthritis , especially foot joint . There evidence suggest allopurinol might also useful people diabetes normal moderately impaired kidney function decrease risk develop advanced kidney disease future . To prove beneficial effect allopurinol , conduct international clinical trial eight diabetes center , enrol approximately 480 patient type 1 diabetes increase risk develop kidney disease . Participants randomly assign take allopurinol placebo ( inactive pill ) three year , follow periodical visit . To prevent possible bias , neither participant clinical staff know take allopurinol take placebo . Kidney function measure begin end treatment period see whether patient take allopurinol experience slow loss kidney function time compare take inactive pill . If trial successful , reduction health problem result prevention delay kidney function loss due use allopurinol would major impact live type 1 diabetic patient well society large , significantly reduce human financial cost associate diabetic kidney disease . Because emphasis early intervention , propose trial , successful , establish new paradigm treatment slow prevent progression towards end stage kidney disease type 1 diabetes far beyond anything achieved date .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite improvement past 20 year glycemic blood pressure control introduction 'renoprotective ' drug renin-angiotensin system blocker , incidence end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) decline . Novel therapy complement intervention urgently need . Mounting evidence prospective study indicate moderately elevate serum uric acid strong , independent predictor increase risk chronic kidney disease increase rate loss kidney function among T1D person . To study whether uric acid lower reduce glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) loss T1D , establish PERL ( Preventing Early Renal Function Loss Diabetes ) Consortium include investigator Joslin Diabetes Center , Universities Minnesota , Colorado , Toronto , Michigan , Northwestern University , Albert Einstein College Medicine , Steno Diabetes Center Denmark . With support NIH grant R03 DK094484 , Consortium design three-year , multi-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial specific aim evaluate efficacy urate-lowering drug allopurinol , compare placebo , reduce kidney function loss among subject T1D . The trial target T1D patient microalbuminuria moderate macroalbuminuria ongoing kidney function decline serum uric acid level ≥ 4.5 mg/dl , since patient high risk rapid GFR decline might benefit reduction uric acid level . Study subject require GFR 40 99 ml/min/1.73 m2 , consistent goal intervene relatively early course clinical DN rather later stag structural change far advance large proportion kidney function already lose . The primary endpoint study GFR ( measure iohexol plasma disappearance ) end 2-month wash-out period 3-year intervention . Sample size calculation various dropout non-adherence scenario suggest 240 subject treatment arm would provide least 80 % power detect clinically meaningful achievable reduction GFR decline allopurinol vs. placebo group.If demonstrate allopurinol halt slow GFR decline T1D subject , provide safe inexpensive intervention prevent delay kidney failure T1D apply early clinically detectable stage renal injury . It difficult overstate significant finding would , perspective public health person diabetes .</detailed_description>
