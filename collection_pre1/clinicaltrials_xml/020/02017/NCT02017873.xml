	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate effectiveness longevity color Tooth sensitivity patient undergoing home whiten peroxide 10 % carbamide ( Whiteness Perfect , FGM , Joinville , Santa Catarina , Brazil ) , relationship cigarette use tooth whiten . They select 120 patient incisor darker A2 , high plant divide 2 group per center ( n = 30 ) , GE - Group Experimental ( smoke ) GC - Group Control ( non-smoking ) . For two group use Carbamide peroxide 10 % 3 hour daily period 3 week . Color evaluate Vita Classical scale Vita Easyshade Spectrophotometer period : Home , tooth whiten ( 1st , 2nd 3rd week ) post- whitening ( 1 week 1 month , 2 3 month ) . Patients record perceived sensitivity Numerical Analogue Scale ( NRS ) value 0 4 , 0 = sensation , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe 4 = significant , also Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , value 0 10 0 = 10 = severe tenderness sensitivity . color analysis make two-way ANOVA ( group vs. treatment time ) , Over time repeat measure ( α = 0.05 ) . Test hold Tukey contrast average ( α = 0.05 ) . The sensitivity evaluate Fisher exact test . It expect difference effectiveness home whiten tooth sensitivity smoker nonsmoker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct CONSORT recommendation respect principle Helsinsky convention corresponds multicenter study conjunction University Ponta Grossa Brazil ( Deputy resolution protocol ethic committee ( Appendix A B ) . Will invite participate study patient come clinic FOUCH public poster . Subsequently 120 volunteer select criterion qualify inclusion exclusion study report volunteer examine qualify criterion inclusion part initial n , accord CONSORT recommendation . After sign informed ( TCLE ) consent ( Appendix 3 ) shall make prophylaxis teeth upper low teeth , removal extrinsic stain jet sodium bicarbonate ( Profi class , Ribeirao Preto , Sao Paulo , Brazil ) , two week begin tooth whiten . Inclusion exclusion criterion : Patients include study must 18 , good general health buccal , teeth free carious lesion periodontal disease , agree inform consent document . And color anterior teeth high classified A2 great value , accord scale VITA Classical ( Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Sackingen , Germany ) spectrophotometer Easyshade Vita ( Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Sackingen , Germany ) . Evaluation color VITA scale Classical make independently two calibrate investigator blind . Be exclude study patient : already make treatment tooth whitening , dental prosthesis option upper front teeth , pregnant lactating , present gingival recession , sensitivity dental , endodontic treatment anterior maxillary teeth , color severe internal , non-carious cervical lesion , take medication , use fix orthodontic appliance , submit bruxism habit , visible teeth crank available attend control . Study Design Patients divide two group ( n = 60 ) , GC ( control group ) GE ( group experimental ) . At initial consultation volunteer ask smoke habit daily . Patients smoke part GC , heavy smoker ( 10 day ) part GE.A cigarettes smoker complementary give booklet tip quit smoking damage , sit find information . ( Annex C ) The teeth whitening technique select study , technique home bleaching , validate group . Treatment follow-up cost patient . For development individual bucket , impression upper low arch patient Jeltrate Plus alginate ( Dentply , Petrópolis , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ) , mold cast plaster immediately print . After obtain plaster model cut take vacuum laminator ( Protécni , Araraquara , Sao Paulo , Brazil ) make bucket individual vinyl acetate 1 mm thick ( Plate Pail Whiteness -FGM , Joinville , Santa Catarina , Brazil ) . Cuvettes acetate cut inch margin gingival . For group PC gel use 10 % ( Whiteness Perfect , FGM , Joinville , Santa Catarina , Brazil ) , period 3 hour day three week ) . After test cuvette acetate individual , method application product carefully explain patient study follow : Dispense drop region product correspond buccal surface tooth tray . The amount gel sufficient remain contact buccal tooth surface without cover gingival third , prevent injury . After period , patient instruct withdraw tray whiten gel perform vigorous mouth rinse water complete removal product . Evaluation Color Subjective method Color assess scale VITA Classical ( Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Sackingen , Germany ) , consist 16 color guide , organize value , high value ( B1 ) low value ( C4 ) . Although scale linear , organize accord rank range valor . Represent purpose analysis . Two blind reviewer record color right maxillary central incisor patient scale VITA Classical ( Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Sackingen , Germany ) . At follow time : initial , 1st week , 2nd week , 3rd week ( active phase bleach ) post- bleach period : 1 week , 1 month , 2 3 month . Evaluators always record color independently room lighting . If discrepancy color registration , new evaluation conduct together consenso . The area choose color measurement middle third labial surface central incisor , accord ADA specification . The color change evaluate mean vary scale Vita unit ( ΔUEV ) organize value . Objective method The color also measure spectrophotometer Easyshade ( Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Sackingen , Germany ) accord CIELab system Vita . Calibration equipment always make measurement , three measurement tooth make . The evaluation conduct time method subjective . For standardize measuring color , mold teeth upper arch heavy condensation silicone ( Coltoflax profile cub , Vigodent , Rio de Janeiro hold , Brazil ) make silicone matrix . The matrix use standardize region tooth color measure spectrophotometer . The matrix drill vestibular region , middle third , upper teeth , use scalpel circular 6 mm diameter , Biopsy punch ( Miltex , York , PA USA ) , similar diameter tip spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade . Color recurrence begin day patient bleach , spectrophotometer use sufficient sensitivity determine minimal color change , base construction algorithm detection dimension h b color . ( Jadad et al . , 2011 ) Evaluation Dental Sensitivity In initial clinical examination patient , baseline sensitivity measure vertical , horizontal drum , air jet application probe teeth , compare sensitivity whiten dental.Durante whitening , patient record presence absence tooth sensitivity , newspaper tooth sensitivity use analog numerical scale ( ENR ) , value 0 4 , : 0 = tenderness , 1 = Slight , 2 = moderate 3 = considerably 4 = severe . And visual analogue scale ( VAS ) value 0 10 0 = sensitivity 10 = severe . Patients mark vertical line across horizontal line scale correspond intensity tooth sensitivity . After measurement millimeter make aid millimeter ruler . Annex 5 6 value organize two category : percentage patient tooth sensitivity time treatment ( absolute risk sensitivity ) intensity tooth sensitivity . Patients severe sensitivity immediately assist investigator reverse painful picture use desensitize / analgesic anti-inflammatory pain relief , patient remove study . If sensitivity use desensitize FMG KF 2 % ( nitrate Potassium Sodium Fluoride 2 % , Joinville , Brazil ) , literature present report RAM , reason Medical Adverse Event research team responsible additional medical dental treatment require follow-up , wake whitening procedure ( restoration , endodontics , etc . ) Statistical Analysis The color data obtain objective subjective analysis evaluate analysis variance two factor ( ANOVA ) repeat measure ( time vs. treatment group ) ( α = 0.05 ) . Tukey 's test perform test mean ( α = 0.05 ) . The absolute risk sensitivity evaluate Fisher exact test . Sampling calculation obtain G -Power 3.1 program consider Beta error 0.8 , alpha error 0.05 , mean sample calculation 25 patient per group per center , consider drop-out report publish work ( 5 % ) decide increase 30 n sample size group per center . Coincident Odds Ratio clinical work whiten past 10 year .</detailed_description>
