In contrast , Ivor Lewis esophagectomy , resection esophagus limit level thoracic inlet cervical lymph node dissection impossible unless neck incision create . However , take less time perform whole procedure save neck incision . In study , would conduct prospective randomize study compare surgical result Tri-incision Ivor Lewis approach esophagectomy treat esophageal cancer . Both procedure perform video-assisted thoracic surgical ( VATS ) esophagectomy laparoscopic gastric mobilization esophageal reconstruction . The primary end-point overall survival secondary end-point would perioperative complication , postoperative recovery quality life . Patients Methods This study include patient diagnosis esophageal cancer undergo curative surgical resection surgical department National Taiwan University Hospital . All patient receive stag study tumor include compute tomography ( CT ) brain , neck , chest abdomen , panendoscopy endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , position emission tomography compute tomography ( optionally ) bronchoscopy tumor locate mid-to-low third thoracic esophagus . The patient care accord perioperative routine protocol thoracic surgical department National Taiwan University Hospital , include preoperative respiratory exercise training , nutritional support postoperative bronchoscopic toileting , chest physical therapy . Jejunostomy feeding start postoperative day 2 3 , oral intake start 10 day 2 week surgery anastomotic leakage demonstrate contrast swallowing image study . Exclusion criterion : Poor lung function FEV1 le 70 % prediction . Major systemic co-morbidity : e.g . CVA , end-stage renal disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure . Presence tracheal invasion distant metastasis tumor Primary end point : Overall survival duration Secondary end pint : Disease-free survival duration Surgical complication Postoperative ICU stay hospital stay Quality Life Change lung function surgery Anesthesia perioperative care Epidural analgesia agree patient administer surgery . The patient intubate ventilated double-lumen endotracheal tube surgery . After surgery , extubation give satisfactory general condition include oxygenation , spontaneous breathe vital sign observe . However , temporary ventilator support give patient high surgical risk intensive care unit ( ICU ) wean base wean parameter general condition patient . Jejunostomy feed begin stool flatus passage detect . Oral intake begin esophagogram examination reveal anastomotic leakage , usually 10 14 day surgery . Postoperative clinical follow-up The patient follow out-patient clinic discharge least tri monthly . Pan-endoscopy , computer tomography brain , neck , chest abdomen do every three month immediately 2 year surgery every six month thereafter . Life quality lung function evaluate one , three six month surgery . Power calculation : With difference 10 % postoperative complication two group study , 50 patient require recruited study group . The status surgical complication , disease progression recurrence survival evaluate year . Any significant difference detect analysis call early termination study protect patient injury inadequate treatment .</detailed_description>
