	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancer mouth throat one common cancer Taiwan . This cancer develop several year , begin white red patch mouth throat become growth . It also cause condition lead rigidity cheek . The growth identify doctor look person mouth . It currently clear people abnormal growths progress cancer others . Researchers want good understand patient early abnormal growth get late abnormal growth . They also want understand people get abnormal growth , even receive treatment . Objectives : - To understand people precancerous lesion mouth develop cancer others . Eligibility : - Adults 21 year old , abnormal growth mouth , without , head neck cancer . Design : - Participants visit hospital Taiwan 2 time . - At first visit , participant answer question health , lifestyle , family medical history .

Participants also give blood saliva sample , plus small sample mouth rinse . - Participants diagnose late abnormal growth cancer return second visit . They answer question undergo procedure first study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral cancer ideal candidate screen , early detection , secondary prevention give amenability visual inspection specimen collection availability recognize precursor . Yet , currently guideline screen , treatment , follow-up patient oral cancer precursor , part , owe current gap knowledge regard natural history precursor lesion . We propose conduct prospective cohort study patient oral cancer precursor address knowledge gap investigate novel etiologic factor . In preparation cohort study , recently conduct pilot study Taiwan , country high oral cancer incidence . This pilot aim streamline field operation collect preliminary data aid design cohort study . As detailed concept , successfully accomplished goal pilot study , include successful recruitment retention patient well collection critical preliminary data . Based effort , seek approval conduct prospective cohort study 3000 patient precursor investigate natural history histologically-defined oral cancer precursor lesion evaluate epidemiologic/ molecular predictor progression . This prospective component complement cross-sectional comparison epidemiologic/molecular factor across 500 control , 3000 precursor , 500 cancer .</detailed_description>
