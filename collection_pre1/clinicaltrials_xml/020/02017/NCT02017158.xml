	<brief_title>Virtual Sprouts : Web-based Gardening Games Teach Nutrition Combat Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1-16 C.1.a : Overview Plan : This project proceed three iterative phase : Development , Dissemination Evaluation . Development ) curriculum , b ) virtual garden c ) pedagogical agent proceed parallel , integrated test evaluation . A participatory research group comprise key community member , teacher , clinician , education expert , 8-11 year old youth parent form provide iterative round input evaluation throughout development Virtual Sprouts . This participatory research group provide input focus group , beta testing , idea-building advisement throughout development Virtual Sprouts . We successfully use model previous health intervention study . The participatory research group compose 20 diverse member tax individual member study needs ensure diverse input . Sub-groups large participatory research group form specific task , depend research need group interest . The Virtual Sprouts Game develop around virtual pedagogical agent , guide player game use cognitive affective learning principle . The Virtual Environment game system develop use deep narrative dramatic element . Both pedagogical agent game environment extensively iteratively tested member participatory research group development . The Virtual Sprouts game introduce three USC Family Schools Elementary school , C.1.b : Curriculum Development : During first year grant , work develop focus group test nutrition gardening curriculum . Curriculum test iterative focus group beta test member participatory research group . The gardening nutrition program teach child health benefit fruit vegetable child learn additional skill math , science , history . The program include lesson relate culture , include grow crop cultural significance nopales , bean , corn squash ( latter three crop historically refer `` three sister '' ) . Gardening provide ideal vehicle teach Science , Technology , Engineering , Mathematics ( STEM ) topics plant grow garden manage environmentally sound manner ( science include biology , earth science , agriculture , study weather climate ) , make good nutrition choice produce harvest ( nutrition science , health behavior ) . Furthermore , think planting , harvesting , climate involve great deal math engineering . The web-based interactive nature Virtual Sprouts game introduce child new us advanced technology . C.1.c : Game , Pedagogical Agent Virtual Environment Integration : The game contain Pedagogical Agent Virtual Environment provide interaction framework play mechanic . Rather serial task-driven game , envision persistent virtual environment player explore Virtual Sprouts challenge nurtured agent joint social play activity . Play experience episodic , require minute play per day several week . Certain interaction virtual environment joint activity ( water harvest vegetable ) , challenge issue agent involve agent personally . For example , agent may challenge learner plant , grow , harvest ingredient certain recipe , prepare . Based quality learner work , agent may like dislike result meal . Use kind intrinsic feedback blur line learn gameplay , make agent integral thus indispensable part experience . During first year , determine breadth ( variety ) depth ( challenge ) game experience relation garden cook task appropriate target population paper prototyping iterative play test ( Fullerton T , Swain C , Hoffman S. , 2008 ) . C.1.d : Pedagogical Agent Components : The pedagogical agent consist several key component , combine , provide knowledgeable , friendly , entertain companion learn Virtual Sprouts environment cognitive-affective approach . These component include : 1 . Expert knowledge : The character posse cognitive model effective gardening cook allow support activity Virtual Sprouts game . This enable agent explain create maintain healthy garden , harvest cook item garden , provide explanation health benefit eat organically prepared food . The expert model also form basis assessment learner activity give credit take correct action ( e.g. , water correct time amount ) know 've make mistake ( e.g. , plant two seed close one another ) . These assessment fee pedagogical decision system . 2 . Pedagogical knowledge : The provision guidance require delicate balance provide timely ( want ) support allow learner feel sense freedom remain stay control feel sense ownership garden . Care must therefore take decision provide guidance . Too little guidance lead frustration many user ( i.e. , agent helpful ) , much may threaten user ' feeling autonomy freedom game environment ( i.e. , agent perceive control ) . Thus , combination unsolicited guidance trigger evidence confusion and/or lack domain knowledge solicit guidance , learner request help , agent seek productive helper ensure learner acquire need knowledge skill succeed Virtual Sprouts , regular life relate eat exercise . 3 . Emotion/affect knowledge : In addition support game play provide explanation game event , agent also support learner 's affective state . Cultivating nurturing interest , motivation , positive feeling domain critical pursuit behavior change , expression empathy agent play learner 's willingness remain engage ( McQuiggan , S.W. , Rowe , J.P. , &amp; Lester , J.C. , 2008 ) . These intervention technique implement concert game- cognitive-focused tactic describe . For example , user beginning complete first vegetable receive high praise , diminish time specific accomplishment . Similarly , learner express negative perception gardening vegetable , agent work harder motivate entertain . 4 . Animation sound : As discuss , appearance agent impact learner 's affective state , interaction . A well-known respected character , one model First Lady ( possible ) , increase chance establish familiarity credibility outset . Use appeal animation joint activity , water garden simultaneously , bolster feeling co-presence teamwork . The character 's voice , deliver along subtitle English second language learner , chosen base preference user target audience early testing system . C.1.e : Game , Pedagogical Agent Virtual Environment Development : The phase development outline : 1 . Domain knowledge learn objective analysis : ( Desurvire , H. , &amp; Wiberg , C. , 2008 ) . 2 . Expert model feedback : 3 . Pedagogical agent design &amp; prototyping : 4 . Agent game integration : I 5 . Agent visual content revision : C.1.g : Teacher Professional Development : The vehicle training teacher use Virtual Sprout game hybrid approach include Summer Teacher Academy ( STA ) serve kick program face case USC Distance Education Network ( DEN ) mediate , school site follow-up professional development elementary school classroom use lesson study approach . Teacher academy recognize teacher education literature powerful impactful way comprehensively train support teacher ( Crowther , D.T. , Vil√° J.S. , Fathman A.K. , 2006 ) . The Summer Teacher Academy : A summer teacher academy ( STA ) occur August implementation year immediately year one program 's development phase year 2-5 . Through STA , teacher train annually . The academy three day long USC 's campus target school relative close proximity USC . Mornings academy spent learn nutrition conceptual knowledge , explore application practice use guide experiential learn approach facilitate game use . The content training align grade 6-12 California health content standard focus nutrition relate health . Lesson study , begin observational demo progress teacher create role-play focus professional development . The teacher participant spend portion morning observe practice Virtual Sprouts game , discuss application use game classroom . As academic year follow-up , teacher participant practice use Virtual Sprouts game application engage peer review game facilitation fellow teacher ( lesson study ) tandem USC teacher education expert classroom .</detailed_description>
