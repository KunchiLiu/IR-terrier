	<detailed_description>During chronic HBV infection , dynamic balance viral replication host immune response pivotal pathogenesis liver disease . HBV specific T-cell function impair patient chronic HBV infection characterize low level antiviral cytokine , impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity , persistent viremia . However , mechanism underlie T-cell malfunction chronic HBV infection completely understood . The biomedical research sample obtain study include , among study , advance flow cytometry study Treg activation marker , negative regulatory molecule phenotype CD4 CD8 subset use extended panel marker develop VGTI Florida . Additional antibody panel measure functional CD4 response ICS , DC subset , activation , signal pathway phos</detailed_description>
