	<brief_title>Fetal Thyroid Ultrasound And Fetal Thyroid Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune thyroid disease complicate 5-20 % unselected pregnancy . The crucial impacting factor pregnancy outcomes mother autoimmune thyroid disease thyroxine level change . But , fetal hypo hyperthyroidism find treat pregnant woman autoimmune thyroid disease , even thyroid hormone normal range , thyroid antibody , antithyroid drug iodine pas placenta . Our previous result show high fetal free thyroxine ( fT4 ) level measure cordocentesis unexpectedly frequent woman autoimmune thyroid disease , include maternal autoimmune hypo- hyperthyroidism . Increasing awareness even mild fetal disorder impact later neurophysiologic development health individual make recognition therapy fetal hypo- hyperthyroidism increasingly significant domain interest . According result , fetal fT4 concentration correlate neither dose medication ultrasound biometric parameter ; range maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) correlate predominantly normal fT4 mark . The type concentration antithyroid antibody might prognostic value . There grow list publication refer ultrasound measurement fetal thyroid important tool detect fetal thyroid dysfunction . Fetal thyroid measurement become part clinical guideline pregnancy complicate maternal thyroid disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant woman diagnose treated autoimmune hyper hypothyroidism : Disease diagnose endocrinologist , base clinical laboratory test ultrasound thyroid examination . All hyper hypothyroid woman positive one thyroid antibodies enter study . Patients autoimmune thyroid disease include study first half pregnancy , later 20th week gestation For pregnant woman control group : euthyroid , antithyroid antibody within reference range , healthy uncomplicated pregnancy Patients chronic disease ( except thyroid disease ) past medical history record . Pregnancy induce disease part exclusion criterion ( gestational diabetes pregnancy induce hypertension ) patient whose pregnancy result assisted reproductive technology exclude study . mother control group exclude , neonate abnormal thyroid function</criteria>
