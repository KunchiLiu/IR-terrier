	<brief_summary>Introduction Appendicitis common condition represent significant resource burden Scottish National Health Service ( NHS ) . It unknown whether significant difference outcomes follow appendicectomy may explain geographic factor . Aims The aim study describe appendicectomy outcome Scotland vary urban-rural nature patient 's home location travel time hospital . Methods This research study retrospective observational enquiry utilise administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . Patient episodes identified procedure code appendicectomy , urban-rural classification patient derive postcode data . Travel time hospital also estimate postcode data . The investigator study 10 year period January 2001 December 2010 . Primary outcome measure risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality , 30 day readmission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , length stay negative appendicectomy rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study explore possibility outcome appendicectomy may vary accord : 1. urban-rural nature patient 's home location 2. travel time hospital . This retrospective study appendicectomy perform Scotland period 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010 . It use routinely collect administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . Potentially significant confounding variable age , gender , co-morbidity study predictive value univariate model include multivariate model remain significant . There single appendicectomy outcome measure literature standard , follow evaluated primary outcome measure : risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality , 30 day readmission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , length stay negative appendicectomy rate . The registry supply data study Scottish Morbidity Record 01 ( SMR01 ) , full title `` General / Acute Inpatient Day Case dataset '' ( see http : //www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/ ? detail ) . SMR01 collate administered ISD , data submission mandatory Scottish NHS provider in-patient day-case care . Approximately 1.4 million record added year . Diagnoses cod accord International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) -10 standard procedure cod accord United Kingdom 's Office Population Census Statistics ( OPCS ) standard , recent version 4.5 . The data quality SMR01 high assure regular internal audit . In 2010 audit accuracy , Main Condition record accuracy 88 % Main Procedure record accuracy 94 % . Where data inconsistency identify extract supply study , clarification obtain possible ISD 's data retrieval support team . Data completeness high SMR01 . However , significant volume data miss unusable , need data imputation explore . The study period decide pragmatically desire provide assessment current practice , fully within era widely practise laparoscopic surgery . A power calculation also suggest would provide adequate sample size demonstrate difference . Our power calculation- specific length stay- base Faiz O , Clark J , Brown T , Bottle A , Antoniou A , Farrands P , et al . Traditional Laparoscopic Appendectomy Adults . Ann Surg . 2008 Nov ; 248 ( 5 ) :800-6 . In cohort 259,735 appendicectomy perform 1996-2006 , geometric mean length stay 3.52 , SD 1.8 . We decide difference 0.5 day would 'clinically significant ' . We specify alpha 0.05 Power 0.9 , allocation ratio 2 ( allow comparison one tertile two others ) . A two-sided t-test difference two independent mean perform G*Power 3.1.7 . This demonstrated total N 616 require demonstrate difference . According ISD figure , 3,712 appendicectomy procedure perform 2010/11 , number available able detect clinically significant difference length stay . The investigator use Scottish government 's 8-fold urban-rural classification system ( see http : //www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification ) investigate possible relationship patient geographical location outcome . Urban-rural category may group analysis , depend initial exploratory work . The investigator calculate approximate travelling time patient home location ( use postcode ) treat hospital , construct isochrone time/distance interval hospital . Travel time evaluate continuous discrete variable .</detailed_description>
