	<brief_summary>This research focus health need , construct meaning health , meaningful health promotion tactic among woman heart disease patient . Women heart disease consider highly vulnerable group cardiovascular disease-related death Singapore . Because culture-centered approach previously demonstrate community-driven participatory process Culture-Centered Approach ( CCA ) foster positive change health outcome , project highlight involvement community member develop effective health promotion regard heart health . Rather rely solely intervention create outside expert , The investigator aim engage Heart Health promotion meaningful involvement community member process change . Thus , investigator seek engage woman heart disease patient develop heart health intervention beneficial . Through in-depth interview , focus group , formation advisory board , community-wide dialogue workshop lead woman , investigator seek identify specific heart health promote strategy tactic meaningful live experience woman . As part overall solution , project work alongside Women 's Heart Health Clinic create train material disseminate finding base analysis . Methodology : As far methodology , investigator use Culture-Centered Approach ( CCA ) well use biomedical measure evaluation . First , advisory board form inform step methodology data analysis . First , investigator randomize one group patient control group one group experimental group . The investigator conduct baseline measure group . For control group , investigator measure biomedical data 3 time ( 3 month , 6 month , 12 month ) . For experimental group , investigator create advisory board consist approx . 4 physician 6 patient . In-depth interview conduct woman experience CVD live Singapore . Each interview last maximum 90 minute . Interviewees ask question understand health , health experience , obstacle face access health care Singapore . Data interview analyze advisory board use guide discussion focus group woman experimental group . Focus group session , last maximum 90 minute , conduct patient experimental group . In session , participant collectively develop potential solution issue emerge earlier interviews.During one-year period study , participant experimental group participate one many one-on-one interview , focus group , activity plan base feedback participant . Based information give interview , advisory board meeting , focus group , intervention design carry experimental group . This group also evaluate 3 time point ( 3 month , 6 month , 12 month ) addition baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Culture-Centered Approach Promoting Women 's Heart Health Singapore</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose randomized clinical social scientific trial compare outcome among woman cardiovascular disease 2 treatment group : ( 1 ) conventional general cardiology outpatient programme ; ( 2 ) gender-tailored woman 's heart health outpatient programme consist general cardiologist , advanced practice nurse , dietician , physiotherapist occupational therapist . Participants include consecutive woman admit NUH general cardiology problem attend general cardiology clinic . Women require sub-specialty care ( eg valve clinic , pulmonary hypertension clinic , congenital heart clinic ) exclude . The investigator randomly assign 150 woman control group ( biomedical variable measure throughout course year 's time ) 150 experimental group ( biomedical variable measure addition participant ' involvement interview , focus group , prospective workshop base expressed need ) . Randomization occur consent process participant assign group , full involvement explain . If randomized experimental group , participant ask give consent participation one-on-one interviewing , focus group discussion , forthcoming health promotion strategy develop base data collect . There minimal risk involve intervention component since investigator involve participant throughout development process future intervention . In order develop cultured-centred approach/processes woman heart health programme , investigator begin form advisory board comprise woman patient , nurse , well provider . The advisory board comprise 8 member ( 4 patient , 2 nurse , 2 doctor ) . The advisory board meet first month project subsequently meet every two month . Based inputs advisory board objective establish board , research team develop design conduct in-depth interview 20 patient ( in-depth interview take 60 90 minute ) . The interview take place month 2 month 4 . The advisory team analyze interview data collaboration NUS Communication New Media design team , materialize health-promoting strategy workshop , conduct part intervention programme . Additionally , basis interview data six workshop conduct group 4 develop health promoting strategy tactic . The NUS Communication New Media ( CNM ) design team collaborate workshop participant develop implement tactic . The workshops material development take place month 4 month 6 project . Once strategy tactic develop , baseline survey conduct 150 woman CCA experimental group 150 woman control group . For experimental group , conduct semi-structured short interview . Additionally follow clinical assessment occur experimental control group baseline 12 month visit : change cardiovascular risk marker ( lipid , fast glucose , waist circumference , body-mass-index , blood pressure , hs-CRP , NT-proBNP , body fat analysis ) , vascular reactivity ( endoPAT ) , arterial stiffness measurement , quality life ( SF-36 Health Survey ) , depression ( Center Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ) Duke activity status index . The patient ' cardiovascular risk marker ( Cr , Hba1C , Lipid panel rout blood test depend physician ) , order part standard care record well . Patients follow 12 month recurrent hospitalization death . Once participant join study , randomize experimental group , require participate one follow activity : one-on-one interview , focus group , join advisory board . The control group participate clinical assessment baseline interview ( administration questionnaire ) . The investigator believe health intervention develop grassroots approach incorporate opinion advice target population . For experimental group , participate development heart health intervention base share experience interview , focus group , advisory board . The investigator believe focus voice expertise population develop effective intervention result improve health outcome experimental group . In order understand extent , investigator plan compare biomedical social scientific measure experimental group control group . Any intervention material course make available control group study complete .</detailed_description>
