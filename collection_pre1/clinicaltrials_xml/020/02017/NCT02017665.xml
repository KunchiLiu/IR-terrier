	<brief_summary>Worldwide , central nervous system infection inflammation brain ( encephalitis ) , inflammation meninges ( meningitis ) sudden onset weakness muscle maybe infectious origin result significant illness death healthcare cost . Vast majority central nervous system infection remain without identifiable cause . There also concern new emerge infection . This study thus intend fill gap knowledge regard central nervous system infection Singapore give thorough description burden cause central nervous system infection detection outbreak new pathogen . Patients suspected central nervous system infection recruit 5 restructure Singapore hospital blood clinical specimen send test . Patients also follow assess long term outcomes socio-economic cost infection . This help clinicians , policymakers public health official estimate financial societal cost CNs infection Singapore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study aim : 1 . To describe epidemiology CNS infection Singapore . 2 . To improve diagnosis aetiology CNS infection systematic clinical , laboratory neuro-radiological evaluation extensive diagnostic testing . 3 . To evaluate prognosis , long-term outcome socio-economic cost CNS infection . 4 . To establish archive biological tissue patient encephalitis CNS infection utilized future test emerge novel pathogen non-infectious aetiology . The study recruit 400 patient 2 year 5 restructure hospital Singapore . As comparative study , sample size determine . The study involve clinical laboratory data collection . Data also collect quality life health economic analysis . The quality data integrity periodically review Principal Investigator member study team . All sample store de-identified data de-identified analysis .</detailed_description>
