	<brief_title>Facilitating Implicit Learning Improve Neurorehabilitation Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Someone stroke US every 45 second , result 700,000 new stroke every year stroke leading cause disability Veterans ( American Heart Association Statistics Committee Stroke Statistics Sub-Committee ) . The vast majority case result motor impairment , frequently cause individual become dependent others daily function ( modify Rankin Scale 3-5 , see Lees et al. , 2006 ) . Specifically , upper extremity hemiparesis lead cause functional disability stroke upper arm function explain 50 % variability report quality life ( Wyller et al , 1997 ) . As optimize upper arm neurorehabilitation critical problem address age Veteran population . `` Rehabilitation , patient , fundamentally process relearn move carry need successfully '' ( Carr &amp; Shepherd , 1987 ) . This statement posit core neurorehabilitation motor learning , despite principle , research motor learn little impact stroke rehabilitation ( Krakauer , 2006 ) . Recently interest develop test new method optimize upper extremity rehabilitation . Investigators Baltimore VAMC pioneer task orient training paradigm improve mobility ( Macko et al. , 2005 ) chronic stroke . As part programmatic approach novel upper extremity robotics train program develop improve reaching , limb coordination . However , majority intervention rely error-based learning strategy rehabilitation , foster task-related explicit knowledge . However , corpus motor learn research indicate may best strategy optimize motor learning , thus neurorehabilitation . Error-based learn involves receive continual feedback movement intent learner make correction movement real time . Thus learn occurs series repetition learner continually reduce discrepancy ideal behavior observation behavior . In word , error-based learning foster adaptation achieve desire behavior . In contrast , operant condition learn strategy consist learner receive feedback quality movement end behavior . Thus , learn occurs series reinforcement desire behavior entirety , model-free adaptation incur error-based learning . A primary distinction two learn strategy error-based learn foster explicit knowledge task , whereas operant conditioning foster implicit knowledge ( Krakauer &amp; Mazzoni , 2011 ) . These two type knowledge drastic implication functional outcome ( i.e . motor performance , cognitive workload , retention ) . Prior stroke , upper arm function reach grasp largely do without use explicit knowledge . In word , healthy individual devote little conscious effort control limb , 'do ' . Although , use explicit strategy learn facilitate rate learning , give enough time , individual limit explicit knowledge perform equally well ( Maxwell et al , 1999 ) . Despite slow rate learning , payoff reduce explicit knowledge task advantageous motor performance . Notably , retention learn behavior great individual learn condition inhibit explicit knowledge . For example Malone Bastian ( 2010 ) individual learn novel walk task ( split belt treadmill belt move different rate ) explicit knowledge limit exhibit learn persist longer relied explicit knowledge learning . In addition , limit explicit knowledge motor learning may result reduce cognitive workload maintain performance condition challenge ( Zhu et al. , 2011 ) . In conclusion , promote explicit knowledge rehabilitation rather unconscious control ( limit explicit knowledge ) reduce sustainability newly acquire motor skill , consumes cognitive resource , need available demand . As , automatic control behavior critical perform daily activity , suggest operant conditioning ( limit explicit knowledge ) superior error-based learning . Those stroke able learn task implicitly , although rate learning may delay compare healthy control ( Pohl et al. , 2001 ) delay function stroke severity ( Boyd et al. , 2007 ) . Further , simply provide explicit information implicit task show reduce learn rate retention basal ganglion stroke ( Boyd et al. , 2004 ; Boyd et al. , 2006 ) damage sensorimotor area ( Boyd et al. , 2003 ; Boyd et al. , 2006 ; Winstein et al. , 2003 ) . While study highlight importance limit explicit knowledge learn do context learn implicit sequence rather development skill , relate , rely different aspect motor learning ( Krakauer &amp; Mazonni , 2011 , Yarrow et al. , 2009 ) . In context functional skill learning , timing/ type feedback robustly show affect learning rate well retention implicate affect knowledge type ( Levin et al. , 2010 ) . Specifically , provide feedback task performance less frequently performance rather ( i.e . delay ) show increase learn retention likely facilitate implicit learn ( Cirstea et al. , 2006 ; Winstein et al. , 1996 ) . Additionally , feedback result ( knowledge result ) rather performance ( knowledge performance ) show increase retention limit explicit knowledge ( Cirstea el al. , 2006 ; Sidaway et al. , 2008 ; Winstein , 1991 ) . Accordingly , current proposal attempt foster implicit knowledge development motor skill manipulate feedback give type feedback . The aim current study determine effect error-based learning versus operant conditioning learn critical outcome neurorehabilitation ( i.e . performance learning , generalizability , cognitive workload impose task , retention ) .</detailed_description>
