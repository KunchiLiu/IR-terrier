	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn ability substance call arginine improve function immune system people certain type brain tumor . This could lead improvement type treatment brain tumor call immunotherapy . The immune system include organ , cell , substance body fight infection disease . Immunotherapy type treatment use immune system tool seek destroy abnormal cell . Immunotherapy require immune system work properly . Arginine normal component protein ( amino acid ) consume food red meat , poultry , fish , dairy product body make . Arginine help immune system function normally . Recent research show certain type brain tumor decrease amount arginine body lead impair immune system function . This may interfere ability immunotherapy fight abnormal cell . We would like see give people brain tumor arginine powder form make immune system work well .</brief_summary>
