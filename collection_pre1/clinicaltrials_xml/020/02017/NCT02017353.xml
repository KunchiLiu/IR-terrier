	<brief_title>Effect Curcumin Addition Standard Treatment Tumour-induced Inflammation Endometrial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various cancer type associate chronic inflammation . During formation cancer immune system activate tumor order evoke anti-tumor immune response . However , tumor develops , give rise chronic inflammation , cause immune system malfunction . This highlighted fact different chronic inflammatory disease associate increase risk cancer ( f.i . chronic inflammatory bowel diseases colon cancer , prostatitis prostate cancer , hepatitis liver cancer ) . Endometrial cancer reveals different aspect inflammation , include cytokine secretion infiltration immune cell type tumor . It presume hormonal fluctuation genetic change contribute formation pro-inflammatory environment stimulates tumor growth . Cancer cell endometrial tumor produce immunomodulatory mediator , also attract different sort cell immune system stimulate tumor growth . It already demonstrate mice model vitro experiment curcumin show strong anti-inflammatory effect slow tumor growth and/or prevent formation metastasis . In addition , noticed model curcumin also positive effect function various chemotherapeutic drug , cause effect enhance toxicity decrease . Clinical study investigate anti-inflammatory effect curcumin rare , study reveal suppression inflammation . The primary reason clinical study curcumin rare bad intake curcumin human body . Recently , lot research carry regard development new formulation curcumin lead good intake human body . The best nutritional supplement contain curcumin develop far MerivaÂ® , commercialize Belgium name `` CurcuPhyt '' .</detailed_description>
