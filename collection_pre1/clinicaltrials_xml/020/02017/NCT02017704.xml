	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Brachytherapy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced rectal carcinoma continue major oncologic problem United States approximately 40,000 new case diagnosed 2011 . For stage II/III rectal carcinoma , adjuvant chemoradiation ( 1-3 ) total mesorectal excision ( TME ) ( 4 , 5 ) represent major treatment advance increase cure rate past 30 year . In set TME , landmark phase III German trial stage II/III rectal cancer patient establish neoadjuvant 5FU-based chemoradiation ( NCRT ) standard care regimen give post-operatively ( 6 ) . The preoperative arm show superior local control ( 6 % vs. 13 % p=0.006 ) , complete pathologic response 8 % , high rate sphincter preservation less grade 3 toxicity compare post-operative treatment . However , disease-free overall survival ( 76 % versus 74 % , respectively ) different high rate distant metastasis occur 1/3 patient ( 5yr DM 36 vs 38 % , p=0.84 ) . Importantly , attain pathologic complete response decrease rate distant metastasis improve disease-free survival . Drawbacks regimen include acute grade 3 4 toxicity 27 % patient , low compliance rate postoperative chemotherapy ( 27 - 50 % ) , overall decline anorectal function show long-term study ( 6 ) . Given excellent locoregional control report TME surgical series , several trial investigate whether certain patient may spar preoperative radiotherapy ( 7-9 ) . Two large randomize trial Dutch British investigator show short preoperative course hypofractionated EBRT ( 25 Gy 5 fraction ) follow TME surgery decrease locoregional recurrence 2/3 compare patient treat TME surgery alone . In Dutch trial , patient mid distal rectal cancer likely benefit radiotherapy . In patient , preoperative radiation show decrease locoregional recurrence 5-fold ( 10 % 2 % ) ; however , hypofractionated preoperative EBRT regimen associate significant increase acute chronic morbidity . Indeed , Dutch study reveal irradiated patient , compare surgery alone , perineal wound heal problem abdominoperineal resection ( 29 % vs. 19 % ) , worsen deterioration anal sphincter dysfunction , severe long-term effect relate sexual functioning male ( p=0.004 ) female ( p &lt; 0.002 ) ( 10-12 ) . Birgisson Additionally , colleague report consistent negative impact bowel function patient undergoing sphincter preservation ( 13 ) . In review long-term data Swedish short course preoperative EBRT rectal cancer trial , Birgisson also report high incidence secondary tumor ( 9.5 % ) patient treat preoperative radiation compare patient surgery alone ( 4.3 % ) ( 14 ) . Modern approach address risk distant metastasis poor compliance adjuvant systemic chemotherapy ( follow NCRT ) incorporate new effective chemotherapy agent earlier treatment protocol . For example , oxaliplatin one widely study agent result proven efficacy combine 5-fluorouracil leucovorin ( FOLFOX ) metastatic adjuvant setting colon cancer ( 15 ) . Initial phase II study addition oxaliplatin standard 5-FU base NCRT appear show improved pathologic complete response rate compare standard NCRT . However , two phase III trial clearly show addition oxaliplatin 5FU-based NCRT significantly improve pathologic complete response , locoregional control , distant metastasis survival increase acute grade 3-4 toxicity two three-fold ( 16 , 17 ) . One approach limit toxicity external beam radiotherapy use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . IMRT limit radiation dose normal rectum ( tumor ) surround organ risk ( OARs ) bladder sexual organ . IMRT utilizes multiple beam radiation treat rectal tumor plus margin limit dose OARs . While IMRT decrease radiation dose normal structure , require additional 2-3 cm margin microscopic extension ( clinical treatment volume=CTV ) , set-up error , rectal motion ( plan treatment volume=PTV ) . Furthermore , IMRT still require 5-6 week radiation concurrent chemotherapy , substantially expensive conformal radiation , especially prohibitive country access technology necessary IMRT limit ( 20 ) . Based preliminary result RTOG 0822 others , still remain determined whether IMRT confers statistically significant improvement pCR , toxicity rate QOL relative standard NCRT . A novel approach limit radiation toxicity use high dose rate endorectal brachytherapy ( Endo-HDR ) ( 21 ) . Endo-HDR involves placement silicon multicatheter applicator within rectum deliver large dos rectal tumor mesorectum rapid dose fall surround organ . An Iridium 192 high dose rate brachytherapy source attach wire insert catheter deliver high dose radiation therapy tumor . High dose rate brachytherapy well establish various malignancy ( prostate , uterine , sarcoma , head neck ) escalate radiation dose tumor short period time spar normal tissue . Compared NCRT IMRT , Endo-HDR delivers treatment internally tumor without pas surround normal tissue organ . It require small margin ( CTV/PTV=~1 cm ) tumor since applicator position fiducial guidance tumor without need margin organ motion allow great spar OARs ( 22 ) . Furthermore , area rectum expose high dose radiotherapy surgically remove time resection minimize chronic toxicity . Important structure may spar include bone marrow , small bowel , bladder , autonomic nerve , sexual organ , anal sphincter skin . Considering 1/3 patient develop metastasis , limit bone marrow toxicity may contribute good compliance systemic treatment allow well treatment strategy target systemic recurrence . Another distinct advantage Endo-HDR shorten treatment time ( 1 versus 6 week ) . Endo-HDR therefore provide major logistic advantage patient may benefit neoadjuvant therapy geographically distant radiation center , elderly , medically infirmed .</detailed_description>
