	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine ( FLT ) -positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( PET/MRI ) measure early response patient metastatic solid tumor receive treatment block blood flow tumor . Diagnostic procedure , FLT-PET/MRI , may help measure patient 's response earlier treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study FLT-PET/MRI Early Response Monitoring Anti-Angiogenic Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility FLT-PET/MRI early prediction treatment response patient undergoing anti-angiogenic cancer treatment . II . To assess test-retest reproducibility PET biomarker ( FLT ) uptake use PET/MRI . III . To assess test-retest reproducibility quantification MR sequence ( multi-parametric MRI particularly related tissue perfusion ) . IV . To assess ability PET/MRI measure change PET biomarker ( FLT ) tumor uptake initiation therapy . V. To assess change qualitative morphologic image quantitative functional MRI parameter initiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare early change PET biomarker ( FLT ) tumor uptake treatment response assess completion therapy ( prediction treatment response ) . II . To compare change MRI signal intensity ( multi-parametric MRI ) treatment response assess completion therapy . III . To compare result multi-parametric MR image FLT tumor uptake . IV . To assess combination quantitative PET MRI metric . OUTLINE : Patients undergo FLT-PET/MRI twice baseline within 4 week start treatment .</detailed_description>
