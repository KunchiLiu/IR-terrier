	<brief_summary>This research study clinical trial . Clinical trial test effectiveness investigational imaging technique learn whether investigational imaging technique work detect cardiac injury administration certain chemotherapy , doxorubicin . `` Investigational '' mean imaging technique still study research doctor try find it-such whether technique detect low level cardiac injury treatment doxorubicin . It also mean FDA yet approve use gadolinium approve use CMR study detection cardiac toxicity doxorubicin . The chemotherapy drug schedule treat , doxorubicin , associate development heart failure patient . Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) type MRI scan us magnetic field produce picture heart . The CMR scan use study information research study suggest image technique may help good detect difference structure heart muscle treatment doxorubicin . In research study , investigator hope good detect change heart muscle treatment doxorubicin CMR scan hope cardiac injury detect treat earlier prevent heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If decide participate research study , ask undergo screening procedure determine eligible . These procedure include : medical history , determination kidney function pregnancy test ( applicable ) . The investigator also ask sign CMR safety screen form make sure safe CMR scan . If metallic implant ( pacemaker , defibrillator , aneurysm clip ) metallic fragment eye , CMR . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Visit 1 take place prior start doxorubicin chemotherapy . The visit take 1.5 hour . The investigator ask come Shapiro Cardiovascular Center Brigham Women 's Hospital study visit . For subject qualify , investigator bring basement level hospital heart CMR scan , echocardiogram blood work . Before CMR scan investigator take blood via IV cannula . The investigator take 4 tube blood . This equivalent 2.5 tablespoon blood . From blood investigator test blood marker cardiac injury compare result test . For CMR scan , ask lie still scanner table slide tunnel-shaped machine . Four electrocardiogram ( EKG ) patch wire attach place chest back check heart rate . The investigator place intravenous ( IV ) catheter one arm . An IV catheter thin plastic tube put vein needle . The IV catheter use give CMR contrast dye ( gadolinium ) . The dye help u identify subtle change within heart muscle . This dye , gadolinium , use routinely CMR study . The investigator also draw sample blood IV catheter measure red blood cell count . Then , scanner table move slowly tunnel-shaped CMR machine picture take . The machine slightly wide body may little room move . If feel discomfort need stop test , able tell research staff . You able speak CMR able speak . If think might anxious inside narrow CMR scanner long period time , investigator may prescribe drug help relax think might helpful . The CMR scan take one hour . An echocardiogram test use doctor monitor heart function . An echocardiogram safe test use ultrasound image heart . After completion CMR test , echocardiogram . This test take place area CMR test . The echocardiogram test take 40 minute . Visit 2 take place 2-4 week last cycle doxorubicin chemotherapy . When come back Visit 2 , type CMR scan , echocardiogram blood test Visit 1 . At Visit 3 investigator perform exercise test bicycle . The test design test oxygen consumption body exercise . It provide way quantify ability body exercise . This test take 30 minute . During test subject sit bicycle least 3 minute pedal rate 60 cycle per minute slowly work-load increase peak exercise obtain . The investigator define peak exercise tire breathless . Heart rate blood pressure record test . During test breathe mouthpiece investigator measure oxygen level . It take 12-16 month complete research study , depend date timing chemotherapy . During time , investigator ask make 3 study visit . The investigator call approximately six month see .</detailed_description>
