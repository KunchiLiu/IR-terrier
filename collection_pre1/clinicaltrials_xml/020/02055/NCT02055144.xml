	<brief_title>Veristrat Predictor Benefit First Line Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Patients From Standard Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VeriStrat® , pretreatment blood-based test correlate clinical outcome EGFR-TKI therapy non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient , develop validate multi-institutional study advance NSCLC patient treat gefitinib [ Taguchi et al ] . The VeriStrat algorithm develop use training set pre-treatment serum sample patient experience either long term stable disease early progression gefitinib therapy . Mass spectra patient ' serum sample use define eight MS feature ( i.e . peak ) , differentiate two outcome group . An algorithm ( VeriStrat ) utilize feature base k-nearest neighbor ( KNN ) classification scheme create parameter optimize use additional spectra training cohort . All aspect VeriStrat freeze development . VeriStrat assign spectrum `` Good '' `` Poor '' label . VeriStrat validate blinded fashion two independent cohort patient treat gefitinib erlotinib . These study confirm patient classify `` Good '' good outcome patient classify `` Poor '' ( HR death = 0.47 P = 0.0094 one cohort , HR death = 0.33 P = 0.0007 ) . In original study , VeriStrat show correlate clinical outcome follow EGFR-TKI therapy , chemotherapy post-surgery setting : No statistically significant difference see overall survival patient classify `` Good '' `` Poor '' serum patient collect second-line chemotherapy ( HR = 0.74 , 95 % , P = 0.42 one cohort ( cohort B ) HR = 0.81 , P = 0.54 another ( cohort C ) ) . In third control cohort patient resect early-stage NSCLC , hazard ratio overall survival 0.90 ( P = 0.79 ) . However , analysis subset chemotherapy sample demonstrate separation `` Good '' `` Poor '' arm may depend particular type chemotherapy . Thus retrospective subset analysis cohort C show patient treat docetaxel second line show sign separation , patient receive combination platinum-based agent either vinorelbine gemcitabine paclitaxel trend separation two arm . The work hypothesis mechanism VeriStrat `` Poor '' label relate activation canonical non-canonical MAPK pathway downstream receptor tyrosine kinase , possible cross-talk activation NF-kB pathway . This mean VeriStrat may demonstrate different predictive performance depend particular chemotherapy treatment associate cell pathway interaction .</detailed_description>
