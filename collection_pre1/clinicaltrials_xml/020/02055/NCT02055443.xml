	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether new novel marker clinical electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , use non-invasive measure heart disease , detect coronary artery disease patient chest pain . The researcher especially interested study change unique wave evolve time rest activity . It hop finding helpful differentiate patient cardiac chest pain emergency department non-cardiac chest pain , early identification accelerate treatment save life . Eligible participant age 18 old refer nuclear stress test University Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital rule coronary artery disease part clinical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) lead cause death worldwide . Differentiating ACS non-ischemic chest pain imperative emergency medicine miss myocardial infarction remain one high source medical malpractice Emergency Departments ( ED ) . At time , economic pressure limited resource demand physician avoid hospital admission protract observation every patient chest pain suspicious symptom . In absence clear ST elevation ( STE ) electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , ED provider reliable tool quickly triage non-STE ( NSTE ) ACS patient . Current guideline rely blood biomarkers ( e.g . cardiac enzyme ) identify syndrome completely describe ischemic ECG change associate . ED Providers need delay management high risk patient cardiac biomarkers withdraw , analyze , interpret . This result great mortality rate NSTE-ACS patient overburden healthcare system . The prolonged observation time EDs unnecessary admission additional consequence overuse nurse time exacerbate nursing shortage . ECG change ST elevation dynamic ECG change rich opportunity improve diagnostics . This proposal intend provide new insight ischemic repolarization change evolve time subacute phase myocardial ischemia . Sixty patient suspect coronary artery disease refer nuclear cardiac stress test include . Resting 12-lead ECGs obtain stress test one stress test nuclear scan . Alterations novel , computerized T wave index correlate focal myocardial ischemia see nuclear scan . Repeated Measures ANOVA group comparison , Generalized Estimation Equation use analysis . The result provide insight diagnostic value different novel T wave index detect myocardial ischemia . Results study provide tool ED provider distinguish ACS non-ischemic chest pain patient early triage process , especially absence STE constitute common standard nowadays .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>adult &gt; 18 year age refer nuclear cardiac stress test suspect coronary artery disease . There restriction sex race . Children teens less likely ischemic etiology chest pain , justify exclusion . To optimize clinical utility , exclusion criterion base previous medical history , medication , present chief complaint ; consecutive patient eligible . Patients uninterpretable ECGs ECG show know secondary repolarization abnormality ( i.e . bundle branch block , ventricular hypertrophy , channelopathies , early repolarization ) exclude . Of note , per clinical guideline , patient get usually refer exercise treadmill test . This improve recruitment process study .</criteria>
