	<detailed_description>Vaccines responsible prevent million death extend average human lifespan . Effective vaccine stimulate cell immune system activate gene associate function bring protective immunity . Knowledge gene cellular function activate effective vaccination improve understand immune system work define feature necessary successful vaccine response . This study aim define cellular function important hepatitis B ( HBV ) vaccine immune response healthy individual . The investigator identify gene activate suppressed immune cell various time dose HBV vaccine . The investigator explore vaccine-induced `` gene signature '' characterize cellular function associate effective immune response HBV vaccination . The investigator hypothesize many gene associate innate adaptive immune function important effective HBV vaccine response .</detailed_description>
