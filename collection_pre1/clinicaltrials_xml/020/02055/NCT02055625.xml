	<brief_summary>Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) major complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , classify acute ( aGVHD ) chronic ( cGVHD ) . aGVHD onset within first 100 day transplant clinical feature include erythema , liver dysfunction oral mucositis , whilst cGVHD persistent GVHD occur approximately 30-60 % transplant patient survive first year . Long-term five-year prognosis cGVHD patient poor 70 % mortality rate . cGVHD manifest autoimmune-like disease affect multiple site , include skin , mouth , eye , gastrointestinal tract , liver , joint . The oral cavity second common site affect symptoms 45-83 % case . In mouth diverse spectrum clinical feature find example mucosal lesion affect almost site , salivary gland dysfunction restrict mouth opening . Short-term patient experience mucosal sensitivity , malnutrition , problem speak , increased caries risk , xerostomia , oral pain diminish quality-of-life . Long-term complication include secondary malignancy perhaps early death . Clinical management seek alleviate symptom improve quality-of-life 50 % patient fail front-line systemic steroid therapy . Oral cGVHD treat topical high potency corticosteroid oral rinse , however treatment always effective carry risk systemic absorption . Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell ( MSCs ) resident adult fetal tissue , bone marrow capacity form bone , cartilage , stroma , muscle fat , know exhibit immunosuppressive immunoregulatory property vivo vitro . MSC infusion use treat disorder osteogenic imperfecta , cardiovascular disease heal large bony defect . Indeed , immunosuppressive capacity MSCs lead infusion use second-line treatment GVHD patient , group show within Phase II clinical trial , 55 % aGVHD patient fail front-line steroid treatment respond MSC infusion study go cGVHD patient . The goal project perform pilot study determine whether MSC injection directly mucosal lesion patient oral cGVHD able alleviate symptom facilitate reparative process .</brief_summary>
