	<brief_summary>The appearance postural instability gait disorder major turn point evolution Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . These axial symptom usually unresponsive L-Dopa represent severe impairment patient due frequent fall reduce outside mobility . There effective pharmacological treatment available symptom , pathophysiology well know : currently assume non-dopaminergic brainstem lesion participate axial symptom PD . Surgically , patient benefit high frequency deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) since operation tends even aggravate axial symptom unresponsive L-Dopa patient . A dysfunction pedunculopontine nucleus ( PPN ) might origin axial symptom , since PPN participate maintenance posture motion primate . In PD patient , recent report suggest low frequency stimulation PPN may equally improve gait posture . However , result debatable due methodological limitation , insufficient clinical evaluation uncertain anatomical targeting . Thus , aim propose low frequency PPN stimulation six advance PD patient accord usual criterion STN DBS , however , unsuitable operation due gait posture disorder . We perform randomize , double-blind cross design ( two month period without DBS randomly assign patient ) . The target allow three-dimensional deformable atlas basal ganglion fusioned stereotaxic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient . Evaluations comprise 1 month surgery `` Off '' `` On '' stimulation condition : - clinical motor assessment `` Off '' `` On '' drug state , include cardinal parkinsonian sign , gait balance - gait initiation physiological evaluation - cognitive behavioral test If hypothesis confirm , low frequency PPN stimulation may well represent substantial improvement therapeutic option advance PD patient suffer debilitate gait posture disorder unresponsive L-Dopa .</brief_summary>
