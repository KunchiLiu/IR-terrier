	<detailed_description>Single-session radiosurgery versus multi-sessions radiosurgery acoustic neuroma . BACKGROUND Most vestibular schwannomas benign slow-growing . Based fact , conservative management serial image viable alternative . For patient undergo treatment tumor growth , progressive symptom , personal preference , option include serial observation , microsurgical resection , fractionate stereotactic radiotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery . There remain debate best manage tumor . Historically , vestibular schwannomas treat microsurgical resection . Loss hear facial nerve injury , however , uncommon microsurgical complication . Fractionated radiotherapy use initially adjunct microsurgery patient undergone subtotal resection , demonstrate overall effectiveness radiation treat modality vestibular schwannomas . Stereotactic radiosurgery emerge safe effective treatment modality vestibular schwannomas . The long-term data stereotactic radiosurgery support efficacy treatment modality term local control , concern hear preservation still remain debated . Over last decade , attention direct improve hear preservation rate follow radiosurgery reduce treatment-related morbidity . Initial radiosurgery series report hearing preservation rate range 51 % 60 % significant rate facial weakness numbness . Analysis recent data suggest overall hear preservation rate approximately 51 % expect approaching 3-4 year radiosurgical treatment , analysis reveals patient treat ≤13 Gy likely preserve hear patient receive large dos radiation . Furthermore , large tumor older patient appear increase risk hearing loss SRS young patient patient small tumor . Despite improved radiosurgical technique lower marginal dos , recent report show somewhat disappointing 10-year actuarial hearing preservation rate 44.5 % , hearing loss develop much 6 year . Studies demonstrate total radiation dose cochlea critical factor hear preservation . Fractionation total dose , staging , however , also may play fundamental role . Staging radiation treatment long propose mean reduce risk injury adjacent critical structure brainstem , cranial nerve , cochlea . Fractionation prescribe dose may take advantage radiobiologic principle reduce toxicity maintain tumour control . Aim present study compare outcome single multisession radiosurgery term hear preservation local control use frameless , robotic CyberKnife® system ( Accuray Incorporated , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . In fact , radiobiological point view , high local dose radiation single fraction would produce good tumour control . On hand , limited fractionation could protect surround normal tissue ( cochlea , brainstem , etc . ) injurious level radiation . This could improve therapeutic rationale MSRS , especially large ( 3 cm ) lesion proximity critical organ brainstem cochlear apparatus . PRETREATMENT EVALUATION Prior medical history physical examination . Complete history , physical examination include detailed neurological examination evaluation Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) perform . Any prior surgery , prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery brain record . Prior surgery site lesion , prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery brain prevent patient participate protocol . Pre-treatment audiogram ( pure tone audiometry speech comprehension ) obtain within 2 month treatment document baseline hearing unless anacusis document previously . Hearing grade accord American Academy Otorhinolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery classification A full neurological assessment perform treatment . Special attention give fifth , seventh cranial nerve examination . Any baseline deficit palsy register . Trigeminal nerve function grade semiquantitative scale normal sensation , decrease sensation , sensation ( Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity score , Barrow Neurological Institute facial numbness score , BNS ) . Facial nerve function grade House-Brackmann ( H-B ) scale . Patient write informed consent obtain prior examination related Cyberknife treatment . RADIOSURGICAL PROCEDURE : mSRS sSRS ( CyberKnife ) Planning All patient initially fit custom make Aquaplast mask thin foam headrest ensure consistent position acquisition image study radiotherapy treatment . While mask , thin slice ( 1.0 mm ) high resolution ( CT ) scan entire head obtain Scanner . A thin slice ( 2 mm ) gadolinium enhance T1 weight MRI also acquire . The acquired image transfer Cyberknife treatment plan workstation . The MRI fuse CT use Cyberknife treatment plan software create composite image tumor localization . The treat surgeon manually define tumor volume critical structure axial image . Although axial image normally use treatment planning , possible delineate structure either coronal sagittal image . It usually necessary adjust window level treatment planning CT dataset optimize clarity bone internal auditory canal improve definition tumor margin . In addition , cochlea define ( mandatory ) . Once tumor critical structure delineate , inverse plan use Cyberknife treatment planning software provide highly conformal radiotherapy dose minimizes dose adjacent critical structure The treatment plan evaluate select base analysis volumetric dose dose-volume histogram target volume adjacent critical structure . The number paths beam use patient varies determine select individual treatment plan . Planning target volumes The target volume CyberKnife radiosurgery consist tumor outline treatment planning software see plan CT and/or MRI 1 mm margin Dose Treatments deliver hypofractionated schedule single-session radiosurgery accord randomisation . The prescription dose 70 85 % In radiosurgery dose 11Gy 13Gy ( median 13 Gy ) In fractionated schedule : dose fraction 6 7 Gy deliver . The number fraction 3 Total dose 11 21 Gy relation proximity critical organ ( cochlea ) PATIENT ASSESSMENTS Evaluation During Treatment Patients see evaluate CyberKnife radiosurgery documentation tolerance , include acute reaction . Evaluation Following Treatment Patients follow follow : The neurologic assessment , contrast enhance , thin slice ( 1 3 mm ) MRI , audiometric evaluation perform every 4 month first year post-SRS ; every 6 month 2nd 3rd year annually . Tumors volume always record . A response classification ( CR , PR , SD , PD ) assign . Whenever possible , patient obtain audiogram center minimize discrepancy relate technique . Criteria Toxicity Toxicity grade per NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 . Criteria Local Control Complete response ( CR ) define MRI disappearance lesion . Partial response ( PR ) define 20 % , decrease volumetric size lesion MRI , stable disease ( SD ) change size lesion , progressive disease ( PD ) increase volumetric size lesion , confirm least follow two consecutive MRI . Data Collection Patients allocate number data collect Case Report Forms . Data include information protocol visit complete timely manner . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Randomization procedure The assignment patient group performer randomization . The randomization number assign patient independent institution ( Dipartimento di Scienze Sanitarie Applicate , Università di Pavia ) use computer-generated randomization list . Determination sample size The sample size base primary endpoint proportion subject hear preservation . Assuming proportion subject hear preservation 50 % standard technique , 49 patient per group require conclude experimental technique reach proportion hear preservation 77 % , 80 % power 5 % significance level . Allowing 10 % drop-out rate , total 108 patient randomize single multisession radiosurgery . Statistical analysis Demographic data ( age weight , height ) summarize treatment group . Quantitative variable summarize use descriptive statistic suitable continuous variable ; qualitative variable summarize frequency distribution . The primary efficacy variable hearing preservation proportion , define number treat patient class A B total number patient . The analysis present difference proportion subject hear preservation two group least 36 month . Subgroup analysis perform primary outcome variable secondary efficacy variable . The result present demographic subgroup ( age , sex , prior surgery dose cochlea , volume lesion ) . The secondary efficacy variable local tumour toxicity ( neurological ) evaluation ( facial trigeminal nerve ) . Associations neurological score ( BNI , BPS , BNS ) facial nerve function MRI measure examine use Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . Analyses perform use Stata version 10 ( Stata Corp , College Station , Tex ) . All test perform 0.05 level significance .</detailed_description>
