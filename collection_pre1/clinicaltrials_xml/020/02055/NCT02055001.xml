	<detailed_description>Atherothrombotic disorder account 25 % death among woman substantial morbidity resource use health care . Nonetheless , gender-related difference epidemiology cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain largely unexplained . Thus , application sex-gender medicine strongly recommend WHO international organization . In fact , emerge although men woman subject cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , however , different risk factor , disease progression response drug treatment . In last decade emerge scientific knowledge platelet role atherothrombotic disease physiopathology provide clue asks question possibility different platelet function modulation could influence woman population cardiovascular disease clinical course , especially consider , compare men population , woman one recognize bad cardiovascular outcome . It widely acknowledge platelet reactivity play pivotal role thrombus formation atherosclerosis . Differences platelet reactivity woman men describe use several method response vary stimulus . In particular , platelet woman without vascular disease reactive men response standard concentration agonists adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) thrombin receptor agonist protein . Mechanisms could account difference investigation . Indeed , sex steroid hormone could involve exert multiple direct indirect effect cardiovascular physiology . The pleiotropic effect estradiol-17 ( E2 ) estrogen receptor ( ERs ) , part thei pivotal role sexual development reproduction , consequence widespread expression ER many cell population within body well possibly reflect ancestral status ER steroid receptor family . Epidemiologic experimental study support atheroprotective effect endogenous exogenous estrogen . The Women 's Health Initiative study show coronary protective effect estrogen postmenopausal woman , subsequent study show inappropriate timing ( ie , administer hormone therapy late ) identity associate progestin . Physiologic difference men woman affect also drug activity , include pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . Women underrepresented cardiovascular study , even preponderance age population steadily increase . A good understanding factor contribute observe sex-related difference platelet biology warrant . In particular concern raise role specific hormone mediate platelet activation function differential benefit antiplatelet medication woman . It report many sex gender difference associate CVD woman could depend estrogen . The finding estrogen receptor express platelet render cell excellent model study non-genomic effect hormone . In conclusion , impact estrogen endogenous ( menstrual cycle ) and/or exogenous ( oral contraceptive therapy ) platelet activity response antiplatelets drug woman extensively evaluate . To fill gap evidence find support optimize cardiovascular therapy gender-oriented approach , investigator plan study effect endogenous estrogen ( menstrual cycle ) platelet function antiplatelet therapy response pre-menopausal healthy woman . Phase 1 Evaluation platelet function different menstrual cycle phase . Phase 2 : `` Proof concept study '' A short treatment period aspirin ( 100 mg daily ) also plan . Patients involve first phase study ask participate interventional study . The investigator plan enroll study 10 woman follow 1 month . Blood sample obtain baseline four time point treatment verify effect aspirin platelet ' function relate menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuation .</detailed_description>
