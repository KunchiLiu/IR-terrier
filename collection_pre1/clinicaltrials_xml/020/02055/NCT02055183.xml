	<brief_summary>The purpose Registry evaluate patient safety follow Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G ) - ( Equine ) ( BAT® ) administration adult pediatric patient confirm suspected exposure botulinum toxin . This Registry intend serve active surveillance system assess safety profile BAT® quantify occurrence unexpected adverse event , give current safety database consider small reliably identify unexpected risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BT-010 Registry Evaluation Safety Clinical Outcomes Patients Treated With Botulinum Antitoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective Registry estimate absolute risk ( incidence rate ) hypersensitivity /allergic reaction , include serum sickness , febrile reaction , hemodynamic instability , bradycardia , serious adverse event pediatric adult patient administer Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G ) - ( Equine ) ( BAT® ) . The secondary objective Registry : - Evaluate safety BAT® use treat patient confirm suspected exposure botulinum toxin . - Collect summarize clinical outcome information patient treat BAT® . - Validate design patient Registry implement event mass botulinum toxin exposure scenario . Subject Population : The base population include patient United States America confirm suspected exposure botulinum toxin treat BAT® . There age gender restriction . Sample Size : The study size goal enrollment minimum 100 patient Registry 3-year recruitment period , include least 10 pediatric patient age 17-years . Enrollment Registry close minimum sample size achieve 3-years , whichever occurs last . Registry Location : Any hospital /facilities treat patient confirm suspected exposure botulinum toxin treat BAT® Center Disease Control Prevention Strategic National Stockpile State stockpile eligible participation . Registry Design : Noninterventional , retrospective , observational phase 4 patient Registry . All patient treat BAT® ask participate Registry ; data obtain aim well define absolute risk ( incidence rate ) hypersensitivity/ allergic reaction , include serum sickness , febrile reaction , hemodynamic instability , bradycardia , serious adverse event patient treat BAT® due confirm suspected case botulism . Clinical outcome data collect summarized evaluate safety BAT® , patient treat BAT® due confirm suspected case botulism . Assessments : Data collect treat physician and/or health care professional involve care BAT® treat patient ( ) use Cangene 's Botulism Case Report Forms ; Form 1-Initial Case Report Form ; Form 2-Follow-up Case Report Form . Form 1-Initial Case Report Form collect baseline patient demographic information , include ; treat physician ( ) facility ; time date ( presumed time date ) exposure botulinum toxin ( know ) , relevant medical history include neurologic impairment , respiratory cardiac condition , know allergy ; clinical sign botulism presentation ; supportive care , intensive care unit mechanical ventilation use ; concomitant mediation ; monitor detail pre- post-BAT® infusion include occurrence hypersensitivity /allergic reaction , febrile reaction , bradycardia , hemodynamic instability , anaphylaxis and/or serum sickness information inadvertent overdoses , medication error drug effect whether lead adverse event . Form 2-Follow-up Case Report Form collect clinical outcome data include ; discharge status , duration hospitalization intensive care , death ( date cause ) ; diagnosis discharge , confirmatory laboratory result toxin type source available ; occurrence adverse event ( include limit blood borne infection , serious label unlabeled event death ) , concomitant mediation . All adverse event information report review Cangene 's Pharmacovigilance department . Data Analysis : The analysis descriptive include frequency table summarize characteristic patient Registry detail exposure botulinum toxin , clinical sign botulism , detail BAT® administration . Incidence rate adverse reaction overall type reaction ( i.e. , immediate hypersensitivity , delayed hypersensitivity ) calculate incidence proportion 95 % confidence interval patient treat BAT® stratify final botulism diagnosis age . Clinical outcome tabulate include duration hospitalization , duration intensive care unit stay mechanical ventilation , clinical status time hospital discharge , destination upon discharge , presence residual disability time hospital discharge , death , cause death . Patients enrol Registry stratify accord time exposure BAT® administration : early treatment ( ≤2 day symptom onset ) late treatment ( &gt; 2 day symptom onset ) .</detailed_description>
