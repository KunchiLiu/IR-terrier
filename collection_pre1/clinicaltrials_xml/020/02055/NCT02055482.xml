	<brief_summary>Anaemia condition blood lower normal number red blood cell . It also occur red blood cell contain enough haemoglobin , oxygen carry part blood . Anaemia common patient chronic kidney disease . Healthy kidneys produce hormone call erythropoietin , stimulate bone marrow produce proper number red blood cell need carry oxygen vital organ . Chronic kidney disease general term mean kidney function full potential . The study drug , BAY85-3934 , evaluate drug increase body 's ability produce erythropoietin . The purpose extension study find study drug , tablet take orally , safe effective treatment anaemia associate chronic kidney disease . The extension study enroll 240 patient multiple location Europe , Asia Australia . Patients participate Studies 15141 15261 may eligible take part extension study . The study consist Haemoglobin ( Hb ) Stabilisation Phase Main Phase . The Hb Stabilisation Phase involve 10 study visit schedule 16 week . The Main Phase last least 6 month maximum 36 month , visit every 4 week . During scheduled visit patient undergo number procedure confirm efficacy safety study drug , include measurement heart rate blood pressure , physical examination , Electrocardiogram blood/urine sample collection laboratory test . The study conduct 5 hospital UK . Bayer HealthCare AG funding research . This study include subject either complete treatment period respective Phase 2 parent study ( i.e. , Study 15141 Study 15261 ) experience stop event fix dose parent study ( Study 15141 ) . As Study 15141 double-blind study , subject unblinded per Study 15141 protocol prior entry extension study .</brief_summary>
