Sample Size calculation : For power analysis , use categorical ( behavioral ) outcomes arrive conservative estimate sample size 0.05 significance level . Effect sizes difference proportion base Cohen 's h statistic ( Cohen , 1988 ) , compute 80 % power Two-tailed significance test alpha = 0.05 equal number participant intervention control group Confidence Interval 95 % . From previous study All Babies Cry intervention 5 week postpartum 36 % control group answer similar knowledge question correctly , compare 47 % receive All Babies Cry Intervention .
