	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : A . To compare bacterial community collect superficial versus deep sample stage 3 4 sacral bedsore use metagenomics standard culture method . B . To characterize evolution digestive bacterial flora patient period 28 day . Changes term pathogenic , potentially pathogenic non-pathogenic described , well appearance resistance phenotype . C. To characterize evolution urinary bacterial flora patient period 28 day . Changes term pathogenic , potentially pathogenic non-pathogenic described , well appearance resistance phenotype .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient correctly inform study implementation , objective , constraint patient right The patient must give his/her inform sign consent The patient must insure beneficiary health insurance plan The patient available 28 day followup The patient one pelvic pressure ulcer ( bedsore ) ( stage 3 4 ) . Note : Patients bedsores vary stage include wound correspond high stage . If patient multiple bedsore stage , deep wound select . The patient require modern wound dressing ( i.e . tulle gauze ) without add bactericidal antibiotic element The patient hospitalize ant Propara neurological rehabilitation center ( Montpellier , France ) The patient receive antibiotic last 14 day . The patient participate another study , participate another study last 3 month The patient exclusion period determine previous study The patient judicial protection , tutorship curatorship The patient refuse sign consent It impossible correctly inform patient The patient pregnant , parturient , breastfeed The patient already include present study The patient sacral pressure ulcer stag 1 2 , sacral pressure ulcer Patient curative anticoagulation Patient receive antibiotic within 14 day inclusion ( however , inclusion , patient treat antibiotic necessary )</criteria>
