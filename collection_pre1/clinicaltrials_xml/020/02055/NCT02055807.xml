	<brief_title>Role Lung Ultrasound Imaging Comparison Two Mechanical Ventilation Strategies During Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pulmonary complication contribute morbidity surgical patient . During general anesthesia , 90 % patient develop atelectasis , think major contribute factor development . The adjustment ventilator setting prevent occurrence atelectasis reduce pulmonary complication remain controversial . Despite use similar mechanical ventilation strategy , two recent study ( IMPROVE , PROVHILO ) involve 1300 patient diverge conclusion regard impact strategy prevention pulmonary complication . In study , absence imagery ass pulmonary end-result different ventilation strategy complicate interpretation result . On arrival operating theatre , patient undergo baseline lung ultrasound examination . The anesthetic technique monitoring standardize . The radial artery cannulate induction anesthesia blood gas monitoring . Ventilator setting adjust accord randomization . A second lung ultrasound examination perform 5 minute follow induction general anesthesia . In PEEP group , lung ultrasound examination perform immediately follow first recruitment maneuver . A lung ultrasound examination also perform end surgery emergence general anesthesia . Fifteen minute arrival recovery room , last lung ultrasound examination perform . Fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) vital sign record ultrasound examination . Arterial blood sample collect simultaneously . The aeration score calculate lung ultrasound examination .</detailed_description>
