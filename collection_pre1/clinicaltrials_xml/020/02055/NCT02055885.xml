	<brief_summary>In literature , effect acute oxygen administration exercise tolerance relate symptom often appear contradictory . Some investigation report benefit acute oxygen supply exertion , include increased exercise performance , reduce dyspnea , good cardiorespiratory adaptation , whereas study report improvement . Recently , advance hypothesis patient would non-responders even worsen oxygen treatment . The preliminary result confirm hypothesis since demonstrate 56 % patient improved supplemental oxygen , 16 % non-responders 28 % negative-responders ( decreased performance increase dyspnea endurance exercise supplemental oxygen ) . However , pilot study offer preliminary insight tentative conclusion must confirm large case series . The aim retrospective study : 1 . To confirm cohorte clinical test ( 6-minute walk test - 6WT ) deleterious response acute oxygen supplementation LTOT ( long terme oxygenotherapy treatment ) non-LTOT patient exhibit exercise desaturation . 2 . To identify predictive factor among clinical data ( i.e. , anthropometric , spirometric gazometric data ) and/or functional data record rehabilitation program</brief_summary>
