	<brief_summary>Composite tissue allotransplants ( CTA ) involve transplantation various tissue include vessel , nerve , skin , bone , immune cell entail significant antigenic load . The large majority recipient maintain immunosuppression therapy similar use solid organ transplantation associate complication usually report solid organ transplantation . The question whether risk associate indefinite immunosuppressive justified non-lifesaving procedure still remain unanswered . At present CTA recipient prove spontaneously tolerant immunosuppressive protocol ; indeed , recipient discontinue immunosuppressive therapy reject graft . On hand CTA recipient show low incidence chronic rejection despite high incidence acute rejection episode . For reason great interest minimize immunosuppression CTA patient know immunologic `` risk '' . The main outcome study search signature tolerance recipient hand face allotransplantation test biomarkers previously identify operational tolerant kidney transplant recipient . These marker develop study tolerant kidney recipient already test five bilateral hand transplantation one face transplantation . The present study include hand face allograft recipient transplant least one year several European institution ( Innsbruck , Lyon , Monza , Valencia ) : 11 bilateral hand transplantation , 4 single hand transplantation 3 face transplantation . All patient undergo B cell phenotyping , TCR repertoire , molecular signature operational tolerance skin biopsy immunohistochemical staining specimen order show sign acute chronic rejection . The result could provide valid tool detect operationally tolerant recipient well recipient prone develop chronic rejection .</brief_summary>
