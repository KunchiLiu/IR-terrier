	<brief_summary>Background : - Different people perceive pain differently . Mood , attention , stress , personality affect feel pain . Researchers want know whether people yoga perceive pain differently people practice yoga , meditation , martial art . They also want study cortisol , stress hormone , relate pain brain difference . Objective : - To study effect yoga body stress response , pain perception , brain structure pain response . Eligibility : - Right-handed adult 30 year old practice yoga regularly . - Healthy right-handed volunteer 30 year old least mild exercise yoga martial art . Design : - Visit 1 : Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test electrocardiogram measure heart activity . - At home , participant wear heart monitor 1 day collect 5 saliva sample daily seven day . - Visit 2 : Participants undergo test chair mock MRI machine . They lie table slide cylinder . - A heating device place leg heat periodically seconds time . - They give saliva sample . - Heart rate , respiration , etc . monitor . - They fill questionnaire . - Visit 3 : Participants answer question repeat Visit 2 test . Tests do real MRI machine . The scanner make loud knock sound . Participants get earplug . Participants scanner 1 hour coil head .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Pain perception characterize substantial difference individual . We recently show group experience yogis tolerate pain much longer matched control . To tolerate pain yogi report use strategy involve interoceptive awareness parasympathetic activation nearly control . Yogis gray matter multiple brain region , mid-insular gray matter correlate pain tolerance . They also higher leave intra-insular white matter connectivity control . Given autonomic integration occur mid-insula , observe insular adaptation could relate successful pain affect regulation mediate increased interoceptive processing parasympathetic regulation . Our finding consistent recent theory suggest yoga benefit achieve reduce allostatic load stress response system ( wear tear body ) , thus restore optimal homeostasis . Specifically , beneficial effect yoga many condition , include chronic pain , may attributable increase parasympathetic activation . Indeed , condition benefit yoga practice exacerbate stress exhibit high sympathetic/parasympathetic balance , measure low heart rate variability ( HRV ) . Increased sympathetic activity know increase hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis function . Additionally , proposed people respond uncertainty activate sympathetic nervous system , default response relate well-known negativity bias , tendency prioritize negative information positive . Yoga teach neutral appraisal world might well adaptive response uncertainty involve much sympathetic activation require less energy organism prioritize negative information reactive way . This promote good control stressful event include pain . Thus , propose study first pilot psychophysical procedure proceed full study test general hypothesis difference pain process relate neurostructural neurophysiological difference expect found experience yogis relate flexible autonomic HPA axis control . We also document personality trait , include pain-related behavior , mental state associate observed difference . Study population : In pilot sub-study 19 experience yogi compare 19 healthy volunteer serve control . The full protocol include 49 participant per group . Design : A pilot sub-study follow full cross-sectional study . In full cross-sectional study experience yogis match number variable healthy control practice type mind-body technique . After screen , participant fit ambulatory electrocardiography device ( Holter monitor ) 24 hour characterize HRV natural setting . They also provide saliva sample pre-determined interval seven consecutive day measure cortisol , index HPA axis function . Each subject undergo two test session . Session 1 evaluate participant anticipate process warm painful stimulus certain uncertain context measure perception monitor physiological response respiration , heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance cortisol response . In session 2 , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use assess potential difference brain rest state activity group , well document neural response related anticipation processing warm painfully hot stimulus certain uncertain context use similar paradigm session 1 . Once , physiological monitoring perform . Anatomical MRI scan acquire co-registration fMRI finding well measure gray matter volume cortical thickness difference group . Questionnaires evaluate participant mental state personality trait acquire throughout session . Outcome measure : Ratings warm painfully hot stimulus certain uncertain context compare group . Baseline HRV cortisol level also compare group . Functional anatomical MRI data analyze examine difference yogis healthy volunteer 1 ) gray matter volume cortical thickness ; 2 ) thermal anticipation thermal-evoked activation pattern certain uncertain context ; 3 ) functional connectivity anticipation process thermal stimulus certain uncertain context ; 4 ) rest state activity ; 5 ) functional connectivity rest state . We examine whether behavioral , functional , structural difference find related HPA axis function , autonomic function , personality trait mental state .</detailed_description>
