	<brief_summary>Trends organ donor pool characterize increase age shift towards cerebrovascular disease primary cause death . As result , donor older 60 year nowadays represent one fourth entire donor pool Italy . This , along increase number patient wait list transplantation , prompt grow use organ subject older 60 year would consider unsuitable year ago . To improve graft outcomes , transplant two old kidney recipient propose . To optimize allocation organ single dual transplantation , score system kidney , base biopsy , score range minimum 0 ( indicate absence renal lesion ) maximum 12 ( indicate presence mark change renal parenchyma ) suggest . According panel , kidney score 4 low predict contain enough viable nephron use single transplant , score 5 , 6 , 7 use dual transplant , kidney score great 7 discard . The survival kidney graft obtain donor older 60 year allocate single dual transplantation basis biopsy finding transplantation similar single graft young donor . To improve result , set-up strategy preserve organ crucial save residual nephron mass optimize outcomes marginal graft . In regard , past 30 year two method kidney preservation develop . With cold storage , kidney flush remove donor place ice-cooled container preservation solution . With use pulsatile machine perfusion , kidney connect machine , pump cold solution contain oxygen nutrient kidney . This process allow metabolism continue kidney end product remove . The broad aim present study evaluate whether pulsatile machine perfusion kidneys older/marginal donor may provide good outcome static perfusion . To purpose outcome recipient perfuse kidney compare outcome historical control receive non-perfused kidney select allocated basis criterion match gender , age kidney histologic score .</brief_summary>
