	<brief_summary>Background : - Moebius syndrome limit ability make facial expression like smile , frown blink - move eye laterally . It also cause speech , swallow breathe difficulty affect part body , limb , jaw , muscle , heart . Some individual Moebius intellectual impairment behavior problem . Researchers want study clinical feature individual Moebius relate disorder explore genetic and/or environmental cause condition . Objective : - To learn genetics clinical characteristic Moebius syndrome Congenital Facial Weakness disorder . Eligibility : - People age 2 80 year congenital facial weakness , isolate combined congenital anomaly , family member . Design : - Participants Moebius syndrome congenital facial weakness disorder evaluate NIH Clinical Research Center 3 5 day undergo follow procedure : - Medical family history physical examination , include body measurement vital sign . - Blood saliva collect genetic test evaluate liver , kidney , heart hormonal function . - Eye examination , include video take eyes move . - Hearing evaluation . - Speech language assessment , include swallow study . - Dental exam . - Detailed neurological evaluation , include electromyogram/nerve conduction blink reflex study . - Rehabilitation medicine evaluation , include muscle tongue strength test assessment balance . - Neurocognitive behavioral test questionnaire assess quality life copying mechanism . - Imaging study head , magnetic resonance diffusion tensor image -MRI/DTI . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder take image internal body structure use magnet . Child participant may sedate . - Some adult may additional X-rays head limb , abnormal finding . - Medical photograph face affect body part may take . - Other specialized test consultation , indicate . - Participants choose skin biopsy take . - A follow-up visit offer participant review genetic test finding possibly additional clinical test , indicate . Family member patient medical family history physical examination . Blood saliva obtain genetic study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Moebius Syndrome Other Congenital Facial Weakness Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This natural history study cross-sectional design Moebius syndrome ( MIM 157900 ) , heterogeneous developmental disorder define congenital , non-progressive facial weakness limit abduction one eye , often associate additional feature cranial nerve dysfunction , craniofacial , skeletal limb deformity , well intellectual behavioral impairment . In study attempt characterize clinical phenotype Moebius associate congenital facial weakness syndrome , collect thorough information possible prenatal environmental exposure use genetic study , include whole exome sequencing , DNA patient family member patient identify disease-causing gene . We also conduct brain magnetic resonance- diffusion tensor imaging- study patient order explore brainstem cranial nerve structure associate white matter tract anomaly . Through combined clinical , molecular imaging approach , anticipate phenotype-genotype correlation reveal . These result lead new insight clinical definition condition , molecular pathway , potential network involve pathogenesis facial weakness associate multisystem dysmorphogenesis . Our population consist patient , age 2 80 year , inclusive gender , race , ethnic group , congenital facial palsy , isolate combined congenital anomaly , family . We recruit approximately 24 probands year first three-years study , age 2 80 year , inclusive gender , race , ethnic group , parent unaffected family member total 72 patients/families . In case , patient refer Moebius Syndrome Foundation , patient organization current membership 2000 people database , 1400 diagnose Moebius syndrome . Outcome measure include result battery clinical evaluation , include ophthalmology , audiology , neurology , psychiatry , rehabilitative medicine . Patients also undergo neurocognitive autism screen assessment , electromyography/nerve conduction , blink reflex study . Imaging genetic study provide robust data analysis study . A skin biopsy may perform patient order culture fibroblasts additional biochemical , cell biological , molecular analysis .</detailed_description>
