	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer ( PC ) represent one common cancer industrialized country . Patients localized disease may treat surgery radiation , androgen ablation use first-line therapy patient metastatic disease . While patient initially respond well hormonal therapy , ultimately become unresponsive recur within 2 year androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) . Recently , docetaxel-based regimen demonstrate improved survival men AIPC two different , large , phase III study . However , median overall survival prolong 2 3 month . Androgen independent ( AI ) progression involve variable combination clonal selection , adaptive up-regulation anti-apoptotic gene , ligand-independent androgen receptor ( AR ) activation , alternative growth factor pathway , immune system escape . Additional therapeutic strategy target molecular mechanism mediate resistance , combine immunotherapy must develop . One strategy improve therapy advanced PC involve target gene activate androgen withdrawal , either delay prevent emergence resistant AI phenotype . Recently , scientist , identify Heat Shock Protein ( Hsp27 ) highly over-expressed gene AIPC . Hsp27 knockdown use antisens oligonucleotides ( ASO ) small interfere RNA ( siRNA ) increase apoptotic rate enhance hormone- chemo-therapy PC . She develop patent 2nd generation ASO target Hsp27 license ( investigational drug call OGX-427 ) clinical trial phase I/II currently process PC . Despite OGX-427 efficiency , functional role stress induce Hsp27 castration chemotherapy-induced apoptosis remain undefined . The purpose study elucidate pathway lead Hsp27 action androgen-independent prostate cancer order 1/ Increase pharmacological safety OGX-427 2/find new specific therapeutic target treatment strategy androgen-independent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
