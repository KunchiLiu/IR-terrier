	<brief_title>PAZOFOS : Phase Ib Phase II Trial Pazopanib +/- Fosbretabulin Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer fourth big contributor female cancer mortality , account 4 % malignancy diagnose woman . In United Kingdom ( UK ) , seven thousand new case ovarian cancer annually four thousand two hundred death disease . The standard treatment approach currently consist surgical debulking chemotherapy , usually base around combination carboplatin paclitaxel . Most ovarian cancer initially chemo-responsive however majority patient whose disease initially respond subsequently develop recurrent disease . Once patient recur , treatment option become less numerous less effective . Progression free survival rate platinum-sensitive disease 13 month outlook patient platinum-resistant disease much bad . This study explore new combination drug fosbretabulin , vascular disrupting agent pazopanib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor . There scientific rational combine two type drug able work combination contrast mechanisms action . The first part study dose find exercise cohort patient give drug combination recommend dose drug find . Patients cohort monitor closely safety drug toxicity . The second part study randomise component patient receive combination drug pazopanib alone aim determine whether advantage progression free survival patient receive pazopanib fosbretabulin . This monitored RECIST .</detailed_description>
