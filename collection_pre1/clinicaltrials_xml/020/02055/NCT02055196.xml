	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose genetically modify stem cell give together irinotecan hydrochloride treat patient recurrent high-grade glioma . Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Placing gene create laboratory neural stem cell inject brain may help irinotecan hydrochloride kill tumor cell reach brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define recommend phase II dose intracranially administer active modify human form carboxylesterase ( hCE1m6 ) - neuronal stem cell ( NSCs ) ( carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell ) combination intravenous irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) . II . To determine biologic activity hCE1m6-NSCs compare SN-38 concentration brain treatment hCE1m6-NSCs irinotecan compare irinotecan alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate relationship hCE1m6-NSC dose SN-38 concentration brain interstitium . II . To characterize relationship intracerebral systemic concentration irinotecan SN-38 . III . To assess possible development NSC immunogenicity first exposure repeat dos NSCs . IV . To evaluate intracerebral distribution NSCs use iron-labeling cellular tracker . V. To describe clinical benefit ( define stable disease , partial response , complete response ) patient receive treatment repeat cycle NSCs irinotecan . VI . To determine , time autopsy , fate NSCs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell . Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell via intracerebral catheter day 1 week 1 ; week 1 3 , week 1 , 2 , 3 ; week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 3 week 1 ; week 1 3 , week 1 , 2 , 3 ; week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 15 year .</detailed_description>
