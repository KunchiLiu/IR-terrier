	<brief_summary>Preterm infant bear 28 week gestation risk lung disease require oxygen pressure keep lung open . This usually involve device call nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) . When preterm baby reach certain age , ready begin fee mouth , nCPAP , oral feed usually start due concern choke . This may cause miss window learn may lead long hospital stay oral aversion . Sometimes baby switch nCPAP low flow oxygen ( LFO2 ) short time oral feed , may provide enough support lung . Heated , humidify high flow nasal cannula ( HHHFNC ) another mode provide oxygen pressure . It equal nCPAP small baby transition ventilator , study do old baby . We plan compare feed baby orally use either nCPAP LFO2 HHHFNC preterm baby bear 28 week gestation 34 week correct gestational age . The goal fast time full oral feed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Comparing Different Modes Non-invasive Ventilation Oral Feeding Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study ass whether baby bear less 28 week gestation 34 week correct gestational age , reach full oral feed faster current practice nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) low flow oxygen ( LFO2 ) new intervention heat , humidify high flow nasal cannula ( HHHFNC ) . The specific aim study investigate effectiveness safety use nCPAP LFO2 versus HHHFNC reach full oral feed premature infant . We hypothesize use HHHFNC initiation oral feeding allow baby reach full feed sooner compare nCPAP LFO2 . Babies bear extreme prematurity ( &lt; 28 week gestation ) , risk chronic lung disease due lung immaturity . A proportion preterm infant remain dependent non-invasive ventilation correct gestational age neurodevelopmental stage oral feed . If oral feed initiate timely manner , delay progression oral feed oral aversion may occur , result long hospital stay and/or gastrostomy tube insertion . Those nCPAP dependant unable orally fee due safety concern place low pressure system low flow nasal cannula feed . This may lead microatelectasis baby need high pressure maintain gas exchange . HHHFNC another method non-invasive ventilation change high pressure system ( litre per minute ) low pressure system turn dial , disconnect baby respiratory system . Randomized controlled trial consist two arm : 1 ) The CPAP/LFO2 arm baby maintain nCPAP time oral feed wherein circuit exchange low flow cannula . 2 ) The HHHFNC arm baby maintain 5 lpm HHHFNC time oral feed , wherein flow turn 2 lpm . The study conduct level III neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) Mount Sinai hospital . The study subject 40 preterm baby bear 28 week gestational age 34 week correct gestational age ( CGA ) , dependent non-invasive ventilation receive full feed via nasogastric tube . The randomization occur 33+6/7 week CGA . Demographic characteristic compare group use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . Differences continuous variable assess use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U test non-normally distributed variable . The primary outcome ( time full oral feed ) binary outcome compare group use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . A difference p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
