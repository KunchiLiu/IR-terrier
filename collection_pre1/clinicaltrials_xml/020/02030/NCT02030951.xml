	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS : Feeding circumvents oral cavity drastically alter infant 's feeding experience may lead oral feed difficulty . It estimate 35 - 40 % infant exhibit oral feeding difficulty 34 % infant evaluate oral feeding difficulty develop oral feed resistance first year life . Behaviors associate oral feeding difficulty include : unclear infant behavior signal hunger satiation ; infant frequently interrupt feeding , spit vomiting , postural change feed ; infant irritability ; increase decreased length feeding ; delay acquisition feed skill , disengagement feeding . Oral feed resistance severe include persistent food refusal &gt; 1 month , disruptive mealtime behavior , rigid food preference , gag anticipation feeding , and/or vomit failure master feed skill consistent child 's developmental level . The consequence oral feed difficulty involve : delayed oral feeding , growth failure , delay perceptual motor performance , disengagement caregiver relate feeding , lead less optimal pattern parent-infant interaction . It currently unknown early indicator oral feed difficulty begin develop . The purpose research prospectively describe early feeding social interactive behavior tube fed infant prior later development oral feeding difficulty retrospectively compare difference behavior infant exhibit oral feeding difficulty infant exhibit behavior . Throughout first year life , infant growth , parent perception infant feeding , clinician assessment infant feeding skill , infant maternal behavior feeding evaluate document occurrence oral feeding difficulty , allow comparison early hospital feeding behavior . The study aim : Aim 1 : Describe range early feeding behavior ( pre-feeding , intra feeding , post ) feed progression hospitalize infant long term exposure naso-gastric , oral-gastric gastrostomy tube feeding . Feeding behavior measure behavioral state , orally direct behavior , social interactive behavior ( engagement disengagement behavior ) , hunger satiation cue , suck organization , motor activity . Feeding progression measure daily change proportion tube oral intake . Aim 2 : Identify change early feeding behavior throughout infant 's hospital stay . Aim 3 : Compare early feeding behavior infant without oral feed difficulty 12 month correct age ( CA ) . Aim 4 : Compare parent perception provider assessment feeding , maternal sensitivity infant , response distress , social-emotional cognitive growth foster cue infant clarity cue responsivity mother feed hospital discharge 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month CA infant without oral feed difficulty 12 month CA . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : While healthy infant establish recur cycle hunger , oral feeding , satiation association transition behavioral state , orally direct behavior , social interaction , hospitalized infant often experience tube intravenous feed extend period time , contribute non-establishment hunger , feeding , satiation pattern . Unlike normal healthy infant experience pleasurable sensation smell , taste , touch , social interaction associate oral feeding , hospitalized infant often aversive oral experience relate intubation , insertion oral gastric tube , suction . Behaviors associate oral feeding difficulty include : unclear infant behavior signal hunger satiation ; infant frequently interrupt feeding , frequent interruption , spit vomiting , postural change feed ; infant irritability ; increase decreased length feeding ; delay acquisition feed skill , behavioral disengagement feeding . Oral feed resistance severe may include limited food refusal , disruptive mealtime behavior , rigid food preference , increase decreased length feeding , alter pattern mother-infant interaction , suboptimal growth , failure master feed skill consistent child 's developmental level . The consequence include : delayed oral feeding , disengagement caregiver relate feeding ( lead parent/caregiver frustration . The cost tube feed average $ 40,000 first year life . The cost outpatient behavioral treatment range $ 10,000 $ 52,000 readmission treatment average $ 330,000 . Infant Characteristics Behaviors Related Feeding Oral Feeding Difficulty : The feed experience encompass infant 's preparation feeding ( prefeeding period ) , well actual feeding ( intra feeding ) post feeding period . Feeding involves complex anatomic structure , coordination breathing , suck swallowing , reflex activity , constellation behavior , social interaction . Several infant characteristic include gestational age ( GA ) , post menstrual age , birth weight , health status , long term tube feed show influence oral feeding . There paucity research identify constellation behavior prior , post feeding infant tube feeding . Additionally , intervention currently use hospitalized infant experience feed difficulty predominately address intra feeding period . Management oral feeding difficulty old infants/children intensive , yet also address intra feeding period . Oral Feeding Progression : Low level oral feed skill slow feed progression key indicator oral feed difficulty . Lau Smith categorized level oral feeding skill include fatigue endurance . Infants alert behavioral state progress quickly complete oral feeding . Importance Mother-Infant Interaction : Feeding hold central opportunity development long last pattern mother infant interaction . Feeding critically important involves mother-infant interaction ; primary factor affect growth ; major concern clinicians parent transition full oral feed discharge home . When infant unable able engage mother feeding , difficulty lead non-optimal mother-infant interaction potential alter infant development . Oral Feeding Difficulty : Oral feed difficulty identify parent clinician . Parent perception offer detail information parent 's perspective include ease/difficulty feed infant , infant 's behavioral cue surround feed experience , parent set begin feeding , length feeding . Clinician assessment identifies infant 's oral feeding skill . Design Methods Prospective design . Infant feed behavior , feed progression , growth evaluate weekly hospital stay . Parent perception clinician assessment oral feeding difficulty evaluate 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month correct age . Mother-infant interaction evaluate hospital discharge throughout first year life . Sample : We enroll 75 infant Children 's Hospital Wisconsin ( CHW ) expect receive minimum two week non-oral formula/breast milk feeding hospitalization . Infants meet follow criterion eligible study : prior surgical treatment gut , chest surgery ( non cardiac ) , non-surgical infant require minimum two week non-oral formula/breast milk feeding . Infants may receive oxygen therapy intravenous therapy . Infants may previously treat sepsis , pneumonia , receive intravenous intake , manage assist ventilation . Exclusion criterion include infant currently treat sepsis , pneumonia , intravenous intake , receive assist ventilation , congenital anomaly oral cavity , chromosomal abnormality , neurologically intact ( e.g . hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy significant neurologic deficit ) . Procedures Procedures Data Collection . Evaluation data collect enrollment , weekly hospitalization , hospital discharge , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month CA . At enrollment , informed consent obtain , in-hospital research nurse conduct medical record review obtain infant demographics/risk factor . The early feeding behavior data obtain weekly . Infants video record 90 minute . The first 30 minute comprise pre feeding time . Immediately follow 30 minute pre feed recording , infant fed ( approximately 20 - 30 minute feed ) . After feed complete , video record continue additional 30 minute . The early feeding behavior data assess entire 90 minute data collection session . Infants remain cardiac monitor session . The video record data transfer video camera secure ( encrypt ) server save . The video recording also download Mangold system cod . The feeding progression data collect medical record . Outcomes assess hospital discharge . Within 24 hour discharge , final assessment early feeding behavior occur . In addition , suck organization measure infant partially fully oral feed discharge . The medical record review hospital progression data ( feed progression , type feeding infant receives , weight gain , length , head circumference , length hospital stay ) . The oral feeding skill suck organization data collect member research team . Mother-infant interaction assess feeding . Outcomes assessed Infant Discharge 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month CA . Infant growth mother-Infant interaction feed play assess 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month CA Pediatric Translational Research Unit . Difficulty Oral Feeding infant 's first 12 month , identify parent self report clinician assessment . Mother-infant interaction assess feeding . Statistical Analysis Plan : Frequencies 95 % confidence interval base appropriate model variation calculate behavioral data change behavior time . The behavioral data convert percent , count rate time ( week ) evaluate change time ( maturation ) . Changes time model linear , curvilinear step function fractional polynomial . Analysis change time use Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMM ) repeat count ( Poisson ) frequency/categorical ( logistic multinomial logistic ) . Where outcome occur , feed tube discharge , correspond Generalized Linear Model ( GLM ) use regression modeling ; e.g . Poisson GLM instead Poisson GLMM , logistic GLM place logistic GLMM , etc .
