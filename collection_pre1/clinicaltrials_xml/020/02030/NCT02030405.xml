	<brief_title>Ixazomib ( MLN9708 ) Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Determine best response include complete remission ( CR ) , CR incomplete recovery ( CRi ) , partial remission ( PR ) 3 cycle treatment MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) patient nucleophosmin ( NPM ) 1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( follow LeukemiaNet1 guideline response criterion ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Determine duration remission responder treatment MLN9708 define time document remission relapse . - Determine 1 year overall survival , measure time study entry earlier death cause end follow 1 year . - Establish toxicity tolerability MLN9708 treatment AML , include non-hematologic toxicity grade 3 specified Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
