	<brief_title>NK Cell Infusions With Trastuzumab Patients With HER2+ Breast Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , target immunotherapy become part therapeutic arsenal adult solid tumor , show promising activity melanoma prostate cancer . Trastuzumab monoclonal antibody target HER2 use routinely combination chemotherapy HER2 over-expressing breast gastric cancer . Trastuzumab known induce antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , among various mechanism tumor cell kill . As , trastuzumab may suitably combine immunotherapy strategy harness host 's immune system HER2-positive tumor cells.There mount evidence natural killer ( NK ) cell powerful anti-cancer activity . In patient leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant , several study demonstrate NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity . Allogeneic NK cell infusion patient primary refractory multiple-relapsed leukemia show well tolerate void graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) effect . In study , seek enhance antitumor activity commonly use antibody treat HER2+ breast gastric cancer , trastuzumab , administer combination infusion activate expand autologous NK cells.This lead-in phase I follow phase II study . Up 9 patient enrolled phase I test two different dos NK cell infused patient . This follow phase II study 20 patient enrol . Eligible patient undergo apheresis 9 day ( 11 day ) prior cycle 1 therapy harvest NK cell . The collected NK cell expand activated ex vivo . On day 1 cycle 1 , patient receive herceptin subcutaneous IL2 , follow NK cell infusion day 2 cycle 1 . This follow 5 dos s/c IL2 three time week keep NK cell activate vivo . The patient receive three cycle herceptin ( every 21 day ) . In patient achieve objective tumor response cycle 2 cycle 4 , second NK cell infusion along s/c IL2 administer cycle 4 cycle 6 herceptin respectively.This study determine safety efficacy novel therapeutic strategy HER2 positive breast gastric cancer . It also provide valuable insight role NK cell infusion adult solid tumor .</detailed_description>
