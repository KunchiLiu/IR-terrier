	<brief_title>The Management Resistant Hypertension Kidney Transplant Patients Using Chlorthalidone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve transplant recipient present transplant Clinic Gateway 7th floor resistant hypertension . The initial contact take place transplant clinic study consist approximately eight patient visit 8 week period : Screening , follow-up visit conduct Clinical Research Services ( CRS ) Unit . The Baseline ( Week 1 ) , Visit 1 Enrollment ( Week 1 ) Day 1 2 , Visit 2 , ( Week 3 ) Day 1 2 , Visit 3 End Study , ( Week 7 ) Day 1 2 . Additional visit maybe required accommodate adverse reaction . The study require approximately four ( 4 ) time point blood pressure , pulse weight obtain , safety blood collection approximately 2-3 tablespoon draw venipuncture 24 hour urine collection period . Home blood pressure reading require two ( 2 ) time point study . The subject require stop take current medication seven week , take study medication 6 week report adverse reaction concomitant medication visit . During Enrollment visit , subject identify , informed consent obtain , demographic characteristic , past medical history , co-morbid illness , current medication , home office blood pressure record assess eligibility criterion . This data collect prospectively investigator . Initial clinical assessment time patient 's screen visit perform outpatient test center transplant clinic . A three day window allow visit . The following measurement occur visit : Biometric measurement : vitals ( blood pressure pulse ) body weight , EKG , Arm circumference , confirmation hypertension 24-h ABPM , urine study : 24 hour urine collection evaluation , safety , 8-10AM sit upright Plasma Aldosterone/Renin Ratio , clinical safety laboratory test : bone morphogenetic protein , Mg/phosphorus level , Parathyroid hormone , vitamin D level HbA1c , review document concomitant medication , include current furosemide prescription . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion start Baseline ( Week 1 ) Measurements . At Baseline ( Week 1 ) current furosemide prescription document discontinue . This begin washout period . The washout period continue one week . At end washout period subject instruction return CRS unit Visit 1 Enrollment measurement . Visit 1 Enrollment Measurements Week 1 , Day 1 , include follow measurement : Biometric measurement : Body Weight , confirmation hypertension 24-h ABPM Urine study : start 24 hour Urine collection , safety laboratory evaluation : bone morphogenetic protein , document concomitant medication , adverse reaction . Visit 1 Enrollment Measurements Week 1 Day 2 subject return 24-hour urine collection 24 hour ABPM remove . The study medication chlorthalidone start . The subject take study medication 3 week return next study visit : Visit 2 ( Week 3 ) Day 1 . A three day window allow . At Visit 2 ( Week 3 ) Day 1 2 . Biometric measurement : Body Weight home B/P recording , start 24 hour Urine collection . Review pill count compliance , concomitant medication adverse reaction obtain . Day 2 : subject return 24-hour urine collection . Review study removal criterion After take study medication three week , subject return CRS unit Visit 3 End Study , ( Week 7 ) Day 1 2 Visit 3 End Study , ( Week 7 ) Day 1 2 . On day 1 , Biometric measurement : Body Weight , start 24-h ABPM , Urine study : start 24 hour Urine collection , safety laboratory evaluation : 8-10AM sit upright Plasma Aldosterone/Renin Ratio , collect safety lab : bone morphogenetic protein , Mg/phosphorus level , parathyroid hormone , vitamin D level HbA1c , document pill count , concomitant medication , home blood pressure read adverse Reactions . Day 2 : subject return 24-hour urine collection 24 hour ABPM remove If blood pressure adequately control study medication subject may continue study medication . If blood pressure adequately control study medication subject may return pre-study medication medication prescribe physician .</detailed_description>
