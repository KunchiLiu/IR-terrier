	<detailed_description>This study open-label , non-randomized , metabolism excretion study [ 14C ] -rigosertib administer single dose approximately 450 mg contain 250 μCi [ 14C ] -labeled rigosertib 24-hour continuous intravenous ( CIV ) infusion healthy volunteer . Up 8 subject enrolled ensure least 6 subject evaluable data . Eligible subject confine clinical site time Check-in ( approximately 24 hour prior dose ) Discharge ( Days 6 10 ) . One single dose [ 14C ] -rigosertib administer 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion Day 1 . Subjects discharge early 120 hour start infusion , ≥ 90 % administer radioactive dose recover urine feces combine total radioactivity recover urine feces ≤ 1 % administer radioactive dose 2 consecutive 24-hr sample . The maximum stay Day 10 ( 216 hour start infusion ) .</detailed_description>
