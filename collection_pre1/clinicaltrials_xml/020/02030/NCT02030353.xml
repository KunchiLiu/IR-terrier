	<brief_summary>The purpose study test feasibility two 6-month behavioral intervention weight gain prevention ( self-regulation plus activity monitor self-regulation ) among African American breast cancer survivor along delayed control group . Participants 45 African American post-treatment breast cancer survivor . Intervention content deliver online one face-to-face individual meeting . Weight , clinical psychosocial measure assess baseline , 3 6 month . It hypothesize feasible deliver two weight gain prevention intervention among African American breast cancer survivor , participant two intervention group low magnitude weight gain 6-month follow-up relative delay control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Smart Scales Weight Gain Prevention African American Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer among African American woman United States , North Carolina ( NC ) , African American woman likely die breast cancer compare woman races/ethnicities . Given disparity approximately 90,000 African American breast cancer survivor NC , important identify modifiable factor help improve survival among population . Behavioral intervention promote weight management among breast cancer survivor help reduce risk prevalent comorbidities , cardiovascular disease diabetes , potentially improve prognosis survival . While lifestyle intervention show promise improve body weight breast cancer survivor , none focus weight gain prevention African American breast cancer survivor , evaluate use frequent self-weighing self-regulation strategy . Regular self-weighing effectively use approach weight maintenance help individual monitor daily weight fluctuation make small change energy balance behavior . Given frequency self-weighing among breast cancer survivor unknown , importance self-regulation behavior weight maintenance well establish , extend previous work prevent weight gain among breast cancer survivor critical next step optimize cancer outcome . It unknown whether self-weighing activity monitoring feasible strategy breast cancer survivor monitor weight change regulate energy balance . Thus , three-arm , pilot randomize control trial evaluate two behavioral self-regulation intervention weight gain prevention ( self-regulation self-regulation plus activity monitoring ) compare delay control group among 45 female African-American post-treatment breast cancer survivor . Participants randomly assign one three group : Self-regulation intervention activity monitoring ( n=15 ) ; Self-regulation intervention ( n=15 ) ; Delayed control ( n=15 ) .</detailed_description>
