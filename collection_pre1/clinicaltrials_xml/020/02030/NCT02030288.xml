A patient center computer-based intervention help close performance gap deliver tailor intervention excellent quality fidelity . Relational Agents on-screen character speak patient establish `` relationship '' . They use improve several health behavior include diet exercise , overcome communication barrier relate low level computer literacy . The Relational Agent place desktop tablet computer touch screen , patient indicate response . Using Motivational Interviewing behavior change principle , Relational Agent guide patient consider change . Use `` eHealth '' tool offload time-intensive task clinician provide patient , may limit computer skill , non-threatening vehicle `` discussing '' stigmatize topic risky alcohol use . Relational Agents proven effective web-based intervention promote health-related behavior change study . Pilot study VA Boston demonstrate Veterans engage Relational Agents view favorably . To date , VA trials Relational Agents . Aims : - 1 ) Tailor Relational Agent Intervention Veteran population - 2 ) Conduct randomize control trial Treatment Usual plus Relational Agent versus Treatment Usual unhealthy alcohol use - 3 ) Examine in-depth Veterans ' experience Relational Agent Intervention . Methods : To achieve Aim 1 , investigator use standard software development technique , include cognitive interviewing usability testing , tailor Relational Agent Intervention Veteran population . Once Relational Agent refine , investigator conduct two-arm RCT ( Aim 2 ) VA Boston Healthcare System .

The Relational Agent provide personal feedback Veteran clinician , flag Veterans meet criterion referral treatment . Alcohol use related behavior assess in-person survey baseline telephone survey 3-month follow-up . Primary outcome measure quantity frequency alcohol use 3-month follow-up , rate brief intervention , referral treatment , satisfaction secondary outcome .
