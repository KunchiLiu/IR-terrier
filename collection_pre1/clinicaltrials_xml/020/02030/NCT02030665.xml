	<detailed_description>Marijuana commonly use illicit drug US , treatment marijuana dependence fully effective . The effective treatment date employ motivational enhancement ( MET ) plus cognitive-behavioral coping skill treatment ( CB ) contingency management ( CM ) abstinence . This proposal competitive renewal recently complete study enhance cop self-efficacy improve marijuana outcomes long term . In current proposal explore idea tailor teach cop skill may result improved outcome marijuana-dependence see thus far . The Individualized Assessment Treatment Program ( IATP ) marijuana dependent patient employ experience sampling ( ES ) determine strengths weakness patient drug-use situation treatment tailor accordingly . Results pilot study indicate IATP alcohol dependent patient yield well drink outcomes posttreatment package CB program ( PCBT ) , IATP patient report great use cop skill PCBT participant , posttreatment report cop skill related posttreatment drinking . Participants 275 men woman meet criterion marijuana dependence randomly assign 9 session treatment one 4 treatment condition : Standardized MET plus CB ( SMET-CB ) ; SMET+ CM ( SMET-CB-CM ) ; IATP ; IATP + CM ( IATP-CM ) . Patients treatment engage ES via cell-phone two week prior treatment , weekly period treatment , another week treatment end , two weekly period month 8 14 . In IATP condition , information gather pretreatment during-treatment ES period provide data functional analysis patient ' drug use urge use . Therapists use information address specific cognition , affect , behavior adaptive maladaptive , tailor specific cop skills program patient . During-treatment experience sample allow adjustment treatment goal procedure , make treatment adaptive . In SMET-CB condition experience sample data use therapy , still provide in-vivo measure drink cop skill . It hypothesize IATP condition yield significantly well cop skill acquisition SMET-CB condition , posttreatment extend follow-up , change cop skill predict good outcome IATP condition . It predict addition CM IATP SMET-CB enhance short-term long-term outcome . The result implication improve tailor treatment patient ' strength deficit , validity training cop skill relapse prevention . The data collect shed light way patient treatment use cop skill real-time context . Finally , use repeat ES period allow u determine treatment impact thought , feeling behavior , turn affect outcome long short term .</detailed_description>
