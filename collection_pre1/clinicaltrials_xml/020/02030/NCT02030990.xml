Research Design This single-center , prospective , comparative cohort study . 3 . Hypothesis There significant difference refractive correction amongst treatment group , 12 month surgery . 4 . Objectives The primary study objective compare effect intraoperative MMC postoperative short topical steroid taper 3 week , intraoperative MMC rapid topical steroid taper 1 week , commonly accept postoperative regimen 2 month long topical steroid taper without intraoperative MMC . The primary endpoint evaluate objective estimate refractive error ( WaveScan WaveFront™ System ) 12 month post-surgery . Secondarily , extent haze formation evaluate objectively use densitometry map generate automated Scheimpflug imaging cornea ( Pentacam® ) . Furthermore , subjective vision patient ' perspective evaluate questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To evaluate use mitomycin-C ( MMC ) intraoperative adjunct photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) , effect postoperative healing ability reduce postoperative topical steroid course surgery . 2 . Research Design This single-center , prospective , comparative cohort study . 3 . Hypothesis There significant difference refractive correction amongst treatment group , 12 month surgery . 4 . Objectives The primary study objective compare effect intraoperative MMC postoperative short topical steroid taper 3 week , intraoperative MMC rapid topical steroid taper 1 week , commonly accept postoperative regimen 2 month long topical steroid taper without intraoperative MMC . The primary endpoint evaluate objective estimate refractive error ( WaveScan WaveFront™ System ) 12 month post-surgery . Secondarily , extent haze formation evaluate objectively use densitometry map generate automated Scheimpflug imaging cornea ( Pentacam® ) . Furthermore , subjective vision patient ' perspective evaluate questionnaire . 5 . Methodology At Navy Refractive Surgery Center San Diego ( NRSC SD ) , total 300 patient enrol randomly assign three cohort . PRK perform standard fashion treatment group . In first two group , intraoperative MMC 0.01 % contact time 15 second utilized . During postoperative period , first cohort use short steroid taper second cohort use rapid steroid taper . The third cohort receive intraoperative MMC self-administer postoperative steroid , taper two month . All cohort follow 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month procedure . Standard clinical measure visual performance record . Since visually significant corneal haze relatively rare , corneal densitometry use objective measure detect subclinical corneal haze addition usual subjective haze evaluation do clinical optometrist . The patient complete voluntary questionnaire evaluate subjective impression refractive surgery , recovery outcomes . Specifically , patient report use refractive correction , usefulness surgery work , dry eye complaint , subjective appraisal vision .</detailed_description>
