	<brief_summary>Various system measure intravesical intrarectal pressure urodynamic testing ; especially cystometry , exist . Water fill tube -systems commonly use regarded contemporary standard . A water fill system however sensitive tube patient movement artefacts prone erroneous calibration . Air charge catheter less sensitive patient especially tubing- movement , calibrate easier . However , vitro test demonstrate air charge catheter respond somewhat slow relatively damped , especially rapid pressure change ( simulate ) coughing , comparison water fill system . The clinical relevance observation unknown . This study compare technical reliability clinical applicability two type catheter system cystometry synchronous double catheter test procedure prospective group patient schedule urodynamic investigation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Patient cohort , acute experiment , mono -center synchronous double urodynamic catheter technique study . Study population : Adult female patient male female patient spinal cord injury meningomyelocele unable void , schedule urodynamic investigation basis contemporary standard guideline , sign symptom low urinary tract dysfunction . Intervention : Synchronous double catheter urodynamic testing ; Standard fill cystometry air-charged Ã¡nd water fill catheter pairwise insert , connect registry equipment . Main study parameters/endpoints : Difference intravesical pressure increment maximum fill cystometry two system . Primary hypothesis test : The average difference well average absolute difference maximum water pressure ( standard system ) maximum air pressure ( comparator ) 0 ( zero ) . There per-protocol follow patient .</detailed_description>
