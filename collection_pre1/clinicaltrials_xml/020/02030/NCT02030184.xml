	<brief_summary>There two part trial . The first study evaluate increase dos Re188 P2045 patient advance small cell lung cancer recur initial therapy patient advance neuroendocrine cancer progress therapy . Re188 P2045 design attach type 2 somatostatin receptor frequently express cancer radioactivity Re188 kill cancer cell . Only patient cancer see Tc99 P2045 administer ( also seek SSTR2 , Tc99 image , treat cell ) treat . Therefore , approach maximizes possibility patient benefit treatment cancer target undergo treatment . The primary purpose study determine high dose Re188 P2045 safely administer . The second study open conclusion first . Patients first undergo scan Tc99 P2045 treat topotecan three day . Topotecan standard chemotherapy drug approve second line therapy small cell frequently use neuroendocrine cancer . Following , patient re-evaluated Tc99 P2045 scan demonstrates tumor positive SSTR2 , patient receive Re188 P2045 . The goal study determine high dose Re188 P2045 safely administer topotecan well determine topotecan increase chance tumor express SSTR2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Rhenium 188-P2045 Small Cell Lung Cancer Other Advanced Neuroendocrine Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial conduct patient small cell lung cancer neuroendocrine cancer . These include extrapulmonary small cell , gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor arise pulmonary lesion , large cell neuroendocrine ( NE ) tumor . First , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) Rhenium Re188-P2045 alone determine administer single dose , 80 , 90 , 130 , 170 , 210 ( ) 250 mCi/m2 . Subsequently , second study Rhenium Re 188-P2045 administer 40 , 50 , 75 , 85 100 per cent MTD determine first study , single agent follow 3 daily topotecan treatment ( 1.0 1.5 mg/m2 ) patient advanced neuroendocrine tumor SSTR2 expression determine Technicium ( Tc ) Tc99m P2045 scan . The overall response survival rate patient treated Rhenium Re188 P2045 administer single dose follow topotecan measure . The change ( ) SSTR2 expression , determine Tc99m P2045 scan topotecan administration also determine . The correlation pre-therapy SSTR2 expression ( determine Tc99m P2045 scan ) overall response survival rate calculate .</detailed_description>
