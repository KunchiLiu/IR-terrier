	<brief_title>Statistical Analysis Plan Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis Three , International Trials Comparing Protocolised With Usual Resuscitation Patients Presenting Emergency Department With Severe Sepsis Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2001 , Rivers colleague , publish result single-centre , proof-of-concept , randomise , control trial conduct USA compare protocolised resuscitation , term early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) , usual resuscitation 263 patient present emergency department ( ED ) severe sepsis septic shock . The Rivers ' trial demonstrate significant 16 % absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) hospital mortality 46.5 % 30.5 % . With view inform generalisability finding health care setting , three independent , large , multicentre , randomise control trial test EGDT subsequently fund , one USA , one Australasia one UK : USA - Protocolized Care Early Septic Shock ( ProCESS ) ; Australasia - Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation ( ARISE ) ; UK - Protocolised Management In Sepsis ( ProMISe ) . Though independent trial , view perform subsequent individual patient data meta-analysis ( IPDMA ) , effort make harmonise three , contemporaneous trial key area design , example , trial protocol , entry criterion , data data collection , primary secondary outcome , etc . As exist , publish , individual trial , ProCESS , ARISE ProMISe , propose IPDMA require pre-specified statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) . The SAP set agree three trial team prior knowledge result individual three trial . It note , propose analysis add IPDMA SAP , post-knowledge result ProCESS , ARISE and/or ProMISe , clearly indicated subsequent publication SAP result IPDMA . Objectives In patient present ED severe sepsis septic shock : Primary objective - compare effect EGDT usual resuscitation 90-day all-cause mortality Secondary objectives - compare effect EGDT usual resuscitation 90-day all-cause mortality adjustment important baseline covariates - compare effect EGDT across country - compare effect EGDT secondary/intermediate outcome - compare effect EGDT pre-determined , clinically important subgroup Data management Prior pooling data three trial , clinical report form trial compare similarities/dissimilarities discuss across trial team inform final structure specification IPDMA dataset . Similar variable double-checked consistency across trial ( analysis distribution , range summary statistic ) prior finally import IPDMA database . [ Unlike ARISE ProMISE - two-arm trial compare EGDT usual resuscitation , ProCESS three-arm trial additional arm evaluating protocolised usual resuscitation ( term protocolised standard care ) . Data ProCESS patient recruit randomise protocolised standard care ( n=450 ) exclude analysis primary objective retain possible inclusion analysis relevant secondary objective . ] Analysis principle Primary analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis , patient retain original , randomly assign group , unadjusted effect covariates . Imputation miss value consider , employ , method fully describe . For analysis , number complete/missing observation report . Pre-determined , clinically important subgroup analysis conduct even strong evidence treatment effect primary outcome absent . All test two-sided p-value 0.05 used indicate statistical significance . No formal adjustment make multiple comparison - however , large number subgroup analysis plan , cautious interpretation employ . Sample size calculation As indicated Introduction , treatment effect Rivers ' trial 16 % ARR hospital mortality ( 12.6 % ARR mortality 60-days ) . Individually , ProCESS , ARISE ProMISe 80-90 % power detect 6.5-8.0 % ARR mortality ( hospital mortality censor 60-days ProCESS , 90-day mortality ARISE ProMISe ) , assume baseline mortality 24-40 % depend trial . The combined recruitment ProCESS , ARISE ProMISE 4210 patient 3760 patient randomise either receive EGDT usual resuscitation . Based control event rate range 25 % -35 % , 80 % power two-sided p-value 0.05 , IPDMA able detect ARR 90-day mortality range 4-5 % ( allowance heterogeneity treatment effect cluster outcome across three trial ) . For subgroup , base control event rate range 25 % -35 % , 80 % power two-sided p-value 0.05 , IPDMA able detect interaction effect ( odds ratio ) around 1.5 subgroup represent half total sample interaction effect around 1.6 subgroup represent one quarter total sample . If treatment-subgroup interaction significant , interpreted treatment effect subgroup best inform overall treatment effect IPDMA . Analysis plan The IPDMA perform use one stage , multi-level ( patient nest site nested trial ) , mixed modelling . Heterogeneity trial determine fit fix interaction term treatment trial , overall treatment effect report trial treat fixed effect site treat random effect . A secondary analysis adjust important baseline covariates , include : age ; sex ; APACHE II score ; SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg ; use invasive mechanical ventilation . Primary outcome 90 day all-cause mortality - logistic , mixed modelling , term trial site , report odds ratio 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) Secondary/intermediate outcome Hospital ( censor 60 day ) 28-day mortality - binomial , mixed modelling report odds ratio 95 % CI Survival analysis - Appropriate survival analysis technique , e.g . Cox proportional hazard regression report Hazards Ratio 95 % CI proportionality assumption hold Duration stay ED , ICU hospital - assessed normality , appropriate transformation report ratio geometric mean 95 % CI , account impact survivorship Receipt duration mechanical ventilation , vasopressor support renal replacement therapy - binomial , mixed modelling report odds ratio 95 % CI Where relevant , assumption underlie analysis detail report . All result report tabular form display use forest plot 95 % CI . All analysis perform use SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) . A two-sided p-value 0.05 consider statistically significant . Subgroup analyse To determine relationship treatment primary outcome differs pre-determined , clinically important subgroup , fix interaction term treatment subgroup report . To ascertain treatment-subgroup interaction vary trial , three-way fix interaction trial , treatment subgroup also report . Furthermore , subgroup define continuous variable , analysed categorical continuous data linearity continuous relationship explore . Additional sensitivity analysis conduct adjust important baseline covariates . Pre-determined , clinically important , pre-randomisation subgroup interest relate site , patient care delivery factor . Site factor : - Country - Type hospital - Annual admission - Annual ED presentation - Number ICU bed - Ratio ICU hospital bed - Annual ICU admission - Specialist staff ICU - EGDT delivery model Patient factor : - Age - Sex - Race/ethnicity - Obesity - APACHE II score - MEDS score - SOFA score - Source infection - Infectious aetiology - Presentation - refractory hypotension - Presentation - hypoperfusion - Receipt vasopressor - Receipt invasive ventilation Care delivery factor : - Interval ED presentation first administration antimicrobial - Interval ED presentation start intervention - Time admission ( day/night weekend/weekday ) - Volume fluid Causal mediation analysis Exploratory analyse post-randomisation variable , understand delivery therapeutic effect EGDT , conduct . Potential mediator causal effect EGDT outcome consider association intervention mediator intervention outcome , adjust mediator , estimate . Prior commence IPDMA analysis , detail , final SAP publish .</detailed_description>
