	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize crossover study evaluate effect two different manipulation technique pulmonary function parameter person COPD . Thirty-six ( 36 ) subject enrol study order complete study least 30 subject . Pulmonary function measure include spirometry lung volume . The pulmonary function test do baseline , 30 minute post-treatment , 3 hour post-treatment . The study protocol treatment consist five-minute treatment session one two studied treatment technique give random order . After washout period least four week , subject return second treatment session use technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject must age 50 old , history consistent diagnosis COPD , document airflow obstruction increase residual volume pulmonary function test . Airflow obstruction define FEV1/FVC ratio 70 percent le predicted value RV 120 percent great predict value . Subjects exclude received form manipulative treatment 3 month prior enrol study . Subjects acute respiratory illness , exacerbation COPD , acute bronchitis , pneumonia exclude study . Persons unable cooperate follow instruction complete pulmonary function test due dementia cognitive disorder exclude person spinal scoliosis great 25 degree , significant chest wall deformity , acute rib compression fracture vertebra , unstable angina , unstable congestive heart failure .</criteria>
