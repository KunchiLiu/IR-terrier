A blocked randomisation process stratify participant accord three child factor ( sex , age child behaviour difficulty ) . A computerised random integer generator use generate random allocation sequence separate randomisation list . A sample size calculator formula statistical superiority design indicate 130 participant would require achieve effect size 0.8 primary outcome measure 5 % significance level ratio 2:1 intervention control . After allow expect drop 40 % base similar study ( Sanders , Prior , &amp; Ralph , 2009 ) target population 182 parent . After initial randomisation , process follow every additional person interested participating study . The assistant include participant appropriate group .

Differences group outcome assess ANCOVAs uni-dimensional questionnaire , MANCOVAs multi-dimensional questionnaire . To control baseline difference primary outcome , result present treatment effect estimate mean group difference change score baseline post-intervention control baseline demographic difference parental education number child family , conventional p value .05 , effect size use Cohen 's , estimate effect 95 % confidence interval ( Altman , 2005 ) . Change score calculate simple subtraction , positive change score represent great improvement desire therapeutic direction . The estimated marginal mean report mean score adjust covariates use ( Austin , Manca , Zwarrenstein , Juurlink , &amp; Stanbrook , 2010 ) . Significant effect explore use ANCOVAs , pairwise comparison determine significant difference condition . Bonferroni adjustment make base number pairwise comparison conduct . Phase 7 : End Research At end study parent return 6-month follow-up assessment booklets researcher send envelope follow material .
