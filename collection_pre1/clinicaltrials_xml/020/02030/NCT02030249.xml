	<detailed_description>This sub-study consist 2 part : PART 1 . Durability change appetite appetite-regulating hormone weight loss overweight obese pre-diabetic adult : impact diet weight maintenance . A major reason failure many lifestyle-based weight loss attempt body respond energy restriction weight loss series adaptive response prevent ongoing weight loss promote weight regain ( Sainsbury Zhang 2010 ; Sainsbury Zhang 2012 ) . This 'famine reaction ' include increase appetite alteration circulate concentration gut-derived hormone tend stimulate appetite promote fat accumulation . Recent evidence suggest alteration sustain long low body weight maintain ( Sumithran et al 2011 ) . This find - validate population - enormous implication clinical practice . For instance , know certain weight loss-induced increase appetite reverse without weight regain , identify individual increase appetite subside , multiple fruitless heartbreaking effort lose excess weight via lifestyle intervention could circumvent , individual could immediately channel aggressive - albeit still imperfect - treatment option ( i.e . long-term appetite-suppressing medication , bariatric surgery ) . If , hand , know increase appetite follow weight loss subside follow period weight maintenance low weight , could identify individual possible , information could use promote compliance weight maintenance strategy weight loss , patient message ; `` Keeping weight difficult beginning , n't give likely become easy time '' . A substantial body research show diet high protein ( Westerterp-Plantenga et al 2004 ) low glycaemic index ( Brand-Miller et al 2002 ) diet conventionally recommended health may help people maintain low body weight post weight loss , benefit may occur reduce drive eat . These finding raise possibility high protein lower glycaemic index weight maintenance diet could use reduce intensity famine reaction overweight obese people completion weight loss diet , thereby improve likelihood keep weight . While ample research show benefit higher protein diet reduce appetite , enhance weight loss preserve lean body mass loss apply energy restrict weight loss program , recently review ( Soenen et al 2013 ) , relatively little work date emerge benefit higher protein diet applied weight maintenance program weight loss . The importance Sub-Study ( Part 1 ) seek confirm controversial new find potentially enormous implication clinical management overweight obesity ( Sumithran et al 2011 ) , also investigate potential benefit higher protein lower GI diet - apply weight maintenance phase standardize weight loss program - prevent apparently permanent increase appetite overweight obese people report one study ( Sumithran et al 2011 ) experience response weight loss . Part 1 Hypothesis : - Both overweight obese individual demonstrate increase appetite corresponding change appetite-regulating hormone response standardize low calorie diet weight loss program , effect normalize within 4-10 month weight maintenance program overweight obese individual . - In overweight obese individual , high protein lower glycaemic index weight maintenance diet weight-reducing diet improve normalisation appetite appetite-regulating hormone compare moderate protein moderate glycaemic index weight maintenance diet . Part 1 Aim : â€¢ To determine fast appetite fast circulate concentration appetite-regulating hormone ( ghrelin peptide YY ) 2-month standardize low calorie diet overweight obese pre-diabetic adult , determine whether effect attenuate 4 10 month one two different weight maintenance program differ protein content glycaemic index . PART 2 . Effect weight loss bone homeostasis muscle strength young old overweight obese pre-diabetic adult : impact diet weight maintenance long-term durability effect . While generally recognise lose excess weight help prevent disease development young adult , controversy whether weight loss program indicate management overweight obesity old adult , , body mass index program implement ( Chapman 2008 ) . It noteworthy weight loss via voluntary involuntary mean older adult link reduced function , reduce quality life increase mortality ( Chapman 2008 ) . The reason relationship clear , one possibility weight loss program lead significant loss bone lean tissue certain circumstance ( e.g . inadequate dietary protein , inadequate exercise ) , unknown loss recuperate . Given reduction bone density lean body mass risk factor fracture fall old adult , change body composition response weight loss effort older adult could inadvertently produce negative effect . In light establish role dietary protein maintenance lean tissue bone muscle old people response weight loss ( Westerterp-Plantenga et al 2012 ) , PREVIEW trial offer invaluable opportunity investigate effect standardise weight loss program bone homeostasis muscle function ( strength ) young old adult , well impact difference diet weight maintenance attenuate effect . Part 2 Hypothesis : - That 2-month standardize low calorie diet weight loss program lead reduction bone mass muscle strength young old adult , particularly old adult , parameter return towards baseline value within 3 year young old adult . - That high protein weight-maintenance diet improve restoration bone mass muscle strength weight loss younger old adult . Part 2 Aim : - To measure bone mass , bone turnover muscle strength young ( 25-45 year old ) old ( 55-70 year old ) adult standardize 2-month weight loss program , well 6 , 12 , 24 36 month commencement weight loss program . - To compare effect two different weight maintenance program differ protein content restoration bone homeostasis muscle strength standardize 2-month weight loss diet . The weight maintenance program 10 month ' duration administer immediately 2-month weight loss program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 25 45 year 55 70 year Overweight obesity status BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 Prediabetes . The criterion WHO/IDF ( International Diabetes Foundation ) assess prediabetes use formal inclusion criterion , i.e . : Impaired Fasting Glucose ( IFG ) : Fasting venous plasma glucose concentration 5.6 6.9 mmol/l Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) : Venous Plasma glucose concentration 7.8 11.0 mmol/l 2 h oral administration 75 g glucose ( oral glucose tolerance test , OGTT ) , fast plasma glucose le 7.0 mmol/l . Due potential betweenlab variation ( local assessment ) , HbA1c use inclusion criterion screen . Informed consent require Ethnic group No restriction Smoking Smoking allow , provide subject recently ( within 1 month ) change habit . However , smoke status monitor throughout study use confound variable . Motivation Motivation willingness randomize group his/hers best follow give protocol Other Able participate CID 's normal working hour . Based interview and/or questionnaire , individual follow problem exclude : Medical condition know subject : Diabetes mellitus ( gestational diabetes mellitus ) ; Significant cardiovascular disease include current angina ; myocardial infarction stroke within past 6 month ; heart failure ; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease ; Systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 100 mmHg whether treatment hypertension . If treat , change drug treatment within last 3 month ; Advanced chronic renal impairment ; Significant liver disease e.g . cirrhosis ( fatty liver disease allow ) ; Malignancy currently active remission less five year last treatment ( local basal squamous cell skin cancer allow ) ; Active inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease , chronic pancreatitis disorder potentially causing malabsorption ; Previous bariatric surgery ; Chronic respiratory , neurological , musculoskeletal disorder , judgement investigator , participant would unacceptable risk difficulty comply protocol ( e.g . physical activity program ) ; A recent surgical procedure full convalescence ( investigator judgement ) ; Transmissible bloodborne disease e.g . hepatitis B , HIV ; Psychiatric illness ( e.g . major depression , bipolar disorder ) . Medication : Use currently within previous 3 month prescription medication potential affecting body weight glucose metabolism glucocorticoid ( exclude inhale topical steroid ; bronchodilator allow ) , psychoactive medication , epileptic medication , weight loss medication ( either prescription , counter herbal ) . Low dose antidepressant allow , judgement investigator , affect weight participation study protocol . Levothyroxine treatment hypothyroidism allow participant stable dose least 3 month .
