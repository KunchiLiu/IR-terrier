	<brief_title>Palbociclib Combination With Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial men woman multiple myeloma return treatment ( relapse ) respond prior treatment ( refractory ) . This phase 1 study addition PD 0332991 ( Palbociclib ) CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor lenalidomide / dexamethasone treatment RRMM . The purpose study determine effectiveness combination PD 0332991 , lenalidomide dexamethasone ( PLD ) treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . PD 0332991 ( Palbociclib ) experimental drug pill take mouth . It work block specific growth signal within cancer cell . Lenalidomide ( also call Revlimid ) approve use dexamethasone people multiple myeloma receive prior therapy . Study participant receive different dos Palbociclib lenalidomide depend enroll study . The study help determine maximum tolerate dose combination study drug . Treatment schedule ( treatment cycle 28 day ) : - Palbociclib daily Days 1-14 cycle - Lenalidomide daily Days 8-21 ( Days 1-21 , depend dose level ) cycle - Dexamethasone Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 cycle . Participants continue study treatment long respond therapy experience unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
