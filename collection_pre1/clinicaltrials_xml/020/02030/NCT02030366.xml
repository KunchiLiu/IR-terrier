	<brief_summary>Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) common injury combat , terrorist attack sport football hockey . Unnecessary delay diagnosis treatment brain damage patient benefit evacuation procedure lead bad brain injury , bad outcome , sometimes , unnecessary death . However , reliable sensitive method diagnosis TBI severity field . In study examine feasibility use multifocal chromatic pupillometer monitoring TBI , examine pupillary response multifocal chromatic stimulus intracranial pressure ( ICP ) -monitored severe TBI patient . As control , normal subject test pupillary response use device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chromatic Multifocal Pupillometer Detection Follow-up Acute Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To examine feasibility use multifocal chromatic pupillometer monitoring TBI , pupillary response multifocal chromatic stimulus assess 20 healthy subject 20 ICP-monitored severe TBI patient . The portable pupillometer test 20 healthy volunteer . Their pupillary response measure 3 times/day 1 week . Pupillary response 20 severe TBI patient evaluate detailed following time point : 1 . At admittance ICU , prior insertion ICP CT scan 2 . Prior CT scan routinely perform day 3 7 post injury 3 . Routinely begin every medical personnel shift 7 day ( 3 time day ) . 4 . With every change ICP ( 5 mmHg 15 min ) Data record analyze .</detailed_description>

Healthy subject History past present ocular disease Use topical systemic medication could adversely influence efferent pupil movement TBIpatients High level barbiturate medication abolish pupillary responsiveness Coma suspect primarily due cause ( e.g . alcohol ) Preexisting clinically significant disease chronic condition ascertain time admission could affect pupillary response measurement ( know retinal dystrophy disease , glaucoma dense cataract .</criteria>
