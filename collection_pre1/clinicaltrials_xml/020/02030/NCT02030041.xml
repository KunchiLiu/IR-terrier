	<brief_summary>Statins along lifestyle modification include exercise commonly prescribe patient type 2 diabetes . American diabetes association recommend use moderate-intensity statin lifestyle therapy patient diabetes age ≥40 year , even without additional cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors.. Myopathy well known adverse effect statin , occur 1-7 % patient . The spectrum statin-related myopathy range common benign myalgia rare life threaten rhabdomyolysis . Being lipophilic , simvastatin diffuses nonselectively extrahepatic tissue muscle , lead high incidence myopathy among statin user . In addition , simvastatin attenuate exercise-induced increase cardiorespiratory fitness , reduce skeletal muscle mitochondrial content oxidative capacity human . Impaired cardiorespiratory fitness mitochondrial function possibly due reduction Coenzyme Q10 , component electron transport chain indispensable generation adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrion . Statins hydroxyl-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMA CoA ) reductase inhibitor interfere production mevalonic acid , precursor synthesis coenzyme Q10 . Mitochondrial dysfunction also report vitamin D deficient individual attribute intra-mitochondrial calcium deficiency deficient enzyme function oxidative pathway ( direct effect vitamin D enzyme gene protein expression ) . Thus , vitamin D may improve statin-mediated change cardiorespiratory fitness mitochondrial function improve enzymatic machinery involve oxidative phosphorylation block statin .

	<detailed_description>Statins , class hydroxyl methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , commonly prescribed patient metabolic syndrome multiple cardiovascular disease risk factor lifestyle change fail achieve LDL target reduce risk coronary heart disease morbidity mortality . American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) recommend moderate intensity statin patient diabetes without additional CVD risk factor age &gt; 40.Statins widely prescribe combination exercise low risk cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality . Every 1millimole per liter reduction LDL associate 10-20 % reduction risk cardiovascular event all-cause mortality , every 1 Metabolic equivalent [ MET ] ( 3.5 milliliter oxygen per kilogram body weight per minute ) increase fitness associate 18 % reduction cardiovascular disease mortality 11-50 % reduction all-cause mortality.Statins generally safe , myotoxicity , include fatal rhabdomyolysis occur . Although severe muscle-related side effect occur &lt; 0.1 % statin user , less severe symptom , myalgia muscle cramp , occur 1-7 % user . The mechanisms mediating statin myopathy unclear , possibility include decrease sarcolemmal endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol , reduce production prenylated protein include mitochondrial electron transport protein coenzyme Q10 , reduce fat catabolism , increase myocellular concentration cholesterol plant sterol , failure repair damage skeletal muscle , vitamin D deficiency , inflammation . Increasingly , interest focus alter cellular energy use mitochondrial dysfunction , dysfunction activate pathway lead muscle atrophy . Although mechanisms poorly understood , statin ( simvastatin , atorvastatin , fluvastatin ) show reduce skeletal muscle mitochondrial content oxidative capacity human . Sirvent et al evaluate mitochondrial function calcium signal muscle patient treat statin , present muscle symptom , oxygraphy record calcium spark , respectively . Patients treat statin show impairment mitochondrial respiration involve mainly complex I respiratory chain altered frequency amplitude calcium spark . The muscle problem observe statin-treated patient appear thus related impairment mitochondrial function muscle calcium homeostasis . Mikus et al examined effect simvastatin change cardiorespiratory fitness skeletal muscle mitochondrial content response aerobic exercise training . The primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness skeletal muscle ( vastus lateralis ) mitochondrial content ( citrate synthase enzyme activity ) . Thirty-seven participant ( exercise plus statin ; n=18 ; exercise ; n=19 ) complete study . Cardiorespiratory fitness increase 10 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) response exercise training alone , blunt addition simvastatin result 1.5 % increase ( P &lt; 0.005 group time interaction ) . Similarly , skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity increase 13 % exercise group ( P &lt; 0.05 ) , decrease 4.5 % simvastatin plus exercise group ( P &lt; 0.05 ) Impaired cardiorespiratory fitness mitochondrial function possibly due reduction Coenzyme Q10 , component electron transport chain indispensable generation ATP oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrion . Statins hydroxyl-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMA CoA ) reductase inhibitor interfere production mevalonic acid , precursor synthesis coenzyme Q10 . Mitochondrial dysfunction also report vitamin D deficient individual attribute intra-mitochondrial calcium deficiency deficient enzyme function oxidative pathway ( direct effect vitamin D enzyme gene protein expression ) . Mukherjee et al conduct study chick raise 3 4 week either normal ( vitamin D supplement ) rachitogenic diet . The Ca2+ content serum , heart tissue heart mitochondria significantly decrease chick raise rachitogenic diet . In mitochondrion isolated calcium deficient heart , rate adenosine diphosphate induce state 3 respiration 2,4-Dinitrophenol uncoupled respiration significantly decreased.When vitamin D deficient chick orally dose vitamin D3 , serum calcium level state 3 respiration rate return normal indicating change reversible In longitudinal study , effect cholecalciferol therapy skeletal mitochondrial oxidative function vitamin D deficient subject use 31Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy examined.The phosphocreatine recovery half-time ( t1/2PCr ) significantly reduce cholecalciferol therapy subject indicate improvement maximal oxidative phosphorylation ( 34.44 ±8.18 sec 27.84 ±9.54 sec , P &lt; .001 ) . Thus , vitamin D may improve statin-mediated change cardiorespiratory fitness mitochondrial function improve enzymatic machinery involve oxidative phosphorylation block statin . Another propose mechanism interaction statin vitamin D inhibition CYP3A4 statins , display 25-hydroxylase activity vitro . Vitamin D deficiency lead 'preferential shunt ' CYP3A4 hydroxylation vitamin D , thus decrease availability CYP3A4 statin metabolism lead statin-induced toxicity . This study describe effect vitamin D supplementation simvastatin-mediated change exercise-mediated cardiorespiratory fitness skeletal muscle mitochondrial content adult type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
