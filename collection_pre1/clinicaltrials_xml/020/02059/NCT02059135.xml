	<detailed_description>Hospitalized PPE patient expectantly manage , initial assessment stabilization period , consider study . After informed consent obtain subject screen eligibility . Screening include obtain subject 's medical/obstetric history physical examination include assessment maternal fetal status . Blood sample hematology , clinical chemistry , biomarkers , coagulation , immunogenicity AT activity level draw . Urine collect baseline urinalysis , protein/creatinine ratio biomarkers . Eligible subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 ratio receive continuous infusion either ATryn placebo . Sampling AT activity perform immediately prior first dose study drug specify time thereafter . Subjects continue study drug maternal and/or fetal indication delivery necessitate cessation expectant management 34 0/7 week gestation . The average extension pregnancy standard care expectant management patient population approximately 7 day . It assume treatment ATryn provide additional increase gestational age 5-7 day compare standard care . Total duration study drug therefore estimate approximately 7 14 day average . Post treatment assessment mother perform hospital discharge approximately 4-6 week delivery neonate . Information neonate collect reach post-menstrual age ( PMA ) 36 week . If neonate reach 36 week PMA &lt; 28 day follow delivery , final neonatal follow-up visit do 4-6 week post-delivery visit . After primary study completion follow-up period , neonate total number day Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , day ventilator , day require supplemental oxygen ( FiO2 ≥21 % ) , neonate hospital discharge date whether neonate discharge hospital requirement supplemental home oxygen therapy collect help ass health care utilization . In addition , date death collect neonate expires hospital discharge . These data consider supplemental primary study data set .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Hospitalized female pregnant patient gestational age ≥23 0/7 week ≤30 0/7 week ( subject gestational age 23 0/7 23 6/7 standard intervention include antenatal steroid cesarean fetal indication must offer ) . Gestational age determination local practice use one follow three approach : Last menstrual period ( LMP ) date confirmatory ultrasound Ultrasound alone LMP reliable Known date conception set assisted reproductive technology 2 . At least 16 year age ( NOTE : different age restriction may apply per local regulation and/or ethical consideration ; subject local age consent may exclude discretion review Institutional Review Board [ IRB ] /IEC ) 3 . Recent diagnosis Preeclampsia Superimposed Preeclampsia define : • For Preeclampsia Gestational hypertension define record systolic blood pressure ( BP ) ≥140 mm Hg diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg 2 occasion least 4 hour apart ( since commencement medical intervention facility ) OR Severe gestational hypertension define systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg , confirm second assessment within short interval ( minute ) AND New onset following : Proteinuria define ≥0.3 g protein per 24 hour 1224 hour urine collection protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3 mg/mg* ( random sample collection period . ) Platelet count le 100,000/μL Serum creatinine concentration great 1.1 mg/dL absence renal disease Elevated liver transaminase ≥ twice upper limit normal Cerebral visual symptom For Superimposed preeclampsia : The start antihypertensive medication , increase dose currently administer antihypertensive medication add second antihypertensive medication 20 week pregnancy systolic BP ≥ 160 diastolic BP ≥ 105 patient previous history control hypertension 20 week pregnancy . AND New onset follow : proteinuria define ≥0.3 g protein per 24 hour 1224 hour urine collection protein/creatinine ratio ≥0.3 mg/mg ( random sample collection period ) Platelet count le 100,000/μL Serum creatinine concentration great 1.1 mg/dL absence renal disease Elevated liver transaminase ≥ twice upper limit normal Cerebral visual symptom 4 . In opinion investigator patient demonstrate sufficient clinical stability eligible expectant management 5 . The patient expect managed inpatient delivery 6 . Signed informed consent subject neonate 1 . Criteria would likely require immediate delivery fetus exclusionary present prior randomization : Refractory hypertension despite maximal medical intervention systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg Thrombocytopenia ( platelet ˂ 100/mm3 ) without Hemolysis elevate liver enzymes low platelet ( HELLP ) syndrome define defined Aspartate amino transferase ( AST ) ≥70 units/L , platelet ˂100/mm3 , evidence hemolysis blood film plus either Lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ≥600 IU/mL total bilirubin ≥1.2 mg/dL ) Oliguria ( ≤500 mL/24 hour ) evidence progressive renal insufficiency Serum creatinine concentration great 1.1 mg/dL Persistent visual disturbance Placental abruption Pulmonary edema Nonreassuring fetal heart rate trace Intractable headache unrelieved analgesia Intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain vomit If umbilical Doppler ultrasound perform , presence abnormal umbilical artery Doppler define absent reverse end diastolic flow Biophysical score ≤ 4/10 2 occasion Oligohydramnios ( deep vertical pocket le 2 x 2cm ultrasound ) Other maternal fetal condition would preclude expectant management 2 . Known lethal major fetal anomaly 3 . Recent ( within 12 month ) history maternal alcoholism drug dependence 4 . Diagnosis epilepsy 5 . Has need chronic therapy nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) include selective cyclooxygenase ( Cox ) 2 inhibitor , unwilling abstain use NSAIDs study treatment period ( low dose aspirin 81 mg/day less allowable ) 6 . Received within 72 hour requirement heparin ; low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin dalteparin ; fondaparinux ; antiplatelet agent clopidogrel , prasugrel , high dose aspirin ( &gt; 81 mg/day ) ; Direct Thrombin Inhibitors ( DTI ) dabigatran 7 . Preexisting renal disease , document prepregnancy pregnancy prior 20 week gestation ( prior diagnosis preeclampsia ) 24 hr urine ≥0.3 gm/24 hour , documented pregnancy , prior 20 week gestation ≥2+ dipstick ≥ 0.3 Protein Creatinine Ratio ( PCR ) , document pregnancy last available test prior 20 week gestation . In case conflict result dipstick , PCR , time urine collection test work episode proteinuria , time urine collection result would supersede result 8 . Multifetal pregnancy 9 .
