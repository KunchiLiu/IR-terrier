	<detailed_description>One common health care intervention healthcare set medication prescription . On individual population level , outpatient medication use potential improve health . Unfortunately , 25 % outpatient prescription associated adverse drug event ( ADEs ) . ADEs decrease patient health directly lead non-adherence , turn negative consequence . The investigator recently conduct pilot project feasibility potential utility information technology enable outreach program monitoring patient receive outpatient prescription test . This intervention involve use interactive voice response system program automatically call ambulatory care patient follow prescription . If system identify potential medication problem , pharmacist notify subsequently contact patient , modify therapy accordingly , inform physician necessary . The pilot project include 568 patient diverse illness two Canadian city ( Montreal Quebec City ) . The system successfully contact 477 patient ( 84 % ) . High level patient provider acceptability system determine 21 day interview . The program identify 56 125 ( 45 % ) ADEs 10 26 ( 30 % ) primary non compliance event . Very episodes ameliorable ADEs observe ADE severity could diminish appropriate management . The investigator feel result justify randomize control trial ass effectiveness intervention improve patient-centered outcome . To determine whether system reduces severity duration outpatient ADEs improve adherence medication care three 12 month , ambulatory care patient receive incident prescription one four condition ( hypertension , diabetes mellitus , depression , anxiety ) randomize intervention routine care . As exploratory analysis , impact intervention patient self efficacy health service use also examine . This study help define whether promise intervention improve patient health individual patient population health perspective . There wide scope potential application approach . This study provide important information guide future application beyond specific question ask protocol .</detailed_description>
