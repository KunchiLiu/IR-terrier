	<brief_summary>This clinical trial men woman whose lymphoma ( non-Hodgkin Hodgkin ) respond treatment return respond previous therapy , need stem cell transplant . The purpose study test safety effectiveness give drug Bendamustine , follow high dose chemotherapy , within two week prior stem cell transplant lymphoma achieve complete response salvage ( treatment use relapsed disease ) chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects Hodgkin 's Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma respond treatment disease return respond previous treatment , need stem cell transplant eligible pilot study . Thirty subject enrol , 15 subject assign autologous transplant cohort ( accord disease status eligibility ) 15 subject allogeneic transplant cohort ( accord disease status eligibility ) . Subjects undergo follow number screen procedure determine eligibility . All eligible subject receive bendamustine dose 200 mg/ m2/ day two day Days - 24 Day - 23 follow short break 10 - 14 day . Subjects receive condition regimen , BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine arabinoside , Melphalan ) alemtuzumab 6 day ( Day -6 Day -1 ) follow autologous allogeneic transplant . Subjects pathological confirm B-cell malignancy also receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 Days + 1 +8 post-transplant . Subjects T-cell lymphoma enrol study receive rituximab . After transplantation subject receive medication prevent graft v host disease supportive care prevent infection . To speed recovery stem cell , subject receive post-transplant filgrastim ( G-CSF ) . After discharge hospital , subject see regularly clinic exam assessment . All test consider standard care .</detailed_description>
