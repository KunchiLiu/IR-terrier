	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Endometrial Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity dasatinib patient recurrent persistent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal , endometrial clear cell carcinoma use objective tumor response ( complete partial ) : patient without loss BRG-associated factor 250a ( BAF250a ) expression patient loss BAF250a expression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine nature degree toxicity patient population treat regimen patient without loss BAF250a expression . II . To examine progression-free survival overall survival patient population receive dasatinib patient without loss BAF250a expression . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine agreement BAF250a immunohistochemistry AT rich interactive domain 1A ( SWI-like ) ( ARID1A ) mutation status use next generation sequence perform formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
