	<brief_title>Two-part Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Study LAS190792 Patients With Asthma COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study integrate Phase I protocol divide 2 part . Part one : single ascend dose study ( 6 LAS190792 dose level ) 16 male subject mild asthma . LAS190792 administer ( Genuair® inhaler ) supervision study centre , accord randomisation scheme . One dose level administer per week 2 3 week dose level safety pharmacokinetic data review . Part two : A 5-way , crossover , single dose study ( LAS190792 [ two dos ] , indacaterol , tiotropium placebo ) 40 male non-childbearing potential woman subject moderate severe COPD . Each treatment period separate washout period least 7 14 day . The aim ensure least 30 subject complete Part 2 study . The primary comparison bronchodilation LAS190792 dose placebo . Other treatment comparison ( indacaterol tiotropium v placebo LAS190792 v indacaterol tiotropium ) consider additional .</detailed_description>
