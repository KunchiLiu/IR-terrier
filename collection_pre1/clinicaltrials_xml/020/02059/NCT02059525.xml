The general aim observational cohort study thus quantify set target proteins high diagnostic potential diagnosis initial T. pallidum infection T. pallidum persistence .

This prospective observational cohort study HIV-positive patient new diagnosis syphilis infection conduct HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infections ( STI ) Clinic Institute Tropical Medicine , Antwerp ( ITM ) . 120 patient new diagnosis syphilis infection receive treatment syphilis ITM give inform consent , recruit ; base current rate syphilis diagnosis take approximately 18 month . Participants receive detail , standardized clinical assessment , fill brief behavioural questionnaire treat therapy syphilis accord stage disease . In addition routine test perform , consent participate study , serum analyzed number immunological marker . A control group recruit , consist 30 convenience select patient HIV infect evidence syphilis ( Rapid Plasma Reagin , T. pallidum antigenaemia , clinical evidence could suggestive syphilis infection ) attend HIV clinic regularly , see month one acute syphilis case consent take part study . The control group undergo investigation plan baseline visit . Noteworthy , hop result study also allow develop evaluate utility composite diagnostic rule diagnosis syphilis reinfection .</detailed_description>
