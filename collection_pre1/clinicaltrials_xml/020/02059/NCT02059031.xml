	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two new GSK1265744 sodium salt tablet formulation provide data selection one tablet formulation use Phase 3 . This single-center , randomize , two part , open-label , crossover study healthy adult subject . Part A randomized , open-label , 3-way balance cross-over design 24 subject assess oral bioavailability two GSK1265744 sodium salt tablet formulation relative current GSK1265744 sodium salt formulation use phase IIb study fast condition . Part A treatment period separate 14 day washout . After completion Part A , preliminary PK data analyze decision make base pre-specified criterion , formulation use conduct Part B. Fifteen subject participate Part A participate Part B receive select formulation moderate fat meal . All treatment administer single 30 mg dos GSK1265744 . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 10 - 14 day last dose study drug .</brief_summary>

A female subject eligible participate : nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy [ definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ] ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit per milliliter ( MIU/mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram ( pg ) /ml ( &lt; 147 picomole per liter [ pmol/L ] ) confirmatory ] ; childbearing potential negative pregnancy test determine serum urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing AND ; agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception final study visit ; OR samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 14 day postlast dose study medication . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 gram alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . A history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . The subject 's systolic blood pressure outside range 90140 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) , diastolic blood pressure outside range 4590 mmHg . History clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : exclusion criterion screen ECG ( single repeat allow eligibility determination ) Heart rate &lt; 45 &gt; 100 beat per minute male &lt; 50 &gt; 100 beat per minute female ; QRS duration &gt; 120 millisecond ( msec ) ; QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTc B ) &gt; 450 millisecond .

Any significant arrhythmia , opinion principal Investigator GSK Medical Monitor , interfere safety individual subject . Nonsustained ( &gt; =3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) sustain ventricular tachycardia . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
