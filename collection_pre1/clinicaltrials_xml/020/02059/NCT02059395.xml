	<brief_summary>Background : In cardiac arrest survival rate dramatically increase bystander present initiate Basic Life Support ( BLS ) . However , even though serious effort make , skill retention traditional time-based BLS course laypeople remain suboptimal . In contrast , mastery learning-based educational approach show efficacious might promise even layperson . Therefore investigator aim evaluate impact mastery learning-based BLS course skill retention BLS laypeople . Methods : Forty laypeople without previous BLS experience randomize traditional time-based BLS course group ( Control - TB group ) mastery learning-based group ( Intervention - ML group ) . Both group receive BLS train consist 6 successive station include diagnosis cardiac arrest , chest compression , ventilation , one-rescuer BLS , two-rescuer BLS AED use . In ML group , subject deliberately practice receive feedback station pre-set target level reach . Subjects allow proceed next station achieve require target level performance . In contrast , participant TB group teach 6 station two hour , accord standard American Heart Association BLS criterion . All subject assessment knowledge skill immediately teach ( immediate post-test ) four month ( retention post-test ) . Implications : Previous research show mastery learning-based education improve learner ' procedural skill performance . The investigator study determine impact mastery learning-based BLS course skill retention laypeople .</brief_summary>
