	<brief_summary>This study look effect add drug Palbociclib CAD ( Combined Androgen Deprivation ) therapy patient RB ( Retinoblastoma Protein ) positive hormone sensitive prostate cancer . The investigator hypothesize addition Palbociclib initial ADT ( Androgen Deprivation Therapy ) patient newly metastatic RB-positive prostate cancer may significantly increase efficacy ADT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Without Palbociclib RB-Positive Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo exam , test , procedure determine eligible participate . Subjects randomize one two group . Patients randomize Arm 1 - Patients receive LHRH agonist every 3 month . Patients also take 50 mg. bicalutamide mouth every day . Bicalutamide come tablet form . This arm broken period time call cycle , start cycle 1 cycle 2 , on.Each cycle 28 day long . If randomize Arm 2 - Patients receive LHRH agonist every 3 month . Patients also take 50 mg. bicalutamide mouth every day . Patients also take 125 mg. Ibrance® daily 21 day , stop take Ibrance® 7 day . Patients begin take Ibrance® 7 day . Patients keep repeat cycle every 28 day . When patient start first 28 day cycle cycle 1 , cycle 2 , . During cycle patient come routine research test procedures patient safety , see patient , research purpose . The researcher ask patient complete drug diary track bicalutamide Ibrance® administration . The total time study participation depend patient responds study medication . Patients may study short period time , week , long period time , year . Patients may continue study treatment one following : cancer progress ( get bad ) ; another illness condition develop prevents study participation ; unacceptable side effect occur ; drug delay 4 week ; patient withdraws consent ; study doctor think patient stop ; patient follow researcher 's instruction ; study cancel .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have pathologic diagnosis prostate cancer . Have hormonesensitive metastatic disease ( M1 ) evidence soft tissue and/or bony metastasis . Patients may either untreated newly diagnose metastatic disease ( preferred much possible ) start androgen deprivation therapy . Patients start androgen deprivation therapy treatment newly diagnose metastatic disease eligible long duration treatment less equal 2 week ( 14days ) prior registration . The start date androgen deprivation consider day patient first receive injection LHRH agonist/antagonist ( orchiectomy ) , date oral antiandrogen start . Patients must minimum PSA ( ProstateSpecific Antigen ) ≥ 5 ng/mL within 60 day registration prior initiation androgen deprivation patient start androgen deprivation therapy . Agree undergo biopsy least one metastatic site RB ( Retinoblastoma Protein ) status evaluation . Adequate metastatic tissue prior biopsy/resection use available lieu biopsy . ECOG performance status 02 ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score system use quantify general wellbeing activity daily life ; score range 0 5 0 represent perfect health 5 represent death ) . Patients may receive prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy , nonmetastatic disease must last 36 month . At least 12 month must elapse since completion androgen deprivation therapy neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting . Within 14 day prior registration patient must adequate organ marrow function : White Blood Cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3,000/μl , Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/μl , Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/μl , Serum Creatinine ≥1.5 x institutional upper limit normal correct creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mg/ml/hr/1.73 m2 BSA ( Body Surface Area ) , Bilirubin within institutional limit normal , AST ( Aspartate Aminotransferase ) ≤ 2 x upper limit normal , ALT ( Alanine Aminotransferase ) ≤ 2 x upper limit normal . Patients must able take oral medication without crush , dissolve chew tablet . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy surgery . However , least 14 day must elapse since completion radiation therapy surgery patient must grade 2 less adverse effect time registration . Patients must agree use highly effective contraception treatment period 90 day end treatment PD 0332991 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document approve institutional review board . Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy great 14 day ( LHRHagonist antagonist ) treatment newly diagnose metastatic disease prior enrollment eligible study . Patients currently treat strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , amprenavir , fosamprenavir , indinavir , itraconazole , ketoconazole , lopinavir , mibefradil , miconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , posaconazole , ritonavir , saquinavir , telaprevir , telithromycin , verapamil , voriconazole , grapefruit ) strong inducer ( e.g. , carbamazepine , felbamate , nevirapine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , primidone , rifabutin , rifampin , rifapentine St. John 's wort ) must either discontinue drug ineligible . Patients must refrain use proton pump inhibitor . If need , alternative antacid therapy may use include H2receptor antagonist , locally act antacid . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer eligible . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider without evidence disease 1 year . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible .</criteria>
