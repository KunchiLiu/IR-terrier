	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) important identifiable cause hypertension . Previous study suggest OSA significantly increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality , especially patient pre-existing cardiovascular disease.The standardize treatment moderate/severe OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Most short-term trial indicate CPAP treatment reduce BP patient OSA . But relevant study relative short duration one year . In opinion , sufficient detect real effect CPAP reduction BP . Besides , impact OSA metabolic disorder still unclear.We hypothesize long-term CPAP treatment could reduce blood pressure improve metabolic disorder patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) OSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder characterize repetitive partial ( hypopnea ) complete ( apnea ) occlusion upper airway sleep cause collapse pharyngeal airway , result sleep fragmentation oxyhemoglobin desaturation . Kiely colleague 's study show 20 % hypertensive patient exhibit OSA , whereas prevalence hypertension set OSA exceed 50 % . One study confirm OSA important identifiable cause hypertension . OSA consider one common risk factor resistant hypertension . Previous study suggest OSA significantly increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality , especially patient pre-existing cardiovascular disease . Several study confirm CPAP reduce systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) patient OSA . Additionally , paper report protective effect CPAP therapy death cardiovascular disease patient severe OSA . Other research regard antihypertensive effect CPAP therapy , however , show CPAP antihypertensive effect . But relevant study relative short duration one year . In opinion , sufficient detect real effect CPAP reduction BP . According knowledge , report long-term effect CPAP BP hypertensive patient coronary revascularization ( CRV ) OSA conventional antihypertensive medication . Therefore , conduct long-term , prospective control study investigate effect CPAP BP , metabolic disorder , clinical symptom , cardiovascular cerebrovascular event patient CHD OSA conventional treatment .</detailed_description>
