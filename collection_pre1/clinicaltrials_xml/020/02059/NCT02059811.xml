Fortunately , lower blood pressure recommend treatment target slow progression CKD , also improve cardiovascular outcome . Controlling hypertension patient population , however , quite challenge . A lifestyle modification effectively reduce blood pressure pre-hypertensive hypertensive adult Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet . The purpose pilot study ( 1 ) determine extent DASH diet lower blood pressure hypertensive adult moderate chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( estimate glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2 ) ( 2 ) establish DASH diet safely consume patient population .</brief_summary>
