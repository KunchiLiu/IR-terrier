These patient approach invited discuss participation project . The potential participant give full information study invite consider whether wish participate . Design This study independent group , repeat measure design . Two group assess different time point . Group 1 receive 8 week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) Group 2 receive 8 week Relaxation Training ( RT ; active control ) . All participant assess five main time-points : - 8 week pre-treatment , - The start treatment - The end treatment - 1 month follow-up - 6 month follow-up The primary outcome measure tinnitus complaint , secondary outcome measure take psychological distress tinnitus loudness , tinnitus acceptance everyday mindfulness . Measures : A number Questionnaire measure Visual Analogue Scale use assess tinnitus complaint , psychological well-being mindfulness . Participants evaluate measure initial assessment ( 8 week pre-treatment ) , treatment commencement , end treatment 1and 6 month follow-up . Statistical Analyses The primary outcome change tinnitus complaint measure Tinnitus Questionnaire pre-treatment post-treatment . This assessed use t-tests . Further statistical exploration use t-tests ass change initial assessment end 8-week waiting period , assess change maintenance change end treatment 1and 6 month follow-up point . The type analysis do measure psychological well-being . To assess difference outcome MBCT RT group , series repeated-measures ( 2x2 ) ( Group 1 - Group 2 x pre-treatment - post-treatment ) ANOVAS carry . This allow assessment group effect interaction effect group time . A number correlation also perform assess relationship psychological distress pre-treatment tinnitus outcome within group . Correlation also perform assess relationship change tinnitus complaint tinnitus acceptance everyday mindfulness . They also perform assess relationship change psychological distress everyday mindfulness . Chi-square analysis carry measure tinnitus complaint CORE-OM score pre- post-treatment ass number patient within group demonstrate clinically significant change . A clinically significant change tinnitus complaint define change least 10 point reduction TQ . A clinically significant change psychological well-being define reduction least 0.5 total mean CORE-OM score . Correlations perform assess possible association patient characteristic , attendance , amount home practice various outcome . Weekly measure mindfulness use explore temporal sequence change . Methodology : All participant assess use measure describe 2 week period . They randomly assign one two group : Group 1 treat use 8 week course Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) . Group 2 treat use 8 week course Relaxation Training ( RT ) .This randomization carry member staff Ear Institute , independent clinical part trial . He use computer programme complete randomization . After assessment , patient enter 'waiting ' stage trial , receive intervention eight week . Four week wait time , patient send letter confirm date time specific group take place . On eighth week , participant attend first group session . At point , prior commencement group , complete measure describe second time . All participant attend 8 consecutive week group treatment . Throughout treatment period , end session , participant complete two brief measure ( MAAS TAQ ) . This important allow temporal sequence change assess , offer opportunity explore potential mediation effect mindfulness . At end eighth week , ask complete measure third time . All participant invite attend two session - 1 6 month treatment completion . At start session participant ask complete measure describe fourth fifth time . These session also provide ongoing support participant provide opportunity discus group finish . Thus MBCT compare active control condition ( RT ) passive control condition ( wait list control ) , RT also compare passive wait-list control condition .</detailed_description>
