	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish whether Bimatoprost eye drop effective reduce proptosis inactive thyroid eye disease ( TED ) patient improve quality life patient TED . Current standard NHS treatment/care inactive TED artificial tear ( use placebo study ) surgery appropriate . The IMP Bimatoprost eye drop PGF2Î± ( 0.03 % ) . This already license eye drop usually use glaucoma . Therefore current trial 's indication outside licenced indication . The Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) use accord licenced dosage form . This first time Bimatoprost use treatment TED</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostaglandin F2-alpha Eye Drops Thyroid Eye Disease ( Bima Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid eye disease ( TED ) chronic disfigure debilitate disease eye lead sight loss severe case . Patients TED frequently characteristic eyeball protrusion ( proptosis ) due increase fat accumulation behind eye . The discomfort change appearance eye source severe psychological distress impair quality life many patient . Current treatment TED unsatisfactory establish non-surgical therapy specifically reduce proptosis lacking . Reduced eyelid protrusion recently report side-effect use prostaglandin analogue eye drop ( e.g . Bimatoprost ( PGF2-alpha ) ) routine treatment glaucoma laboratory data show inhibition fat cell Bimatoprost . Hence PGF2-alpha eye drop potentially represent simple , non-invasive low toxicity topical alternative surgery TED . However clinical trial Bimatoprost conduct TED date . The objective study determine whether Bimatoprost eye drop effective reduce proptosis thus improve quality life patient TED . Trial participant recruit TED clinic University Hospital Wales . The clinic regional referral centre treatment study TED run multidisciplinary team ophthalmologist , endocrinologist , orthoptist expertise TED . Following informed consent , participant randomise receive Bimatoprost placebo eye drop three month undergo two month drug washout period switch opposite treatment final three month study . The primary endpoint change standardise measurement proptosis secondary endpoint include change quality life score . This study provide evidence novel application bimatoprost patient TED .</detailed_description>
