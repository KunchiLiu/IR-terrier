There compel evidence poor response inhibition core cognitive feature OCD related disorder , effective intervention exist directly attempts address problematic cognitive deficiency . This study examine feasibility clinical utility computerize cognitive training program design improve response inhibition among individual diagnose OCD trichotillomania.This training program offer systematic practice response inhibition form 40-level computer game . Individuals condition randomize either 8 session ( ) computerize response inhibition training ( RIT ) ( b ) placebo computer training ( PLT ) . We hypothesize RIT outperform PLT improve response inhibition capability reduce relevant clinical symptom . In sum , project expect generate important knowledge guide development effective computer-based treatment approach may help reduce critical problem exist treatment suboptimal patient retention treatment under-utilization , thereby improve overall treatment response rate among individual suffer OCD related condition .</brief_summary>
