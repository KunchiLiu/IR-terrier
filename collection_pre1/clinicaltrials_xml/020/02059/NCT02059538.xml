	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease represent huge medico-economic issue support public health policy . It link high prevalence disease also associate cost encounter . Therefore , seem rather urgent create validate tool predict evolution group disease order well take care patient enter chronic stage induce increase cost socioeconomic medical burden . It well acknowledge gut microbiota modify metabolic disease type-2 diabetes also inflammatory disease . However , gut microbiota still insufficiently explore cardiovascular disease , although could represent useful , non-invasive practical tool daily care patient . Investigators aim deepen knowledge characterization gut microbiota patient go metabolic disease metabolic syndrome , obesity type 2 diabetes ( risk factor cardiovascular disease ) overt coronary artery disease ( first event end stage heart failure ) . Investigators use system medicine approach whose aim integrate numerous data come different technology ( include environment , transcriptomics , metabolomics , metagenomics , lipidomics bioinformatics ) . These integrate approach need translate basic science finding clinical practice benefit patient . Investigators aim uncover new microbial signature could help diagnose and/or predict natural evolution cardiometabolic diseases response treatment . Investigators aim go forward personalized medicine . Patients approach enrolment hospitalization 3 center 24-month enrolment phase ( WP3 ) . Once informed consent complete , patient assess CMD phenotype include clinical examination , environmental food habit evaluation , blood urine feces sample . In group patient , sub-sample 30 50 subject include one advance phenotyping item . This include whole body composition absorptiometry ( DXA ) , abdominal visceral fat tomodensitometry , Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) ( glucose , insulin , incretins ) , subcutaneous fat biopsy , cardiac echocardiography , intima medium thickness , pulse wave velocity . For obese patient undergo bariatric surgery : liver subcutaneous omental adipose tissue biopsy obtain surgery . This group patient follow 3 , 6 12 month surgery examination mention .</detailed_description>
