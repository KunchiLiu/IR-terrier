	<detailed_description>Survivors critical illness know poor quality life . Specifically , post-discharge insomnia symptom common significantly associate physical quality life impairment among six-month acute lung injury ( ALI ) survivor , even adjustment post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) depression symptom . Further study need validate result characterize sleep disturbance ALI use sleep-specific metric . Chronic insomnia impact 1 10 adult link accident , decrease quality life , diminish work productivity , increase long-term risk medical psychiatric disease diabetes depression .

Methods improve sleep vitality may decrease effect inadequate sleep prevent diseases death due accident . Moreover , sleep , lack thereof , may reflection global stress , disease severity , reveals much patient ' overall well-being could associate hospital readmission . Cognitive-behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBT-I ) currently consider gold-standard treatment insomnia .

Such complementary alternative treatment previously suggest improve well-being vitality human study . We know well-being vitality facilitate sleep sleep deprivation associate reduce well-being vitality . Moreover , recently show Johrei therapy improve sleep murine sleep deprivation model . Whether Johrei therapy achieve improved sense well-being facilitation sleep survivor critical illness unknown . Specifically , whether Johrei therapy comparable CBT-I management sleep problem survivor critical illness largely unknown . The propose study address knowledge gap . If Johrei treatment improve sleep survivor critical illness , patient reduce vitality due insufficient sleep ( majority US population ) , insomnia , disrupt sleep ( sleep apnea ) may also benefit treatment . Insomnia subject , good sleeper , show high level pro-inflammatory cytokine associate increase risk heart disease even mortality . Whether improvement sleep CBT-I Johrei therapy mediate reduction stress pro-inflammatory cytokine level unknown . The investigator study address knowledge gap measure circulating level cytokines patient receive Johrei therapy CBT-I . Also , recent study show urinary level neurotransmitter may increase ( catecholamine epinephrine , norepinephrine , Æ”-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) ) decrease ( Taurine ) subject sleep disturbance . Whether CBT-I practice aim promote sleep normalize urinary change neurotransmitter largely unknown . A. JT arm : Johrei treatment administer subject University Arizona patient 's residence 3 session per week last 30 minute . Two session combine one day 1 hour interval yield two visit per week . A total 18 session administer 6 week participation . Therapy administer senior Johrei administrator receive training Reimei Kyokai Kyoto , Japan . The Johrei administer per principle Johrei . Before therapy , therapist wash hand pray 1 minute face subject distance . The Johrei therapy administer without require physical contact placement therapist 's hand proximity subject ( 20 cm ) . Johrei therapy complementary alternative form therapy originate Japan , like Reiki therapy . Johrei therapy non-invasive bio-energy healing practice deliver outstretched hand Johrei practitioner ( http : //www.johrei-institute.org/aboutus.htm ) . Similar Reiki , Johrei nondenominational spiritual practice complementary alternative medical therapy channel purification energy human body palm practitioner without require physical touch . Such complementary alternative treatment previously suggest improve well-being vitality human study . We know well-being vitality facilitate sleep sleep deprivation associate reduce well-being vitality . Moreover , recently show Johrei therapy improve sleep murine sleep deprivation model . B. CBT-I arm : Cognitive Behavioral therapy Insomnia administer license trained clinical psychologist completion initial assessment nature subject sleep problem via HIPAA-compliant encrypt Vsee app subject 's iPAD .
