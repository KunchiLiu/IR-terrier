	<brief_title>Screen-and-treat Program Chronic Kidney Disease- High Risk Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . To evaluate whether automated CKD CDSS achieve low BP level , high rate BP control appropriate use ACE/ARB compare usual care , among person eGFRcreat &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m^2 primary care . Hypothesis 1a . The CKD CDSS result improve BP level BP control , compare usual care . Hypothesis 1b . Within CKD CDSS group , utilization ACE/ARB among person albuminuria increase follow-up . Aim 2 . To evaluate acceptability feasibility implement CDSS improve disease awareness stag primary care provider , compare usual care , among person eGFRcreat &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m^2 . Hypothesis 2a . The CKD CDSS result increase physician CKD awareness , stag appropriate test albuminuria , cystatin C CKD complication ( anemia , hyperphosphatemia , hyperparathyroidisim ) person reduce eGFRcreat . Hypothesis 2b . The CKD CDSS require low expenditure readily accept PCPs patient . Aim 3 . To evaluate whether CDSS PLUS pharmacist-led CKD management program improve BP level patient disease knowledge person higher-risk CKD , compare CDSS alone . Hypothesis 3a . The pharmacist-led CKD management strategy result low BP level higher rate appropriate use ACE/ARB , compare CDSS alone . Hypothesis 3b . The pharmacist-led BP management program acceptable PCPs , result high level patient CKD NSAID-avoidance knowledge compare CDSS alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The entire primary care medical practice SFVAMC consider . Randomization occur team ( nurse ) level . Within team , individual patient consider eligible chronic kidney disease screen protocol inclusion trial hypertension without concomitant diabetes , prior record diagnosis chronic kidney disease . Hypertension define systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg two encounter ( encounter ) within previous 3 year document diagnosis hypertension ( list problem list ICD9 code ) . Diagnosed chronic kidney disease define documentation chronic kidney disease problem list ICD9 code ongoing nephrology follow . We define diagnose chronic kidney disease without consideration estimate glomerular filtration rate creatinine albumincreatinineratio laboratory section medical record , since work group others show awareness recognition chronic kidney disease extremely low , even among person document reduce estimate glomerular filtration rate albuminuria . Persons require see physician least one time within past 18 month . Kidney transplant recipient , pregnant woman , individual estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 exclude study likely need specialty care uncontrolled hypertension . Persons age &gt; 80 exclude data aggressive blood pressure lower population less clear adverse effect associate aggressive blood pressure control well document . We exclude person New York Heart Association class III IV heart failure , know ejection fraction &lt; 25 % , document allergy AngiotensinConverting Enzyme/Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers . Other exclusion criterion relate require ability communicate provider provide informed consent : prevalent dementia , impaired cognition severe mental illness ; expect life expectancy &lt; 6 month ; severe visual impairment absence available caretaker read .</criteria>
