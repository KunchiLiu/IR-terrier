	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study imiquimod fluorouracil see well work compare observation treat patient high-grade anal squamous skin lesion human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -positive . Biological therapy , imiquimod , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether imiquimod fluorouracil effective observation treat high-grade anal squamous skin lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy intra-anal imiquimod 2.5 % treatment anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) compare observation . II . To assess efficacy intra-anal topical 5-fluorouracil ( fluorouracil ) 5 % treatment anal HSIL compare observation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability intra-anal imiquimod 2.5 % topical 5-fluorouracil 5 % . II . To compare efficacy intra-anal imiquimod 2.5 % topical 5-fluorouracil 5 % . III . To assess partial response intra-anal imiquimod 2.5 % topical 5-fluorouracil 5 % compare observation . IV . To evaluate effect intra-anal imiquimod 2.5 % topical 5-fluorouracil 5 % human papilloma virus ( HPV ) persistence . V. To evaluate anal HSIL outcome week 44 . VI . To evaluate effect behavioral pattern include tobacco smoke sexual activity treatment efficacy , tolerability HPV . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients apply imiquimod intra-anally daily ( QD ) 16 week . ARM B : Patients apply fluorouracil intra-anally twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive treatment . Patients still HSIL week 20 agree randomization may cross-over Arm A B . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 20 , 24 , 26 , 32 , 40 , 44 .</detailed_description>
