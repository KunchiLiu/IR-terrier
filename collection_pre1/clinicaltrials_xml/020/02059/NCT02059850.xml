	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best way give NY-ESO-1 specific T cell cyclophosphamide treat patient advanced synovial sarcoma myxoid/round cell liposarcoma . Placing gene create laboratory white blood cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving NY-ESO-1 specific T cell cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NY-ESO-1 Specific T Cells After Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Advanced Synovial Sarcoma Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To confirm safety efficacy cancer-testis antigen ( NY-ESO-1 ) specific T cell ( autologous NY-ESO-1-specific cluster differentiation [ CD ] 8-positive T lymphocyte ) patient advanced synovial sarcoma myxoid/round cell liposarcoma follow condition high dose cyclophosphamide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To confirm persistence NY-ESO-1 tetramer positive cell peripheral blood 10 week T cell infusion synovial sarcoma myxoid/round cell liposarcoma patient receive NY-ESO-1 specific T cell follow cyclophosphamide condition post-infusion interleukin ( IL ) -2 . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -3 -2 NY-ESO-1 specific T cell IV 60 minute day 0 . Patients may receive additional infusion discretion Principal Investigator ( PI ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
