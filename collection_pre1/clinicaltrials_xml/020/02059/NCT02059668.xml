	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary : Evaluation local-regional recurrence- free survival two year patient locally advanced head neck cancer receive definitive adjuvant radiochemotherapy . Secondary : Evaluation disease-free -survival , metastases-free overall survival two year , patient locally advanced head neck cancer . Outline : This multicenter observational study . The treatment base center specific standard care . The total dose 69 73 Gy ( definitive treatment ) 63 66 Gy ( adjuvant treatment ) , chemotherapy cisplatin- base . The aim analysis validate prognostic impact potential biomarkers loco-regional control . This lead definition risk group stratification patient help individualize radiotherapy prescription future trial .</detailed_description>
