	<brief_summary>The objective propose study evaluate new , molecular image direct , three-dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasound guide biopsy system human patient . The current biopsy use ultrasound image guidance . However , procedure use two-dimensional ( 2D ) ultrasound image sample error thus cancer miss standard 2D image-guided biopsy . In study , FDA-approved ultrasound device use obtain three-dimensional ( 3D ) image prostate commercially available ultrasound scanner . The clinician use 3D image guide biopsy , record core location biopsy site , perform re-biopsy site patient follow-up examination . This system also use image magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) fuse PET MR image 3D ultrasound image guide needle suspicious tumor target see MRI PET . We think fusion target biopsy technology help improve accuracy current systematic biopsy approach prostate cancer detection .</brief_summary>
