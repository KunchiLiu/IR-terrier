Secondary : 1 . In woman heterogeneous dense breast tissue , specificity MBI correctly classify subject without breast cancer non-inferior breast tomosynthesis . 2 . In woman heterogeneous dense breast tissue , area receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve MBI non-inferior superior breast tomosynthesis . 3 . Combining use MBI breast tomosynthesis provide performance superior either technology alone , manifest superior ROC curve area .</brief_summary>
