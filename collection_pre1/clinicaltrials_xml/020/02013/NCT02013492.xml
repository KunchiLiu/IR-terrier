	<brief_title>Propranolol Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility tolerability beta-adrenergic blockade patient metastatic locally advanced cancer . II . To determine effect beta-adrenergic blockade tumor microenvironment host immune system via series correlative laboratory study use cancer tumor tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell study patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect beta-adrenergic blockade progression-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 4 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
