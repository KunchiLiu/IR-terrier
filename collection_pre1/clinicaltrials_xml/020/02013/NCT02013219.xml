	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics intravenous ( IV ) dose MPDL3280A ( Atezolizumab ) combination oral erlotinib alectinib participant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This study two stage . In erlotinib group , combination treatment give participant epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) -treatment-naive , advance ( non-resectable ) NSCLC safety-evaluation stage participant previously untreated , EGFR mutation-positive , advanced NSCLC expansion stage ( Stage 2 ) . In alectinib group , safety-evaluation expansion stage ( Stages 1 2 ) , combination give treatment-naive participant anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) -positive advanced NSCLC . In Stage 1 , erlotinib give start dose 150 milligram ( mg ) daily ( QD ) start dose alectinib 600 mg twice daily ( BID ) , 28 consecutive day Cycle 1 21-day cycle thereafter . The start dose atezolizumab 1200 mg , administer every 3 week ( q3W ) start Day 8 Cycle 1 . If start regimen combination treatment tolerate , alternative dos and/or schedule erlotinib atezolizumab alectinib atezolizumab may test determine potential recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination treatment . In Stage 2 , potential RP2D schedule combination treatment investigated expansion cohort . For stage , continuation treatment beyond Cycle 1 discretion treat investigator . Study treatment discontinue participant experience disease progression unacceptable toxicity , compliant study protocol , , opinion opinion investigator , benefit study treatment . However , absence unacceptable toxicity , participant second-line great NSCLC still receive atezolizumab time radiographic disease progression may permit continue study treatment . Time study expect approximately 15 month .</brief_summary>
