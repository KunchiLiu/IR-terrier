	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anemia inherited form anemia , condition n't enough healthy red blood cell carry adequate oxygen throughout body . These patient increase risk death , stroke , frequent pain crisis , acute chest syndrome well chronic condition include : lung damage , retinopathy , kidney damage , leg ulcer , pulmonary hypertension . There 's cure people sickle cell anemia . However , treatment relieve pain help prevent co-morbid condition associate sickle cell anemia . Hydroxyurea FDA approve drug help alleviate symptom associate sickle cell disease . The mortality rate still high patient use hydroxyurea significant percentage patient still aggressive disease despite hydroxyurea treatment . Hydroxyurea therapy also seem prevent development many complication sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension . Historically , stem cell transplantation sickle cell disease mainly do pediatric population . The option limit adult sickle cell disease aggressive disease despite hydroxyurea . Most rely chronic red blood cell transfusion carry significant risk infection , iron overload , alloimmunization . Alloimmunization refers production antibody occur 50 % patient sickle cell disease chronic transfusion therapy make transfusion difficult high potential hemolytic transfusion reaction . Recently use non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation regimen ( rely immunotherapy instead chemotherapy ) sickle cell disease adult show 88 % engraftment rate ( 30 34 patient ) GVHD 0 % mortality . However , transplant use fully HLA-matched sibling , unavailable approximately 14-28 % patient could benefit transplant UIC . A recent study Johns Hopkins carry similar haploidentical ( half match ) transplant 14 sickle cell patient lack fully HLA-matched donor . Approximately two year follow transplant , 57 % patient successfully engraft ( 8 14 patient ) . There deaths one episode acute GVHD skin resolve without therapy . The investigator plan offer stem cell transplantation sickle cell patient aggressive disease partially match HLA sibling donor . Haploidentical transplant consider patient standard option available would normally treat supportive ( palliative ) care give option participate clinical trial . Donors HLA-haploidentical source hematopoietic stem cell . Potential donor include relative ( e.g . parent , offspring , sibling , cousin , aunts/uncles , grandparent ) . The related donor stem cell transplantation use alemtuzumab/TBI platform show safe strategy cure severe sickle cell disease . However , due lack suitable donor , many patient benefit strategy . Alternative donor source desperately need fill gap . Nearly patient haploidentical family member would able donate . The use post transplantation cyclophosphamide greatly improve outcome haploidentical stem cell transplantation . The investigator propose combine alemtuzumab/TBI conditioning . The investigational component study combination Alemtuzumab ( immunotherapy ) Total Body Irradiation condition regimen HLA Haploidentical Transplant post-transplant Cyclophosphamide . Investigators plan study engraftment rate ( transplant success rate ) Day 60 sickle cell patient undergo HLA haploidentical stem cell transplant post transplant high dose cyclophosphamide .</detailed_description>
