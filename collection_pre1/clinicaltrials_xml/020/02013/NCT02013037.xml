	<brief_summary>All individual receive heart transplant risk develop antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) . An antibody protein produce body 's immune system detect foreign substance , call antigen . The mechanism antibody attack antigen . In antibody mediated rejection , antibodies attack transplanted heart , cause injury heart . The purpose investigation determine study drug , call Eculizumab ( Soliris ) , prevent antibody-mediated rejection patient high antibody production prolongs long-term cardiac transplant survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The De-novo Use Eculizumab Presensitized Patients Receiving Cardiac Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The grow proportion sensitize cardiac recipient present additional challenge transplant practitioner attempt minimize occurrence antibody mediate rejection ( AMR ) . Patients pre-exposed `` sensitize '' antigen expose event ( i.e . : blood transfusion , multiple pregnancy , prior organ transplantation , ventricular support device ) likely posse preform develop de-novo antibody . Sensitized patient panel reactive antibody &gt; 25 % risk increase mortality heart transplantation . A central component antibody-mediated cell injury complement activation . The inhibition terminal complement activation may miss link decrease possibly complement-mediated AMR cellular rejection ( CR ) inhibit inflammatory effect circulate antibody cytokine induce cell death . Eculizumab monoclonal antibody specifically bind complement protein C5 high affinity , thereby inhibit cleavage C5a C5b prevent generation terminal complement complex C5b-9 . By mechanism , Eculizumab ( Soliris® ) inhibit terminal complement mediate intravascular hemolysis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patient . This study non-randomized , open-label , investigator-initiated safety efficacy trial investigate de-novo use Eculizumab alongside conventional therapy prevent antibody mediate rejection . The duration study include open enrollment period least 12 month follow-up ( post-transplant ) . The trial enroll total 10 `` sensitize '' patient panel reactive antibody score great 70 % , previously currently enrol another ongoing trial . The use Eculizumab un-blinded study research practitioner participant . A historical cohort 10 additional patient also utilized comparison .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient ≥ 18 year age . Patient panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) ≥ 70 % time prior screening . Patient consider compliant intend available minimum followup study period 1 year . Patient must vaccinate Neisseria meningitides least 2 week prior receive treatment therapy . Voluntary write informed consent must obtain performance studyrelated procedure consider routine medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use two acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study 2 month last dose study medication . Donor recipient age &lt; 18 year &gt; 75 year . Cold ischemia time &gt; 6 hour . Current clinical , radiographic , laboratory evidence active latent tuberculosis ( TB ) , determine local standard care . History active TB within last 2 year , even treat . History active TB great 2 year ago , unless documentation adequate treatment accord locally accept clinical practice . ( Note : Patients risk TB reactivation preclude administration conventional immunosuppression , determine study investigator base upon appropriate evaluation ) . Receipt desensitization treatment rituximab le 2 week prior therapy cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) count &gt; 2 % . Receipt live vaccine within 4 week prior study entry . Patients current recent severe systemic infection within 2 week prior transplantation . Prior history splenectomy .</criteria>
