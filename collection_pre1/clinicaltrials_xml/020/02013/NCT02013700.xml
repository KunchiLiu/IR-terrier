	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) progressive debilitate lung disease characterize interstitial fibrosis decrease lung volume pulmonary insufficiency eventually result death . Patients Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) typically present complaint sub acutely progressive dyspnea non-productive cough , often accompanied digital clubbing . Due insidious onset symptom , however , patient diagnose late stage disease significant fibrosis occur . Physical exam characterize hypoxemia , `` dry '' inspiratory crackle auscultation , occasional digital clubbing ( 6 ) . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology progressive decline force vital capacity ( FVC ) , diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) six-minute walk distance . Diagnosis establish pathologic find usual interstitial pneumonia ( sub epithelial fibroblastic focus ) open lung biopsy ( 7 ) , and/or high resolution CT ( HRCT ) demonstrate characteristic finding peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular change fibrosis , honeycombing , traction bronchiectasis ( 8 , 9 ) . The prognosis patient Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) uniformly poor . The natural history disease characterize inexorable progressive decline intersperse `` exacerbation '' period accelerate disease often fatal ( 5 ) . There FDA approve treatment option patient Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) thus standard care . In case patient age 60 limited comorbid disease , lung transplant may offer . Patients Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) receive empiric treatment , supportive care alone , recently , offer enrollment clinical trial . The pathogenesis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) characterize epithelial cell injury activation interstitial inflammation , fibroblast proliferation extracellular matrix collagen deposition , eventual loss function . Because mesenchymal stem cell know home site injury , inhibit inflammation , contribute epithelial tissue repair , use suggest novel therapy treatment Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) .</detailed_description>
