	<detailed_description>Thirty ( 30 ) patient chronic ischemic leave ventricular dysfunction secondary MI schedule undergo cardiac catheterization enrol study.This phase II study intend gain additional safety efficacy assessment among two dose level previously study phase I set . In study , 20 million total hMSC dose 100 million total hMSC dose randomly allocate administer via Biocardia Helical infusion system blind manner . The technique transplant progenitor cell region damage myocardium , term cellular cardiomyoplasty , potentially new therapeutic modality design replace repair necrotic , scar , dysfunctional myocardium . Ideally , graft cell readily available , easy culture ensure adequate quantity transplantation , able survive host myocardium , often hostile environment limit blood supply immunorejection . Whether effective cellular regenerative strategy require administered cell differentiate adult cardiomyocytes couple electromechanically surround myocardium increasingly controversial recent evidence suggest may require effective cardiac repair . Most importantly , transplantation graft cell improve cardiac function prevent adverse ventricular remodel . To date , number candidate cell transplant experimental model , include fetal neonatal cardiomyocytes , embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes , tissue engineer contractile grafts9 , skeletal myoblasts , several cell type derive adult bone marrow , cardiac precursor reside within heart . There substantial clinical development use whole bone marrow skeletal myoblast preparation study enrol post-infarction patient patient chronic ischemic leave ventricular dysfunction heart failure . The effect bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) also study clinically . Currently , bone marrow bone marrow-derived cell represent highly promising modality cardiac repair . The totality evidence trial investigate autologous whole bone marrow infusion patient follow myocardial infarction support safety approach . In term efficacy , increase ejection fraction report majority trial . Chronic ischemic leave ventricular dysfunction common problematic condition ; definitive therapy form heart transplantation available tiny minority eligible patient . Cellular cardiomyoplasty chronic heart failure study less acute MI , represent potentially important alternative disease .</detailed_description>
