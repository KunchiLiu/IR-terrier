	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety immunogenicity MTBVAC potential substitute BCG vaccination . BCG vaccination indeed demonstrate major limitation induce protection tuberculosis ( TB ) . Novel vaccines essential fight current world epidemic tuberculosis resistance anti-TB drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity MTBVAC Vaccine Comparison With BCG Vaccine .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized , double-blind , controlled Phase I study conduct CHUV , Lausanne , Switzerland , compare MTBVAC license BCG healthy , PPD-negative adult male female volunteer . The study involve random allocation 36 subject ( 4 vaccine group 9 volunteer fulfil inclusion criterion ) MTBVAC ( test three separate dos ) standard dose BCG ( 3 verum : 1control basis ) dose-escalation manner one three cohort . Each cohort include 9 subject set receive MTBVAC low dose 5x10E03 , MTBVAC intermediate dose 5x10E04 , high dose 5x10E05 colony form unit ( CFU ) 0.1 mL 3 subject set receive standard dose BCG ( 5x10E05 CFU 0.1 mL ) . A single intradermal injection give non-dominant arm volunteer start low MTBVAC dose . Each MTBVAC vaccine dose administer staggered cohort , start cohort low MTBVAC dose level . After least 35 day follow-up within cohort safety review evaluation Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board provide go/no-go vaccination subsequent cohort safety issue define preset stopping rule .</detailed_description>
