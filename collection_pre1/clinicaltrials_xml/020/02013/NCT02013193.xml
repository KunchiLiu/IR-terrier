	<brief_summary>The primary objective study prove superior performance Ranger™ paclitaxel-coated PTA balloon catheter angioplasty femoropopliteal artery lesion compare non-coated balloon six month post-procedure compare Late Lumen Loss ( LLL ) . Study statistical hypothesis : The % -mean loss luminal diameter assess angiography six month follow-up treatment femoropopliteal artery Ranger DCB study device low % -mean loss luminal diameter treatment uncoated PTA balloon control device .</brief_summary>
