	<brief_summary>A small proportion patient lung cancer present solitary pulmonary nodule ( SPN ) . This important group patient lung cancer , presentation SPN represent early disease , follow surgery high 5 year survival rate . However SPNs lung cancer would unethical biopsy every case . Clinical guideline recommend SPNs undergo initial ( FDG ) -PET/CT scan , may give information SPN may indicate likely lung cancer . However many case current practice monitor SPN series CT scan 2 year look change growth may/ always indicate lung cancer . If change observe 2 year SPN consider lung cancer . This expensive National Health Service ( NHS ) worry patient term monitor CT cost delay treatment due length time diagnosis . This study examine diagnostic capacity use different CT scan . Dynamic Contrast Enhanced -CT ( DCE-CT ) . DCE-CT FDG-PET/CT scan give different information SPN investigator look see information either scan combine information scan may better diagnosis early stage lung cancer . The investigator also undertake review previous study use scan use data review trial look cost effectiveness use DCE-CT diagnosis SPN . The trial recruit 375 people SPN detect normal CT scan require FDG-PET/CT scan . In addition receive DCE-CT scan either day within three week FDG-PET/CT scan . This extra procedure take place normal NHS care , however collect clinical outcome data next two year . The study coordinate Southampton University clinical trial unit . Recruitment January 2013 - April 2016 , 14 UK site . Data analysis conclusion expect end 2018 . The study fund NIHR-HTA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Indication : Lung Cancer Primary Objectives : - To determine high precision , diagnostic performance DCE-CT 18FDG-PET/CT NHS characterisation solitary pulmonary nodule ( SPNs ) . - To use decision analytic modelling ass likely cost health outcome result incorporation DCE-CT management strategy patient SPNs . Secondary Objectives : - To assess , within NHS setting , incremental value incorporate CT appearance SPN interpretation integrate PET/CT examination . - To assess whether combine DCE-CT 18FDG-PET/CT accurate and/or cost-effective , characterisation SPNs , either test use alone series . - To document nature incidence incidental extra-thoracic finding 18FDG-PET/CT undertaken characterisation SPNs model impact cost-effectiveness . Rationale : A small proportion patient lung cancer present solitary pulmonary nodule ( SPN ) diagnostic imaging test . This important group patient presentation SPN represent early disease high 5 year survival rate follow surgical resection . However , SPNs due lung cancer accurate characterisation SPNs diagnosis early stage lung cancer diagnostic challenge significant associate health cost . Widely adopt clinical guideline subsequent investigation SPNs recommend serial CT scan look subsequent growth biopsy confirm diagnosis . UK , National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guideline recommend 18FDG-PET assessment SPN case biopsy possible failed . DCE-CT 18FDG-PET scan give different information SPN . Information either scan combine information scan may better diagnosis early stage lung cancer . Trial Design : Prospective Observational Sample size : 375 Non-CTIMP : Non interventional trial Concomitant Therapy : As per local practice Primary Trial Endpoints : Primary outcome measure include diagnostic test characteristic ( sensitivity , specificity , accuracy ) 18FDG-PET/CT DCE-CT relation subsequent clinical diagnosis lung cancer . The outcome measure use economic model include accuracy , estimate life expectancy , quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) . Costs estimate NHS perspective . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compare management strategy DCE-CT strategy without DCE-CT . Secondary Trial Endpoints : Secondary outcome measure include diagnostic test characteristic 18FDG-PET/CT incorporation CT appearance combine DCE-CT/18FDG-PET . The incidence incidental extra-thoracic finding 18FDG-PET/CT , subsequent investigation cost also determine . Total Number Sites : 14</detailed_description>
