	<criteria>Males nonpregnant , nonlactating female least 18 year old . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis SCCHN ( Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ) . Stage IVC ( metastatic ) advance , locally recurrent SCCHN amenable curative surgery radiotherapy . Measurable disease define RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) vs 1.1 ( Appendix 1 ) . . If site measurable disease study within prior field irradiation , sum long diameter ( SLD ) lesion must increase least 20 % prior treatment nadir . ECOG Performance status ( measure health general well scale 0 5 0 represent perfect health ) &lt; 1 ( Appendix 2 ) . Expected survival least 3 month . Adequate liver renal function define Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min ( Jelliffe calculator ) AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ) /ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ) &lt; 2.5 X ULN ( unless hepatic metastasis , case AST/ALT within 5 X ULN ) Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN ( Appendix 5 ) . Ability understand willingness sign inform consent form . Willingness ability comply study procedure follow . There restriction number prior therapy long patient deem candidate palliative chemotherapy one standard chemotherapy regimen . Willingness use contraception method deem effective Investigator male female patient childbearing potential partner throughout treatment period least 30 day follow last cycle chemotherapy ( post menopausal woman must amenorrheal atleast 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Comorbidities preclude treatment combination chemotherapy per investigator discretion . Pregnancy lactation . Medical psychiatric illness may compromise patient 's ability tolerate treatment comply study requirement . Patients another active cancer history another cancer last 3 year except treated curative intent skin cancer ( melanoma ) , situ breast situ cervical cancer treat curative intent cancer evidence disease 2 year . Allergy PPI inability tolerate PPI . Patients reside prison . Any investigational drug dose within 28 day plan start trial . Any concurrent standard therapy intend treat SCCHN . Any symptomatic infection ( bacterial , fungal viral ) per investigator discretion . Patients uncontrolled CNS ( Central Nervous System ) metastases exclude . Patients know , previously treat CNS metastasis eligible neurologically stable per investigate physician 's clinical assessment . Any condition circumstance would , opinion Investigator , make patient unsuitable participation study . Patients Rilpivirine , Atazanavir , Indinavir Nelfinavir eligible participation study significant drug interaction unless patient switch different antiviral medication prior study enrollment . Omeprazole increase serum concentration methotrexate , clorazepate citalopram increase risk adverse effect . Omeprazole may result reduction clinical efficacy clopidogrel increase risk thrombosis . Omeprazole coadministered dasatinib , bosutinib , ponatinib , erlotinib , dabrafenib vismodegib reduces systemic exposure drug , therefore patient drug enrol study .</criteria>
