	<brief_summary>Purpose The Study : The purpose study follow : A ) To gather age-related normative visual acuity data Vimetrics Central Vision Analyzer ( CVA , Vimetrics , LLC , Media , Pa ) B ) To gather visual acuity data patient know ocular problem , include cataract maculopathy . C ) To correlate compare CVA visual acuity finding acuity measure standard LogMAR acuity chart view similar condition contrast lighting</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vision Measured Vimetrics CVA Compared With Chart Testing Under Similar Luminance Contrast Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement visual acuity involve determination small high contrast target resolve patient . Classically , approach use letter style optotypes , successively small stroke gap resolution . More recently , arrangement letter chart redesign logarithmic scale attention pay uniformity effect crowd choice optotype . The resultant Ferris-Bailey-Lovie chart become standard acuity testing , especially clinical research . The letter acuity chart 0.1 logMAR step progression ( 1.26 X ) line 5 letter per line . It note logMAR chart could great resolution finer step line improve repeatability convert letter-by-letter scoring system . While advance improve resolution reliability acuity measure , require relatively cumbersome wall chart provide advantage interactive program would enable threshold approached stimulus presentation see well non-seeing side . The Vimetrics CVA interactive computer device measure threshold visual acuity present Landolt-C gap randomly tumble one 4 position patient responds response pad . The threshold approach logarithmic , staircase fashion define test subject 's acuity threshold resolution similar letter letter score chart test ability rapidly test number condition luminance contrast simulate activity daily live . The CVA determination visual acuity six condition contrast light compare acquire logMAR chart test similar condition .</detailed_description>

Normals : Systemic Disease Persons systemic disease would interfere vision exclude normal classification . Such disease would exclude subject category would include diabetes , systemic disease neurological disorder examiner determines may interfere vision eye . Ocular Inclusion criterion : For inclusion normal group eye would ocular examination within three month , least , include following : A visual acuity measure 20/30 good examination refractive error alone determine define vision . For individual 65 year great , lens nuclear opalescence brunescence less equal NO3 , NC3 accord LOCS III grade system . For individual le 65 year , lens nuclear opalescence brunescence less equal NO2 , NC2 , accord LOCS III grade system . Ocular Media opacity retinal optic nerve pathology examiner determines would affect measure vision . For individual age 65 great , eye nuclear opalescence brunescence , accord LOCS III grade system great NO3 , NC3 opacities exclude . Eyes Cataracts : General Persons without systemic disease would interfere vision enrol . Such disease would exclude subject category would include diabetes , systemic disease neurological disorder examiner determines may interfere vision eye . Ocular For inclusion eye would ocular examination within three month per state protocol . A visual acuity bad 20/30 . The determination examination examiner lens opacity alone define vision . For individual less age 65 nuclear cataract denser NO2 , NC2 contain component ( posterior cortical posterior sub capsular ) document . For individual 65 year age old , nuclear cataract great NO3 , NC3 contain component define vision . Ocular Eyes retinal optic nerve pathology examiner determines would affect measure vision . Eyes best refract chart acuity 20/100 bad eye examiner prevented medium opacity adequately examine fundus determine coexistent macular pathology . Eyes Maculopathy : General It recognize many individual within group diabetes hypertension may cause maculopathy aggravate maculopathy . However , systemic disease necessarily exclude person , unless examiner determines disease cause reduce vision eye define maculopathy . Ocular For inclusion eye would ocular examination within three month component accord protocol state . A visual acuity chart test bad 20/30 examination maculopathy alone determine define vision . Ocular Eyes chart acuity 20/400 worse . Eyes lens optic nerve pathology examiner determines would affect measure vision . Eyes dense cataract adequate examination macula prevent .</criteria>
