	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call enzalutamide combination external beam radiation therapy possible treatment prostate cancer . Presently , participant receive hormonal therapy radiation therapy prostate cancer , medication give reduce testosterone level blood stream . This lead side effect loss sex drive , erectile dysfunction ( ED ) decrease muscle strength . The purpose study test another form hormonal therapy radiation therapy . The medication call enzalutamide use radiation therapy . Instead lower testosterone , enzalutamide block testosterone cell . This study test enzalutamide use radiation lower PSA without cause side effect associate medication low testosterone blood stream .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide + External Beam Rt For Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The participant give study drug-dosing diary 6 treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) , time participant take study drug enzalutamide mouth ( 4 pill daily ) . The diary also include special instruction take enzalutamide . - The participant also undergoing external beam radiation therapy study , duration 8 ½-10 week . Treatment administer outpatient basis . This part study consider standard care . - The participant require fiducial marker place within prostate part study . These small gold marker place prostate . This procedure similar biopsy participant diagnose cancer . This procedure routinely perform permit image position correction improve precision external beam ( radiation ) delivery ( Image Guided Radiation Therapy ) . The placement three gold marker perform Urologist . The fiducials place ultrasound guidance . This also consider standard care experimental . - Planned Follow-up : Participants follow study 3 month follow-up treatment ( cessation enzalutamide ) . Additional follow-up ass status participant 's cancer conduct discretion treat physician part participant 's routine medical care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study population : Participants must histologically confirm malignancy candidate external beam radiation therapy . Patients eligible study must intermediate risk disease define PSA value 1020 ng/ml and/or T2bc and/or Gleason grade 7 . If three present , le 50 % core biopsy positive . Patients previously diagnose low risk ( Gleason score &lt; 6 , clinical stage &lt; T2a , PSA &lt; 10 ) prostate cancer undergo active surveillance rebiopsied found intermediate risk disease accord protocol criterion eligible enrollment within 180 day repeat biopsy procedure . Age 18 year . Life expectancy great 1 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( see Appendix D ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL Platelets ≥80,000/mcL Total bilirubin &lt; 2X institutional upper limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 2x institutional limit . The effect enzalutamide develop human fetus unknown . For reason enzalutamide may teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Patients must NOT meet follow exclusion criterion Received investigational agent within 4 week prior enrollment Stage T4 prostate cancer clinical examination radiologic evaluation . Hypogonadism severe androgen deficiency define screen serum testosterone less 50 ng/dL normal range institution . Prior androgen deprivation , chemotherapy , surgery , radiation prostate cancer . Receiving concurrent androgen , antiandrogens , estrogen , progestational agent , receive agent within 6 month prior enrollment take finasteride dutasteride within 30 day registration . History another active malignancy within previous 5 year curatively treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer superficial bladder cancer . Participants treat malignancy relapse within two year eligible participate study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection . Severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity , judgment Investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment . Unwilling use contraceptive study relevant patient . History seizure condition concurrent medication may predispose seizure . History loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month prior enrollment . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease , include : Myocardial infarction within 3 month enrollment ; Uncontrolled angina within 3 month enrollment ; Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , history congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram multigated acquisition scan perform within 3 month result leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45 % ; History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) ; History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place ; Hypotension indicate systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 mmHg 2 consecutive measurement Screening visit ; Bradycardia indicate heart rate &lt; 50 beat per minute Screening visit ; Uncontrolled hypertension indicate systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg 2 consecutive measurement screen visit ; EKG demonstrate equal great grade III toxicity accord NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 History gastrointestinal disorder ( medical disorder extensive surgery ) may interfere absorption oral study drug ( ) within 3 month enrollment . Major surgery within 4 week registration . Previous use , participation clinical trial , investigational agent block androgen synthesis ( e.g. , abiraterone acetate , TAK700 , TAK683 , TAK448 ) target androgen receptor ( e.g. , enzalutamide , BMS 641988 ) ; ketoconazole . Any condition reason , opinion Investigator , interfere ability patient participate trial , place patient undue risk , complicate interpretation safety data . Need medication list drug use caution avoid ( see APPENDIX F ) . Use herbal alternative remedy may affect hormonal status Prostasol PCSPES .</criteria>
