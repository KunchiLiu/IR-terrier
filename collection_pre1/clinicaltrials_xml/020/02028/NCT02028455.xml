	<brief_summary>Patients relapse refractory leukemia often develop resistance chemotherapy . For reason , attempt use T cell obtain directly patient , genetically modify express chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) . The CAR enable T cell recognize kill leukemic cell recognition CD19 , protein express surface leukemic cell patient CD19+ leukemia . This phase 1/2 study design determine maximum tolerate dose CAR+ T cell well determine efficacy . The phase 1 cohort restrict patient already allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) . The phase 2 open patient regardless history HCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pediatric Young Adult Trial Genetically Modified T Cells Directed Against CD19 Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon meet eligibility requirement enrol study , subject undergo apheresis obtain T cell generation CD19 CAR+ T cell . In patient prior history allogeneic HCT , T cell obtain donor origin . The T cell isolated apheresis product , CD4 CD8 T cell select grown separately , transduce lentivirus express CD19 CAR well truncate EGFR signal capacity ( noted EGFRt ) expand culture three week period . During process cell generation , subject continue care primary oncologist may undergo additional treatment direct leukemia time . After CAR+ T cell generate , subject undergoes disease assessment determination lymphodepletion necessary . A variety lymphodepletion strategy acceptable determined case case basis . At least 48 hour completion lymphodepletion , subject receive infusion CAR+ T cell approximate 1:1 ratio CD4 CD8 CAR+ T cell . Following treatment CAR+ T cell , subject follow intensely 2 month serial blood test re-evaluation disease status bone marrow aspirate . After 2 month , subject clinical care resume primary oncologist , possible would receive additional chemotherapy HCT . Some subject receive cetuximab ablation genetically modify T cell . Criteria receive cetuximab include acute toxicity life threatening , well ongoing remission continue B cell aplasia . Upon completion study , subject follow bi-annually 5 year , annually 10 additional year either medical history , physical exam blood test phone call/questionnaire . This follow help determine subject develops long-term health problem relate CAR+ T cell include new cancer .</detailed_description>
