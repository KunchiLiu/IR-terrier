	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response BMS-936559 HIV-Infected People Taking Combination Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People infect HIV take cART low viral load level may still reservoirs HIV remain body . BMS-936559 drug study previous clinical trial treat various type cancer . The purpose study evaluate safety , PK , immunotherapeutic activity single dose BMS-936559 ( administer IV infusion ) HIV-infected people receive cART viral load limit detection . Researchers also evaluate whether BMS-936559 reduce hidden reservoir HIV . Participants enrol four cohort . Within cohort , participant randomly assign receive BMS-936559 ( Cohort 1 : 0.3 mg/kg ; Cohort 2 : 1 mg/kg ; Cohort 3 : 3 mg/kg ; Cohort 4 : 10 mg/kg ) placebo . The four cohort enrol sequentially , researcher review safety data cohort enrol participant next cohort . Prior study entry , participant must eye exam electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . At study entry , participant undergo medical medication history review , physical examination , eye exam , blood collection . Some female participant pregnancy test . All participant receive single IV infusion assign dose BMS-936559 placebo . The infusion occur period 60 minute , participant remain clinic observation additional 12 hour . Additional study visit occur Days 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 , Weeks 10 , 16 , 24 , 36 , 48 . These study visit may include physical examination , blood collection , adherence assessment , PK evaluation . Some participant may additional eye exam study , as-needed basis .</detailed_description>
