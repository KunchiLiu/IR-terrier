	<brief_summary>This international ( 5 country ) randomize phase III study 2 cohort , patient randomize 1:1 endocrine therapy ( cohort 1 : exemestane 25 mg daily , cohort 2 : fulvestrant 500mg day 1 15 cycle 1 day 1 every 4 week ) plus palbociclib ( 125 mg daily x3 week every 4 week ) vs. capecitabine ( 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily x2 week every 3 week ) . Postmenopausal patient HR+/HER2 MBC eligible resistant previous NSAI ( letrozole anastrozole ) define : recurrence within 12 month end adjuvant treatment progression within 1 month end treatment MBC . Previous chemotherapy permit either ( neo ) adjuvant set and/or first line MBC . Patients must measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 bone lesion , lytic mixed , absence measurable disease .</brief_summary>
