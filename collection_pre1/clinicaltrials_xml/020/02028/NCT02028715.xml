	<brief_summary>The investigator ' goal plan prospective , randomize , patient blind study compare standard care control group experimental group patient receive preemptive IV acetaminophen dose continue every 6 hour total 8 dos patient undergone major gynecologic surgery . The outcome analyze include amount rescue opioids require , time return bowel function , length hospital stay , cost effectiveness , patient satisfaction . The hypothesis addition IV acetaminophen decrease need opioid rescue thereby decrease incidence associate gastrointestinal side effect include nausea , vomit , bloating , constipation . The hope affect final outcome quicker return bowel function , increase patient satisfaction , shorten hospital stay prove overall cost effective postoperative pain management approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This patient-blinded prospective study patient undergo major gynecologic surgery via open abdominal approach randomize two arm : 1 . Control Group : Morphine patient-controlled-anesthesia ( PCA ) initial 24 hour post-operation low-dose basal rate ( 0.5mg/hr ) patient administer bolus prn . Oral oxycodone 24-48 hour post-operation use prn pain patient transition oral combine oxycodone/acetaminophen remainder hospital stay . Normal saline 100cc IV infuse placebo every 6 hour total eight dos first dose give time anesthesia induction . 2 . Experimental Group : Morphine PCA initial 24 hour post-operation low-dose basal rate ( 0.5mg/hr ) patient administer bolus prn . IV acetaminophen 1,000mg give every six hour total eight dos first dose give time anesthesia induction . Oral oxycodone 24-48 hour post-operation use prn patient transition oral combine oxycodone/acetaminophen remainder hospital stay . Outcomes analyzed include amount opioids use ; time return bowel function designate passage flatus ; time first bowel movement occur inpatient ; duration hospital stay ; cost effectiveness ; patient symptom satisfaction 24 48 hour mark well time discharge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female patient undergo major gynecologic surgery via open abdominal approach . The included surgery would exploratory laparotomy without removal uterus , fallopian tube , ovary . Patients baseline preoperative liver function enzyme ( AST ALT ) great twice upper limit normal would exclude . Patients baseline CrCl &lt; 30 . Patients require intensive postoperative care delay extubation typically require additional sedation would impede adequate evaluation two study pain regimen design patient control . Patients complication unrelated pain regimen prolong stay would exclude evaluation hospital stay cost effectiveness analysis . Examples would include limited prerenal azotemia acute renal failure ; pneumonia ; venous thromboembolism ; need reexploration laparotomy . Allergy acetaminophen would exclude patient set enter experimental IV acetaminophen study arm . One exception would allergy trivial relate route administration mild nausea oral acetaminophen . Patients undergo bowel resection surgery may adversely effect return bowel function Patients require regular opioid intake 7 day precede surgery . NSAIDs within 8 hour surgery . Chronic steroid use exception lowdose inhale steroid formulation . Chronic alcohol drug abuse . Patients currently pregnant . Patients unable provide inform consent . Age &gt; 85 Any physical , medical , mental condition would make participation study inadvisable .</criteria>
