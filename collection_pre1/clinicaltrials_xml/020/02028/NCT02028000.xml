	<brief_summary>The study look woman undergo cesarean section delivery baby . The purpose research study determine type skin closure cesarean section help decrease pain level improve appearance incision site . The study hypothesis determine skin closure absorbable subcuticular staple lead improved cosmesis and/or decrease post-operative pain . Participants study already schedule cesarean section delivery baby . They randomize one three group , 1 ) Insorb ( absorbable subcuticular stapes ) , 2 ) Vicryl suture 3 ) Monocryl suture skin closure cesarean section . Information record include amount pain medication usage hospital cesarean section , daily patient rat pain score discharge hospital , pain score 6 week surgery cesarean section cosmetic scar 6 week surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery common surgical procedure perform United States , 1 million procedure perform per year . Based recent Centers Disease Control National Vital Statistics Report 32.3 % birth United States via cesarean delivery , mark twelfth consecutive annual increase cesarean delivery rate . Given high number cesarean delivery perform today , interest optimize surgical technique . Several recent review summarize evidence various step cesarean delivery , surprisingly many case little scientific evidence base choice surgical technique . The topic skin closure cesarean delivery area focus several randomize control trial . The trial compare surgical steel staple subcuticular suture various material focus difference post-operative pain , infection rate , scar cosmesis . Cosmesis investigate three Randomized Clinical Trials none find difference surgical steel staple subcuticular suture . Infection rate study single observational study find high infection rate patient whose skin close surgical steel staple compare suture . Studies post-operative pain skin closure technique contradictory . The early Randomized clinical trial investigate skin closure post-operative pain do Frishman et al ( 5 ) find subjective self-assessment pain well hospital discharge 6 week post-operatively patient subcuticular suture rather surgical steel staple use . A subsequent Randomized clinical trial report opposite result less pain 6 week post-operatively surgical steel staple use . This discrepancy may , part , due different suture material use two trial . The study Frishman et al show benefit subcuticular suture utilize use polyglycolic acid ( Vicryl suture Insorb staple ) ; whereas , study Rousseau et al use polyglecaprone ( Monocryl suture ) . To date direct comparison skin closure time cesarean two suture material perform . Recently , new technology skin closure introduce employ absorbable material , polylactic polyglycolic acid , subcuticular staple . In animal model method skin closure show less histological inflammation few wound infection either surgical steel staple subcuticular suture . Unfortunately , little known skin closure technique compare establish technique cesarean delivery human . However , retrospective analysis compare subcuticular absorbable staple surgical steel staple reveal association subcuticular absorbable staple decrease in-hospital analgesic use . The current study prospective randomize trial investigates four cesarean skin closure techniques—surgical steel staple , subcuticular polyglycolic acid suture ( Vicryl ) , subcuticular , polyglecaprone suture ( Monocryl ) , absorbable subcuticular polyglycolic acid staples—to determine one associate improved cosmesis decrease post-operative pain .</detailed_description>
