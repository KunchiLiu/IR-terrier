	<brief_title>ICE : Intracardiac Ultrasound Within Left Atrium During Radiofrequency Ablation Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common rhythm disturbance affect human population . 1 . Its prevalence increase age find &gt; 8 % human age eighty ; 2 . Radiofrequency ablation drug refractory nonvalvular atrial fibrillation become common therapy available patient . It show efficacious cost effective ; 3 . The standard approach atrial fibrillation involve electrical isolation pulmonary vein ( PVI ) rest atrium chamber . This involve move 3.5mm tip ablation catheter point point around PV structure encircle ablation line form . This make difficult knowing tip good contact atrial tissue . In addition esophagus posterior lying structure injury esophagus ablate overlie tissue report , time fatal ; 4 . Currently , intracardiac imaging leave atrium FDA approval right atrial chamber . This lead difficulty visualize tip tissue interface , important leave sided structure carina , ligament , esophagus . By place tip ICE catheter leave atrium , enhance visualization tip tissue interface may lead effective ablation point , few need ablation point , enhance safety avoid placement adjacent noncardiac structure .</detailed_description>
