	<brief_title>IPI-145 Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If patient find eligible take part study , receive IPI-145 mouth twice day month ( 30 day ) . Patient swallow IPI-145 whole glass water ( 8 ounce ) . If patient forgets take dose vomit , take another dose . Each study cycle last 30 day . Patient 's dose study drug may change depend side effect may . Study Visits : Patient physical exam within 1 week Day 1 study cycle . The first 2 cycle call induction cycle call consolidation cycle . Blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) draw 1 3 time week induction ( Cycles 1 and/or 2 ) least 1 time week consolidation . How often blood drawn base study doctor 's decision . These blood draw may do clinic close patient life choose . Patient bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy Days 14-21 ( +/- 3 day ) Cycle 1 every 1-2 cycle check status disease . Patient may additional bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy doctor think necessary . Length Study : Patient may receive IPI-145 24 month doctor think best interest . Patient longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit/call . Follow-up Visit/Call : Patient follow-up visit 30 day last dose study drug . At visit , patient ask side effect may . If patient make clinic visit , may speak phone member study staff . This phone call last 10 minute . This investigational study . IPI-145 FDA approve commercially available . Its use study investigational . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
