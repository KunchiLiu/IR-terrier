Plasma level adiponectin negatively associate index obesity , insulin resistance cardiovascular disease . However , role RA still controversial evidence indicate proinflammatory effect suggest antiinflammatory property adipocytokine . Aim present study evaluate effect different lifestyle intervention administration , increase adherence Mediterranean diet group patient RA live Mediterranean basin , , thus , improve parameter related subjective objective disease marker , include plasma adiponectin concentration .</detailed_description>
