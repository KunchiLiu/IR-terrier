	<brief_title>Pilot Study Investigating Feasibility Determining Endogenous Glucose Production During Hypoglycaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject participate 3 Visits . The total study duration subject approximately one month.The trial divide : - Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) - Hypoglycaemic clamp Visit ( Visit 2 ) - Follow Visit ( Visit 3 ) Screening Visit ( Visit1 ) : The subject ask attend screen visit fasting . The following data assess perform : informed consent sign date , inclusion exclusion criterion study , full medical history include current medication , physical examination laboratory examination blood/urine sample . For woman childbearing potential urine pregnancy test perform . Hypoglycaemic Visit ( Visit2 ) : Each subject ask attend clinical unit approximately 20:00 even day 1 . Thereafter subject receive insulin glucose infusion intravenously order obtain steady state PG level 5.5 mmol/L overnight approximately 08:00 morning day 2 . At 05:00 hour D- [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose ( 100 g/l ) solution give i.v . prim ( 9.6 mg/kg/min ) one minute constant ( 0.08 mg/kg/min ) infusion last blood sample plasma glucose level 4.0 mmol/L perform . At 08:00 hour morning day 2 , insulin infusion increase 1.5 mU/kg/min subject Plasma Glucose keep plateau 5.5 mmol/L control variable intravenous infusion glucose ( 10 % glucose enrich 4mg [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose /ml ) one hour . Afterwards , plasma glucose allow fall plateau 3.5 mmol/L , nadir 2.5 mmol/L , blood glucose level 4.0 mmol/L finally back level 5.5 mmol/L safety reason . Blood sample measurement plasma glucose , [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose ( label glucose ) , glucagon , vital sign , hypoglycaemic symptom questionnaire hypoglycaemic awareness perform plasma glucose plateau . The subject discharge clinic day 2 , later deem necessary investigator . Follow Visit ( Visit 3 ) : The subject attend Visit 3 , 3 - 10 day Visit 2 . The following data assess perform : concomitant medication , include current diabetes treatment , adverse event , full physical examination laboratory examination blood/urine sample . For woman childbearing potential urine pregnancy test perform .</detailed_description>
