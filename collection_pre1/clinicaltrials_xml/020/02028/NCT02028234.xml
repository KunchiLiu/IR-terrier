	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel Prasugrel pro-drug necessitating conversion active metabolite CYP 450 system ( CYP ) , particularly CYP3A CYP2C19 isoforms . These drug platelet purinergic receptor antagonist , know P2Y12 . The link active metabolite Clopidogrel Prasugrel P2Y12 receptor prevents ADP receptor activation inhibit several event lead conformational change platelet , therefore facilitate activation aggregation , basis acute coronary syndrome . Despite double antiplatelet drug principle therapy treatment prevention atherothrombotic event cardiovascular disease , important cause bleed peptic ulcer . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) actually consider principal agent reduce gastroenteric bleeding risk associate antiplatelet therapy . Nevertheless interaction PPI antiplatelet therapy object interest . Several study demonstrate PPI reduce efficacy clopidogrel platelet reactivity , probably inhibition metabolism , increase risk cardiovascular event . Only data Prasugrel available show minor effect PPI antiplatelet activity clopidogrel . Differing prasugrel clopidogrel , ticagrelor direct inhibitor P2Y12 , necessitate biotransformation liver ; therefore interaction PPI remain unclear . Nevertheless actual study consider clinical outcome ( MACEs ) , subgroup analysis Platelet Inhibition Patient Outcomes ( PLATO ) trial , show high rate MACEs clopidogrel Ticagrelor patient undergone PPI therapy , especially omeprazole treatment . Interaction omeprazole clopidogrel seem relate high inhibitory activity PPI CYP2C19 , interfere conversion clopidogrel active metabolite . It yet unclear high rate MACEs ticagrelor group , similarly clopidogrel , despite n't hepatic metabolism .</detailed_description>
