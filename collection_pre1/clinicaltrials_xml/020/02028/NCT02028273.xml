	<brief_summary>This study do measure number brain cell grow brain throughout life determine effective way complete MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scanner . The number brain cell may affect cocaine use . Researchers try understand long-term effect cocaine use brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hippocampal Neurogenesis Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New neuron generate process neurogenesis . Although active pre-natal development , neurogenesis persists throughout human lifespan . In adulthood , neurogenesis occur predominantly subgranular zone hippocampal dentate gyrus . A highly novel methodology use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) recently develop measure formation hippocampal newborn stem cell human brain . We propose assess Neural Progenitor Cells ( NPCs ) neuropsychiatric disorder cocaine dependence , chronic disease process associate pathology hippocampus impaired neurogenesis . In addition , assess measure associate neurogenesis , include hippocampal ( dentate gyrus ) cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) use Vascular-Space-Occupancy ( VASO ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging . We predict newborn hippocampal cell [ neuronal progenitor cell ( NPCs ] attenuate recently use cocaine-addicted participant relative abstinent control participant , change parallel change CBV . In pilot study , assess change cocaine-addicted subject actively use cocaine recently abstinent ( three six month ) well age- , race- , gender-similar control participant .</detailed_description>
