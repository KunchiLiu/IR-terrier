	<brief_summary>Overweight obesity well establish risk factor breast cancer develop menopause . The increase postmenopausal breast cancer risk woman overweight obese likely attribute multiple metabolic disturbance . Metformin commonly use medication diabetic stabilize blood sugar . Association study laboratory study show potential reduce risk development cancer , include breast cancer . Recent pilot clinical study breast cancer patient suggest metformin may effective overweight obese woman metabolic disturbance . We propose conduct clinical study metformin overweight obese premenopausal woman metabolic disturbance . Study participant randomly assign receive metformin placebo 12 month . The study evaluate whether metformin result favorable change risk feature associate increase breast cancer risk . The risk feature examine study include breast density , certain protein hormone , product body metabolism , body weight composition . The study help determine potential breast cancer preventive activity metformin grow population risk multiple disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Metformin Reduction Obesity-Associated Breast Cancer Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High adiposity major risk factor number chronic disease , include type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , certain type cancer , include postmenopausal breast cancer . The increase postmenopausal breast cancer risk woman high adiposity likely attribute multiple metabolic disturbance include alter circulate sex steroid hormone , hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance , alter expression secretion adipokines adipose tissue , increase production pro-inflammatory cytokine , increase oxidative stress . Metformin , widely use antidiabetic drug , exert favorable effect multiple metabolic disturbance may lead reduction breast cancer risk woman high adiposity . In addition , metformin may exert direct effect mammary tissue activation AMP-activated protein kinase signal pathway , lead antiproliferative effect induction apoptosis . Recent case control cohort study find treatment metformin appear substantially reduce risk development cancer diabetic , include breast cancer . There number ongoing clinical trial metformin breast cancer patient . However , applicability trial risk healthy woman require research concurrent prior cancer treatment trial hinder evaluation metformin single agent breast cancer risk reduction . In addition , recent clinical animal study suggest metformin may exert tumor suppressive effect metabolic phenotype high adiposity metabolic disturbance . We propose conduct Phase II randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial metformin overweight/obese premenopausal woman metabolic syndrome . This study population increase risk postmenopausal breast cancer high prevalence metabolic disturbance . The overall objective study determine potential effect reduction obesity-associated breast cancer risk .</detailed_description>
