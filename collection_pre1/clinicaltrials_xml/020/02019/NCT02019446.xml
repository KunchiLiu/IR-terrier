	<detailed_description>Onychomycosis fungal infection nail unit affect one third people diabetes.1,2 Risk factor onychomycosis diabetes include age , male sex , poor glycemic control , long duration diabetes , use immunosuppressive agent , poor peripheral circulation.2-5 Etiology onychomycosis varies across population , common cause diabetic patient yeast dermatophytes . In particular , Candida spp . ( 31-48.1 % ) common yeast , Rhodotorula spp . ( 21.7 % ) report well.4,6-8 Trichophyton rubrum ( 31.7-46 % ) common dermatophyte observe , nondermatophytic mold less common . Individuals diabetes complicated peripheral neuropathy risk develop particularly severe complication onychomycosis . Infected nails become brittle sharp , injure compromise adjacent skin . This breakdown allow portal entry bacteria , cause cellulitis paronychia.9 Because nail bed close proximity underlie nail , paronychia develop osteomyelitis adequate foot care neglect . Given significant morbidity onychomycosis include potential limb amputation , prompt effective treatment imperative . Currently available treatment include topical systemic option , significant limitation . Topical antifungal therapy test patient mild onychomycosis . Cure rate 29-85 % observe ciclopirox 8 % nail lacquer non-diabetic population mild disease ; 10 diabetic population use open label methodology cure rate approximately 54 % reported.11,12 Novel topical form terbinafine various penetration-enhancing compound also development.13-15 Early study report effective nail penetration formulation , lack data clinical efficacy topical terbinafine . One preliminary study report 90 % mycological cure 12 week treatment terbinafine spray , less half sustain cure 36 week post-treatment.16 Although effective mild moderate superficial onychomycosis , poor nail penetration topical agent generally recommend fungus appear infect 50 % nail surface.7 One recent review suggest monotherapy topical agent avoid altogether.17 Systemic antifungal agent often use treat severe onychomycosis . Two common systemic agent itraconazole terbinafine . Itraconazole newer agent added advantage cover Candida specie addition dermatophytes . Both agent associate cure rate approximately 50 % give full three month course.18 These agent significant limitation give potential drug-drug interaction via inhibition cytochrome P450 enzyme subtypes.19 Itraconazole terbinafine associate increase risk bleeding warfarin , itraconazole increase risk rhabdomyolysis statins hypoglycemia oral agent diabetes terbinafine metoprolol , propafenone , tricyclic antidepressants.19 Due significant limitation topical systemic treatment onychomycosis , critical need alternative replacement therapy . While surgical technique avulsion nail plate removal employ severe resistant infection , treatment quite invasive painful.7,20 Other device-based therapy onychomycosis include UV light therapy21-23 photodynamic therapy.24-27 While modality show evidence vitro efficacy , robust study conduct yet demonstrate clinical effectiveness . A promising device-based therapy laser treatment . The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( Nd : YAG ) device emits laser continuous pulsed fashion , 1064 nm wavelength think optimal due ability penetrate deeply nail bed eradicate fungal growth.28 Although device approve US Food Drug Administration use patient onychomycosis `` temporary increase clear nail , '' 28 lack research demonstrate effectiveness beyond several pilot study . One study demonstrate mycologic cure 7 8 patient major side effect aside temporary nail discoloration occasional pin prick sensation.29 The parameter laser include 0.65 m pulse duration , 2 mm spot size 223 J/cm2 energy fluence , treatment consist 2 3 session space least 3 week apart . A Chinese study 33 patient demonstrate 51 % 53 % cure rate patient treat eight four session respectively , space 1 week interval use 30 m pulse duration 3 mm spot size laser 240-324 J/cm2.30 Results Japan show similar cure rate 51 % 19 patient treat 1 3 treatment 4 8 week apart.31 To knowledge , randomize control trial exist validate preliminary finding . Study Objectives The objective study determine relative safety clinical efficacy laser treatment use FOX Nd : YAG 1064 nm device compare conventional therapy ( topical terbinafine ) diabetic onychomycosis hallux ( great toe ) . Specifically , study test hypothesis participant randomize FOX Nd : YAG laser likely cured 6 month initiate therapy compare randomized conventional therapy . A secondary objective determine improvement quality life laser treatment versus conventional therapy . Subjects Eighty participant randomize equally either laser treatment group standard care group . Study overview This prospective , randomize , intention-to-treat , non-blinded comparative group clinical trial 80 participant receive laser conventional , topical medication , therapy single infect hallux . All participant baseline 6 month follow-up visit photograph hallux repeat KOH culture perform . Participants randomize laser group undergo laser treatment baseline ask return 2 subsequent visit six week apart ( week 6 12 ) undergo laser treatment hallux . Each visit last approximately 45 minute . At 6-month visit , participant randomize control group offer first three laser treatment ( second third occur week 30 36 ) . Participants laser group persistent infection 6 month offer standard therapy . No data collect final 6-month visit . The treatment perform BCDiabetes ( 400 - 210 West Broadway , Vancouver , V5Y 3W2 , Canada ) own operated Dr. Elliott . Primary outcome measure One primary outcome proportion participant microbiological cure ( KOH culture ) 6 month post-randomization ( i.e . : initiation treatment ) . Other primary outcome include safety outcome . Specifically , safety outcome interest include side effect list : Usual side effect : Feeling warmth , heat , tingle laser target site ( treatment ) Rare side effect : Discoloration/burn mark surface nail Slight mild pain ( treatment ) Redness treat skin around nail ( last 24-72 hour ) Rare laser effect : Sometimes laser creates 'sparks ' surface nail - cause problem Extremely rare laser effect Blistering treat skin around nail Scarring treat skin around nail Secondary outcome measure Secondary outcome include proportion participant experience clinical cure visual assessment ( planimetry photograph ) evaluate . The secondary outcome improvement quality life measure validated `` NailQoL '' questionnaire assess symptom , emotion , functional domain .

If participant lose follow-up , least 3 documented attempt must make contact subject , one must include send certified letter participant 's last known address , include request return study site final study evaluation . Participants fail return 6-month visit consider failure ( i.e . microbiological cure ) unless nail clipping obtain prior visit confirm microbiological cure . Information whether microbiological cure achieve study share subject well health care provider . At completion study procedure , laser treatment offer control group participant well intervention group participant wish additional toe treat . Risks Discomforts The following list risk possible discomfort associate FOX Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser . Precise estimate percentage occurrence side effect available give limited number pilot study available . Usual side effect : Feeling warmth , heat , tingle laser target site ( treatment Rare side effect : Discoloration/burn mark surface nail Slight mild pain ( treatment ) Redness treat skin around nail ( last 24-72 hour ) Rare laser effect : Sometimes laser creates 'sparks ' surface nail - cause problem Extremely rare laser effect ( occur clinical study ) : Blistering treat skin around nail Scarring treat skin around nail Significant side effect report several small pilot study Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser . We minimize risk side effect use laser strictly accord manufacturer-recommended protocol describe intervention section . We would consider stop study early severe side effect blister scar unexpectedly observe significant proportion study participant . Side effect control group receive topical terbinafine expect part current standard care . The known side effect conventional treatment detail : Dermatologic side effect ( 1-10 % ) : Burning , contact dermatitis , dryness , exfoliation , irritation , pruritus , rash Local side effect ( 1-10 % ) : Irritation , sting Statistical Analysis Analysis Supporting Primary Objective The primary outcome measure proportion participant microbiological cure ( KOH culture ) 6 month post-baseline treatment . The null research hypotheses support primary objective investigate impact whether laser treatment , use FOX Nd : YAG 1064 nm device , effective treatment onychomycosis comparison conventional therapy ( topical terbinafine ) : H0 : pc ≥ ptr vs. H1 : pc &lt; ptr pc ptr proportion subject microbiological cure ( KOH culture ) 6 month post-baseline treatment , within control group , laser group respectively . Here , reject null hypothesis implies proportion participant achieve microbiological cure high laser group . A 1-sided , 0.05 alpha-level Fisher 's exact test proportion used.34 The rate safety outcome ( feel warmth/heat/tingling , discolouration burn mark , pain , redness , spark , blistering , scar ) , accompany 95 % exact binomial confidence interval , calculate . Sample Size Considerations Based previous study , terbinafine may associate cure rate approximately 50 % ( give full three month course ) .18 The success rate FOX laser group thoroughly investigate . Table 2 provide power detect various true difference control laser group control group assume success rate 40 % 60 % . A sample size 80 subject 1:1 randomization control laser arm provide power 80 % reject null hypothesis laser arm true cure rate control arm 79 % control arm achieve cure rate 50 % . If success rate control group high 60 % , difference 26 % group detectable 80 % . If true difference 34 % great , detect least 90 % power . For total sample size 100 , true difference least 31 % detectable least 90 % power , reduction 3 % . Similarly , total sample size 60 , difference must least 39 % detect least 90 % power , increase 4 % .
