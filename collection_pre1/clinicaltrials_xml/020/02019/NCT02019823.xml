Participant recruitment : Posters advertise study leaflet contain study information available general wait area health centre . Adult patient attend medical outpatient department one chronic disease club approach invited consider take part study . Interested individual opportunity ask train research staff question study participation . Information study available English , isi-Xhosa , Afrikaans . Individuals interested participate asked series screen question assess eligibility inclusion study blood pressure measure per study protocol . Eligible participant decline participate asked permission access clinical record extract basic detail ( age , gender , medication , recent blood pressure ) . Copies Participant Information Leaflets posters English find Appendix B . Translated copy available upon request .

Study assessment : - Baseline We ask standard question health medical history , measure blood pressure , weight height . Any necessary blood test do per clinic protocol . A trained research assistant review participant 's clinical record . - 6 month Participant contact detail ( particularly participant 's primary mobile-telephone number ) check necessary up-dated blood pressure measure . - 12 month A train research assistant administer final set questionnaire , measure participant 's blood pressure accord trial protocol , repeat basic clinical measurement include anthropometry . Clinical record review capture intervene clinical event change medical management . Participants attend 12 month follow-up clinic appointment follow , cause non-attendance hospital admission death , hospital record death certificate data obtain . End study : The end study date final 12-month follow-up clinic visit last participant . After time study participant ask would like receive SMS-text message per provincial department health protocol exists . Privacy confidentiality : Participant 's contact detail ( cellular phone number , address , etc ) , available name senior research staff involve study . Details share clinic staff service provider unless permission expressly give participant study conclude . Data capture use combination electronic data capture paper case-report form ( CRFs ) . CRFs enter onto trial database day collection . The trial database include check logic consistency resolve local investigator . Data store computer individually assign password individually assigned level access . The trial database include full audit trail change make . Randomisation cod separately store accessible trial statistician . No personal data include trial database participant identifiable unique study number . All essential document retain trial master file . Trial documentation archive store seven year . Potential harm : The measurement propose take include blood pressure , height , weight , waist circumference safe regularly use routine clinical care . We take participant 's blood pressure time usually do clinic could cause discomfort . The potential harm patient result trial intervention judge low . The University maintain Public Liability Professional Liability insurance operate respect . Potential benefit individual participant : All study participant receive SMS-text message may find beneficial . Participants blood pressure accurately measure least three occasion . Rewards : This study provide reward compensation participant .
