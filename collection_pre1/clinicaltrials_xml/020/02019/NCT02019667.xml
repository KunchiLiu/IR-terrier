	<brief_summary>Objective : To perform clinical trial assess safety , tolerability efficacy GABA ( B ) receptor antagonist SGS-742 patient SSADH deficiency . Study Population : Twenty-two child adult SSADH deficiency . Design : Double-blind , cross-over , phase II clinical trial . SGS-742 GABA ( B ) receptor antagonist show safe well-tolerated clinical trial adult cognitive impairment . In addition , preliminary data SSADH knockout mouse model suggest efficacy specific syndrome . The primary outcome measure change Auditory Comprehension subtest Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Language Module score ; secondary outcome measure change cortical excitation inhibition measure transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Additional evaluation include neurological neuropsychological examination , magnetic resonance spectroscopy CSF collection measure GABA level . The trial baseline phase patient undergo neurological examination neuropsychological evaluation . During subsequent treatment phase , patient randomize SGS-742 , supply IRIX Pharmaceuticals , base weight give maximum tolerate dose exceed 600 mg t.i.d . orally , placebo , 6 month . Patients repeat TMS , neurological neuropsychological evaluation , follow cross-over alternate treatment arm , re-evaluation 6 month . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure drug efficacy performance neuropsychological testing response parent questionnaire . The secondary outcome measure TMS parameter cortical excitation inhibition . The outcome measure safety include clinical examination neuropsychological test .</brief_summary>
