	<brief_summary>The purpose TiME Trial determine whether dialysis facility implementation minimum hemodialysis session duration 4.25 hour ( versus usual care ) patient end-stage renal disease initiate treatment thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis benefit mortality , hospitalization health-related quality life . The trial also aim demonstrate capacity conduct large , pragmatic clinical trial partnership two large dialysis provider organization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cluster-randomized , Pragmatic Trial Hemodialysis Session Duration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TiME Trial cluster-randomized , parallel-group pragmatic clinical trial patient initiate treatment maintenance hemodialysis . Facilities randomize 1:1 distribution Intervention arm Usual Care arm . Facilities randomize Intervention arm adopt practice recommend dialysis session duration least 4.25 hour patient initiate hemodialysis treatment regardless body size dialysis solute clearance measurement . Facilities randomize Usual Care maintain exist approach prescribe dialysis session duration . Participants follow 3 year . The primary endpoint mortality ; major secondary endpoint hospitalization rate quality life . Pragmatic feature TiME Trial include 1 ) high generalizability due non-restrictive eligibility criterion broad representation participate facility , 2 ) implementation intervention clinical care provider rather research personnel , 3 ) reliance data obtain routine clinical care rather research activity .</detailed_description>
