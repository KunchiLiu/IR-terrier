	<brief_summary>BioSteel Sports Drink ( BSD ) , proprietary blend branch chain amino acid , taurine , B vitamins , increased popularity among professional amateur athlete . BioSteel claim BSD attenuates muscular mental fatigue , enhance recovery consume intense exercise . To date , efficacy BSD attenuate muscular mental fatigue , enhance recovery repeat bout intense exercise unknown . In blind crossover study , participant subject sprint interval exercise follow muscular cognitive function test two condition : BSD isoenergetic control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study expect start January 2014 complete December 2014 . Ten exercise train male athlete ( 18-35 year ) complete repeat test protocol 2 experimental condition systematically rotate blind crossover design : BSD isoenergetic carbohydrate control , separate 1 week . The test protocol consist sprint interval exercise ( 4-repeated Wingate cycle test , resistance 10 % body mass separate 4 min recovery bout , follow 4 muscular fatigue 2 cognitive function test ) . Approximately 1-2 week prior test , participant complete two familiarization session laboratory . During first session ( ~2h ) , participant ask complete physical activity readiness questionnaire participant information form personal familial health history rule pathology health issue may preclude participate present study . Additionally , body composition determine via BodPod ( air displacement chamber ) , also screen via 5 exercise test use National Hockey League Combine ( 150 lb bench press , 8 lb sit medicine ball toss , stand long jump , vertical jump maximal oxygen consumption test cycle ergometer ) . During second session ( ~1h ) , familiarize 2 cognitive test . This testing design eliminate learn effect repeat test . On test day ( ~5h ) , participant arrive laboratory ~0800h follow 12-h overnight fast , limited activity ( drive/use elevator get lab ) . Participants feed standardize breakfast ( 7 kcal/kg body weight ) allow 2 hour digest prior test . Thirty minute exercise , participant ingest either 500ml BSD ( 0.18 calories/kg body weight ) isoenergetic carbohydrate control similar taste/appearance blind fashion . Participants give 5-minute warm , complete session sprint interval exercise ( 4 repeat Wingate test , separate 4 minute recovery ) . Following exercise , 4 National Hockey League Combine test complete evaluate muscular fatigue ( 150 lb bench press , sit medicine ball toss , stand long jump , vertical jump ) , 2 cognitive function test . Participants receive 15-minute non-exercise recovery consume another 500ml supplement ( placebo ) complete test protocol . Ratings perceive exertion ( RPE ) collect throughout exercise muscular fatigue test . Test day timeline : 0800h : Arrive lab 0805h : Standard breakfast 1025h : Blood sample 1030h : Take supplement ( double blind ) 1100h : Blood sample 1105h : Warm 1110h : Sprint interval exercise : post test RPE 1130h : Muscular fatigue test : post test RPE 1150h : Cognitive function test 1200h : Rest 1215h : Sprint interval exercise : post test RPE 1245h : Muscular fatigue test : post test RPE 1305h : Cognitive function test 1315h : Blood sample 1320h : Leave lab During experimental trial , participant able drink water ad libidum ( volume consume quantified ) . The Gatorade condition similar taste/appearance BioSteel . Blood sample collect via venipuncture forearm 3 time point : prior supplement ingestion , 30 minute post-ingestion/pre-exercise immediately second test protocol . Blood obtain analyzed leucine , isoleucine , valine tryptophan . All blood sample do trained phlebotomist . Eligibility Criteria : Individuals must healthy , exercise-trained male age 18-35 year . Participants never consume BioSteel Sports Drink . To ensure participant trained , must achieve 2013 National Hockey League Combine average score well 5 exercise test ( 150 lb bench press , 4 kg sit medicine ball toss , stand long jump , vertical jump maximal oxygen consumption test cycle ergometer ) . Women study subsequently asses whether gender difference exist . Outcome Measures : Blood Collection : Blood sample collect venipuncture arm vein train phlebotomist previous study conduct lab . Briefly , participant sit comfortably chair armrest specimen collection . In addition , subject thoroughly brief regard blood draw , blanket , pillow , food drink available event subject react negatively . Standard sterile blood handle technique use include disposable medical examination glove , alcohol swab , needle . All blood contaminate material dispose hazardous material label disposal container , promptly analysis . The specimen collect EDTA-treated tube , undergo treatment follow ELISA kit protocol , centrifuge , store freezer -70°C Exercise Nutrition Research Lab hormone analysis laboratory . The frozen specimen remain stable approximately 1 month . Therefore , blood analysis complete within time frame , dispose appropriately . The sample control cared principal investigator Dr. Peter Lemon Kolten Abbott . Body composition : Will measure densitometry use air displacement plethysmography via BodPod® ( involve sit comfortably chamber five minute space body take measure ) . Aerobic Capacity : Will quantify via incremental exercise cycle ergometer test . This test conduct routinely laboratory follow American College Sport Medicine guideline ( Gold standard ) . Wingate test : Will conduct use cycle ergometer electronically measure power ( average , peak decline ) . Resistance equal 10 % subject body mass kg . Muscular power endurance : Four measurement conduct accordance National Hockey League Combine guideline ( Gledhill &amp; Jamnik , 2007 ) . 1 . Bench press repetition 150 lb ( include barbell ) perform rate 25 repetition per minute , number consecutive repetition individual keep cadence record . 2 . Sitting medicine ball toss use standard 8 lb medicine ball . Subject sit floor back flat wall leg straight ( hip flex knee extend ) . The ball start chest push . When ball first land measured total distance ( record cm . ) 3 . Standing long jump conduct stand start foot together . The distance jumping line individual heel record total distance ( record cm . ) 4 . Vertical jump conduct stand start . Fingers outstretched dominant arm reach high possible deflect plastic marker . Without pre-step individual jump high possible . Measurement near cm . Cognitive function : Two test conduct computer locate within Exercise Nutrition Research Laboratory . Subjects receive 5 minute complete cognitive test . 1 . Modified Stroop test- measurement attentional fatigue executive function , score base error rate mean response time ( Kane &amp; Kay , 1992 ) . 2 . Trail Making Test Part B- measurement visual attention speed processing , score total time completion ( Sanchez-Cubillo et al. , 2009 ) . Ratings perceive exertion : Will assess sprint interval trial conclusion muscular endurance power test via Borg Scale ( Noble et al. , 1983 ) .</detailed_description>
