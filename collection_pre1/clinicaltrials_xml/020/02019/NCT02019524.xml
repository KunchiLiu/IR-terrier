The study target population patient breast ovarian cancer diagnosis treat without evidence disease . Disease-free subject standard care multi-modality therapy screen HLA type .

	<brief_title>Phase Ib Trial Two Folate Binding Protein Peptide Vaccines ( E39 J65 ) Breast Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , randomize , non-blinded , single-center Phase Ib trial . Patients identified diagnosis breast ovarian cancer , complete standard course therapy disease-free . They properly screen , counsel consent prior enrollment . Once enrolled , patient 's blood test HLA-A2 status ( approximately 50 % HLA-A2+ ) . Additionally , tumor test FBP-expression information track purpose correlative science . Patients HLA-A2+ stratify base cancer diagnosis ( breast versus ovarian ) , randomize computer table one three arm PVS . Each arm receive 6 monthly injection peptide + GM-CSF . Arm A receive six inoculation E39 peptide ; arm B receive three inoculation E39 follow three J65 ; arm C receive three inoculation J65 , follow three E39 . Since J65 previously use human , two week wait period institute first second patient enrol either Arm B C. Immunologic data assess 1 month 6 month ( ±2 wks ) PVS , specifically ex vivo immunologic recognition E39 J65 assess clonal expansion use dextramer assay vivo response assess Delayed Type Hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . Immunologic recognition E39 primary endpoint , recognition J65 serve additional data point . The 6 month post-PVS immunologic data use assess patient significant residual immunity ( SRI ) , define ≥2-fold increase E39-specific CD8+ T-cells pre-vaccination level . Patients sort two group : SRI without . Patients within group randomize receive one booster either J65 E39 . Each patient return clinic within 1-2 week 6mo post-PVS visit receive single booster inoculation . This second randomization result four group : 1 ) patient SRI receive E39 ; 2 ) patient SRI receive J65 ; 3 ) patient without SRI receive E39 ; 4 ) patient without SRI receive J65 . Immunologic data gather 1 month ( ±2 wks ) 6 month ( ±2 wks ) post-booster . This final immunologic data analyze difference four group . Additionally , toxicity data gather . Patients monitor closely one hour inoculation questioning , serial exam , vital sign every 15 minute . Patients ask return vaccine clinic 48-72 hour inoculation question regard local systemic toxicity examine measure local reaction vaccination site . The graded toxicity scale ( NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , v4.03 ) utilize assess local systemic toxicity . GM-CSF dose reduction may require &gt; 10cm erythema induration see injection site give inoculation .</detailed_description>
