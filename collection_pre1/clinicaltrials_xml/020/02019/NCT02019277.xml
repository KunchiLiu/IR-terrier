	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , phase IIIb study ass safety , tolerability efficacy combination therapy intravenous ( IV ) pertuzumab ( Perjeta ) , subcutaneous ( SC ) trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , taxane chemotherapy ( docetaxel , paclitaxel nab-paclitaxel ) first-line therapy participant HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) . All participant treat 3-week cycle pertuzumab IV ( 840 milligram [ mg ] first dose ; subsequent dose 420 mg ) trastuzumab SC ( 600 milligram per 5 milliliter [ mg/5 mL ] ) . The taxane treatment regimen determine investigator . Participants continue therapy disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , participant withdraws consent , whichever occur first . Time study treatment 2 year .</brief_summary>
