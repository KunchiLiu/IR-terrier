EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Psychiatric Risks : Actively suicidal risk suicide Previous current diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , psychosis . Current diagnosis depression . Previous current PTSD . Current diagnosis PCS . Current alcohol drug abuse dependence . Pregnancy . Under treatment major illness injury may put participant high risk participation ( : IV therapy severe infection , chemotherapy cancer , multiple necessary surgical intervention injury , unstable cardiac disease , severe immune dysfunction , etc. ) . History endocrine disorder dysfunction , unless clear via endocrinology consult ( include thyroid , adrenal pituitary disorder ) . Abnormal lab value may indicate endocrine disorder dysfunction ( unless clear endocrine consult ) may suggest major illness describe determined screening clinician . Unstable diabetes .
