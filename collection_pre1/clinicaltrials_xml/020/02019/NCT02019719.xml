OR Of nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone 23.0 116.3 million international unit ( MIU ) /millilitre ( mL ) estradiol &lt; = 10 picograms ( pg ) /mL confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one approve contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Males : must agree use one approve contraceptive method time Screening 2 completion Followup Visit . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) ( Screening 2 verification ) : Bazett 's Correction QT Interval ( QTcB ) &lt; 470 millisecond ( msec ) QTcB &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . There QTc inclusion criterion subject predominantly pace rhythm . Dialysis frequency : On hemodialysis ( HD ) three time weekly least 8 week prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Dialysis adequacy ( Screening 2 ) : A singlepool Kt/Vurea 1.2 base historical value obtain within prior month order ensure adequacy dialysis . If Kt/Vurea available , average last 2 value urea reduction ratio ( URR ) least 65 % . Hemoglobin : Target stable Hgb 9.512.0 g/dL screening . Stable erythropoiesisstimulating agent ( ESA ) dose ( Screening 2 ) : Using ESA ( epoetins biosimilar , darbepoietin ) total weekly dos vary 50 % 4 week prior Screening 2 . Iron replacement therapy : Subjects may stable maintenance oral intravenous ( IV ) ( &lt; 100 milligram [ mg ] /week ) iron supplementation . If subject oral IV iron , dose must stable 4 week prior Screening 2 , Screening 2 Week 4 . Dialysis modality : Planned change HD peritoneal dialysis within study time period . Renal transplant : Renal transplant anticipate schedule within study time period . High ESA dose ( Screening 2 verification ) : As define epoetin dose &gt; =360 IU/kilograms ( kg ) /week IV darbepoetin dose &gt; =1.8 microgram ( μg ) /kg/week IV within prior 8 week Screening 2. methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta ( Screening 2 verification ) : Use methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta within prior 8 week Screening 2 .

Stroke transient ischemic attack : Within 8 week prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Heart failure : Class III/IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system symptomatic right heart failure diagnose prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Hypertension : Defined use predialysis vitals diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg . Thrombotic disease : History thrombotic disease ( e.g. , venous thrombosis deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , arterial thrombosis new onset worsen limb ischemia require intervention ) , except vascular access thrombosis , within 8 week prior Screening 2 Day 1 Eyes : History proliferative retinopathy require treatment within prior 12 month macular edema require treatment.. Inflammatory disease : Active chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) diagnose prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Hematological disease : Any hematological disease include affect platelet , white red blood cell ( e.g . sickle cell anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , hematological malignancy , myeloma , hemolytic anemia thalassemia ) , coagulation disorder ( e.g. , antiphospholipid syndrome , Protein C S deficiency ) , cause anemia renal disease diagnose prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Liver disease : Current liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) evidence Screening abnormal liver function test [ alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ] ; hepatic abnormality opinion investigator ( subinvestigator ) would preclude subject participation study . Major surgery : Major surgery ( exclude vascular access surgery ) within prior 8 week , within Screening 2 Day 1 plan study . Transfusion : Blood transfusion within prior 8 week , within Screening 2 Day 1 anticipate need blood transfusion study . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding : Evidence actively bleed peptic , duodenal , esophageal ulcer disease OR clinically significant GI bleeding within 8 week prior Screening 2 Day 1 . Acute infection : Clinical evidence acute infection history infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 8 week prior Screening 2 Day 1 .
