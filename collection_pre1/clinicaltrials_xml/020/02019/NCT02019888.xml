	<brief_summary>The accurate assessment auditory status critical planning treatment Veterans hearing loss include medical audiological management . Current physiologic test auditory function standard clinical audiological test battery Veterans limit sensitivity detect middle-ear disorder , include direct test cochlear function . Recent study show promise new wide-bandwidth ( WB ) test absorbance improved sensitivity assessment middle-ear function include acoustic reflex test . The addition WB test cochlear function include WB test battery provide opportunity improve audiological diagnosis range hearing disorder Veterans . The automation provide WB test battery could provide additional benefit reduce duration evaluation , leave time evaluation test finding counsel . Results study may lead improvement audiological care Veterans hearing loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Wide Bandwidth Test Battery Auditory Function Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research evaluate comprehensive test battery new wide-bandwidth , i.e. , wideband ( WB ) , acoustical test auditory function differential diagnosis middle ear , cochlear neural pathology population Veterans . WB test refer ear canal test use sound response measure 0.2 kilohertz ( kHz ) frequencies high 8 kHz , bandwidth critical speech perception . There test battery middle-ear assessment use power absorption , cochlear assessment use otoacoustic emission ( OAEs ) acoustic stapedius reflex ( ASR ) use middle ear power absorption . Results compare standard single-frequency clinical immittance test battery routinely use assessment auditory function Veterans . Aim 1 seek evaluate accuracy WB test battery differential diagnosis middle-ear pathology relate conductive hearing loss compare sensitivity specificity WB battery traditional immittance battery follow disorder common Veterans : tympanic membrane perforation , serous otitis medium , cholesteatoma , otosclerosis . Aim 2 seek modify WB ASR test provide automatic detection ASR threshold comparison traditional single-frequency ASR threshold . Aim 3 seek validate use Transient-evoked otoacoustic emission ( TEOAE ) spontaneous otoacoustic emission ( SOAEs ) test Veterans assess cochlear status , evaluate test performance classify ear normal hear sensorineural hearing loss . Finally , Aim 4 seek compare diagnostic accuracy full WB test battery full single-frequency admittance test battery detect type hearing loss include sensorineural , conductive mixed . The hypothesis WB test battery accurate traditional immittance test battery identify ear normal auditory status ear range risk auditory pathology . Methods : Subjects- Human subject recruit study hear evaluation VA Audiology Service Portland VA Medical Center H. Quillen VA Medical Center . These subject respond flyer contact IRB-approved human subject volunteer registry . Additional detail regard recruitment selection criterion may find next section protocol . The investigator recruit approximately equal number subject , total 640 . Data acquire two site total 190 adult subject normal hear 180 adult subject sensorineural hearing loss . These subject recruit three age group : 20-39 year , 40-59 year 60-79 year age comparison normative middle-ear data . Data also acquire site 250 adult subject middle-ear disorder and/or conductive hearing loss age 20-89 year . Of latter group , investigator plan enroll 50 subject tympanic membrane perforation , 50 subject serous otitis medium , 50 subject cholesteatoma , 50 subject otosclerosis , 50 subject unspecified middle-ear disorder . The investigator expect approximately 20 subject ( group , normal hearing , sensorineural hearing loss , middle-ear disorder ) lose screen failure drop study , thus , investigator recruit additional 20 subject replace . This bring total planned number subject recruit study 640 . Testing- All subject receive clinical WB test battery . Each subject test one laboratory visit . Subjects enrol study upon otoscopic inspection ear canal , active drainage ear , ear canal free cerumen ( wax ) impaction , bilaterally . Subjects find drain ear cerumen impaction refer treatment . These individual may enrol study follow successful treatment condition . All subject standard pure-tone air- bone-conduction audiogram comfortably seat sound-treated booth . Standard insert earphone bone-conduction vibrator use present sound stimulus . Next , speech audiometry complete speech reception threshold , uncomfortable loudness test speech , speech recognition score obtain . Then subject standard immittance test battery consist tympanogram acoustic reflex threshold test . Stimuli exceed level 100 decibel hear level ( dB HL ) . Finally , wideband test battery perform adult seat comfortably sound-treated booth . A small probe soft rubber tip insert subject 's ear canal , subject ask remain quiet sound presented ear via sound source within probe . Responses measure use miniature microphone within probe . The test wideband battery similar clinical admittance battery include ambient absorbance , absorbance tympanometry acoustic reflex threshold . The otoacoustic emission test separate measurement inner ear function typically conduct clinic use different equipment .</detailed_description>
