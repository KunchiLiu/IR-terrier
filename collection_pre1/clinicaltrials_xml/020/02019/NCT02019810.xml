	<brief_summary>Severe traumatic brain injury increase intracranial pressure lead decrease cerebral blood flow . Low cerebral blood flow responsible secondary lesion , lead bad prognosis . It yet establish whether increase cardiac output patient lead increase cerebral blood flow , although argument favor hypothesis . The aim study demonstrate increase cardiac output improve cerebral blood flow patient severe traumatic injury high cerebral pressure .</brief_summary>
