	<brief_title>Metformin Carbohydrate Restriction With Platinum Based Chemotherapy In Stage IIIB/IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NS-NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer relate mortality men woman . In U.S. alone , estimate 160,340 lung cancer relate death occur 2012 , account 28 % cancer relate death . Approximately 85 % lung cancer classify non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) roughly two-thirds patient present advanced disease . Histologically , NSCLC subdivide adenocarcinoma , squamous cell , large cell , non-small cell lung cancer classify . Those tumor squamous ( adenocarcinoma , large cell , classify ) collectively term non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer ( NS-NSCLC ) account roughly 75 % non small cell cancer case . The accepted upfront treatment patient advanced stage NSCLC platinum base chemotherapy . Current standard practice treatment stage IV non-squamous NSCLC patient cytotoxic chemotherapy evolve past decade . In sentinel study 2005 , Sandler colleague demonstrate addition bevacizumab platinum doublet chemotherapy ( carboplatin/paclitaxel ) follow maintenance bevacizumab confer survival advantage compare platinum doublet chemotherapy alone ( 12.1 mo vs. 10. mo ) patient stage IV non squamous , non-small cell lung cancer . Following , large phase III study ever conduct stage IV NSCLC randomize 1700 patient stage IV lung cancer either cisplatin/pemetrexed cisplatin/gemcitabine . This study first reveal interaction chemotherapy histology , demonstrate survival advantage subset patient non-squamous cell treat cisplatin/pemetrexed compare treated cisplatin/gemcitabine ( 11.0 vs 10 mo , p &lt; 0.05 . Building upon , recent study evaluate maintenance pemetrexed ( continue treatment four cycle platinum doublet therapy ) non-squamous cell lung cancer demonstrate significant survival advantage patient receive maintenance pemetrexed vs. placebo four cycle cisplatin/pemetrexed ( 13.9 mo vs. 11.0 mo , p &lt; 0.05 ) . Based study , regimen cisplatin carboplatin pemetrexed follow maintenance single agent pemetrexed become one accepted frontline treatment patient stage IV non-squamous , non small cell carcinoma . Recently , firm understand relevant signal pathways critical lung cancer growth , lead development novel , target therapy . The discovery EGFR ALK pathways lung cancer subsequent development drug target pathway , erlotinib crizotinib respectively , yield unprecedented survival time stage IV non-squamous , non small cell lung cancer . Unfortunately , 25 30 % patient harbor mutation , platinum base chemotherapy remain cornerstone treatment 60-70 % patient stage IV disease without identifiable target . In attempt improve outcome , large need remain develop novel , effective agent combine platinum therapy posse favorable toxicity profile reasonable cost . Metformin : Metformin , oral biguanide agent use treatment non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , prescribe 120 million people worldwide . Its glucose lowering effect result inhibition liver gluconeogenesis increase insulin sensitivity peripheral tissue . Metformin limit adverse effect little risk hypoglycemia healthy , nondiabetic control . In addition anti-diabetic property , metformin demonstrate chemopreventative therapeutic effect prostate breast cancer . Jiralersprong et al report diabetic patient breast cancer receive metformin 24 % complete pathological response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy compare 8 % non-metformin group . More recently Joshua et al report reduced tumor Ki-67 rate well significant reduction fast glucose , insulin growth factor 1 BMI ( body mass index ) prostate cancer patient receive neoadjuvant metformin prior radical prostatectomy . Large epidemiological study consistently show substantially low incidence cancer occurrence death diabetic patient take metformin compare receiving therapy . Most recently , retrospective study patient ovarian cancer find 5-year disease-specific survival significantly well diabetic patient take metformin ( 67 % vs 47 % ; P = .007 ) . Based important observational study , currently several , ongoing prospective study evaluate metformin nondiabetic patient early stage late stage breast cancer prostate cancer , respectively . The role metformin preventative therapeutic agent lung cancer begin assess . A recent epidemiological study Taiwan demonstrate 39-45 % decrease risk lung cancer diabetic patient treat antidiabetic drug include metformin versus take agent . These study trigger preclinical clinical observational trial support metformin 's potential antineoplastic agent . In recent vitro study , Ashinuma et al . able demonstrate inhibit clonogenicity , cell growth proliferation four different human lung cancer cell line expose variable concentration metformin . These preclinical data trigger vivo experiment mouse . Memmott colleague show oral administration 1 5mg/mL metformin decrease lung tumor burden 38 % 53 % respectively A/J mouse inject tobacco carcinogen 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1 byutanone ( NNK ) . Importantly , steady state level metformin similar achieve diabetic patient use metformin , suggest treatment prevention lung cancer could achieve standard oral dosing . Finally , two observational study human reinforce metformin 's potential role therapeutic agent lung cancer . In first , Mezzone et al . show diabetic patient lung cancer previously treat metformin thiazolidinediones low incidence metastatic disease time diagnosis reduce risk death compare receive treatment . More recently , retrospective study perform Tan et al . evaluate outcomes three group diabetic patient NSCLC treat first line chemotherapy receive various diabetic drug . In study , patient treat chemotherapy metformin superior outcome compare patient treat chemotherapy insulin drug metformin ( OS , 20 month vs. 13.1 month vs 13.0 month , respectively , p=0.007 ) . The remarkable activity agent preclinical clinical lung cancer model well low toxicity tolerability non diabetic patient warrant prospective study evaluate therapeutic efficacy platinum base chemotherapy NSCLC . Metformin 's Biological Effects : A nascent understanding metformin 's biological effect malignant cell may provide explanation aforementioned preclinical clinical observation solidifies basis clinical exploration . Preclinical model suggest variety mechanism include inhibition `` energy sensing '' pathway involve cellular growth , interference IGF1-insulin axis blockade VEGF . Metformin think activate AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , major sensor cellular energy level key enzyme limit cellular growth time cellular stress . Once activate , enzyme restrict anabolic process protein , cholesterol fatty acid synthesis inhibits mTOR , protein kinase responsible dysregulated growth . MTOR upregulated variety tumor , include NSCLC provide rationale exploit pathway metformin . Secondly , metformin revers hyperinsulinemia lead regulation insulin-like growth factor ( IGFs ) . These factor associate malignant non-malignant tumorogenesis via aberrant activation PI3K/Akt pathway , well know pathway contribute tumorigenesis . Finally , metabolic reprogramming oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis , know Warburg effect , hallmark cancer cell constitute undisputed advantage tumor growth . Despite glycolytic shift , malignant cell retain capacity continue oxidative phosphorylation energy production may enhance malignant potential . In vivo model indicate metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I thereby suppress oxidative phosphorylation may force cell engage survival process like autophagy lead eventual cell death . In summary , metformin 's inhibition tumor cell growth disrupt MTOR insulin pathway AMP kinase activation represent novel way treat lung cancer .</detailed_description>
