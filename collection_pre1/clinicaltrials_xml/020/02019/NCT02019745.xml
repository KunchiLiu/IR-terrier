	<brief_summary>Chronic exposure ( cigarette smoke ) CS cause biological change , include airway remodel change baseline gene expression profile level epithelium . Our data indicate chronic exposure CS suppress ability epithelial cell enhance antiviral gene expression response influenza infection activate host defense response . While large body evidence support notion exposure CS cause significant change host defense response , may link permanent change epithelial cell genomic level , know whether new emerge tobacco product similar distinct effect . Using live attenuate influenza virus ( LAIV ) inoculation human volunteer , study compare influenza-induced response non-smokers ( NS ) , cigarette smoker ( CS ) , e-cigarette smoker ( EC ) , hookah smoker ( HS ) , Little Cigar smoker ( LCS ) vivo . This do analyzing nasal viral titer , antiviral defense response , inflammatory mediator production , marker immune response LAIV-induced response different group volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke ( CS ) , e-cigarette smoke ( EC ) , hookah smoke ( HS ) , Little Cigar smoke ( LCS ) -exposed population stratify base response smoke diary , protocol questionnaire , well urine cotinine level ( present three group ) . We aware many current smoker poly-tobacco product user ( i.e . smoke cigarette addition non-cigarette product ) , could confound observation . This control potential volunteer complete smoke diary provide daily urine sample 1 week prior enrol study . Based diary , subject group CS ( cigarette ) , EC ( e-cigarette smoker smoke less ½ pack cigarette per week ) , HS ( hookah smoker smoke less ½ pack cigarette per week ) , LCS ( little cigar smoker smoke less ½ pack cigarette per week ) . Individuals mixed exposure exceed describe ( i.e . smoke ½ pack cigarette per week addition smoking hookah , e-cigarettes , Little Cigars ) exclude study . Potential subject complete questionnaire regard smoke history , undergo urine collection measurement cotinine 7 consecutive day . Subjects assign different group follow : Group NS ( routine exposure tobacco smoke , average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0 ) , Group CS ( active cigarette smoker log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio &gt; 4 ) , Group EC ( active e-cigarette smoker average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4 ) , Group HS ( active routine hookah smoker average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4 ) , Group LCS ( active routine Little Cigars smoker average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4 ) . Study protocol outline : Screening visit ( 2-4 week prior Day 0 ) : Obtain informed consent , history ( include smoke exposure questionnaire ) , physical examination , vital sign ( VS ) , blood draw ( anti-influenza antibody titer , HIV T cell stimulation flu antigen ) , urine ( cotinine ) , nasal lavage ( NL , differential cell count , viral culture antigen detection , cytokine panel ) , nasal epithelial lining fluid ( ELF , collect filter paper cytokine analysis ) , nasal epithelial biopsy ( NB ) # 1 , pregnancy test females child bear potential . In addition , smoker undergo spirometry . Subjects return research lab daily week prior D0 provide urine sample cotinine . Subjects give daily smoking/exposure diary time continue throughout study . Day 0 ( Monday ) : Obtain VS , NL , ELF , urine . Administer FluMist . Day 1 ( Tuesday ) : Obtain VS , NL , ELF , urine , NB # 2 Day 2 ( Wednesday ) : Obtain VS , NL , ELF , urine Day 8 +/- 1 day ( Monday-Wednesday ) : Obtain VS , NL , ELF , urine , NB # 3 Day 21 +/- 7 day : Obtain VS , blood draw , collect complete smoking/exposure diary</detailed_description>
