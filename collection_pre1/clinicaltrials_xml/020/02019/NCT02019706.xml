	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Adults possible ectopic Cushing syndrome Age 1890 Patients must willing return NIH followup study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant lactate woman . A pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential ( age 55 ) unless history hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy . Children ( age le 18 ) exclude . Because ectopic ACTH secretion rare age group , likelihood benefit less balance risk radiation . Very elderly patient ( &gt; 90 year ) For mifepristone study : Patients take medication alter CYP3A4 activity eligible mifepristone study , since P450 system metabolize mifepristone . Patients hypokalemia ( K &lt; 3.5 mEq/L ) , despite medical therapy replacement mineralocorticoid antagonist also exclude mifepristone study . Such patient may participate component protocol . Medications affect CYP3A4 may adjust allow participation mifepristone component , one week washout period . The presence severe active infection . clinically significantly impaired cardiovascular ( e.g . history abnormally low ejection fraction , presence moderate pulmonary fluid overload , and/or blood pressure 190/100 ) , abnormal coagulation absence medicallyindicated treatment ( PT PTT elevate 30 % normal value ) , hematopoietic ( hematocrit le 30 % , hemoglobin 10 g/dl , white count 3000 K/UL , platelets 100,000 K/mm ( 3 ) ) , hepatic ( liver enzymes elevate 4fold normal value ) , renal function ( plasma creatinine level 2.1 ) . Based clinical judgment attend physician , medical problem may prompt exclusion . impaired mental capacity markedly abnormal psychiatric condition precludes informed consent . body weight 136 kg , limit table use scan area . combine blood withdrawal six week precede study great 450 ml . know allergy [ ( 111 ) InDTPADPhe ] pentetreotide somatostatin analogue . strong evidence Cushing disease . This include central peripheral ACTH gradient IPSS lesion pituitary MRI . We anticipate exclusion criterion increase ratio patient ectopic ACTH syndrome Cushing disease usual 1 : 8 1 : 2 , thus would accrue 3 patient identify one ectopic ACTH secretion .</criteria>
