	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance care mother newborn infant , many infant ( approximately 20 per 1000 live birth ) continue need resuscitation birth . A proportion infant sustain significant injury interruption blood oxygen supply prior delivery ( perinatal asphyxia ) . In 2-3 baby per 1000 lead brain swell risk long term brain injury call neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) . HIE remain cause neonatal death long term disability . Early accurate prediction outcome would allow u intervene window first 6 hour follow birth , prior secondary reperfusion secondary brain injury . Estimating severity injury difficult newborn infant . Condition birth predict neonatal , long term outcome . Biomarkers could measure time birth analyse bedside would offer infant best chance timely effective intervention . Through BIHIVE study identify number predictive biomarkers hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy .

	<detailed_description>Background current knowledge area : Perinatal asphyxia one commonest cause neonatal death long term disability , occur 20 per 1000 live birth . Of , approximately 2-3 per 1000 go develop hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) ( 1 ) . In Ireland UK HIE third commonest cause neonatal mortality , account 9 % death , 21 % term death , globally estimate cause 1 million neonatal death year . For survivor significant secondary morbidity associate , include cerebral palsy ( 15 % ) , severe cognitive delay ( 11 % ) , seizure disorder ( 8 % ) , sensori-neural deafness ( 7 % ) , visual loss ( 3 % ) ( 2 ) . HIE evolve process , simplify two insult . The initial insult significant cerebral hypoxia and/or ischaemia follow energy depletion , anaerobic metabolism lead accumulation lactate , loss cellular integrity . This set motion cascade event resultant formation free radical , proteases caspase lead cell damage apoptosis , secondary insult ( 3 ) . The secondary energy failure show occur 6-48 hour initial insult . Until recently therapeutic intervention could reduce associate morbidity mortality exist . However recent publication several international trial , subsequent meta-analysis show early induced hypothermia beneficial HIE , improve survival reduce neurological disability ( 4-5 ) . Induced hypothermia become standard care moderate/severe HIE . However effective must commence within 6 hour delivery , secondary energy failure occur . In narrow window time population would benefit treatment must identify , resuscitate , stabilise cool . Unfortunately ability recognise diagnose would benefit therapy always possible within time period . We show current standard method identify risk HIE acid-base balance , lactate Apgar score initial neurological assessment unreliable ( 6 ) . Neonatal electroencephalography ( EEG ) useful grade encephalopathy excellent predictor long term outcome . In particular evolution first 24 hour follow delivery strongly correlate outcome ( 7 ) . However require highly specialised skill set rarely available neonatologist acute setting . Amplitude integrated EEG widely use clinician , interpretation user dependent , majority neonatologists report confident interpretive ability ( 8 ) . The need early reliable prediction outcome HIE never great . A quick , cheap , reproducible , non-user dependent method quantify severity HIE likely prognosis urgent need . Many biochemical haematological marker propose perinatal asphyxia , none lead clinical advance , commercially viable bedside test ( 9 ) . Over last 2 year , Cork University Maternity Hospital , BIHIVE study ( Biomarkers Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy study ) identify potential biochemical marker umbilical cord blood accurately identify infant progress moderate/severe encephalopathy ( 10,11 ) . The BIHIVE study adopt multifaceted approach identify blood-borne biomarkers HIE 1 ) target proteomic profiling use Luminex technology 2 ) miRNA profile 3 ) comprehensive map blood metabolome use Mass Spectrometry Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technique . Our aim recruit cohort infant clearly define perinatal asphyxia HIE , classify use repeat neurological assessment multichannel EEG . At time birth , umbilical cord blood drawn , process bank , use strict standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) develop purpose . These procedure ensure specimen suitable later proteomic , metabolomic , transcriptomic genomic analysis . Using system biology approach study multiple propose marker store umbilical cord blood discovery cohort , initially focus proteome metabolome . Through work already identify number biomarkers present umbilical cord blood potential predict development moderate/severe HIE . Our early data extremely promise . Our initial metabolomic analysis show differentiate HIE control area curve ( AUROC ) 0.92 . Further analysis require identify quantify exact metabolite peak produce differentiation . We wish validate finding cohort infant perinatal asphyxia HIE , validate ability predict long term neurological outcome . Our pilot work examine microRNA change cord blood infant moderate/severe HIE also encourage significant upregulation multiple study miRNAs asphyxia HIE . The promising miRNAs quantify use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplication validate discovery cohort . Future cohort-BIHIVE2 : To develop marker point validate marker &gt; 90 % sensitivity specificity moderate/severe HIE need recruit cohort carefully recruit infant high quality biobanking birth detailed clinical phenotyping . This main work current application . We require cohort 300 infant perinatal asphyxia , 60 develop HIE 30 develop moderate severe HIE . We also need recruit 300 contemporary control infant . To recruit number infant perinatal asphyxia need study 30,000 live birth . We therefore expand study centre include Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , large state art maternity hospital 10,000 live birth per annum . Further validation allow u develop algorithm clinical biochemical marker provide sensitive specific predictive test moderate/severe HIE . Neurodevelopmental follow cohort allow u assess ability predict neurodevelopmental behavioural outcome 2 year . Lastly examine exact timing biomarker alteration use time animal model hypoxic-ischaemic injury ( HI ) . In clinical study hypoxic-ischaemic injury unpredictable timing often impossible estimate . Dr Tracey Bjorkmann Queen 's University , Brisbane develop piglet model HI produce HI induces seizures level injury equate moderate severe HIE ( 12 ) . She agree collaborate programme provide piglet sample serum take 0,1,2 12 hour follow HI . These sample invaluable examine progression biomarker derangement help u time neonatal brain injury delivery .</detailed_description>
