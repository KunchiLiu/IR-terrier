	<brief_title>Enhanced Natural Killer Cell Activity RBAC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate outcome 60-day trial Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound ( RBAC ) among adult . Specifically , subject participate two-group , randomize intervention base nutritional supplement make water soluble extract rice bran partially hydrolyze action natural enzyme complex extract Shitake mushroom . One group take 1 gram/day group take 3 gram/day compare difference outcomes two group . We hypothesize 3 gram/day condition demonstrate faster increase outcome compare 1 gram/day condition . The primary outcome study Natural Killer ( NK ) cell activity , cytokine , total bilirubin , creatinine , liver function test . These outcome compare subject enrol two treatment group 60 day . No substantial psychological , medical , social risk exist participant , minor discomfort associate venipuncture . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report IRB . The component RBAC harmless without significant food allergy . No serious , untoward side effect report company consumer observe previous human study . If side effect occur , remedy discontinue asymptomatic , reintroduce 1/4 dosage , increase amount every 2 day , uneventful , full dosage achieve . Dr. Ali provide additional follow-up consultation subject experience untoward side effect . A toxicology search component reveals unique toxicity characteristic material . As report Daiwa Health Development , manufacturer product , thousand people currently use RBAC ( trade name BRM4 PeakImmune 4 ) , Daiwa unaware significant toxicity . Daiwa apply late scientific method ensure value safety raw material . Daiwa product manufacture state-of-the-art facility , strict quality control environmental protection standard . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study , although may undergo psychological physical discomfort sometimes . The process interview assessment may cause discomfort . Discomfort fatigue may also experience complete assessment battery . Alternatives study enhance immune system function include prescription medication , exercise , dietary modification , nutritional supplement . The risk medication significant , include life-threatening , risk take nutritional supplement totally understood , since regulate US Food Drug Administration . Medications nutritional supplement , part change lifestyle behavior , may also prove beneficial immune system function , long-term use unknown consequence . The information obtain study help determine efficacy use rice bran extract nutritional supplement enhance immune system outcome . By participate study , subject may experience improved NK cell activity cytokine functioning . The risk participate study reasonable potential enhancement immune system function improve nutritional status .</detailed_description>
