	<brief_summary>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) result 200 etiological pathway arise several different insult lung parenchyma : inhaled substance , drug side effect , connective tissue disease , infection , malignancy . The disease also idiopathic origin . If prolong , result inflammation cause permanent progressive fibrotic reorganization parenchyma small airway , reduces distensibility lung impedes O2 CO2 exchange . This study randomize control trial determine safety efficacy aerobic exercise patient interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) uncomplicated pulmonary hypertension . In uncontrolled study , observe efficient cardiorespiratory function , increase physical work capacity , improve health-related quality life follow aerobic exercise study population . Serious adverse event result aerobic exercise training observe work date establish plausibility efficacy aerobic exercise training safety patient ILD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The NIH Exercise Therapy Advanced Lung Disease Trials : Response Adaptation Aerobic Exercise Patients With Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two primary treatment condition . Patients ILD randomize either intervention consist aerobic exercise training plus patient education control condition include patient education . Aerobic exercise training consist 10-week regimen supervise treadmill walk three time week . The duration exercise session progress 30 minute 45 minute per session 10 week , tolerate . The intensity exercise determine base result cardiopulmonary exercise test . Those randomize control initially engage aerobic exercise training . There , however , secondary study : crossover design subject control group complete aerobic exercise regimen . - Participants must age 21 80 live within reasonable travel distance great Washington D.C. area - All pre post testing conduct NIH Clinical Center Bethesda , Maryland . Each test session last 6 hour consist medical history examination ; six questionnaires health , fatigue , activity , mood ; electrocardiogram , transthoracic echocardiogram , pulmonary function test , six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) ; urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) . Other required test : - A maximum treadmill test : The exercise begin easy level gradually increase participant say long continue investigator decides safe continue . Participants fit mask , electrode light sensor measure well heart work well muscle use oxygen . - An arterial occlusion muscle oxygenation capacity test : : During seat rest , light sensor measure oxygen level muscle place calf pressure cuff place around thigh . The cuff rapidly inflate hold high pressure 10 minute deflate . - A blood sample complete blood count Nt-ProBNP ( hormone indicate damage heart muscle ) . - Aerobic exercise training education may take place either NIH Clinical Center Bethesda , Maryland , Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program INOVA Fairfax Hospital Falls Church , Virginia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A diagnosis interstitial lung disease , include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis ( NSIP ) , sarcoidosis , form chronic lung fibrosis base clinical context via clinic note pulmonologist . Individuals ILD refer pulmonary rehabilitation 2180 year age live Washington metropolitan area . No episodes fainting significant chest pain least one month . No prior pulmonary rehabilitation receive within last 6 month currently maintenance program . Physically inactive ( participation structure exercise program define 30 minute exercise 3 day week within last 6 month ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Other medical condition would impair aerobic capacity ability engage physical activity , include pulmonary , cardiovascular , neurological , musculoskeletal metabolic condition Other medical condition may pose risk exercise test training determine investigator ( example , peripheral vascular disease ) Diagnosis pulmonary hypertension Inability maintain rest oxygen saturation great equal 90 % SpO2 , measure pulse oximetry supplemental oxygen Inability complete treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test . Significant hepatic renal dysfunction . Metastatic cancer life expectancy le one year . Active substance abuse . Severe psychiatric disease Antiretroviral therapy Pregnancy Ongoing tobacco use Acceptance onto lung transplant wait list Active participation ILD drug trial Inability read English</criteria>
