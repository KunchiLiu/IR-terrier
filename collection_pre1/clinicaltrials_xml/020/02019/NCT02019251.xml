	<brief_title>Lung Transplant Subjects Using 19F MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study 10 lung transplant recipients post lung transplantation whose post-transplant status monitor accord local standard care . Each subject receive 20 liter PFP/oxygen gas mixture contrast agent visualize airway alveolar space lung use 19F magnetic resonance imaging inert gas/oxygen mixture . The goal study evaluate utilization conventional 'thermally ' polarize perfluorinated gas mixed oxygen exogenous inert contrast agent image airway space subject transplant lung . This open label proof concept study expand work Duke . The central hypothesis current observation PFx gas , use contrast agent , provide functional image lung airway include important regional ventilation information ventilation defect severity gas trapping . We test central hypothesis accomplish overall objective addressing follow specific aim : Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1 : Determine qualitative quantitative measure lung ventilation performance term ventilation efficiency wash-in evaluation 19F image lung airspace . Aim 2 : Determine qualitative quantitative measure lung ventilation performance term direct measure gas trapping measure washout perfluorinated gas mixture . The outcomes work propose aim expect demonstrate non-invasive novel quantitative approach evaluation regional lung function subject lung transplant would allow repeat evaluation lung function post-transplant monitor chronic allograft rejection .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment trial : Subjects must â‰¥ 18 year age ; Post single double lung transplant ; Subjects willing able comply schedule visit trial procedure Subjects present follow included trial : Unable undergo 3.0Tesla MRI exam lung chest contraindication ( e.g . metal eye , claustrophobia ) ; Unable receive gas mixture breathe contraindication ; Participation clinical trial study drug may impact lung function past 14 day ; Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry trial .
