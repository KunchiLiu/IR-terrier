	<brief_summary>It show single high dose steroid surgery may reduce pain first 48 hour insertion new joint knee , call `` total knee arthroplasty '' ( TKA ) . Consequently , introduced standard treatment patient several Danish orthopedic department . Although concern possibility increase risk prosthesis infection , prove previous study . However study , limited number patient do use standardized perioperative set-up . This study make monitor safety single high dose steroid injection TKA , regard prosthesis infection within one year surgery . We hypothesize increase infection patient receive steroid injection TKA compare historical cohort patent receive steroid injection TKA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order reduce pain intensity much possible surgical procedure , modern multimodal analgesic strategy use different analgetics target different mechanism pain reception system use . At time may reduce use opioids , commonly cause sideeffects nausea , vomit , obstipation , urinary retention , itching , respiratory suppression sedation . In spite use wide perioperative multimodal analgesia , pain total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , stil considerable clinical problem need optimisation immediate postoperative pain treatment . There evidence `` high '' dose glucocorticoid administer preoperatively reduces level pain use opioids surgery . A recent review give cause concern regard use glucocorticoid TKA , find data longterm safety aspect lack , recommendation could make . As limited evidence presently point af benefit glucocorticoid without serious side effect , treatment introduced standard treatment TKA several department participate Lundbeck Foundation Centre fast-track Hip Knee Replacement collaboration . This study make monitor safety high dose steroid injection TKA , regard prosthesis infection within one year surgery . We hypothesize increase infection patient receive steroid injection TKA compare historical cohort patent receive steroid injection TKA .</detailed_description>
