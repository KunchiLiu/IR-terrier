	<brief_title>Second Study Assess Different Ablation Strategies Achieving Long-Term Arrhythmia Control Patients With Persistent Long Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AF ablation procedure evolve considerably currently accept technique involve creation circumferential Radiofrequency Ablation lesion around PV ostia ( encircle wide area around leave right side vein ) . We find target area outside pulmonary vein trigger atrial premature beat AF important optimize success AF ablation . The methodology additional lesion creation remain non-uniform , lack mechanistic insight , paucity prospective randomize comparison long term efficacy safety various lesion combination achieve AF control . Our group recently conduct randomize study ( RASTA Trial ) compare PVI combine ablation document non-PV trigger ( standard AF ablation strategy ) AF two strategy i.e . 1 . PVI combine empiric ablation common non-PV trigger site AF , 2 . PVI combine ablation location demonstrate complex fractionate electrograms . In study comprise 156 subject persistent and/or long stand persistent AF , investigator find standard AF ablation strategy efficacious PVI combine empiric ablation common non-PV trigger site AF approach significantly well PVI combined ablation location demonstrate complex fractionate electrograms . Our study also show compare standard AF ablation strategy ( PVI combine ablation document non PV AF trigger ) , PVI combine empiric ablation common location AF trigger leave right atrium show 22 % high odds achieve freedom atrial arrhythmias 33 % high odds achieve arrhythmia control one year . Although difference may clinically meaningful , reach statistical significance study power test difference ≥30 % group . Thus , current proposal investigator hope show statistical difference outcome two strategy increase sample size provide adequate power show 20 % difference primary outcome . Also , investigator hope enhance outcome study arm ( PVI combine empiric ablation common location AF trigger ) also target empirically location leave right atrium show recent study focal source rotor maintain AF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient age ≥ 18 year , undergo first ablation procedure meet American College Cardiology / American Heart Association define criterion persistent long stand persistent AF eligible participate propose study . This include patient history AF episodes last least 7 day require least 2 cardioversions . Patients paroxysmal AF ( selfterminating episode last &lt; 7 day ) Patients previous AF ablation procedure Failure obtain informed consent Patients &lt; 18 year age . Investigators plan exclude paroxysmal AF patient concentrate patient persistent long stand persistent AF may require ablation achieve well outcome . Patients undergone previous AF ablation procedure exclude since prior methodology use may confound result study .</criteria>
