	<brief_summary>Patients cirrhosis particularly prone infection frequently precipitant hepatic encephalopathy , renal failure circulatory collapse . Bacterial infection particular concern patient cirrhosis poorly tolerate . Sepsis associate endotoxaemia whereby bacteria produce inflammatory particle occur approximately 40 % hospitalized patient cirrhosis major cause death . Gut-derived blood-borne pathogen induce inflammatory response within liver spleen , major organ remove bacteria endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide - LPS bacterial DNA ) bloodstream . Several mechanism identify proposed process depend upon balance barrier function gut 'detoxifying ' capacity liver . People establish liver cirrhosis show escape endotoxin bloodstream produce bacteria reside intestine , become permeable 'leaky ' . Gut dysfunction define change type bacteria within gut overall permeability allow bacterial product would otherwise contain within gut travel bloodstream lymphatic system detrimental effect elsewhere body . This passage bacterial product term bacterial translocation , 's effect liver general immune system measure . It become recognised certain type white blood cell neutrophils monocyte become dysfunctional predisposes infection may also direct pathogenic role hepatic encephalopathy . Thus neutrophil monocyte may novel pharmacotherapeutic target condition current therapy bowel aperient ( e.g . lactulose ) inadequate . A therapeutic strategy utilise Rifaximin , non-absorbable antibiotic , modulate gut bacterial produce ammonia , chemical know important cause hepatic encephalopathy , could potentially lower gut-derived systemic inflammation , endotoxaemia , infection organ dysfunction population improve outcome prolong transplant-free survival . We therefore plan test Rifaximin positively affect marker immune dysfunction patient liver cirrhosis experience chronic hepatic encephalopathy 30 day treatment , primary research question . Positive result study would support trial potential benefit use Rifaximin improve immune function , well reduce recurrence hepatic encephalopathy , patient liver cirrhosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial Mechanistic Effects Rifaximin Cirrhosis Chronic Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview The study design conduct double blind placebo control randomise control trial - Clinical Trial Investigational Medicinal Product . This study perform patient refer King 's Liver Unit assessment management chronic overt hepatic encephalopathy ( ≥ Grade 1 ) ≥2 episodes overt hepatic encephalopathy previous 6 month . The study perform 50 patient cirrhosis chronic hepatic encephalopathy [ 25 Rifaximin 25 placebo ] age 18 75 year manage within Liver Unit King 's College Hospital large tertiary Liver Transplant Centre within UK . For purpose study patient consider cirrhosis fulfil 2 3 diagnostic criterion confirmatory liver histology , biochemistry and/or radiologic finding consistent cirrhosis/portal hypertension , present chronic persistent overt hepatic encephalopathy ( ≥ grade 1 ) ≥2 episodes overt hepatic encephalopathy previous 6 month . Patient demographic , clinical detail ( include Westhaven hepatic encephalopathy grade ) blood haematology , biochemistry ( include venous ammonia ) , microbiology data neutrophil function assess collated baseline follow 30 90 day Rifaximin therapy placebo . Intestinal permeability assess use intestinal disaccharide test . Faecal microbiota analysis perform deep pyrosequencing technique plasma endotoxemia measure ( lipopolysaccharide level ) bacterial DNA quantification marker bacterial translocation . These measure 3 time point : baseline 30 90 day initiation Rifaximin therapy match placebo . Investigations Patients undergo intestinal functional test within 7 day recruitment , whereby administer test solution cupful ( 150mls ) different type non-absorbable sugar , drunk liquid form participant . Prior ingestion , baseline sample obtain follow : ) blood sample - analysis intestinal &amp; immune ( dy ) function , metabonomic analysis ii ) urine sample - intestinal ( dy ) function &amp; metabonomic analysis iii ) stool sample - faecal biomarker microbiota analysis 1v ) ascitic sample ( clinically indicate ) - surplus fluid analyse bacterial translocation immune ( dy ) function Once test solution ingest , blood sample obtain via cannula place vein , usually arm , prior start test , allow sample without cause discomfort patient . A total 15 sample obtain 5 hour period , interval range 20-30mins , 6mls per sample . At end test , 5 hour interval , urine sample collect allow intestinal functional testing . This exactly procedure specify approve 'The Gut-Liver Axis Liver Disease &amp; Liver Transplantation ' study ( REC ref : 12/LO/1417 ) . Where participant undergo sample ascitic fluid clinical reason fluid excess pathology 's requirement analyse along peripheral blood sample . Ascitic sample take patient decision make take sample clinical reason ( decision investigator ) . No increased volume sample would require . Clinical outcome ( development recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy , organ failure infection ) record total 90 day . Analysis sample - site Blood , urine ascitic sample analyse Institute Liver Studies King 's College Hospital laboratories various test determine intestinal immune function undertaken . Stool sample analyse laboratory King 's College Hospital Franklin-Wilkins Building , King 's College London , faecal biomarkers faecal microbiota analysis perform , respectively . Metabolic analysis metabonomic profile carried Imperial College London ( St Mary 's Hospital South Kensington Campus ) . Protocol A detailed list test analyse perform find protocol . Study-specific flow chart also provide step-by-step representation study , visually represent study process include participant recruitment , randomisation , sample protocol analysis three time point follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
