	<detailed_description>The goal radiation therapy treat define tumor spare surround normal tissue receive dose specify tolerance dos . There evidence improve local control survival high dos radiation , however , time need spare normal tissue higher dos radiation . Technologies allow delivery increase radiation dose tumor spar normal tissue potential improve therapeutic ratio . However , development technology hamper organ respiratory motion particularly case lung liver . Inadequate radiation coverage tumor secondary organ motion lead deliver low dose portion tumor . Making field radiation large account organ motion result unnecessary radiation dose surround healthy tissue . It therefore desirable document extent motion organ question prior carry radiation treatment planning . The organ motion impact directly radiation dose distribution treatment volume .</detailed_description>
