	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine 1. practical treat moderately severely brain injured patient problem balance mobility group `` boot camp '' ( 3 day week , 6 hours/day 4 week ) exercise class . 2 . If show improvement compare 4 week receive treatment 3 . If electronic daily monitoring center foot pressure standardize balance task allow u see small change ability . A baseline assessment outcome measure perform . This repeat 4 week later . The intervention deliver ( 4 week ) follow assessment outcome measure perform one week later . A follow Primary outcome measure , PART-O participation questionnaire do 12 week later . Participants attend group therapy consist variety exercise design specifically target balance mobility deficit base concept Repetitive Functional Task Practice ( RFTP ) , recovery function occur result neural adaptation . Exercises individualize ( deliver circuit ) group activity . Supervision guidance provide registered Physical Therapist Rehabilitation Assistant . During intervention , amount type RFTP , adverse event , need extra staff record daily basis . As well , standardize individualize task perform center foot pressure record daily basis . Analysis : change outcome measure immediately non-intervention compare intervention period statistically determined estimate efficacy treatment model . Descriptive measure RFTP time/day , staff levels/day adverse event use support feasibility safety model .</brief_summary>
