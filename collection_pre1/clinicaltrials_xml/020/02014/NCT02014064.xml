	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine ( MA ) abuse national public health concern . People dependent MA problem mental function ( e.g. , learning , remembering , focus attention , solve problem ) . Such problem interfere treatment MA abuse , thereby may promote continued drug use . While effect MA study rodent non-human primate , effect human brain well characterize . This study nontreatment seek individual use MA compare individual use MA ( control participant ) . The study three goal : 1. aim identify brain region pathway may contribute problem MA abuser perform mental task ; 2. serve double-blind , placebocontrolled , within-subjects study determine safety tolerability , positive effect MA MA-abusing volunteer treat atomoxetine placebo ; 3 . It aim compare brain activity measure structuraland functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . These noninvasive brain imaging procedure , use study brain function control MA use participant take atomoxetine placebo perform test memory concentration . MA abuse participant undergo 1-day outpatient screen safe participant proceed study participate two inpatient phase study occur UCLA research setting , General Clinical Research Center . The first inpatient stay 15 day , second 9 day stay include drug administration assessment . There least two week interval inpatient phase . During inpatient phase participant receive alternate study drug ; atomoxetine placebo four session IV MA administration placebo . The study schedule control participant include 1-day outpatient screen two phase outpatient administration atomoxotime placebo two week study drug free interval phase . Four five outpatient study visit involve cognitive test brain imaging study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As preliminary step , investigator screen experimental data normality potential association outcome variable demographic variable baseline . In case strong deviation normality , log power transformation use appropriate . For subjective effect questionnaire , peak effect identify subject use dependent variable . The primary analytical technique linear mixed effect regression . The general linear mixed model ( GLMM ) equivalent repeat measure ANOVA subject complete data automatically handle miss observation , produce unbiased estimate long value miss random . This approach allow use data subject complete part protocol invalid measurement test , greatly enhance power . The sample size large great previous human laboratory study assess safety initial efficacy agonist-like pharmacotherapies stimulant dependence . For example , previous study use sample 7 ( Herin et al. , 2010 ; Stoops et al. , 2008 ; Dackis et al. , 2003 ) , 10 ( Sofuoglu et al. , 2009 ) subject obtain significant reduction subjective effect d-amphetamine atomoxetine cocaine modafinil . To conservative , investigator base power estimate completers use available data 30 subject GLMM analyse . This substantially increase power ( power GLMM repeat measure ANOVA equivalent except ANOVA utilize incomplete data , GLMM ) .</detailed_description>
