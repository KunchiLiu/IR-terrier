	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) extremely variable heterogeneous syndrome define acute cardiopulmonary dysfunction require emergent artificial ventilation support . For patient ARF , mortality rate high general ICU mortality , estimate range 15-40 % depend subgroup evaluate . In large , recent report ARF , in-ICU mortality 31 % overall in-hospital mortality rate 37 % . Muscle weakness independent risk factor mortality ARF contribute long-term reduction physical function survivor . Muscle ultrasounds non-invasive , quick reproducible . They provide opportunity ICU staff create patient-specific exercise prescription base functional assessment importantly degree muscle architecture abnormality detect ultrasound . Serial examination muscle ultrasound image obtain mechanically ventilated acute respiratory failure patient allow well understanding time course specific muscle ' architectural abnormality resolution abnormality within hospital survivor . With study , well able understand relationship pattern resolution muscle architectural abnormality within context multiple clinical abnormality therapy present render ICU patient . Muscle sample use conjunction ultrasound patient ARF allow characterization extent mechanism underlie ARF induced muscle dysfunction patient . Furthermore , ultrasound guide muscle sample allows procedure do efficient effective manner . Study participant consist 30 patient ARF admit Intensive Care Units Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center . Muscle ultrasounds occur study enrollment weekly thereafter , also include one image session close hospital discharge possible . Muscle sample occur within 5 day consent approximately 2 month later . Handgrip strength , dynamometer , physical performance test also administer ICU &amp; hospital discharge 2 month post enrollment . The primary outcome investigate possibility relationship ultrasound data , muscle sample data , functional measurement ( length stay , grip strength , SPPB , dynamometer , MRC , simultaneously account severity illness [ APACHE III ] ) .</detailed_description>
