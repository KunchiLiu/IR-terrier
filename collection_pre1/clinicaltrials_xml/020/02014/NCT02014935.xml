	<brief_summary>The poor eating habit sedentary lifestyle young people reflect structural change adult life , lead vascular brain disease . The cerebrovascular accident ( AVC ) represent second cause death throughout country . Presents rapid development clinical sign , provide focal disorder brain function . It necessary knowledge development new treatment technique may minimize sequela cause AVC , common disease great impact public health , represent main cause adult neurological disability , affect basic function limb , motor control balance , strength mobility , involve change daily life low self-esteemIn addition high cost treatment long run . Thus , study aim analyze response low intensity laser prevention pain fatigue induce rectus femoris , vastus patient sequelae spasticity associate effect laser promotes muscle performance muscle activity . It believe study get positive result regard increase time antecedent muscular fatigue associate skeletal muscle performance , normotonics muscle gain strength overcome resistance hypertonic muscle . In way , expect application low intensity Laser Therapy ( LILT ) occur adequacy spasticity , muscle function gain provide high quality physiotherapy care . It known treatment laser skeletal musculature , present positive result peak torque , mean skeletal muscle performance consequently gain increase muscle performance ( LEAL JUNIOR et al , 2010 ; ALMEIDA et al , 2011 ) . Armed information infer low intensity laser therapy spastic muscle , would result improve muscle performance , increase pre-stressing , improve functional capacity individual exercise impose physical therapy . In way , session take satisfactory result jointly provide good quality life patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With course year , become notorious transformation epidemiological profile Brazilian population , progressive decline infectious disease illness narrative gradual growth chronic degenerative disease , particularly cardiovascular disease ( ARAÚJO , 2012 ) According statistic Ministry health , year 2010 record 100 thousand death due cerebrovascular accident ( AVE ) , result sudden interruption blood flow brain , currently responsible lead cause death Brazil ( MINISTRY health , 2012 ) . The heterogeneity Brazilian population , would explain current epidemiological transition , result high rate mortality . The disease circulatory system main cause death Brazil , emphasize cerebrovascular disease , responsible one third death country . The cerebral artery responsible give necessary nutrient source energy neuron , brain require intense blood flow meet high intake nutrient . Being interruption flow oxygen glucose period excess five minute cause irreversible damage brain . Several pathological process cause interruption blood flow certain brain area . Between process include hemorrhage , embolism , stroke disease lead suspension blood flow , therefore deficit supply nutrient . The blood deficit promote change cellular metabolism , lead injury and/or death brain tissue . According estimate , 80 % incidence BIRD arteriolar occlusion result atheroma plate secondary brain artery emboli deprive brain blood supply . The likelihood AVE double every decade life , 55 year age . Although leverage ranking death country , statistic Ministry health 2010 , show decreased mortality rate age group 70 year , represent annual average reduction 3.2 % ( MINISTRY health , 2012 ) . As establish earlier , difference prevalence risk factor among population due high heterogeneity , , different custom , habit lifestyle . So , poor eat habit physical youth population may reflect structural change adulthood , may lead vascular brain disease . Among risk factor associate AVE hypertension , dyslipidemias , diabetes , smoking , alcoholism . In general clinical picture present motor sensory change , may associate deficit cognitive perceptual function damage physical physiological function patient ( DIETZ ; SINKJAER , 2007 ) . Due AVE associate motor disability table , result physical limitation , mainly result spasticity , necessary search way minimise damage . In way , believe help biomedical instrumentation , addition provide quantitative reliable data functional capacity individual , allow development recruitment equipment help evaluation General State patient consequently best result practice neurological rehabilitation . Therefore utmost importance biomedical resource utilization surface electromyography refers method non-invasive monitoring , provide value square root mean square Value ( RMS - R Englishoot Mean Square ) , demonstrate parameter result signal amplitude average power time interval analyze , contain information amount traction unit fire give movement Isokinetic dynamometry bound provide resistance joint movement give range , enable analysis muscle force-related parameter torque , power , endurance . These two feature combine contribute determination time muscle spastic fatigue muscle . On information , session reword concrete limitation patient consequently improvement rehabilitation , automatically improve quality life individual .</detailed_description>
