	<brief_summary>This purpose clinical trial study safety efficacy Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols add-on treatment help stop bleeding vascular , liver , soft tissue , spinal open surgical procedure . Approximately 180 subject treat either Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols ( 120 subject ) Bovine Thrombin JMI® ( 60 subject ) . Subjects evaluate identification target bleed site ( TBS ) control bleed standard surgical technique ineffective impractical require additional treatment stop bleeding . The Investigator ( surgeon ) rate intensity bleed TBS . Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols Bovine Thrombin JMI apply TBS amount bleed TBS examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols Adjunct Hemostasis During Open Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , control , Phase II study evaluate safety efficacy Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols adjunct hemostasis vascular ( IG1202-A ) , hepatic ( IG1202-B ) , soft tissue ( IG1202-C ) , spinal ( IG1202-D ) open surgical procedure . Approximately 180 subject randomize 1 2 treatment group 2:1 ratio : Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols ( 120 subject ) Bovine Thrombin JMI ( 60 subject ) among 4 type surgery . Randomized subject evaluate identification target bleed site ( TBS ) control bleed conventional surgical technique ( include suture , ligature cautery ) ineffective impractical require adjunct treatment achieve hemostasis . The Investigator rate intensity bleed TBS . Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols Bovine Thrombin JMI apply TBS hemostasis assess various timepoints 5-minute observation period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Preoperative ( Baseline Assessments Visit ) hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥9.0 g/dL ( deciliter ) Preoperative ( Baseline Assessments Visit ) fibrinogen level ≥150 mg/dL ( functional method ) . Require one follow procedure : 1 . An elective ( nonemergency ) , open ( nonlaparoscopic ; non endovascular ) surgical procedure involve native arterygraft endtoside proximal anastomosis utilizing coat uncoated polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft ( IG1202A ) . 2 . An elective ( nonemergency ) , open ( nonlaparoscopic ) hepatic resection ( anatomic nonanatomic resection least one anatomical hepatic segment equivalent tissue volume ) ( IG1202B ) . 3 . An elective ( nonemergency ) , open ( nonlaparoscopic ) , surgical procedure involve soft ( nonparenchymous ) tissue ( IG1202C ) . 4 . An elective ( nonemergency ) , spinal surgical procedure epidural venous plexus expose ( IG1202D ) . A target bleed site ( TBS ) identify accord Investigator 's judgment , TBS mild moderate bleeding accord Investigator 's judgment . Requires surgical procedure due trauma ( except spinal surgery ) . Infection anatomic surgical area . History severe ( e.g . anaphylactic ) reaction blood bloodderived ( human animal ) product . Previous known sensitivity Topical Thrombin ( Human ) Grifols component , Bovine Thrombin JMI component , porcine collagen , heparin protamine ( vascular surgery ) component . Receiving organ transplant . Undergoing another concurrent major surgical intervention beyond liver ( applies hepatic surgery [ IG1202B ] ; concurrent intervention pancreas , gall bladder , bile duct , intestine allow ) . Undergoing reoperative procedure , define second , successive , surgical procedure anatomic location . Undergoing vascular procedure surgical session ( applies vascular surgery [ IG1202A ] ; stenting and/or endarterectomy artery allow ) . Undergone therapeutic surgical procedure within 30 day screen ( diagnostic procedure allow ) . Previously include trial ( i.e . subject enrol study ) . TBS identify accord investigator 's judgment . TBS severe bleed accord Investigator 's judgment . Occurrence major intraoperative complication require resuscitation deviation plan surgical procedure . Application topical haemostatic material resection surface liver prior application study treatment ( applies hepatic surgery [ IG1202B ] ) . Radiofrequency precoagulation liver resection surface , except focal use radiofrequency primary haemostatic treatment ( applies hepatic surgery [ IG1202B ] ) . Intraoperative change plan surgical procedure result subject long meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criterion . Application topical haemostatic material cut soft tissue surface prior application study treatment ( applies soft tissue surgery [ IG1202C ] ) .</criteria>
