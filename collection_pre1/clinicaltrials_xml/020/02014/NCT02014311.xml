	<brief_summary>The aim study ass whether clinical management patient recent acute-onset chest pain without acute coronary syndrome may optimize combined coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) + CT myocardial perfusion ( CTP ) guide , rapid diagnostic strategy compare CTA alone . CT diagnostic evaluation potential referral invasive testing perform within 2 week hospital discharge . The follow main hypothesis test : - Combined assessment coronary anatomy myocardial perfusion use 320 MDCT result safe optimized , cost-effective invasive treatment strategy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CArdiac cT Treatment Acute CHest Pain 2 - Myocardial CT Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIAL - Consecutive patient refer chest pain acute coronary syndrome exclude , yet maintain clinical suspicion coronary artery disease include study . Only patient deem clinically suit subsequent invasive evaluation treatment include . METHODS -If patient accept participation trial computerize 1:1 randomization CTA alone ( control group ) CTA CTP combine ( intervention group ) within 2 week discharge conduct . CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion image perform use 320-slice MSCT Toshiba VISION Edition Aquilion One scanner accord recommendation vendor clinical routine develop Rigshospitalet . Based CTA and/or CTP finding patient refer invasive evaluation include fractional flow reserve assessment ( FFR ) treatment within 30 day . Invasive procedure perform accord international guideline frequency revascularization procedure record . Clinical outcome data accord specified secondary endpoint record hospital chart medical registry .</detailed_description>
