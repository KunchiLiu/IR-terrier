	<brief_title>Human Optokinetic Contrast Device ( HOCD ) Measure Visual Function Identify Patients With Without Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol divide two study two separate consent form ( Study 1 Study 2 ) . Study 1 involves optimization device parameter . Study 1 test adult subject history ocular disease ( Study 1A ) ass limit human contrast sensitivity subject definite glaucoma ( Study 1B ) gathering preliminary data comparison . These two pilot sub-studies intend provide rapid data regard device test result support study hypothesis . This strategy help rule false negative false positive adjustment make prior start Study 2 longitudinal data collection . Study 2 involve determination baseline population parameter older population likely age-matched patient glaucoma , well performance patient various level glaucoma severity . Enrollment participant Study 1B begin first 5 participant enrol test Study 1A . Study 2 begin Study 1A B complete . Study 1 : No 20 adult subject history ocular disease 20 adult subject definite glaucoma recruit assist optimization device parameter . Study 1A : The individual patient co-investigators rather volunteer recruit word mouth ( co-employees , resident , research staff , etc . ) willing volunteer time assist development project . Volunteers age &gt; 18 , male female , must self-reported excellent ocular health . Best spectacle correct visual acuity 20/40 better require ( verified Snellen acuity test day participation ) participant must report history glaucoma , retinal disease , amblyopia , ocular trauma , ocular surgery kind exception refractive surgery ( LASIK , PRK , equivalent ) . Study 1B : These individual recruit Alkek Eye Center patient population confirm diagnosis glaucoma age &gt; 18 . Study 2 : Potential subject recruit Department Ophthalmology Baylor College Medicine family . We recruit 100 patient study follow distribution : 1 . 20 normal control age 50 old 2 . 20 patient age 50 old ocular hypertension 3 . 20 patient age 50 old glaucoma suspect 4 . 20 patient age 50 old early moderate glaucoma 5 . 20 patient age 50 old moderate advance glaucoma Study 1 : Subjects participate portion study attend one single visit : 1 ) Informed consent obtain inclusion/exclusion criterion confirm . Demographic information , ocular history , refraction , visual acuity information collect patient . Additional clinical data also collect Study 1B participant . Information collect include name , date birth , ethnicity , gender , ocular history ( surgery , etc ) , type glaucoma ( Study 1B ) , current visual acuity , refraction , central corneal thickness ( Study 1B ) , intraocular pressure ( Study 1B ) , recent slit lamp exam include lens status ( Study 1B ) , recent dilate exam include optic nerve appearance ( Study 1B ) , recent automate perimetry result ( Humphrey visual field , Study 1B ) 2 ) Snellen visual acuity measure wear current spectacle correction ensure acuity 20/40 better . The current spectacle correction ( refraction ) acuity record . 3 ) OKR ( optokinetic reflex ) -based contrast testing perform OCD - optokinetic contrast device ( device study protocol ) . Subjects show brief demonstration OCD red light ( begin dark adaptation ) familiarize device expect test strategy . 4 ) Subjects dark adapt 20-30 minute . During time sit darkened room . If room dark enough loose blindfold may use . Music option available help pas time ease potential discomfort . 5 ) After 20-30 minute blindfold remove ( use ) patient monocular dark-adapted ( scotopic ) test do OCD , leave eye follow right eye . The non-tested eye may cover test . After scotopic testing , light OCD increase light-adapted ( photopic ) test perform manner . 6 ) Debriefing . Subjective assessment test modality dark adaptation process collect . ************************* Study 2 : Study subject participate portion study require two study visit . Potential participant approach PI ask willing participate study . If subject agrees participate , next schedule clinic visit , PI also slit lamp examination include lens status use AREDS 2008 Clinical Lens Opacity Grading Standards addition standard care clinic eye visit . The slit lamp examination include lens status use AREDS 2008 Clinical Lens Opacity Grading Standards research related activity clinic visit . Potential participant `` normal '' Study 2 recruit one co-investigator 's clinic treating physician . If interested , physician ( co-investigator ) contact research coordinator meet call patient explain study . If he/she agree participate , PI slit lamp examination next scheduled visit manner Study 2 participant , except central corneal thickness also determine ultrasonic pachymetry ( standard test patient glaucoma normal control ) . Data clinic visit use baseline information study . The baseline clinical demographic data collect study : 1 . Date Birth 2 . Ethnicity 3 . Gender 4 . Ocular History ( surgery , etc ) 5 . Type Glaucoma 6 . Current visual acuity 7 . Refraction 8 . Central corneal thickness 9 . Intraocular Pressure 10 . Slit lamp examination include lens status method 11 . Dilated examination include optic nerve appearance 12 . Recent automated perimetry result ( Humphrey visual field ) Research Study Visit 1 ( within 2 month clinic visit clinical data obtain ) : 1 . Humphrey standard automate perimetry ( visual field test ) . This form static perimetry use assess retinal function sensitivity . It commonly use photopic test modality diagnosis status glaucoma use frequently throughout ophthalmology many ophthalmologic clinical study . We hypothesize similarity performance Humphrey automate perimetry OKR test help validate test strategy . For patient glaucoma , visual field test frequently perform , test perform high-quality visual field test obtain within last 6 month . For patient , visual field test clinical record use study . 2 . OKR-based contrast testing perform OCD - optokinetic contrast device ( device study protocol ) . Subjects show brief demonstration OCD infrared light ( begin dark adaptation ) familiarize device expect test strategy . 3 . Subjects dark adapt 20-30 minute . During time may blindfold ( depend darkness room ) sit dark room . Music option available help pas time ease potential discomfort . 4 . After 20-30 minute , blindfold remove ( use ) patient monocular dark-adapted ( scotopic ) test do OCD , leave eye follow right eye . The non-tested eye may cover test . 5 . After scotopic testing , light OCD increase light-adapted ( photopic ) test perform manner . This visit take approximately 90 minute complete . Second Research Visit ( approximately 1 month first research visit ) : 1 . Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity Testing . This form stationary central vision contrast sensitivity commonly use test modality photopic contrast many ophthalmologic clinical study . We hypothesize similarity contrast performance Pelli-Robson OKR test help validate test strategy . 2 . OKR-based contrast testing . This performed second visit describe except test order right eye first , follow leave eye . 3 . Debriefing . Subjective assessment test modality dark adaptation process collect . This visit take approximately 90 minute complete . For participate Study 2 , participant ask allow study staff review medical record track clinical outcome 5 year . Participants ask allow review medical record relate develop develop glaucoma eye condition collect longitudinal data . This optional portion test opt . The following information re-reviewed : 1 . Date Birth 2 . Ethnicity 3 . Gender 4 . Ocular History ( surgery , etc ) 5 . Type Glaucoma 6 . Visual acuity 7 . Refraction 8 . Central corneal thickness 9 . Intraocular Pressure 10 . Slit lamp examination include lens status 11 . Dilated examination include optic nerve appearance 12 . Automated perimetry result ( Humphrey visual field )</detailed_description>
