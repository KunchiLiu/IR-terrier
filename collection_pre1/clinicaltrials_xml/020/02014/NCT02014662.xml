	<brief_summary>An isolated bout unaccustomed maximal eccentric exercise associate muscle force loss 2-4 day , mild reversible muscle tenderness , ultra-structural damage muscle fiber , elevation muscle protein serum , detriment range motion . This single center , pilot study design optimize condition robust measurement functional deficit muscle damage identify marker repair 22 day inform future intervention study . The primary measure limb force ( assess electronically ergometer ) , previous study demonstrate functional measure return fairly rapidly , usually 2-4 day . Additionally , several biomarkers muscle function measure 22 day , well change protein synthesis biopsy sample Deuterium-labelled water ( D2O ) consume study participant Day-3 Day 22 aid quantify newly synthesize protein .</brief_summary>
