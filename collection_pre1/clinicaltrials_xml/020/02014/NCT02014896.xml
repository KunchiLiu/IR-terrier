	<brief_summary>The propose study validate clinical use new biomarker blood test identify blood component may differentiate diverse stroke etiology clinical outcome list : 1 . Differentiate cardioembolic large artery atherosclerotic ischemic stroke , hemorrhagic stroke rule . 2 . In case ischemic stroke unknown `` cryptogenic '' etiology , determine ability biomarker blood test predict etiology cardioembolic large artery atherosclerotic . 3 . In case cardioembolic ischemic stroke , differentiation cardioembolic ischemic stroke cause atrial fibrillation ( AF ) cause AF . 4 . Differentiate `` transient ischemic attack '' ( TIAs ) acute ischemic stroke . 5 . Differentiate TIAs non-ischemic `` transient neurological event '' ( TNE ) similar symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) lead cause adult mortality morbidity United States , affect 800,000 individual , annually , leave many permanent disability . Furthermore , hundreds thousand Americans experience transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , momentary episode neurologic dysfunction , often precede major stroke serf warn future ischemic event . Despite symptom resolve , experience TIA increase risk stroke 20 % within 90 day . Emergent evaluation , prompt acute treatment , identification stroke etiology secondary prevention key decrease morbidity mortality associate cerebrovascular disease . Key treatment prevention identification stroke etiology - large vessel atherosclerosis , cardioembolic phenomenon , in-situ small vessel cerebrovascular disease - since primary secondary prevention measure differ base stroke subtype . The diagnosis ischemic stroke include combination patient history , clinical assessment , brain imaging . However , identify cause cerebrovascular ischemia challenge routinely assign cryptogenic origin . Therefore , great need understand pathogenesis TIA AIS event order develop effective preventative measure . Recent study identify differential expression gene whole blood may differentiate major ischemic stroke type . Such difference may help identify TIA AIS event likely respond therapy specifically tailor major stroke type . Furthermore , establish robust standard secondary prevention , future stroke event may avoid . BASE multisite prospective study estimate enrollment 1100 subject adult subject 100 age , gender co-morbidity match control ( `` Controls '' ) recruit patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) hospital suspect AIS TIA . Research personnel identify potential patient respond `` Brain Attacks '' page ED Stroke Team patient meet current Brain Attack criterion . Following evaluation ED neurology physician , clinical coordinator verify patient suspect AIS TIA meet eligibility criterion . The patient legal surrogate approach study participation . Written inform consent obtain subject enrol . There two recruitment window related BASE determine time symptom onset , time presentation ED hospital , ability consent : 1 . `` BASE '' - patient present suspect stroke symptom within 18 hour symptom onset last know normal time OR 2 . `` BASE 24 '' - patient present within 24 hour +/- 6 hour ( i.e . 18 - 30 hour window ) symptom onset last know normal time clinical evidence suggest Acute Ischemic Stroke .</detailed_description>
