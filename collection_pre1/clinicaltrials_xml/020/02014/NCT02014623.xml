	<brief_summary>Allergic diseases represent major health issue worldwide epidemiological study Melbourne , Australia , report high prevalence rhinitis ( hayfever ) atopy ( genetic tendency make allergy antibody ) Asian Caucasian subject . Mainstay treatment allergic rhinitis allergen avoidance pharmacotherapy symptom relief . Allergen immunotherapy offer advantage specific treatment long lasting efficacy , modify course disease . However , use treatment restrict high risk adverse event especially asthmatic . Other , well tolerate , rout allergen administration current conventional subcutaneous route ( SCIT ) investigate include sublingual route ( SLIT ) recently sublingual tablet pollen allergy immunotherapy become available . The tablet safe easy use contain pollen extract 5 common allergy-causing European grass include ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ) , major seasonal pollen allergy Melbourne south-eastern Australia . The immunological mechanism sublingual immunotherapy fully understood . The investigator propose conduct longitudinal open label study investigate immunological change occur 5 grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy tablet ( Oralair® ) cohort Chinese non-Chinese background subject . The investigator investigate induction relevant T cell regulatory immune mechanism change serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin ( Ig ) E IgG4 . Immunoregulatory cytokine synthesis T cell phenotype ( Bio-plex flow cytometry ) examine . This project provide important fundamental knowledge inform decision great application treatment subject moderate severe allergic rhinitis .</brief_summary>
