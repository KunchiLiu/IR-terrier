	<brief_summary>Background : There two basic type movement disorder . Some cause excessive movement , cause slowness lack movement . Some cause mutation gene . On hand , dementia condition decline mental ability , especially memory . Dementia occur age become frequent age . Researchers want study gene family history movement disorder dementia . They hope find genetic cause disorder . This help well understand treat disease . This study limit particular disorder , study movement disorder dementias general . This study perform genetic test identify genetic cause movement disorder dementia . Today , genetic test do analyze multiple gene time . This increase chance find genetic cause movement disorder dementias . Objectives : To learn movement disorder dementia , cause , treatment . Eligibility : Adults child movement disorder dementia , family member . Healthy volunteer . Design : Participants screen medical history blood test . Some physical exam . Participants give blood sample needle arm . This do clinic , doctor , home . Alternatively , saliva sample may provide blood sample obtain . Participants opt send extra blood sample repository future study . Genetic test do sample . The sample cod . The key code remain NIA . Only NIA investigator access code key . Participants request receive result test . Participation generally single visit . Participants may call back extra</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The objective study ascertain individual clinical diagnosis movement disorder dementia , affect unaffected family member , unrelated , healthy individual ( provide control sample ) ; characterize phenotype ; identify characterize genetic contribution etiology collect blood sample , saliva sample , and/or skin biopsy individual DNA induce Pluripotent stem ( iPs ) cell line preparation . Study population Up 10,000 person diagnosis movement disorder dementia , 1,000 asymptomatic person family members/related individual diagnosis movement disorder dementia , 1,000 unrelated , healthy control individual . Design This study usually require one outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . Participant visit may also take place inpatient NIH Clinical Center . Those unable travel NIH may study procedure perform site near home , hospital facility , private physician office , nurse home , assist living facility , local community center , participant home . Participants undergo medical record review , physical examination biospecimen collection include blood draw , saliva collection and/or skin biopsy enrollment visit . Additional visit may schedule collect additional phenotype information collect additional biospecimens . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure study identification pathogenic genetic variant causative movement disorder dementia patient diagnose . These disease-causing variant often inherit . The secondary outcome measure study identification genetic variant alter susceptibility/risk movement disorder dementia patient diagnose . These genetic risk factor associate disease apparently sporadic nature .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA For Patients : Diagnosis movement disorder dementia neurologist qualify professional accompanied sufficient clinical and/or laboratory evidence support diagnosis Confirmation movement disorder dementia study investigator qualify clinician physical examination and/or review medical record Ages 2 older ( age 18 old participate via mailer kit ) Able provide consent , case minor , cognitive impairment , legallyauthorized representative provide consent Able understand participate study procedure For unaffected family member patient : Unaffected relative patient diagnose movement disorder dementia enrol protocol . For purpose , define family member individual demonstrable relationship proband pedigree . This standard approach use familybased study . Furthermore , related patient ( define family member diagnosed disease interest ) must enrol study . Ages 2 older ( age 18 old participate via mailer kit ) Able provide consent , case minor cognitive impairment , legallyauthorized representative provide consent Able understand participate study procedure For unrelated healthy control individual : Be good general health Have know movement disorder dementia , family member movement disorder dementia Age 18 Able provide consent Able understand participate study procedure EXCLUSION CRITERIA For patient : An identifiable , nongenetic etiology movement disorder dementia , specific environmental exposure , birth injury , metabolic disorder , brain infection encephalitis For participant : Clinically significant anemia would make phlebotomy unsafe , participant unwilling provide saliva sample . Clinically significant bleeding would make phlebotomy unsafe , participant unwilling provide saliva sample . Any medical condition would make phlebotomy unsafe undesirable , serious medical illness like unstable heart disease , unstable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , participant unwilling provide saliva sample .</criteria>
