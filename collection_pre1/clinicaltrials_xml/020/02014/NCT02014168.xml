	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Co-administration Candidate Influenza Vaccine MVA-NP+M1 Viroflu® Seasonal Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design test safety effectiveness combination two vaccine influenza . One vaccines seasonal influenza vaccine 'Viroflu ' ( 'Inflexal V ' ) . The second investigational viral vectored vaccine call MVA NP+M1 . The rationale combining two vaccine work differently combine two vaccine , strong broad immune response may produce . The MVA NP+M1 vaccine evaluate five previous clinical trial . In total , 80 volunteer receive vaccine . There vaccine relate serious adverse event . Higher dos MVA NP+M1 reactogenic , however dose use study majority adverse event mild . 20 volunteer recruit study . They adults age 18 . Volunteers assign one two group . Volunteers group 1 receive Viroflu , follow dose MVA NP+M1 . Volunteers group 2 receive Viroflu follow placebo injection ( saline ) . Volunteers blind know group allocate ask complete diary card list adverse event vaccination . Vaccinations administer thigh deltoid muscle normally large enough accept two intramuscular injection . Volunteers follow 6 month total . Two day vaccination receive telephone call one clinical team . They attend three follow visit ( week 1 , 3 26 ) . At visit , volunteer blood test take questioned adverse event may experience .</detailed_description>
