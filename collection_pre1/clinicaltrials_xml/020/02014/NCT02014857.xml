	<brief_summary>Increased level cytokine GCF demonstrate smoker subject chronic periodontitis . It surprise increased level inflammation associate molecule GCF observe smoker periodontitis . However , clear smoking influence parameter periodontally healthy individual . In present study , hypothesize smoking might affect level GCF MMPs growth factor young adult periodontal health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation GCF MMP-1 , -8 Growth Factor Levels Smokers With Periodontal Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective present study investigate GCF level MMP-1 , MMP-8 , TGF-β1 , PDGF-AB VEGF smoker versus non-smoker periodontally healthy young adult . A total 32 periodontally healthy young adult include 16 smoker 16 non-smokers , recruit present cross-sectional study ( 18 female 14 male ; age range : 19 27 year ) . All participant thorough full-mouth clinical examination . The measurement probe depth ( PD ) clinical attachment level ( CAL ) assess six site per tooth whole mouth , exclude third molar study participant . Bleeding probe ( BOP ) amount plaque accumulation also evaluate . GCF sample site select site without BOP plaque accumulation . GCF sample obtain buccal aspect proximal site single-rooted teeth individual participate present study . Paper strips† carefully insert 1 mm crevice 30 second . Care take avoid mechanical trauma . The absorbed GCF volume estimate calibrated instrument . Then strip patient place one polypropylene tube freeze -40°C . The reading convert actual volume ( µl ) reference standard curve . All GCF sample store -40°C laboratory analysis . Considering difference 50 % mean GCF level biochemical marker assume standard deviation maximum 80 % mean value accept power 90 % , P value 5 % smoker non-smoker group , minimum sample size calculate . Chi-square test use determine difference gender smoke state study group . Student test apply comparison age smoker non-smokers . Normality test perform evaluate distribution clinical periodontal parameter level growth factor MMP-1 , -8 . Growth factor MMP level compare Mann-Whitney U test study group .</detailed_description>
