	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize liver injury ( inflammation , fibrosis , cirrhosis ) adults Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD ) , asymptomatic , under-recognized , undiagnosed . In addition , investigator believe genetic environmental factor play important role development alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) liver disease , identify compare cohort database clinical disease information link biospecimen DNA sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Adult Liver Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD ) genetic disorder result low level protein call alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) . This deficiency cause life-threatening liver disease and/or lung disease various age . Some patient experience life-threatening liver disease childhood liver cancer adult . There specific treatment AAT relate liver disease . Some patient develop emphysema young adult , patient remain healthy throughout life . Differences environment gene may explain inconsistency disease . The primary objective multi-center study assess natural history individual Pi-ZZ AAT deficiency , identify biomarkers progression liver disease construct database capable link cohort data repository biospecimens . The secondary objective analyze component demographic , social , family history associate severe liver disease . This study examine natural history liver disease record participant 's family history , medical history , current health , laboratory test result , medical treatment ( ) . Participants may complete brief research questionnaires physical mental health , diet , alcohol intake , smoke , environmental occupational ( work ) exposures . At least 120 Pi-ZZ AAT deficient adult previous history liver disease , moderate-severe liver disease , post liver transplant , enrol one three site . Eligible subject participate one follow study arm : 1 . Liver Biopsy 2 . Known Severe Liver Disease - subject meet Biopsy Group eligibility due presence advance liver disease 3 . Post Liver Transplant - subject previously undergone liver transplant At time enrollment , participant assign unique study identification ( ID ) number . All participant information record sample collect study save unique number . All blood , tissue genetic sample collect send secure repository future retrieval study . The process cod data sample lessens chance breach confidentiality . The length study participation , test activity perform specifically research determine enrollment group . Subjects Biopsy Known Severe Liver Disease group participate study 5 year ( enrollment four annual follow-up visit ) . Both group undergo physical exam , diagnostic abdominal ultrasound , pulmonary function test collection serum , plasma blood routine laboratory genetic testing ( Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ( iPS cell ) , microRNA DNA ) . However , Biopsy Group participants undergo liver biopsy FibroScan enrollment , Year 5 . The liver tissue sample help researcher learn cause liver disease patient liver disease progress . Subjects Post Liver Transplant group single study visit record history , complete questionnaire perform pulmonary function test . In addition , whole blood DNA analysis collect participant . Based study arm assignment , participant receive copy diagnostic abdominal ultrasound , pulmonary function test , routine laboratory test liver biopsy pathology result , share primary care physician .</detailed_description>
