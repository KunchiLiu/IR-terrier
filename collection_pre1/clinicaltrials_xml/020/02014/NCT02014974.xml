	<brief_summary>Background : Worldwide injuries trauma accident represent major population problem . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) deem problem one important global priority , call 2011-2021 Global Road Traffic Safety Decade . Despite , little empirical data low middle-income country quantify burden fracture current practice care . Methods : We conduct multicenter , prospective observational study patient sustain fracture dislocation present orthopaedic fracture unit 14 hospital India . A representative sample patient recruit 8-week period start October 1 , 2012 . Patients follow 30-days hospital discharge determine suffer outcome . Primary outcome include total mortality , reoperation , infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Global Epidemic Trauma : Injuries trauma accident rapidly increase number worldwide particularly develop country . Approximately 5.8 million people die every year traumatic injury , account 10 % world 's death . According recent report World Health Organization , trauma third large killer develop world 2020 . Moreover , every death , several thousand individual suffer impairment , frequently disable consequence . Among Southern Asian country , India high incidence death due physical injury ( 117 death per 100,000 individual ) . Physical injury account 10 % death , 20-25 % hospitalization , one third disability . As trend growing , lead increase number physical injury hospitalization . Most developing nation , trauma burden escalating , little empirical data type injury , access care , management approach . The investigator propose prospective study India ( second populous country world ) examine fracture burden provide foundation future collaboration research . This study fundamental understanding global burden trauma design future pragmatic randomize trial improve function quality life around world . WHO Decade Road Traffic Safety : This study directly align start Global Road Traffic Safety Decade 2011-2020 ( World Health Organization ) , well Department Surgery 's International Surgery Program . The Canadian Orthopaedic Association 's 'call action ' Canadian center towards bridge gap knowledge research trauma Low Middle Income Countries vindicate rationale INORMUS . METHODS Design Overview : Between October 2011 March 2012 , investigator conduct multicenter , prospective observational study patient sustain fracture present orthopaedic fracture unit across 14 hospital India . 4,659 patient 8-week period enrol . Patient characteristic , treatment , outcome data document initial consultation study coordinator hospital . Major complication , hospital , 30-day outcome evaluate . Primary outcome 1 . Logistic regression model involve 12 potential predictor mortality ; Secondary Analyses 2 . Mixed-model involve 12 predictor mortality evaluate potential hospital site effect ; 3 . Logistic regression model look time irrigation debridement open fracture deep infection rate ; 4 . Descriptive analysis look type treatment tibia femur fracture across socioeconomic group India ; 5 . Descriptive analysis look combination injury patient involve road traffic accident . Sample Size : We enrol 4,822 patient , 4,612 ( 95.6 % ) patient complete follow-up . To include 12 predictor model estimate mortality rate among orthopedic trauma patient 1.5 % , require 8000 patient properly power analysis . Based 20 % drop rate , plan recruit 10,000 patient study .</detailed_description>
