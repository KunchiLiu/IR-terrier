	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Recombinant Pichia Pastoris AMA1-DiCo Candidate Malaria Vaccine With GLA-SE Alhydrogel ® Adjuvant Healthy Malaria Non-Exposed European Malaria Exposed African Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project aim : -To evaluate safety 50 µg AMA1-DiCo malaria vaccine candidate GLA-SE Alhydrogel® adjuvant , healthy European adult previously expose parasite Plasmodium falciparum healthy African adult expose parasite . T-o assess humoral immune response vaccine antigens measure level IgG volunteer . To assess cellular immune response measure T cell cytokine IL-5 IFNγ production follow vitro stimulation vaccine antigens volunteer . Design : This trial stagger Phase Ia/Ib , Randomised , Double-blind , Multi-center Centre trial . Two different adjuvant assess , Alhydrogel® GLA-SE . One dosage 50 µg/3 injection AMA1-DiCo evaluate adjuvant . Sixty six ( 66 ) healthy volunteer include 2 follow cohort ( A B ) : Cohort A : 30 Non-exposed European Volunteers ( France ) Cohort B : 36 Malaria Exposed African Volunteers ( Burkina Faso ) The non-exposed European volunteer ( cohort A ) randomise 1:1 ratio two group 15 volunteer per group . The malaria expose African volunteer ( cohort B ) randomise 1:1 ratio , two group 18 volunteer per group . European Volunteers : Cohort A ( 30 ) : Group A1 ( 15 ) : 50µg AMA1-DiCo + Alhydrogel® Group A2 ( 15 ) : 50 µg AMA1-DiCo+ GLA-SE African Volunteers Cohort B ( 36 ) : Group B1 ( 18 ) : 50 µg AMA1-DiCo + GLA-SE Group B2 ( 18 ) : Placebo ( isotonic saline solution ) In order start recruitment cohort B ( Africa ) , safety evaluate data European volunteer Day 7 1st immunisation last European volunteer Data present Independent Data safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) appoint trial</detailed_description>
