	<brief_summary>Part I evaluate pharmacokinetic profile safety KTN3379 several dos objective define Phase 2 dose patient advanced malignancy . Part II evaluate pharmacokinetic profile safety KTN3379 combination target agent obtain preliminary evidence anti tumor activity specific type cancer . Patients continue receive KTN3379 alone combination disease progression toxicity necessitate discontinuation ( whichever come first ) .</brief_summary>
