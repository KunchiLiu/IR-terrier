	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Cetuximab Metastatic Penile Carcinoma ( PENILANE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Penile carcinoma rare cancer type , particularly industrialized country . Incidence well established estimate around 26000 annual new case around world [ 1 ] . We n't accurate estimation France regard data literature , incidence rate develop country vary 0.7 1.0/100000 men [ 2 ] . The mean age diagnosis 60 year [ 3 ] . Different cause identify like history Human PapillomaVirus ( essentially HPV16 ) , phymosis , absence circumcision , tobacco use , history condyloma [ 1 ] . In addition , lot molecular genetic alteration also responsible penile cancer occurrence development [ 4 ] . Histologically , tumor epidermoid cancer . Tumor spread inguinal lymphnodes , pelvic lymphnodes . Then retroperitoneal lymphnodes involve metastatic dissemination , often lungs , liver bone . According French urology recommendation , treatment localize penis cancer conservative , far possible [ 5 ] ; Even local recurrence rate varies 15 % 30 % patient , reduction overall survival observe patient [ 7 ] . The investigation regard involvement inguinal lymphnodes distant organ key-point . Among 10 % patient loco regional recurrence [ 6 ] , lymphadenectomy preferred chemotherapy recommend metastatic patient unresectable patient regional lymphnodes involvement [ 5 ] . Numbers treatment ( monotherapy association ) test penis cancer rarity tumor major obstacle clinical research , due small sample patient . The best result seem obtain platinum-based treatment ( ORR 32.5 % combination cisplatin , methotrexate bleomycine ) [ 8 ] [ 9 ] , even response rate promise , overall survival still short ( median OS = 28 week ) treatment-related toxicity important , even lethal [ 9 ] . The histological type squamous cell carcinoma , large majority penile cancer , lead Pagliaro et al . [ 10 ] explore combination Paclitaxel , Ifosfamide Cisplatin ( TIP ) neoadjuvant treatment locally advance penile tumor . This association chemotherapy agent previously proven efficacy squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Even study include small number patient ( N=30 ) penile carcinoma , show promising result primary objective ( objective response rate = 50 % 10 % complete response ) . Despite result previous research , chemotherapy agent submit health authority 's approval France . It result market approval treatment metastatic penile carcinoma . However , base result Pagliaro et al. , TIP consider French physician recommend standard care patient metastatic penile carcinoma [ 5 ] . From biological point view , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) K-ras status widely explore past year penile carcinoma . EGFR seem present high expression level tumor , whatever stage disease . Among 17 patient study Lavens et al. , expression EGFR 3+ ( high grade expression ) 14 case 2+ 3 case [ 11 ] . Andersson et al . analyze 28 penis tumor find somatic mutation 39 % ( n=11 ) . Mutations detect follow gene : PIK3CA ( 29 % ) , HRAS ( 7 % ) K-ras ( 3 % ) [ 12 ] . Dorff et al . study EGFR expression K-ras status 28 penile carcinoma . They note expression EGFR sample n't find K-ras mutation [ 13 ] Valverde et al . find 22 % K-ras mute carcinoma ( N=28 ) [ 14 ] . When present , K-ras mutation identify exon 2 ( codon 12 13 ) rarely exon 3 ( codon 61 ) . Mutational status easily explore Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification . EGFR expression seem correlate differentiation grade K-ras mutation seem correlate stage disease [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . Cetuximab human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody . It specific competitive binding extracellular domain EGFR , lead inactivation self-phosphorylation receptor inhibition follow intracellular signal chain . This antiproliferative effect cancer cell , inhibits angiogenesis , reduce cell mobility restore apoptosis . Cetuximab widely study cancer overexpression Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors ( EGFR ) , particular squamous cancer head neck [ 15 ] , colorectal [ 16 ] lung cancer [ 17 ] . Phases I study show dose range 200mg/m² 400mg/m² lead good EGF receptor saturation [ 18 ] . Association Cetuximab radiation therapy show improvement overall survival patient locally advanced head neck cancer ( median overall survival = 49 month versus 29 month radiotherapy-alone group ) [ 19 ] . Cetuximab also associate platinum-based chemotherapy ( Cisplatin Carboplatin ) 5-Fluorouracile patient head neck cancer . Median overall survival significantly well group patient Cetuximab ( 10.1 month vs 7.4 month ; p=0.04 ) . However , 82 % patient Cetuximab experience Commom Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE ) grade 3/4 toxicity versus 76 % group [ 20 ] . Adverse event commonly note Cetuximab cutaneous event , hypomagnesaemia , infection grade 3/4 anorexia . Cetuximab also study monotherapy head neck patient responses rate 13 % disease control rate 46 % . Cutaneous event still main toxicity [ 21 ] . One preliminary experience conduct patient penile carcinoma , treat association taxane ( Docetaxel ) Cetuximab . This treatment lead image clinical sign efficacy ( decrease 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18-FDG ) uptake , necrosis metastatic mass , improvement pain performance status ) . The tolerance profile characterize neutropenia mild skin toxicity [ 22 ] . Another key-point efficacy Cetuximab closely related presence mutation gene cod K-ras . Van Cutsem et al . show patient wild-type K-ras colorectal cancer much good responder Cetuximab patient mutation [ 23 ] . K-ras mutation lead constitutive activation Ras pathway independently bypass EGFR-driven signal cascade impair clinical efficacy EGFR . K-ras status always determine Cetuximab initiation would interest know EGFR expression rate order correlate response Cetuximab . Finally , immunogenicity class effect monoclonal chimeric antibody ; incidence Human Anti-Chimeric Antibodies ( HACA ) formation observe around 3.7 % patient treat cetuximab . However , apparent effect safety antitumor activity cetuximab observe patient [ Summary Product Characteristics Cetuximab ] . Given fact , - association Paclitaxel , Ifosfamide Cisplatin efficient treatment metastatic penile carcinoma consider new `` standard '' care France , - squamous cell carcinoma penis express EGF receptor , - cetuximab anti-tumor property EGF mediate cancer , - response rate cetuximab much well patient wild-type K-ras , We postulate : - combination Paclitaxel , Ifosfamide , Cisplatin Cetuximab , enable provide well Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) combination use without Cetuximab . As promising result obtain Pagliaro result comparative phase III reference treatment , consider validate new standard care . The proposed Phase 2 study explore optimal way treat patient metastatic penile carcinoma two experimental scheme use Simon 's selection `` pick winner '' randomize design .</detailed_description>
