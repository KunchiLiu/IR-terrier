	<brief_summary>Intended treat disorder respiratory muscle use device Threshold IMT Â® inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) allow train inspiratory muscle , chief diaphragm objectify improvement function . To monitor action respiratory muscle use several tool manometer aim assess respiratory pressure , ie , strength respiratory muscle , Surface Electromyography ( sEMG ) allow evaluate electromyographic activity muscle analyze . From quantitative clinical trial , randomize blind , compose 45 individual obtain random convenience divide three group , COPD participate pulmonary rehabilitation program ( RP ) make TMI ( TGR - Trained Group Rehabilitated ) , COPD participant PR program ( TGNR - Trained Group Rehabilitated ) control group compose healthy individual ( CG ) seek analyze electromyographic activity sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) diaphragm muscle strength , lung volume breathe patterns period eight week TMI . Manual also hold dynamometry compare grip strength CG , TGR TGNR baseline . Hypothesis : 1 . The Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) increase maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) COPD patient regardless whether enrol program pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) . 2 . TMI alters breathe pattern COPD patient regardless whether entered PR program . 3 . Patients COPD participate PR program high handgrip strength compare patient participate PR program . 4 . There decreased activity sternocleidomastoid muscle due increase activity diaphragmatic muscle fiber period TMI . 5 . TMI COPD patient participate program RP produce great increase MIP , handgrip strength , improve breathe pattern great reduction activity SCM muscle diaphragm participate program RP . 6 . There reduction respiratory rate , heart rate , systolic diastolic blood pressure increase oxygen saturation end TMI . 7 . TMI reduce degree dyspnea report patient MRC scale end training period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Will include study subject sex age 40 80 year . For control group participate healthy subject , nonsmoker normal lung function . For Group TMI + Rehabilitation , NonRehabilitated Rehabilitation Group participate COPD patient GOLD stag II III , participant nonparticipant PR program respectively , individual participate ( GTMINR ) enter PR program stipulate time study participant ( GTMIR ) include project least eight week , time require program provide RP 's effect COPD Not participate study Group TMI + Rehabilitation , NonRehabilitated Rehabilitation Group , individual fit criterion GOLD stage II III , acute disease , present hemodynamic instability , aneurysm , cognitive impairment comorbidity prevents study . For GC participate smoker , exsmokers compromise lung function , individual participate regular physical activity , ie three time per week , pathology affect cardiorespiratory system . Also exclude sign consent form .</criteria>
