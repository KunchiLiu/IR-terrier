	<brief_title>Conversion From Brand Generic Tacrolimus High Risk Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary hypothesis : - Generic immunosuppressant bioequivalence establish single-dose healthy volunteer study also bioequivalent brand stable transplant patient consider high-risk CYP3A expressors , AA , diabetic patient steady-state condition difference intra-subject variability . Secondary hypothesis : - Generic immunosuppressant bioequivalent among transplant patient independent type risk ( CYP3A5 expression , race , diabetes , age combination hereof ) . - All generic immunosuppressant brand bioequivalent confirm vitro dissolution study . - Tacrolimus metabolism clearance affect formulation . - Alternative bioequivalence metric use narrow acceptance interval population pharmacokinetic approach confirm bioequivalence among brand six generic aforementioned high-risk transplant patient population . To test hypothesis , propose follow four Aims : AIM 1 : Using retrospective cohort design , evaluate clinical safety outcome among adult transplant recipient whose tacrolimus dosage convert Prograf® generic formulation . In retrospective review , evaluate impact generic conversion adult transplant recipient post transplant outcomes one year prior conversion one year post conversion . Variables analysis include limited incidence rejection , hospital admission , change renal function , change transplant organ function . All tacrolimus level dose change period collect compare . Additional pharmacokinetic modeling data perform comparison . Aim 2 : Identification single lot long expiration date unique manufacture product approve United States conduct systematic dissolution , content uniformity purity test tacrolimus product . We conduct systematic dissolution test brand currently approve tacrolimus drug formulation use FDA-recommended dissolution method . We propose test compare 1 mg capsule strength . In addition , compare different formulation term potency , purity quality attribute . This work carry GMP-compliant facility The University Iowa Pharmaceuticals ( uip.pharmacy.uiowa.edu ) University Colorado ( iC42 Clinical Research Development , Department Anesthesiology , University Colorado , Laboratory Director : U. Christians ) . Based study , lot pass current USP standard , proceed clinical trial describe Aim 3 . Aim 3 : Comparison relative bioavailability steady-state pharmacokinetics 6 tacrolimus formulation prospective , 6-way cross-over study include CYP3A5 expressors ( n=30 ) non-expressor ( n=30 ) transplant patient . Six tacrolimus formulation test patient receive formulation . As proposed test bioequivalence steady-state , patient receive test formulation one week prior pharmacokinetic evaluation . The pharmacokinetic evaluation incorporate limit sample strategy focus fully characterize Cmax hour 4 post dose . Subsequent PK sample trough blood concentration monitor daily basis use dry blood spot study subject collect home . The daily monitoring level allow u specifically address whether need additional monitoring upon formulation conversion necessary . It critical patient adherent test medication ensure reach steady state . This monitor use test diary , pill count MEMS cap ( Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) , AARDEX Corp , Palo Alto , CABioequivalence test use scaled average bioequivalence metric analysis variance appropriate intra-individual variability formulation compare . This also include analysis potential period sequence effect . A combination limit sample strategy dry spot analysis combination population pharmacokinetic modeling utilized fully characterize PK profile formulation . In addition , study conduct 36 pediatric patient . Aim 4 . Subgroup analysis , population pharmacokinetics , average bioequivalence Aim 4 exploratory aim ( A ) address concern bioequivalence `` general '' patient population translate special subgroup high risk transplant recipient characterize genotype , race , age , gender , sensitization ( repeat transplant cytotoxic PRA &gt; 35 % calculated PRA &gt; 50 % ) , presence concomitant steroid , presence diabetes . ( B ) test alternative bioequivalence metric propose analysis immunosuppressant generic narrow acceptance interval , average bioequivalence well population pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>
