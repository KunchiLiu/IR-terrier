	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis decrease internal jugular venous flow park bench position compare supine position . There also change blood flow right leave internal jugular vein park bench position . In particular , great reduction flow dependent side . However , internal jugular venous flow prone supine position .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Jugular Venous Flow Neurosurgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The different position use neurosurgery well accessibility operate field ( park bench , prone ) impact cerebral venous drainage due effect internal jugular venous outflow blood , may increase intracranial pressure . Excessive neck flexion rotation park bench position , flexion prone position , may lead kink twist internal jugular vein . This hypothesized major cause disturb venous drainage surgery may lead neck swell , brachial plexus injury , macroglossia ( swollen tongue ) , delay airway obstruction , increase intracranial pressure postoperative patient . Optimal brain perfusion best neutral position head , surgery always perform position . Thus , look measure internal jugular venous flow different position , study look important contribute factor .</detailed_description>
