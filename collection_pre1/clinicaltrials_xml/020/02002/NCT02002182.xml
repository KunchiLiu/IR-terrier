	<brief_summary>Some cancer may relate infection virus , Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) . HPV related Oropharyngeal cancer ( HPVOPC ) account 80 % oropharynx cancer case United States . HPVOPC good prognosis patient HPV negative oropharynx cancer . In many hospital , standard care treatment oropharyngeal cancer surgery and/or radiotherapy without chemotherapy . While chance survival patient HPVOPC good , current treatment associate short- long-term side effect severe . In pre-clinical research use animal model cancer , vaccination target HPV virus find cause tumor regression . Thus , approach target unique characteristic HPV-infected cancer cell , therapeutic vaccination , attractive strategy potentially reduce radiotherapy chemo radiotherapy regimen ( thus decrease toxicity ) enhance long-term disease control . The purpose study see experimental vaccine , ADXS11-001 , effective stimulate body 's defense system HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma transoral ( mouth ) surgery . The experimental product ADXS11-001 use live strain Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm ) bacteria genetically modify risk get infection significantly reduce . Several research study already conduct ADXS11-001 men woman cancer . So far , approximately 675 dos ADXS11-001 give 263 patient HPV associate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADXS 11-001 Vaccination Prior Robotic Surgery , HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigator-initiated prospective clinical study patient stage I-IV squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx ( OPSCC ) undergo ablative transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) . There vaccination group control group study . Subjects control group receive vaccination follow TORS surgery additional research blood test measure immune system work . Subjects vaccination group receive two vaccination prior surgery . The first dose 33 day surgery , second 14 day surgery . Participation study also include allow research team take several blood sample subject various time , , treatment his/her cancer . Vaccination subject monitor closely treatment include 6 month oral antibiotic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient newlydiagnosed , biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma Stage IIV ( T13 , N02b ) oropharynx . The patient 's tumor HPV positive PCR ISH assay tumor biopsy . The patient able/eligible undergo treatment transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) without neck dissection without adjuvant radiation therapy chemoradiation . The patient able understand give inform consent . The patient least 18 year old . The patient 's ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . The patient prior head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , exception superficial cutaneous basal cell squamous cell carcinoma . The patient active cancer another part body , exception superficial cutaneous basal cell squamous cell carcinoma If cancer survivor , disease free interval le 3 year , exception superficial cutaneous basal cell squamous cell carcinoma . If cancer survivor patient receive prior systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy If prior standardofcare pretreatment biopsy inadequate analysis immunohistochemistry , patient unwilling undergo additional biopsy procedure . The patient prisoner . The patient psychiatric illness developmental delay would interfere understand study provision inform consent . The patient previously receive definitive surgical , radiation , chemoradiation treatment HNSCC . The patient history HIV know cause immunosuppression , actively take immunosuppressive medication due organ transplantation , rheumatoid disease , medical condition . Patient allergic naproxen Ibuprofen . The patient history liver disease . The patient contraindication ( e.g . sensitivity/allergy ) trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ampicillin . The patient implant medical device ( ) pose high risk colonization and/or easily remove ( e.g. , prosthetic joint , artificial heart valve , pacemaker , orthopedic screw ( ) , metal plate ( ) , bone graft ( ) , exogenous implant ( ) ) . NOTE : More common device prosthetics include arterial venous stent , dental breast implant venous access device ( e.g . PortaCath Mediport ) permit . Patients receive may receive future treatment PI3K TNFÎ± inhibitor . Patients undergone major surgery , include surgery new artificial implant and/or device , within 6 week prior initiation ADXS11001 treatment . Sponsor must consult prior enrol subject study recently major surgery new artificial implant , and/or device . Patients history listeriosis prior ADXS11001 therapy . Patients know allergy component study treatment formulation . Pregnancy . The effect vaccine develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must use two form contraception ( i.e. , barrier contraception one method contraception ) least 4 week prior study entry , duration study participation , Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately .</criteria>
