	<brief_title>Brief Behavioral Therapy Improving Sleep Disorders Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine recruitment rate propose randomize control trial ( RCT ) . II . Determine rate intervention adherence . III . Determine feasibility train National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Community Oncology Research Program ( NCORP ) clinical research staff successfully deliver Brief Behavioral Therapy ( BBT ) intervention . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) insomnia measure Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) . II . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) sleep quality measure Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) . III . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) circadian rhythm measure two-oscillator cosinor parameter estimate base actigraphy data . IV . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) measure FirstbeatÂ® ambulatory heart-rate monitor ( i.e. , 1. respiratory sinus arrhythmia-RSA , 2. standard deviation normal R-wave R-wave interval -- SDNN , 3. root mean square successive difference adjacent normal R-wave R-wave interval -- RMSSD , 4 . The ratio low frequency total spectrum power NN interval .04 .15 Hertz high frequency total spectrum power NN interval .15 .40 Hertz -- LF/HF ratio , 5. natural log low frequency total spectrum power NN intervals 0.04 0.15Hz. ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) quality life measure Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) total score subscales . II . Obtain preliminary estimate effect intervention ( compare control ) general mood measure Profile Mood States ( POMS ) total score subscales . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo BBT intervention , comprise insomnia education , stimulus control , discouragement nap encouragement exercise , sleep compression two 60 minute face-to-face session week 1 3 4 , four 15 minute telephone session week 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
