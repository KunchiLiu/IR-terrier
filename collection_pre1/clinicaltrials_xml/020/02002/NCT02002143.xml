	<brief_title>GMVs Primary Care : An RCT Group-Based Versus Individual Appointments Reduce HbA1c Older People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) old people undisputed health problem . More 1.1 million people diagnosed diabetes mellitus ( DM ) Canada age 65 year . Rates T2DM old people accelerate even adjust age . Thus , total community prevalence increase base great number old people , increase rate among old people , improve survival rate people DM . The financial burden DM Canadian health care system approach $ 17 billion/year 2020 . Beyond direct health burden T2DM , condition independent risk factor fall dementia -two 'geriatric giant ' . T2DM 'an important unresolved issue previously unacknowledged ' consider increase 'biological age ' 2 year age 70 year . Although treatment improve clinical trajectory old people T2DM , many receive guideline care . Combinations drug treatment , physical activity , nutrition advice body weight management , reduce risk factor , delay onset disease lessen rate complication . Group Appointments ( GAs ) - also call Group Medical Visits Shared Medical Appointments may contribute improved T2DM care old people primary care set . The innovation study undertake research one study determine 1 ) clinical effectiveness ; 2 ) quality life ; 3 ) economic implication Group Appointments old people T2DM . 'Group Appointments ' exist various form . Their origin often attribute Noffsinger also Ward . In Group Appointment , one physician work nurse 'behaviourist ' ( describe page 12c ) care eight twelve patient one 60-120 minute appointment . A recent Systematic Review Group Appointments T2DM perform two current Co-Investigators ( HOUSDEN , DAWES ) highlight need Canadian Primary Care RCT would extend previous research Italy . The extension research study Primary Care physician lead Group Appointments RCT include exclusively men woman age 65 year old . The clinical societal importance T2DM old people dispute . 'Diabetes mellitus serious condition potentially devastating complication affect age group worldwide ' . Diabetes epidemiology review 2013 Canadian Diabetes Practice Guidelines Public Health Agency Canada 's 'Diabetes Facts &amp; Figures ' . To make literature 'critical ' investigator focus 1 ) accelerate rate diagnosis type 2 diabetes old people ; 2 ) challenge deliver quality diabetes care affordably traditional one-to-one primary care encounter 3 ) equipoise result international evidence test GAs improve patient self-management absence Canadian Primary Care research field ; 4 ) brief review validity limitation HbA1C measure T2DM self-management ; 5 ) theoretical framework underpin Group Appointment intervention . From 2013 Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines Diabetes , 2009 , 6.8 % Canadians ( 2.4 million people ) condition . This represent 230 % increase compare prevalence estimate 11 year earlier . A decade , additional 1.3 million Canadians expect T2DM . Diabetes complication increase cost service pressure Canada 's publicly fund healthcare system . People diabetes three time likely require hospital admission precede year longer lengths stay . Good metabolic control diabetes prevents complication . This require lifestyle behavioural modification . In Canada , usual clinical care diabetes via individual patient consultation combine 'ad hoc ' educational advice family practice appointment referral educational support program , available . Although traditional primary care delivery address clinical problem , fail embrace principle behaviour change ( compliance/ adherence ) essential part chronic disease management . The Canadian Practice Guidelines T2DM call psychological support , exercise promotion nutritional advice . Traditional one-to-one clinical encounter fee-for-service setting encourage coordinate care . There call improve scope diabetes care currently offer Canada . The quote 'if keep 've always do , 'll keep get 've always get ' relevant setting . Traditional one-to-one clinical encounter always place health service delivery . However , give common need across patient burgeon cost treat T2DM - investigator address question , 'Is effective way encourage successful patient self-management old people T2DM . Two major resource Group Appointments relate various medical setting ( i.e. , primary care alone ) . The 'Bible ' Group Appointments Dr. Edward Noffsinger 's 500-page book Running Group Visits Your Practice ( 2009 ) . He describe two main type GAs -not limit primary care set . A second foundational source Canadians particular , The Group Medical Appointment Manual ( First Edition 2007 ) publish Northern Health Authority British Columbia ( develop visit Dr. Noffsinger ) . In clinical trial , compel data Group Appointments provide superior control HemoglobinAA1C come Drs . Trento Porta , University Turin , Italy . Patients attend structured Group Appointments decrease HbA1C 0.9 % ( Effect size 0.56 ) compare control group counterpart . There number difference study investigator propose . First , study Turin around Italy take place 'hospital-based clinic ' , regular primary care setting . Second , participant Turin study 64years , average -younger propose study . Third , Turin study include generic quality life measure ( e.g . EQ-5D ) estimate health utility . Fourth , health economic implication extrapolate Italian Canadian health system . Considering publish RCTs , HOUSDEN DAWES ( co-investigators ) find significant 0.46 % reduction HbA1C across 10 RCTs meet inclusion criterion . However , 12- month US Veteran Affairs Medical Centre trial , GA patient 0.3 % improvement patient randomize individual care ( effect size 0.21 ) . Other study duration , approach US University Turin study appear similar . The aforementioned HOUSDEN DAWES ' systematic review highlight RCT Primary Care set examine Group Appointments vehicle improve patient management measure HbAIC another clinical measure . Previous publish paper describe T2DM Group Appointments Primary Care set focused patient satisfaction physician perception . Such research provide valuable insight barrier facilitator Group Appointments . However , study answer question 'Do Primary Care-led Group Appointments improve metabolic control diabetes ? ' HOUSDEN report duration Group Appointments ( i.e. , 24-months ) significantly associate outcome ( approximately 0.25 % low HbA1C per year ) number GAs . That inform decision investigator conduct RCT across two year . The rationale Group Appointments build social cognitive theory transtheoretical stage change individual level brings bear group dynamic unavailable Individual Appointment . The investigator emphasize GAs combine three element : 1 ) medical care ; 2 ) disease-specific education ( e.g . significance HbA1C , healthy food choice ) ; 3 ) life skill development goal setting , action planning , problem-solving . Patients attend Group Appointments , definition , 'post-intentional ' phase ( transtheoretical model ) receive education . They know diagnosis recognize need something . Thus , Group Appointments move beyond mere education medical fact 'dynamic ' curriculum focus key challenge surface process turn goal action . Collectively , component help patient adopt healthy lifestyle ( action ) also maintain health behavior change experience setback failure ( cop ) . This consistent transtheoretical model well health action process approach . Note Group Appointments also reinforce self-efficacy emotional support . This contrast traditional primary care individual appointment 1 ) clinician may may make time counsel busy schedule 2 ) give generic verbal advice referral without attention specific nutrition physical activity goal may appropriate patient . The investigator propose element GAs consistent best evidence patient preference . On one hand , Group Appointments may first seem logical component diabetes continuum care . A proportion primary care practice , include collaborator offer . There Provincial Government British Columbia ( BC ) Medical Association ( BCMA ) ( General Practice Services Committee ) endorsement . Yet remain quantitative metabolic ( HbA1C ) economic data ( QALY/health care utilization ) outcomes Group Appointments specifically elderly patient T2DM Canadian Primary Care set . Therefore , rigorous review literature suggest - yet NO clear Canadian evidence would convince policymakers invest Primary care-led Group Appointment old people T2DM unless evidence obtain show work . The investigator propose address gap . They conduct measurement 0 ( baseline ) , 12 ( mid-intervention ) 24 ( end of-intervention ) , month . The investigator assess primary outcome 24 month follow-up evaluate change 36 month ( 12-month follow-up ) . In addition , investigator obtain three-monthly data blood test part routine patient management three-monthly Group Appointments ( Intervention ) individual patient appointment ( usual care ) . At three-monthly interval research assistant ( RA # 1 ) administer Health Resource Utilization ( HUI3 ) collection instrument EQ-5D . SIGNIFICANCE : Despite clinical burden T2DM among old Canadians , potential primary care system deliver innovative multidisciplinary care education , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) goal . The `` GAP '' study apply conceptual clinical innovation Group Appointments primary care set health need old adult diabetes . There need quantitative Canadian research GAs broadly investigator target substantial clinical problem - diabetes old people . Do primary care lead , Group Appointments reduce HbA1C , improve quality life reasonable price ? If answer encouraging , potential 'scale-up ' model via division , province ultimately nationwide .</detailed_description>
