	<brief_summary>This study aim observe therapeutic effect different treatment course inhale corticosteroid eosinophilic bronchitis patient . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Cough score improve treatment longer treatment course inhale corticosteroid EB patient . 2 . The sputum eosinophil percentage decrease recover normal level ( Eos % &lt; 2.5 % ) long treatment course inhale corticosteroid EB patient . 3 . The rate recurrence treatment decrease longer treatment course inhale corticosteroid EB patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study group : 90 patient diagnosed EB randomise three group follow : Group 1 ( 4-week treatment group ) : The patient eosinophilic bronchitis receive Pulmicourt Turbuhaler ( Budesonide 100µg ) 2puff Q12h 4 week . Group 2 ( 8-week treatment group ) : The patient eosinophilic bronchitis receive Pulmicourt Turbuhaler ( Budesonide 100µg ) 2puff Q12h 8 week . Group 3 ( 16-week treatment group ) : The patient eosinophilic bronchitis receive Pulmicourt Turbuhaler ( Budesonide 100µg ) 2puff Q12h 16 week . The study divide follow phase : 1 . First Visit ( Visit 1 , day -3 ) : A full medical history physical examination undertaken determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . After informed consent sign , follow sample obtain patient : blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology , biochemistry chest x-ray ) . A urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential . Bronchial provocation test methacholine inhalation perform determine whether presence bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness . Hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take determine whether esixt eosinophilic airway inflammation . 2 . Second Visit ( Visit 2 , Week 0 ) : A physical examination perform . All laboratory test result obtain determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Enrolled patient randomly divide three group inhale budesonide 200 µg twice daily via turbohaler 4 week , 8 week 16 week respectively give Diary Card . 3 . During Treatment ( Week 0 Week 4/8/16 , every 4 week ) : Patients take study medication 4 week 4-week group,8 week 8-week group,16 week 16-week group . All patient followed-up every 4 week complete Diary Card 7 day last week treatment . 4 . Third Visit ( Visit 3 , Week 4/8/16 ) : A physical examination perform . The Diary Card collect review . Adverse event , secondary complication , concurrent medication recorded.Hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take enrolled patients.Blood sample routine clinical laboratory test ( haematology biochemistry ) obtain 5 . Post-treatment vist ( 24 week , every 12 week ) : Cough symptom score , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) hypertonic saline induce sputum sample cell differential take enrolled patient .</detailed_description>
