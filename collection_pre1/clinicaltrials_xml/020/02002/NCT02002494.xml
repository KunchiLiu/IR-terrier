	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis decrease internal jugular venous flow park bench position compare supine position . There also change blood flow right leave internal jugular vein park bench position , particularly great reduction flow dependent side . However , internal jugular venous flow prone supine position .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The different position use neurosurgery ( park bench , prone ) good accessibility operate field impact cerebral venous drainage due effect internal jugular venous outflow blood may increase intracranial pressure . The kink internal jugular vein due excessive neck flexion rotation park bench flexion prone position may lead kink twist vein . This hypothesized major cause disturb venous drainage surgery postoperative patient may lead neck swell , brachial plexus injury , macroglossia ( swollen tongue ) , delay airway obstruction increase intracranial pressure . Optimal brain perfusion best neutral position head , surgery always perform . Thus , look measure internal jugular venous flow different position little study look important contribute factor .</detailed_description>
