	<detailed_description>Although number death gastric cancer decline past , large proportion elderly patient primarily affect disease . The definition elderly patient varies accord social economic situation . However , develop develop country , 65 70 year age commonly use limit decrease role subject community society . Elderly cancer patient often suffer multiple comorbidities , take many medication , age-associated physiological problem , impair organ function functional change , make selection optimal treatment difficult . This aspect also hamper underrepresentation old patient cancer clinical trial . Elderly patient fulfill inclusion criterion clinical trial could experience advantage toxicity chemotherapy young patient . In contrast physician ' perception , old patient recognize age important issue refuse trial [ 4 ] . Furthermore , performance status helpful estimate general condition elderly patient , factor regard functional , social , mental status consider [ 5 ] . Although majority gastric cancer patient elderly , patient older 65-70 year often exclude , underrepresented , study population combination chemotherapy trial . There , moreover , lack prospective study directly compare outcome tolerability chemotherapy young elderly patient , although data available gastric cancer retrospective analysis . Trumper et al . evaluate retrospectively 1,080 patient enrol three randomize control trias assess 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy . They find elderly patient obtain similar benefit palliative chemotherapy term symptomatic response , tumor regression , survival , without increase toxicity . In gastric cancer patient , oxaliplatin show favorable toxicity profile cisplatin . A combination chemotherapy 5-FU oxaliplatin , mainly FOLFOX regimen , investigate numerous phase II study , use different dos schedule , show considerable antitumor activity . Insofar toxicity concern , significant toxicity , include myelo-suppression peripheral neuropathy , major issue elderly patient . When compare standard FOLFOX schedule , weekly biweekly reduced-dose combination oxaliplatin/5- FU without 5-FU bolus show favorable toxicity profile lower rate peripheral neuropathy myelosuppression . For palliative treatment metastatic gastric cancer , doublet contain oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidines could consider option . Results prospective randomize trial show non-inferiority oxaliplatin , compare cisplatin , treatment advance gastric cancer , decrease toxicity . Of interest , subgroup analysis phase III randomize trial report significantly good result elderly patient treat oxaliplatin compare cisplatin . In trial , patient advance gastric cancer randomize receive 5-FU-based regimen cisplatin ( FLP regimen ) oxaliplatin ( FLO regimen ) . The primary endpoint study , PFS , unmet ; however , subgroup patient older 65 year , FLO regimen achieve improved efficacy term response rate , PFS , overall survival ( OS ) compare FLP regimen . In previous study , use modify FOLFOX regimen omission bolus 5-FU aim improve tolerability regimen elderly population , preserve outcome . This strategy adopt base result previous ongoing study oxaliplatin/5-FU combination regimen . We attain overall response rate 34.9 % , compare favorably phase II study FOLFOX chemotherapy , range 32.2 % 52.5 % ( see Table 5 ) . This overall response rate noteworthy consider patient metastatic recurrent gastric cancer compare study variable percentage ( 8 % 35 % ) enrol patient locally advanced disease . We observe grade 4 toxicity , whereas grade 1-3 gastrointestinal toxicity report moderate number patient . The modified FOLFOX ( FOLFOX ) regimen show 9.3 % occurrence grade 3 4 neutropenia , low report study . Capecitabine monotherapy show effective maintenance treatment chemotherapy favorable safety profile . In metastatic breast cancer , single-agent capecitabine administer dose 1000 mg/m2 twice daily 14 day , follow 7-day rest period , every 3 week . Short-course XELOX follow capecitabine maintenance therapy , dose 1,250 mg/m2 bid d1-14 every 21 day disease progression , provide active well-tolerated treatment option patient previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer . This approach minimise risk unwanted cumulative neurotoxicity , cheap convenient patient healthcare provider . Recently , fix low-dose capecitabine ( 1,000 mg b.i.d . ) , administer continuously , administer patient gastrointestinal cancer high level safety . Capecitabine 1,000 mg twice daily without interruption use first 11 patient . The dose reduce 1,000 mg twice daily 5 day per week 8 patient develop hand-foot syndrome . Main toxicity grade 1 2 fatigue hand-foot syndrome . The present study aim collect data progression free survival ( PFS ) elderly population metastatic recurrent gastric cancer , treat modify FOLFOX protocol follow capecitabine maintenance . The aim present observational study assess maintenance capecitabine fix number ( 8 cycle ) FOLFOX regimen able prolong PFS , acceptable toxicity . In case patient could achieve safe treatment , spar unnecessary combination-related toxicity ( e.g . neurotoxicity , neutropenia , diarrhea mucositis ) .</detailed_description>
