	<brief_summary>Background : The investigator develop Shower Technique protocol ( STP ) hemodialysis ( HD ) patient heal central venous catheter ( CVC ) exit site , design permit shower increase infection risk . Research question : Is feasible conduct randomize control trial compare rate CVC relate bacteremia ( CRB ) adult satellite HD patient use STP versus standard CVC care alone 6 month follow ? Study Design : This pilot study multi-centre randomize control trial . Eligible participant randomize STP versus standard care meeting predefined criterion confirm heal tunneled CVC exit site . Primary Outcome : Feasibility determine base 5 outcome measure : accuracy CRB rate documentation satellite setting , percentage patient screen , recruit , educate successfully STP ( intervention arm ) , aspects STP ( % contaminate patient control arm ) . Study Setting : In satellite unit affiliate 2 academic 3 community centre south central Ontario , Canada . Patient Population : Adult satellite HD patient dialyze via CVC heal CVC exit site . Intervention : STP standard CVC care ; Control : standard CVC care ; Analysis : Each measure feasibility statistical threshold success . If threshold reach 4 5 measure , full HIPPO SAT study deem feasible . Discussion : A pilot feasibility study large study critical due potential challenge associate recruitment , compliance contamination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CVC related infection associate increased morbidity hospitalization rate , high treatment cost , poor survival compare use arteriovenous access . To prevent infection , patient preserve integrity dryness CVC dressing . Showering avoid , difficult attain full protective coverage exit site use dressings barrier . Wet dressings place patient increase infection risk , especially CVC exit site fully heal . However , survey 274 CVC dependent HD patient , 64 % indicate recommended prohibition shower moderately extremely inconvenient reduce quality life . Additionally 77 % patient admit shower least CVC . While submersion CVC water discourage clinical practice guideline , also state precaution take reduce likelihood bacterial CVC entry showering may acceptable . However , guidance opinion base evidence support specific precaution . Thus , address patient ' desire shower safely , least 2 separate dialysis facility Ontario , Canada develop shower procedure alternative method CVC care . Preliminary data small proof-of-concept study 65 patient suggest acceptable CRB rate ( 0.46/1000 CVC day ) use shower procedure . The study conduct satellite HD unit select population patient infection-free 6 month use CVC . Satellite unit offer dialysis outpatient set patient stable require less intensive care in-centre patient . The satellite HD population typically young healthier , likely able perform shower procedure in-centre patient . With increase patient satellite HD , crucial pragmatic , yet effective , prophylactic CVC infection strategy formally test establish set . Following proof-of-concept study , nephrologists , vascular access coordinator , HD centre five dialysis centre across Ontario , collaborate create formal Shower Technique Protocol ( STP ) include chlorhexidine applicator shower minimize risk bacterial entry CVC exit site . STP design specifically patient fully endothelialized CVC tunnel heal exit site . Participants allocate STP able shower change dress 3 time per week . Prior widespread implementation STP , critical determine whether safe use patient heal CVC exit site . In word , confirm CRB rate patient use STP great CRB rate patient use gold standard CVC care . It unknown whether use STP improve patient satisfaction CVC care .</detailed_description>
