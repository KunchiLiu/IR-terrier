	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize study determine home SDHD suitable alternative conventional dialysis perform dialysis center patient suffer chronic kidney disease Peritoneal Dialysis ( HAPD/CAPD ) . The adequacy alternative dialysis technique confirm SDHD home viable option patient come HAPD/CAPD indeed support clinical benefit home SDHD compare conventional dialysis : lowering blood pressure lower use antihypertensive drug , improve quality life , maintenance residual renal function relate reduced risk death reduction operate cost dialysis patient transport .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Hemodialysis Vs Short Daily Hemodialysis Patients Coming From Peritoneal Dialysis ( HAPD/CAPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional Hemodialysis - 3 treatment per week approximately 4 hours- perform dialysis clinic use hemodialysis machine . Short Daily Hemodialysis - 5 6 treatment per week approximately 2-4 hour per treatment- perform patient 's home , use hemodialysis machine . Partecipants randomize SDHD undergo intensive home hemodialysis train program expect take 2-6 week complete . Qualified healthcare professional train SDHD subject 's partner perform dialysis use hemodialysis machine choose clinician . At baseline visit , first study treatment either SDHD CHD arm , follow data collect : demographic information , ESRD history , EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire , vital sign , blood laboratory test result , KT/V parameter , 24 hour time urine collection test result , comorbid condition , vascular access type , current medication . After hemodialysis start , patient follow 12 month data collection 1,3,6 12 month . At visit , follow data collect : EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire , vital sign , blood laboratory test result , KT/V parameter , 24 hour time urine collection test result , adverse event , vascular access type , current medication . During study , follow parameter strictly monitor : treatment cost , medication , number hospitalization admission , number day hospital reason hospitalization , additional cost information . Home hemodialysis could integrate therapeutic option favor de-hospitalization patient require hemodialysis . Aim study offer patient good quality life , create condition improvement blood pressure , phosphate control , cardiovascular morbidity mortality , reduce cost National Health Service .</detailed_description>
