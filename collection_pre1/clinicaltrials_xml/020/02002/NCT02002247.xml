	<brief_summary>The aim investigator ' research program investigate effect perioperative high dose selenium supplementation high-risk cardiac surgical patient undergo complicate open heart surgery . The investigator hypothesize therapeutic strategy test randomized trial may contribute few complication , less organ injury few death . Before investigator conduct large definitive trial , conduct pilot study assess feasibility protocol , roll pilot patient definitive trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over million patient undergo open heart surgery annually number likely accelerate population age prevalence diabetes cardiovascular disease continue increase . Unfortunately , death , organ failure , serious complication frequent follow open heart surgery , especially high-risk patient population . Selenium trace element important many body 's regulatory metabolic function especially time stress . International member study team show non-randomized study high dose selenium supplementation associate improved clinical outcome compare historical control group . The next step program research conduct randomize trial . The aim research program investigate effect perioperative high dose selenium supplementation high-risk cardiac surgical patient undergo complicate open heart surgery . The investigator hypothesize therapeutic strategy test randomized trial may contribute few complication , less organ injury few death . The investigator propose conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicentre definitive trial 1400 patient across 20 site Germany Canada , include pilot study patient . An industry partner ( Biosyn ) provide product additional support European site . Patients randomize receive either daily perioperative high-dose selenium placebo postoperative day 10 ( maximum ) upon early discharge ICU . If hypothesis proven true , simple , inexpensive nutrient reduces complications improves recovery patient undergoing cardiac surgery , potential dramatically change clinical practice improve health outcome .</detailed_description>
