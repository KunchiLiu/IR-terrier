	<brief_summary>The drug test study low dos Optina ( formerly know Danazol ) ( DMI-5207 ) may effective treatment diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . Laboratory study demonstrate low dos drug may treat diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema two important way , decrease blood vessel permeability ( related leak edema ) decrease formation new leaky blood vessel . Optina approve Health Canada treatment diabetic macular edema high dos Optina approve Health Canada treatment endometriosis ( growth cell similar form inside womb grows outside womb ) fibrocystic breast disease ( condition breast tissue ) . Higher dos Optina also approve United States many country since mid-1970s treatment men woman hereditary angioedema ( disease cause swell part body ) addition endometriosis fibrocystic breast disease woman . All Optina dos use current study less half typical start dos approve indication . This compare `` high-dose '' aspirin use treat , example , headache , low-dose `` baby aspirin '' use reduce blood clotting . Similarly , Optina two different effect high low dose . The low dos study select base laboratory study mention . The purpose study investigate safety effectiveness low dos Optina treatment macular edema due diabetes , also test help slow development macular edema .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patient provide informed consent 2 . Male female 18 year old Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus [ define selfreport diabetes accompany treatment ( insulin diet ) history fast plasma glucose ≥ 7.0mmo/l ( 126mg/dl ) 2hr plasma glucose ≥11.1mmo/l ( 200mg/dl ) ] 3 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior randomization must agree utilize reliable form effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method ; abstinence ) throughout study 90 day last dose study medication . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy [ Note : subject use contraceptive method contain progesterone ( include progesterone IUD ) 90 day prior randomization planning use progesterone contraceptive method ( include progesterone IUD ) study drug treatment period eligible enrollment . ] Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 4 . Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman . Thus , female subject postmenopausal without menstrual period ≥12 month , surgical sterility , pregnant breast feed 90 day prior randomization enrol . 5 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion inclusion study ( see Study Eye Inclusion Criteria , ) 6 . HbA1c le equal 10 % 7 . Stable diabetic metabolic control ( major change diabetic lipid reduce medication 3 month prior start study determine Investigator ) 8 . Blood pressure ≤160/90 mm Hg ( case either , systolic diastolic limit exceed , blood pressure remeasured 10 minute rest period inclusion study ) Study Eye 1 . Best correct Early Treatment Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity letter score ≥24 ( i.e. , 20/320 good ) ≤78 ( i.e. , 20/32 worse ) within 28 day randomization 2 . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema involve center macula clinical exam opinion Investigator 3 . Spectraldomain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) central subfield ≥300 micron within 28 day randomization 4 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , subject cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph 5 . Assessment treat ophthalmologist focal photocoagulation defer safely 16 week 6 . Fellow eye meet criterion enrollment may also designate `` study eye '' ; thus , patient two study eye patient one study eye Study level exclusion : 1 . Known allergy danazol ( Cyclomen® Danocrine® , SanofiAventis ) nonmedicinal component danazol test drug ( cornstarch , red iron oxide , black iron oxide , gelatin , lactose , magnesium stearate , talc titanium dioxide ) . Note : lactose intolerance contraindication ingest small amount lactose contain oral medication . 2 . History systemic ( e.g. , oral , intravenous , intramuscular , subcutaneous , intrauterine , epidural , bursal , implant ) androgen , progesterone corticosteroid ( include topical ophthalmic corticosteroid preparation within 4 month prior randomization . Topical nonophthalmic corticosteroid exclusion . 3 . Carcinoma breast 4 . Prostate cancer 5 . Androgendependent tumor 6 . Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding 7 . Genital neoplasia 8 . Currently take warfarin ( coumadin ) , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital cyclosporin tacrolimus 9 . Females pregnant plan pregnancy 6 month period randomization . [ Note : Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman ] 10 . Females breast feed breast feed 90 day prior randomization [ Note : Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman ] 11 . Use hormonal therapy include Hormone Replacement Therapy contraceptive medication contain progesterone within 3 month randomization ( NOTE : patient pure estrogen estradiol replacement therapy enrol study ) 12 . Unstable cardiovascular disease history significant heart disease ( include unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , history coronary revascularization procedure ) within 6 month randomization 13 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Patients poor glycemic control , within last 3 month , use new type insulin ( example , change add short act insulin longeracting insulin ) , increase daily dose ≥50 % , initiate intensive insulin treatment insulin pump additional daily injection plan next 3 month enrol 14 . Significant hepatic disease ( defined aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase , twice upper limit normal ) 15 . Renal disease ( define serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dl , history renal transplant , undergoing dialysis screen ) 16 . Changes antihypertensive medication within 3 month randomization ( except dosage adjustment consider minor opinion Investigator ) 17 . Major surgery ( e.g . head neck , chest , abdomen , gastrointestinal , genitourinary central nervous system ) within past 28 day anticipate next 6 month 18 . History acute intermittent porphyria , thrombosis thromboembolic disease pseudotumor cerebri 19 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day study entry involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry 20 . Patient expect move area clinical center next 6 month Study eye exclusion : 1 . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema , e.g. , cataract extraction , vitreousretinal interface disease ( taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , closure juxtafoveal capillary , dense subfoveal hard exudate ) 3 . An ocular condition ( diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study , e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc . 4 . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely interfere ocular measurement evaluation study 5 . History treatment DME time past 3 month ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid , antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) drug , treatment ) 6 . History panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within 4 month prior randomization anticipate need PRP 6 month follow randomization 7 . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 6 month anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization 8 . History yttrium argon yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization 9 . Uncontrolled glaucoma ( investigator 's judgment ) study eye 10 . Aphakia</criteria>
