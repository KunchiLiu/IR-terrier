	<brief_summary>Type I Diabetes auto immune disease body 's immune system attack destroy insulin-producing beta cell pancreas . Therefore , child affect condition present high blood sugar . This condition affect 1:400/500 person worldwide.Type I Diabetes , previously know Juvenile Diabetes , usually strike childhood , adolescence , young adulthood , last lifetime . To date , treatment arrest , reverse ongoing beta cell destruction . We hypothesize GABA , naturally occur substance , potential reduce inflammation protect pancreatic beta cell autoimmune destruction . GAD-alum may contribute preservation residual insulin secretion patient recent onset , Type I Diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase ( GAD ) Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid ( GABA ) Treatment Type I Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary defect autoimmune Type I Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) involve infiltration pancreatic islet cell T-lymphocytes , macrophage , immune cell , consequent loss beta cell . At onset T1DM 70 % beta cell destroy , whereas residual beta cell likely represent reservoir potential regeneration islet beta cell mass . A series immunological abnormality report T1DM include , limited , production autoantibody ( i.e. , glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD-65 ) , tyrosine phosphatase-related islet antigen 2 ( IA2 ) , Zinc Transporter 8 ( ZnT8A ) , insulin ( IAA ) well alteration capacity regulatory T cell ( Treg ) suppress action effector T cell ( Teff ) ; latter population think play key role immune destructive process . Therefore , vast majority study attempt prevent reverse disease focus immune suppression . While study show limited promise , many side effect significant enough one must question value short term benefit associate utilizing drug . GABA naturally occur substance physiology potential locally reduce inflammation protect pancreatic beta cell auto-immune destruction . GABA , synthesize glutamate GAD , well know neurotransmitter CNS act mainly GABAA receptor ( GABAAR ) . GABA locally produce pancreatic beta cell . GABAARs also express various immune cell , include T-cells , peripheral blood mononuclear cell , know exert immune-inhibitory effect . BABA appear play multiple role pancreas . GABA promote beta-cell growth survival , GABA also act GABA ( A ) receptor pancreatic alpha cell , suppress glucagon secretion , GABA suppress inflammation increase regulatory T-cell number . Based aforementioned information , envisage administer GABA new onset T1DM may preserve increase residual insulin production , suppress glucagon release , decrease inflammation surround pancreas . With , GABA may prolong beta-cell life diagnosis . Combining GAD-alum injection , aim halt autoimmune attack induce tolerance thereby save residual insulin production , may improve glycemic control even significantly decrease risk hypoglycemia long-term complication future .</detailed_description>
