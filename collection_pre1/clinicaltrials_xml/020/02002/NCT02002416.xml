	<brief_summary>The MET oncogene encodes receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) control genetic program lead cell growth , invasion protecÂ¬tion apoptosis . Although definitive role MET oncogene yet determine carcinogenesis gastric cancer , overexpression amplification c-Met demonstrate gastric cancer cell line . In addition , approximately 10-20 % gastric cancer tissue 40 % scirrhous histological subtype show harbor increase MET gene copy number . Importantly , PHA-665,752 , selective c-Met kinase inhibitor show significant reduction establish tumor mass mouse xenograft GTL16 , gastric cancer cell line &gt; 10-fold MET amplification . Another pivotal study show gastric cancer cell MET amplification extremely sensitive PHA-665,752 implicate potential role c-Met protein develop theranostics gastric cancer . More data indicate c-Met important prognostic factor gastric cancer . Gastric cancer heterogeneous disease . Does expression amplification c-Met primary lesion differ metastatic disease ? Does expression amplification c-Met early disease differ advance disease ? Till related report . Purposes : - Compare expression amplification c-Met primary lesion metastatic lesion together clinical characteristic , explore relationship c-Met expression metastatic pattern - Compare expression amplification c-Met early stage metastatic stage , explore role c-MET development carcinoma</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We retrospectively collect metastatic gastric cancer patient receive surgical resection primary disease metastatic lesion January 2006 December 2012 . Patients collect base follow criterion : ( 1 ) pathology proven advance gastric adenocarcinoma ; ( 2 ) paraffin-embedded tissue primary metastatic lesion available ( 3 ) full information follow-up . There 100 patient suitable analysis . c-MET protein expression amplification assess paraffin-embedded tissue primary metastatic disease obtain 100 patient immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) . The clinical pathologic data patient also collect analysis , include : gender , age , Karnofsky performance score ( KPS ) , chemotherapy regimen , tumor location , Lauren classification , histology subtypes , metastatic site . In order compare c-Met expression amplification early advanced stage , match 100 early stage ( stage I stage II ) patient base follow criterion ( 1 ) pathology proven gastric adenocarcinoma radical resection ; ( 2 ) paraffin-embedded tissue primary lesion available ( 3 ) full information follow-up MET IHC employ Dako MET IHC assay supply assay protocol pathology score guideline . MET FISH also employ Dako MET FISH assay supply assay protocol pathology score guideline .</detailed_description>
