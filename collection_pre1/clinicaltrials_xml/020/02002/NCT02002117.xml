	<detailed_description>NSCLC area oncology clinician begin use specific tumor-associated molecular aberration assign and/or prioritize target therapy patient . At early stage , multiple hurdle remain molecular profiling becomes routine part thoracic oncology practice . In particular , develop specific targeted therapy patient whose tumor harbor rare mutation , important identify appropriate candidate , design appropriate trial , execute trial adequate number achieve necessary endpoint . Implementation facilitate realization promise molecularly tailor therapy , could lead effective treatment few side effect .</detailed_description>

Pathologic cytological confirmation nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) available tissue 3 . Patients must understand provide write informed consent prior initiation studyspecific procedures 4 . Have life expectancy 3 month . 5 . Have stage IV NSCLC ( AJCC , 7th Edition ) 6 . No one prior systemic therapy advance metastatic NSCLC 6.1.Adjuvant chemotherapy : The adjuvant chemotherapy ( e.g . vinorelbine / cisplatin ) count one prior systemic therapy interval completion adjuvant chemotherapy documentation recurrence within 12 month . 6.2.Maintenance therapy : The maintenance therapy ( e.g . pemetrexed ) follow firstline systemic chemotherapy achieve complete response , partial response , stable disease count one prior systemic therapy maintenance drug use firstline combination therapy 7 . â‰¥20 year 8 .
