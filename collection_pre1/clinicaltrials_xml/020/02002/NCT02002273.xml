	<brief_summary>The objective randomized study compare effect two control chest tube protocol duration air leak fluid drainage follow pulmonary lobectomy segmentectomy use electronic regulate chest drainage system ( Thopaz ) . Previous study suggest amount negative pressure use level chest drainage device may affect duration air leak , result inconsistent , however reveal recent study understand physic chest drainage device may confound lack regulation pleural pressure . In addition , experimental study show fluid drainage may affect degree negative pleural pressure apply .</brief_summary>
