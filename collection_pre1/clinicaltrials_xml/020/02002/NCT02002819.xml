	<brief_summary>Patients Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) seizures addition lose memory mental function ( refer cognitive function ) . The seizure , example overactive electrical activity brain noticeable , contribute loss cognitive function . Studies animal model AD suggest drug prevents seizures call levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation improve cognition . Based evidence , investigator propose determine levetiracetam use treat patient AD . The investigator develop novel instrument population also use future large-scale clinical trial . The current study last 12 week involve people AD . Participants initially examine overnight brain wave study assess silent epileptic ( seizure-like ) activity . Presence epileptic activity screen exam require enter trial . Participants assign group randomize manner . One group receive levetiracetam 4 week , drug 4 week , placebo 4 week . For another group , order treatment reverse . The cognitive ability participant retested every 4 week compare begin . The cognitive test include virtual-reality navigation test memory computerized test mental flexibility problem solve . The participant monitor magnetoencephalogram ( MEG ) simultaneous EEG ( M/EEG ) visit . M/EEG highly effective non-invasive method identify brain region epileptic activity . The investigator need recruit 36 randomized participant test study hypothesis . This study take place University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) Memory Aging Center , large referral site dementia , Department Radiology . The overall goal study demonstrate levetiracetam provide cognitive benefit AD , particularly patient silent epileptic activity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To include trial follow inclusion criterion must meet : Ability obtain write informed consent patient caregiver surrogate ; Meets National Institute AgingAlzheimer 's Association Workgroups criterion probable AD dementia ( McKhann et al . 2011 ) ; Age ≤ 80 year time screening ; Willing able caregiver daily contact subject ; MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) score ≥ 18 and/or Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) &lt; 2 initial screen assessment ; Subjects caregiver must able comply prescribe regime study treatment throughout course study , meet required time commitment four day inperson visit ; Any concurrent treatment AD approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , donepezil , galantamine , rivastigmine , memantine , must stable least 30 day prior screen least 60 day prior study day 1 . Other medication ( except list exclusion criterion ) allow long dose stable 30 day prior screen . The follow criterion consider ground exclusion : Any condition could account cognitive deficit addition AD , include limited Vitamin B12 folate deficiency , abnormal thyroid function , posttraumatic condition , syphilis , multiple sclerosis another neuroinflammatory disorder , Parkinson 's disease , vascular multiinfarct dementia , Huntington 's disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor , progressive supranuclear palsy , subdural hematoma , etc . ; Previous history seizure disorder , except case first seizure detection epileptiform activity within 5 year screen patient prescribe anticonvulsant ; Significant systemic medical illness ; Use medication likely affect CNS function ( e.g. , benzodiazepine , narcotic ) ; Severe renal dysfunction creatine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min , would affect serum LEV level ; Participation another AD clinical trial within 3 month Screening , AD clinical trial , vaccine , potential longterm effect ; Treatment another study drug investigational drug within 30 day Screening ; Pregnant lactating ; Any medical condition determine investigator potentially create undue risk adverse effect ; Biomarker evidence unsupportive diagnosis AD .</criteria>
