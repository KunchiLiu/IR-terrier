	<brief_summary>The Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine vaccine licence prevent tuberculosis ( TB ) . The stimulus give immune system allow respond effectively subsequent infection TB . Many study show BCG effective reduce death TB disease , particularly child . However , also evidence country relatively high death rate , BCG reduce death rate would expect effect TB alone . This controversial important find warrant serious consideration . One possibility BCG , addition stimulate immune system TB , also positive effect way immune system work generally . This might mean effective response serious infection completely unrelated TB , ability respond well routine childhood vaccine , maintain response longer . In example , time BCG administration relation vaccine could crucial . This study recruit 30 healthy baby would routinely offer BCG vaccine UK within first week life . Babies assign random one three group ten baby . BCG give one group baby around birth , one three month old last group get BCG study . Babies stay study 13 month old five blood test period . This preliminary study look participant ' blood see difference immune system , response MenC childhood meningitis vaccine pattern gene activate BCG give .</brief_summary>
