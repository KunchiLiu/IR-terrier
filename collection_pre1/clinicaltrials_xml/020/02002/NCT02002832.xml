	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Lurasidone Treatment Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening period ( Days -14～-1 ) In-patients out-patients screen . Washout period ( Days -7～ -1 ) Current medication ( antipsychotic ) must discontinue within washout period . The washout period antipsychotic start least Day-1 . All relevant examination ( except clinical laboratory examination ) evaluation complete randomization determine whether subject meet protocol-specified criterion . Subjects randomize 2 group confirmation eligibility screen . Double-blind treatment period ( Days 1~42 ) Subjects need stay hospital least 3 week treatment period . The start dose lurasidone 40 mg/day . After administration 6 consecutive day ( Days 1~6 medication ) , dose either increase 80 mg/day maintain 40 mg/day end double-blind treatment period . The start dose risperidone 2 mg/day . After administration 3 consecutive day ( Days 1~3 medication ) , dose increase 4 mg/day administer additional 3 consecutive day ( Days 4~6 medication ) . From Day 7 , dose either increase 6 mg/day maintain 4mg/day end double-blind treatment period . The dos adjust weekly investigator 's discretion Day 7 . At week 2 , 3 , 4 , change PANSS total score baseline less -9 , dose must increase high dose . The dose reduced time drug intolerance issue emerge . Usage study drug day night meal . Follow-up observation period ( Days 43~49 ) Observe subject 's condition collect safety data .</detailed_description>
