	<brief_summary>Pain way brain interprets certain bodily sensation . It difficult describe put word perception tolerance pain varies widely individual . It known age , gender past experience memory past experience contribute patient ' feeling discomfort tolerance pain , reason patient actually experience pain post surgery still unknown . Because pain affect every person point life , utmost importance find effective analgesic method , provide analgesia tailor individual 's need well discover new method may able identify individual prone suffer serious , chronic pain . It propose epigenetic modification may play role sensitivity analgesia response trauma , post surgery . The effect epigenetic change key gene role play analgesia sensitivity pain perception deserve research . Epigenetics grow field study genetic modification involve change base sequence gene , result nonetheless change gene expression . It long know change gene expression play important role establishment pain state . But known whether prim injury induce last epigenetic mark would result increase postoperative acute pain risk chronic pain . Only fully understanding epigenetic mechanism able offer well drug treatment pain , identify high risk postoperative pain postsurgical chronic pain . The purpose study determine whether severity pain follow surgical procedure , third molar surgery relate baseline methylation status promoter region IL-6 TNF-α change methylation status post surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epigenetic Influences Post-Surgical Acute Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>( ) Subjects : Sixty subject undergoing third molar surgery ( hereafter know 'cases ' ) recruit The Queen Mary Hospital The Prince Philip Dental Hospital sixty , age sex match control undergo surgery next 3 month , undergone surgery past year ( hereafter know 'controls ' ) also recruit Outpatients department hospital . ( ii ) Methods : The study aim detail explain subject informed consent sought . A pain diaryquestionnaire develop group adapt use assess pain experience subject pre post surgery . Research personnel accompany case subject , fill pain diaryquestionnaire visit patient ' blood take . The following health questionaires complete subject recruites : SF-36 : 8-scale profile functional health well-being score well psychometrically-based physical mental health summary measure HADS : Assessment psychological status subject ( anxiety &amp; depression ) Pain assessment : Pain rest opening assess use numerical rating scale ( NRS , 1= pain , 10 = severe pain ) follow time point : 1 . Before surgery 2 . 4 hourly surgery 16 hour 3 . At 24th , 48th 72nd surgery 4 . 1 month surgery telephone interview . 5 . 3 month surgery telephone interview . If pain present , question neuropathic pain ask . Venous EDTA blood ( 10ml ) occacasion drawn case one hour prior surgery , 1 hour 3 hour post surgery . Then ask return hospital 3 5 day post surgery one blood taking , macrophage separate blood total RNA extract soon possible blood take half total cell . The remainder cell ( macrophage ) store -80oC batch DNA extraction . Venous EDTA blood ( 20ml ) drawn control subject time convenient , 3 5 day post first blood taking . The blood take control subject treat exactly way blood take case subject . Therefore , four sample total obtained case control subject . The size IL-6 TNF-α promoter region span sequence upstream transcriptional start site well part first exon determined literature search use database reference , CpG islands first identify primer design ( http : //www.cpgislands.com/ ) . For analysis methylation , commercial kit use ( EpiTect Plus LyseAll Bisulfite Kit Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . Samples undergo bisulfite-conversion , unmethylated cytosine deaminate , form uracil . Methylated cytosine remain unchanged . The location methylated cytosine gene sequence amount methylated cytosine identify quantitated Pyrosequencing use establish technique . Results express % methylation promoter region IL-6 NF-ĸB . Note : The pyrosequencing technique analyse fragment DNA 50 base pair one reaction . According data CpG Island Searcher , % GC set 55 % , observe CpG/expected CpG set 0.65 gap adjacent island set 100bp , CpG islands find either IL-6 , TNFα promoter . Therefore , methylation status whole promoter region gene study use 40 pair primer gene ( order cover 2kb promoter region ) . This approach adopt sensitive reliable determination site specific DNA methylation extend region promoter region . ( iii ) Study design : This case-control study . The sample use study whole blood sample take pre- post- surgery case , match time , control . Power calculation : No data exist level DNA methylation promoter region IL-6 TNF-α normal healthy subject . Power calculation reveal 51 subject group require 80 % power detect true difference variable interest 5 % significance level ( calculation use G*Power software , version 3.1 ) . A total 60 subject recruit group take consideration drop rate . ( iv ) Data processing analysis : Paired t-test ( non-parametric equivalent ) perform investigate difference level DNA methylation pre- post- surgery . Unpaired t-test use investigate difference level DNA methylation case control . Correlational analysis use investigate relationship methylation status IL-6 TNF-α expression . Descriptive statistic employ describe change methylation status ( i.e. , different site CpG island methylated ) promoter region IL-6 TNF-α B , pre-post surgery two different sample time point control subject . Purpose potential : This pilot , exploratory environmental-epigenetics study effect bilateral third molar surgery DNA methylation change promoter region IL-6 NF-ĸB , influence methylation status gene expression . The result provide insight promote understand molecular mechanism methylation status inflammatory gene affect experience pain post surgery .</detailed_description>
