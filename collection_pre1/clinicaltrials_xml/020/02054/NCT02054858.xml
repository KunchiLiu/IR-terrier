	<brief_summary>This study aim ass apply ischaemic insult arm give intravenous contrast help decrease incidence develop contrast induce acute renal injury patient undergo contrast-enhanced CT Scans . The main research question 'In adult in-patients undergo contrast-enhanced CT scan , remote ischaemic pre-conditioning ( RIPC ) induce brief arm ischaemia reperfusion , compare control , reduce proportion patient develop contrast-induced acute kidney injury first 3 post-scan day ?

	<brief_title>Preconditioning Against Renal Damage Under Contrast Examination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous contrast diagnostic therapeutic intervention lead cause hospital-acquired acute renal failure ( 1 ) . Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) occur complex mechanism include toxic hypoxic renal tubular injury , diminish renal parenchymal circulation renal endothelial dysfunction production oxygen free radical due post-ischaemia oxidative stress ( 2 ) . With increase number diagnostic therapeutic intervention , incidence CI-AKI rise next decade . Already , 40 % general surgical in-patients undergo cross-sectional imaging compute tomography ( CT ) , largely use contrast ( 3 ) . Optimal clinical care many specialty oncology , emergency medicine surgery rely upon information derive contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging . In consequence , large number patient expose risk CI-AKI . Current CI-AKI preventive measure comprise identification at-risk patient , minimisation contrast dose use intravenous volume expansion ( 4 ) . Simple , cost-effective method reduce CI-AKI require . Risk factor CI-AKI include advanced age , diabetes mellitus , pre-existing renal insufficiency congestive cardiac failure . Dehydration also increase risk ( 5 ) . While patient age 65 year currently account 11 % Irish population , account 30 % surgical admission ( 6 ) . In recent cohort study 1800 surgical in-patients major Irish teaching hospital , acute renal failure common major complication , occur 2.4 % patient ( 6 ) . Multivariate analysis cohort demonstrate increase age emergency admission independent risk factor complication ( 6 ) . Emergency surgical patient constitute high-risk group simple method minimise complication require . Remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) simple technique whereby brief period skeletal muscle ischaemia reperfusion trigger period resistance ischaemia-reperfusion injury distant tissue e.g . heart kidney ( 7 ) . It reduce renal damage follow endovascular aneurysm repair , procedure require considerable contrast-volumes ( 8 ) . A recent meta-analysis demonstrate RIPC significantly reduce post-procedure creatinine level follow cardiovascular procedure , though considerable clinical heterogeneity include trial ( 9 ) . We hypothesise RIPC induce use brief period upper limb ischaemia-reperfusion reduce AKI patient undergo contrast enhance CT scan . The hypothesis RIPC reduce CI-AKI first explore Whittaker Pryzklenk ( 10 ) . They utilise available data patient cohort undergo emergency coronary angioplasty . Patients 1 3 balloon inflation coronary artery serve control group whilst &gt; 3 balloon inflation serve RIPC group.Both group display immediate improvement estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . However , control group display statistically significant decrease eGFR day 3 post-procedure ( 77 +14 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 70 +12 ml/min/1.73m2 ) . The RIPC group display difference day 3 ( 81 +21 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 80 +14 ml/min/1.73m2 ) despite receive large contrast volume . This observation imply potential protective effect RIPC . Greater availability CT technology lead dramatic increase number patient undergoing ce-CTAP recent year . Between 1996 2010 , number patient undergoing CT scan United States triple , increase 8 % per annum ( 11 ) . Simultaneously , increasingly elderly sick population mean many patient multiple co-morbidities , increase risk contrast-induced acute kidney injury . Approximately 6.5 % patient undergoing ce-CT develop acute kidney injury define &gt; 25 % increase serum creatinine baseline ( 12 ) . Simple method reduce CI-AKI required . We propose use remote ischaemic preconditioning could simple , cost-effective measure could decrease incidence CI-AKI high risk patient undergo contrast enhance CT scan .</detailed_description>
