	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Ways Improve OVC HIV Prevention Well-being</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness TF-CBT compare PC improve range OVC outcomes include HIV risk behavior also mediate factor constitute important outcome - well-being , mental health , functioning , caregiver health support . The study design also include measurement impact factor may moderate effect - age , gender , religion , ethnicity , HIV knowledge attitude , education , physical health . This effectiveness trial intervention provide MoH organization already provide service OVC . Assessments : Study instrument administer use Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing ( ACASI ) system develop Tufts University . The Tufts ACASI system allow responder control navigate answer sensitive question privately discreetly . It develop use Macromedia Authorware ( v7.0 ) program language native speaker record screen text . The Tufts ACASI system offer live interview data entry mode deliver variety question type , include yes/no , single-answer multiple choice ( select one answer ) , multiple-answer multiple choice ( select apply ) question allow numeric keypad entry , well scale question allow user click point along scale , text entry interviewer-administered , open-ended question Procedure : Study participant recruit via several method . The first method recruitment urban community outreach exist Home Based Care Workers ( HBCWs ) peer educator Archdiocese Lusaka , local church , local organization outreach activity community . The HBCWs peer educator introduce study family community believe may eligible study . Investigators also ask peer educator HBCWs use recruitment script introduce study adolescent his/her caretaker . If adolescent and/or caretaker interested hearing study , information pass study staff contact family . The HBCW make follow-up appointment family interested hearing study arrange time go local parish . At follow-up appointment one study assessor discuss study detail potential participant ( adolescent caretaker ) . This preferable clinic-based recruitment , 1 ) many OVC come clinic reason stigma , fear , mental health problem transport problem 2 ) HBCWs assist retention , 3 ) study staff contact family already indicate HBCW would like hear study As second recruitment strategy , investigator also hold general community meeting study sit member community invite . Investigators explain general purpose study meeting answer question . Investigators invite family contact u directly interest hear study one study assessor talk HBCW put family touch research staff . The community also give specific date study team central parish may come assessed and/or ask additional question . Third , may use school-based recruitment . For strategy investigator first hold meeting school official ( e.g. , Principals , head teacher ) school within catchment area Lusaka . Investigators also gain approval Ministry Education Zambia need . Investigators also hold general meeting school open staff , student , parent let know study . If school official agree recruitment school , investigator ask introduce guidance counselor . Investigators train guidance counselor school , knowledge student school might eligible study , purpose study introduce study family believe would eligible . Meet head teacher , explain study . Also talks staff member . Guidance counselor would meet parent child see interested . Additionally , provide study contact information general school meeting interested family may contact u directly . Investigators study staff on-site select day meet privately interested family explain study full , obtain informed consent , proceed study activity . Fourth , investigator use snowball sampling strategy . A large number adolescent caregiver enrol study inform u know family community think would benefit mental health psychosocial service . Investigators plan counselor ask current study participant know specific family think would interested hearing study . If participant know family think would interested , investigator ask participant bring family meet counselor . The counselor give brief introduction study . The counselor refer family still interested research team day/time setup family privately meet assessor consent screen per original study protocol . The assessor parish location , need would go HBCW ( HBCW involve recruitment ) family ' home indicate interest study . The assessor conduct adult consent caretaker permission process caretaker first . Consent permission obtain time part study -- screening , interview use ACASI , intervention . In case , caretaker provide consent participate interview intervention him/herself also provide permission adolescent participate screening , interview , intervention . For case , response section assessor indicate caretaker consent participate section ( screening/interview intervention ) separately give permission adolescent participate 3 section ( screener , interview intervention ) separately . If caregiver child respond yes consent caretaker provide permission adolescent , assessor administer screener . This screener score immediately child determine eligible study , assessor ask able complete full assessment battery time ( approximately 2 hour ) would like schedule separate time complete . If separate time/date prefer , assessor schedule family . The HBCW present consent assessment process . If adolescent find eligible screen interview ( result either adolescent screening , caretaker screening , ) , assessor allocate study ID number adolescent . When baseline designate complete , assessor set two notebook computer baseline interview : one adolescent one caretaker . The adolescent caretaker complete interview simultaneously separately ( separate room ) , assessor present close case problem question . On completion baseline interview assessor let family know someone near MoH clinic contact . At end day assessor report allocate study IDs on-site Study Director , send JHU-based research staff retain confidential master list link study IDs intervention base random assignment . THe JHU researcher respond allocation study IDs . These data use inform clinic intervention new participant receive prior first visit . Both intervention available study site . Neither assessor , caretaker , adolescent know intervention adolescent receive . Whether adolescent agree join study s/he access service Archdiocese Lusaka . These service include Psychosocial Counseling , Home Based Care service , medical education support , VCT , Community Sensitization Campaigns , Behavioral Change , livelihood support , TB care , awareness program communicable disease . The adolescent also access HIV prevention strategy available MoH clinic include , VCT , counseling , safe sex intervention primary care service . For study , monitor utilization service include information variable analysis , determine effect potential moderator treatment effect . The adolescent either go MoH clinic different , pre-identified community center first appointment counselor receive either TF-CBT PC . Later session either clinic another location counselor family agree , location vary week week necessary feasible . The caretaker may also participate session ( consent participate study along adolescent ) . Because Archdiocese Lusaka sit deeply embed community , neighborhood structures—such churches—may use meeting point . Follow-up Assessments adolescent caretaker do 0 6 month completion intervention . The 6 month time point consider primary time point interest . If one treatment show substantially great efficacy 6 month offer receive intervention 12 month assessment do group originally allocate effective intervention . We expect 3-4 study contact research participants caregiver : 1 . Baseline interview 2 . Follow-up 0 month 3 . Follow-up interview 6 month 4 . Follow-up interview 12 month . The outcome Specific Aim 1 indicator HIV risk behavior . This include question social circle engage risky sexual behavior multiple sexual partner , sex without condom , STIs substance use ( HIV risk assessment screen tool ) . The WAF instrument also assess broad HIV risk indicator knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy sexual practice . The outcome Specific Aim 2 score various mental health well-being test , include CPSS , CBCL , self-perception , Achenbach Youth Self Report , ASSIST ( substance use ) , functionality . All primary analysis base intent-to-treat approach . For continuous outcome , linear mixed model model outcome time incorporate random intercept term possibly random slope term account within subject correlation repeat measure . The test score completion intervention 6 12 month completion model separately use treatment arm , baseline symptom score , time , interaction treatment arm time fix covariates model . This analysis allow estimation mean difference symptomatology score two treatment arm time , adjust baseline score need . Mean difference 95 % confidence interval calculate present . For dichotomous variable , generalize linear mixed effect model use . A risk ratio 95 % confidence interval compare binary outcome two arm time report . Potential modifier mediator handle describe . Moderator mediator analysis : The study evaluate impact hypothesize moderator ( child age , gender , religion , ethnicity , HIV knowledge attitude , family formation , education , physical health ) treatment response . We also hypothesize change course therapy caregiver level distress support change child 's mental health self-perception mediate impact treatment child 's outcome . All significant moderate mediate variable simultaneously enter multiple regression analysis respect individual outcome measure ascertain variable contribute unique variance estimate outcome variable . Significant moderator mediator test specific treatment effect use multiple linear-regression analysis . Multiple regression technique examine pattern relationship treatment , hypothesize mediating influence outcomes . Using step suggest Baron Kenny , examine whether ) treatment arm significantly predict mediator ; b ) mediator significantly predict symptom outcome ; c ) whether significant relationship treatment condition symptom outcome decrease significantly change mediator enter regression model . In addition primary analysis clinical effectiveness intervention , also analyze cost effectiveness implementation challenge . Service use , employment-related caregiver data collect retrospective period 3 month baseline , 1 month , 6 month 12 month post-treatment use version Client Service Receipt Inventory adapt OVC . Service use carer input turn cost measure apply local national unit cost value . We also monitor evaluate system implementation factor , include acceptability , adoption , appropriateness , feasibility , fidelity , penetration sustainability perspective multiple stakeholder include , provider , organization policy leader . Semi-structured interview conduct stakeholder examine perspectives barrier facilitator implementation .</detailed_description>
