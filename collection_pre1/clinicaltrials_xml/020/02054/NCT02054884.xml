	<brief_summary>There standard treatment Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) , randomize trial conduct establish standard care . Despite sizable number objective response induce combination cyototoxic chemotherapy , prolongation patient overall survival never demonstrate . This open-label , randomize , double-arm , multi-centre , phase II study F16IL2 combination paclitaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy , propose test therapeutic efficacy F16IL2 plus paclitaxel patient metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma , amenable surgery . A total 90 patient Merkel cell carcinoma enrol treated study ; 45 patient receive combination treatment F16IL2 paclitaxel ( Arm A ) , 45 patient receive paclitaxel monotherapy ( Arm B ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F16IL2 Plus Paclitaxel Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>F16IL2 study two clinical pase I/II trials patient different advanced cancer type . One ( Nr . EudraCT : 2007-006457-42 ) test administration therapeutic dos paclitaxel ( 90 mg/m2 weekly basis ) together escalate dos F16IL2 ( 5 Mio IU IL2 equivalent weekly administration schedule , definition MTD ) . More 40 patient treat clinical trial . As today , high F16IL2 dose test corresponds 45 Mio IU , dose escalataion F16IL2/paclitaxel combination study still ongoing . In general , treatment patient F16IL2 plus paclitaxel well tolerate exceed expect toxicity chemotherapy alone . Multiple objective durable tumor response observe F16IL2/paclitaxel combination trial ( particularly patient non small cell lung cancer melanoma previously fail several line chemotherapy ) . In addition several disease stabilization previously progressive patient . Paclitaxel promote assembly microtubule tubulin dimer stabilize microtubule prevent depolymerisation . This stability result inhibition normal reorganization microtubule network essential vital interphase mitotic cellular function . In addition , paclitaxel reduces abnormal array bundle microtubule throughout cell cycle multiple aster microtubule mitosis . F16 human recombinant antibody fragment scFv ( single chain Fragment variable ) format direct tenascin C , angiogenesis marker common solid tumor independent tumor type . ScFv ( F16 ) selectively localizes tumor tissue animal model demonstrate histologically mechanistic study involve mouse transfected orthotopic human tumour . IL2 , human cytokine interleukin-2 , potent stimulator immune response . It central role regulation T cell response effect immune cell natural killer cell , B cell , monocyte/macrophages neutrophil ( Smith , 1988 ) . IL2 induce tumor regression ability stimulate potent cell-mediated immune response vivo ( Rosenberg , 2000 ) .</detailed_description>
