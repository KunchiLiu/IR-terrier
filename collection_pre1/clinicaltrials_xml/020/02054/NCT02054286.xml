	<brief_summary>The objective Phase I/II trial evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity THV01 compare placebo HIV-1 infect patient HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) . THV01 compose two vaccine derive HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) : lentiviral vector . They non-replicative infectious . They inject intramuscularly , eight week apart . Three dos assess compare placebo . 36 patient enrol . Eligible patient must undetectable viral load must treat HAART 12 month . They randomly allocate one study group receive experimental drug one three dos match placebo . Their anti-HIV treatment alleviate around experimental drug ' administration enable THV01 efficacy . HAART resume one week second injection . 15 week resumption , HAART interrupt . Patients monitor every 2 week CD4+ T cell count viral load well thorough assessment elicit immune response . Stringent anti-HIV treatment resumption criterion implement , base CD4+ T cell count viral load . Statistical analysis perform last patient reach last visit ( week 36 early case early termination ) . A long-term follow-up enrol patient perform 5 year post-prime administration . This provide additional data safety , immune response potential long-term risks/benefits associate THV01 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Immunogenicity Induced THV01 Treatment Patients Infected With HIV-1 Clade B Treated With Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II randomize , double-blind placebo control study ass safety , tolerability immunogenicity THV01 three dose patient infected HIV-1 clade B currently HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) . THV01 involve two intramuscular injection , consist THV01-1 THV01-2 lentiviral vector , administer intramuscularly eight week apart . These lentiviral vector non-replicative self-inactivating . Both encode HIV antigen . 36 patient enrol . They must HIV-1 ( clade B ) infect patient , treat HAART 12 month undetectable viral load . Patients randomly allocate one group : - Group 1 : patient receive THV01-1 THV01-2 vaccine 5.10E+6 TU ( transduce unit ) placebo ; - Group 2 : patient receive THV01-1 THV01-2 vaccine 5.10E+7 TU ( transduce unit ) placebo ; - Group 3 : patient receive THV01-1 THV01-2 vaccine 5.10E+8 TU ( transduce unit ) placebo . Hence , twelve patient randomize block 4 3:1 ratio ( vaccine : placebo ) dose . Experimental drug ' injection occur Week 0 Week 8 . HAART alleviate patient `` vaccination phase '' enable efficient transduction host cell lentiviral vector . Initial HAART resume Week 9 . Starting Week 24 , HAART interrupt . Patients monitor stringent rhythm . HAART resumption criterion base CD4+ T cell count viral load implement guaranty safety enrol patient . Once last patient reach Week 36 visit ( ealier case early termination ) , statistical analysis perform . A long-term follow-up enrol patient perform 5 year administration THV01-1 . During follow-up , three visit plan per year , blood sample . This provide data long-term safety THV01 ; long-term immune response generate THV01 potential long-term risks/benefits associate THV01 .</detailed_description>
