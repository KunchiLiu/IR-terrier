	<detailed_description>The study include 36 carpal tunnel syndrome patient randomly divide 3 groups.The first group receive 0 W/cm2 placebo ultrasound treatment . second group receive 1.0 W/cm2 continuous ultrasound treatment third group receive 1.0 W/cm2 1:4 pulse ultrasound treatment 5 day week total 15 session . All patient also treat night splint treatment . Pretreatment posttreatment Visual Analogue Scale score , Symptom Severity Scale score , Functional Status Scale score , median nerve motor conduction velocity . distal latency sensory conduction velocity median nerve 2nd finger palm compare .</detailed_description>
