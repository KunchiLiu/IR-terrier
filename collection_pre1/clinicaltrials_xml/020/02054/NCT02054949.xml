	<detailed_description>One third patient idiopathic autism treatment resistant epilepsy , associate earlier onset seizure . In addition insufficient response medical treatment , also poorer response surgical VNS approach ( Sansa et al 2011 ) . Novel approach reduce seizure burden improve quality life child caregiver need . There plethora basic research document elevate oxidative stress animal model seizure . Several animal model decrease oxidative stress use compound antioxidant effect , suprisingly , human study do date . This small open-label pilot study examine use N-acetyl cysteine , inexpensive readily available over-the-counter nutritional supplement , reduce seizure frequency 10 youth autism respond completely conventional anticonvulsant therapy</detailed_description>
