	<brief_title>Geriatric Assessment Intervention Reducing Toxicity Older Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine provide information regard geriatric assessment ( GA ) GA-driven recommendation oncology physician reduces clinician-rated grade 3-5 toxicity patient age 70 advanced cancer start new treatment regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Proportion patient alive 6 month study entry . II . Evaluate whether provide oncology physician information regard GA summary GA-driven recommendation influence clinical care old patient receive treatment advance cancer . IIA . Compare treatment decision ( measure relative dose intensity agent administer first cycle ) . IIB . Compare number type GA-driven recommendation implement old patient start new treatment regimen advance cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether provide oncology physician GA information GA-driven recommendation slow functional physical decline old patient advance cancer . II . To examine association patient-reported symptom ( measure Patient-Reported Outcomes [ PRO ] -Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] ) geriatric domain ( measure geriatric assessment ) . III . To compare PRO-CTCAE physician-rated CTCAE sample old patient receive chemotherapy agent similar prevalence toxicity . IV . To examine association PRO-CTCAE treatment decision . V. To examine association PRO-CTCAE adverse outcome ( early discontinuation chemotherapy agent similar prevalence toxicity , hospitalization , mortality ) . OUTLINE : Treatment sit randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( GA intervention ) : Patients complete geriatric assessment . Patients physician provide geriatric assessment information recommendation . ARM II ( usual care ) : Patients complete geriatric assessment , information clinically significant cognitive impairment depression provide oncology team . After completion study , patient follow 4-6 week , 3 6 month , 1 year .</detailed_description>
