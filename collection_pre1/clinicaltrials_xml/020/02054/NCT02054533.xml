	<brief_summary>Understanding best treat inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) evolve last ten year . Evidence suggest effective therapy early course Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) involve use immune suppress medication anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( anti-TNF ) agent infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab . However , many CD UC patient still ultimately require surgery despite use medication . Side effect anti-TNF agent include increase risk infection due effect immune system . Little known use medication near time surgery may affect patient ' risk infection post-operative complication . The available study topic give conflict result . These study limit fact small size retrospective . Retrospective study primarily involve chart review method identify potential risk factor infection complication already occur . This method limit type quality information/data collect . The conflict result lead variance practice pattern regard management anti-TNF agent , time surgery , even type surgery . By enrol patient time surgery , collect extensive information may possible previously study potential risk factor infectious non-infectious complication follow surgery . Risk factor study include individual patient characteristic , disease characteristic , surgical method , novel characteristic CT scan MRIs extensive medication exposure . The primary objective determine exposure anti-TNF agent prior surgery increase risk infection post-operatively . And evaluate exposure anti-TNF agent patient history use measurement anti-TNF drug level time surgery . Monitoring drug level time surgery never utilized way evaluate risk anti-TNF agent IBD . However , do ass risk medication different disease . If anti-TNF agent find pose risk infectious non-infectious outcome IBD patient undergo surgery , change maybe need way medication use around time surgery . Additionally , collect comprehensive information potential risk factor besides medication use patient great risk bad outcome identify take protective measure possible . The aim study address CCFA challenge well define risk medical surgical therapy improve quality care IBD patient undergo surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Risk Factors Post-operative Infection Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , observational study design determine pre-operative exposure anti-TNF agent independent risk factor post-operative infectious complication within 30 day surgery subject IBD . Patient Assessments : Patient assessment occur Screening/Baseline Visit , Discharge Day , 30-Day Telephone Follow-up ( see Figure 1 ) . Potential pre-operative predictor post-operative infection assess Screening/Baseline Visit brief patient interview abstraction medical record . Data enter electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . A second data abstraction occur Discharge Day . At time , data day surgery available include finalized operative report , anesthesia record , pathology . The post-operative medical record also review potential confounding factor relate post-operative infection ( i.e . presence central line , foley catheter , antibiotic use , etc. ) . Additionally , medical record review occurrence post-operative infection non-infectious outcome study . Data enter eCRF . The final assessment occur post-operative day 30 ( within 1 week ) . A telephone interview conduct . The purpose interview assess occurrence post-operative infection non-infectious outcome . If infection identify , relevant medical record request confirm infection abstract information pertain infection . Data enter eCRF . Assessment Anti-TNF Exposure : Exposure anti-TNF agent define two different way . The primary analysis define anti-TNF exposure patient report use within 12 week surgery pre-operatively . Confirmation patient report medical record abstraction . This definition anti-TNF exposure consistent many retrospective , single center study post-operative infection relate IBD surgery . The 12-week cutoff point choose account washout infliximab surgery base half-life . However , different anti-TNF agent vary half-lives . Date last administration prior surgery record different cutoff point define exposure 4 week 8 week may explore . The secondary analysis define anti-TNF exposure measure peri-operative level patient history anti-TNF use six month precede surgery . Anti-TNF level anti-drug antibody check two time point patient recent anti-TNF use . An initial level drawn screen visit , may occur peri-operatively post-op day 4 . A second level drawn anytime post-op day 4 post-op day 7 . The serum blood draw store -80 Celsius third year study time sample test drug level antibody .</detailed_description>
