	<brief_summary>In clinical research study investigator test efficacy innovative , non-invasive methodology reduce mortality low limb loss among high-risk medically-underserved patient cardiovascular disease North Philadelphia . Patients cardiovascular disease recent low limb amputation treat intermittent compression device remain low limb prevent dual amputation . The study hypothesis study intervention protect low limb-loss/death reduce cardiovascular mortality patient ( one year effect limb-loss/death ) . This study may result good secondary prevention strategy disadvantage urban population well general population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>External Compression Therapy Secondary Prevention Lower-Limb Loss Cardiovascular Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate whether non-invasive intervention 3 month intermittent compression device ( ArtAssist® ) high risk patient group reduce risk subsequent one-year limb-loss and/or death ( e.g . one-year amputation-free survival overall survival . ) Survival amputation markedly decrease due generalize cardiovascular disease . The thirty-day mortality amputation range 6 % 16 % depend renal function . Two-year mortality amputation 40 % .For dialysis patient , two year mortality 58 % .13 The five-year mortality amputation non-renal patient 65 % , dialysis patient five-year mortality 83 % . Patients undergone major low extremity amputation relate vascular disease also increase risk lose remain low extremity . The loss second low extremity profound impact patient ' ability ambulate function independently first amputation . Despite intensive initial rehabilitation , use prosthetics bilateral amputee decrease rapidly time . Contra-lateral amputation occur 33 % , mean eight month . According another study , 17 % diabetic initial amputee become bilateral amputee median time less one year men less two year woman . According 2013 study , majority subsequent contra-lateral amputation occur first year index amputation . We hope prove role IPC vascular patient high-risk mortality limb-loss relatively low-cost compression therapy . We hope learn underserved patient category likely benefit start intervention .</detailed_description>

If patient acute renal failure dialysis patient he/she eligible , separately randomize analyzed Creatinine link survival . Subjects status post heal minor ( toe/metatarsal ) amputation treatment leg include . Patients demonstrable peripheral artery disease anklepressure and/or toepressure remain limb ( initial amputation mostly precipitate diabetic neuropathy , deformity , infection , acute embolization . Amputations result late effect trauma , burn , frostbite , etc . also exclude . Patients able consent due mental status , willing able perform compression therapy sit position Contracted nursinghome patient index amputation result largely pressurerelated tissueloss decubitus Patients infect gangrene osteomyelitis present contralateral extremity ( would need compress ) time index amputation Patients active dry gangrene leg compress Patients congestive heart failure Patients deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism suspect Patients undergone arterial compression therapy within 1 year prior study Bilateral amputation low extremity Patients expect lifespan less 3 month Patients require intensive care eligible , transfer regular nursing floor Patients remain limb nonfunctional , example due previous stroke</criteria>
