The effect caffeine consumption platelet reactivity depend caffeine dose duration administration . Chronic caffeine consumption ( ≥7 day ) appear associated inhibition platelet aggregation , probably upregulation adenosine receptor . The effect acute caffeine administration platelet function less clear . Different study show either increase , decrease , change platelet reactivity acute caffeine administration .

Platelet function evaluate use validated method : VerifyNow System ( Accumetrics Inc. , San Diego , CA ) , point-of-care turbidimetry-based optical detection system measure platelet-induced aggregation . Platelet function measure VerifyNow P2Y12 test baseline , ( 5 day wash-out period avoid carryover effect ) 10 day take caffeine .</detailed_description>
