	<brief_summary>- Postoperative pulmonary complication patient undergo cardiac surgery major clinical problem , present negative impact morbidity , mortality , length hospital stay health care cost . Although physical therapy widely use resource improve lung function postoperative period , adoption routine procedures physical therapy need discuss . - Incentive spirometer mechanical device use reduce postoperative pulmonary complication . In general , activated inspiratory effort , visualize uplifted plate ball transparent cylinder sustain inspiration . - Breath Stacking technique allow patient inhale great volume air , keep long period time use one-way valve , thus promote accumulation successive inspiratory volume prevent exhalation . - The objective study evaluate effectiveness two different technique respiratory therapy reduce postoperative pulmonary complication improve lung function . - Type study : randomize clinical trial - Hypothesis 1 . Both technique Trifllo II Incentive Spirometry ( IS ) ( Trifllo ® - II ) Breath Stacking ( BS ) may present similar effectiveness reduce pulmonary complication , improve lung function respiratory muscle strength ( MIP MEP ) , well reduce hospital stay . 2 . Trifllo II Incentive Spirometry ( IS ) ( Trifllo ® - II ) may effective Breath Stacking reduce pulmonary complication , improve lung function respiratory muscle strength , well reduce hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Type study : randomize clinical trial - Study site : The study carry Hospital Santa Casa de Londrina . - Subjects : patient schedule cardiac surgery study ( CABG / valve replacement ) - Patients evaluate preoperatively , fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . They inform procedure submit , well objective propose study preoperatively . If approve patient , `` Statement Informed Consent - SIC '' sign . - Inclusion Criteria . Individuals admit Hospital Santa Casa de Londrina ( HSCL ) program cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass , age 18 year ; referral surgery study team . Individuals must aware , inform , agree participate study , include sign SIC . - Exclusion Criteria . Individuals cognitive impairment prevents implementation spirometry ( lung function ) , manovacuometry ( MIP MEP ) incentive spirometry , 18 year age , patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnose clinical history spirometry ( FVC &lt; 80 % predict / FEV1 &lt; 70 % predict ) individual history asthma . b . Patients withdraw study Intention Treat Analysis perform case : patient extubated need continue mechanical ventilation 24 hour post-operative complication postoperative period ; hemodynamic instability ; myocardial infarction operation ; severe blood loss define medical staff ; loss 20 % total blood volume ( 12 ) ; mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) &lt; 70 mmHg , ; reduce cardiac output require use intra-aortic balloon vasoactive drug 72 hour , ICU admission need new reintubation . Patients agree participate signing SIC . - Procedures intervention a. randomization a.1 . After select inclusion criterion sign informed consent preoperatively , patient allocate one two group base Consort ; a.2 . The allocation generate standardized random table . The allocation concealment ensure use opaque envelope , seal , number serially . The envelope contain card treatment open secretary responsible . - Formation group a. EI Group I - Intervention flow-oriented incentive spirometry ( IS ) ( Trifllo ® - II ) . b . BS Group II - Intervention Breath- Stacking technique ( BS ) . - Recording evaluation patient : patient include study record evaluated physical therapist involve trial ( blind ) accord standardize form . - Duration intervention : Both therapy modality ( Group I Group II ) hold twice daily ICU stay , day hospitalization ward , fifth postoperative day . Each session consist three set five maneuver .</detailed_description>
