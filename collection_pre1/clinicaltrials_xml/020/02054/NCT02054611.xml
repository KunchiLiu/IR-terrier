This problem previously identify use prior ARDS definition , particularly patient milder severity illness . Importantly , chest x-ray criterion ARDS definition demonstrate moderate reliability apply expert , although improve use training radiograph ( use educational module ) . The investigator hypothesize train educational module allow accurate diagnosis ARDS data collectors/study coordinator participate LUNG-SAFE study .</brief_summary>
