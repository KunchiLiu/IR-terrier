	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effectiveness immune checkpoint inhibitor ( drug call ipilimumab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab ) , either give alone , combination experimental immunotherapy drug , dorgenmeltucel-L , melanoma . We hypothesize form combinatorial immunotherapy result tumor stabilization shrinkage , significant prolongation progression-free , disease-free overall survival compare use immune checkpoint inhibitor alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According statistic American Cancer Society , estimate 73,800 individual diagnose melanoma 9,900 die disease 2015 Unites States despite current therapy . This protocol attempt exploit approach melanoma immunotherapy use naturally occur barrier xenotransplantation human increase effectiveness immunize patient melanoma . The expression murine ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase [ alpha ( 1,3 ) GT ] gene result cell surface expression ( 1,3 ) galactosyl-epitopes ( alpha-gal ) membrane glycoprotein glycolipids . These epitope major target hyperacute rejection response occur organ transplant non-primate donor specie man . Human host often pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody bind alpha-gal epitope lead rapid activation complement cell lysis . The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody find individual think due exposure alpha-gal epitope naturally express normal gut flora lead chronic immunological stimulation . These antibody may comprise 1 % serum IgG . In phase 2b study , patient advance stage melanoma receive immune checkpoint inhibition consist ipilimumab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab per treat physician 's standard care . In addition immune checkpoint therapy , half patient also receive dorgenmeltucel-L. Dorgenmeltucel-L compose irradiated allogeneic melanoma cell line ( HAM-1 , HAM-2 HAM-3 ) . These cell line transduce recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MoMLV ) -based retroviral vector express murine ( 1,3 ) GT gene . Endpoints study include safety assessment , efficacy , immunological response .</detailed_description>
