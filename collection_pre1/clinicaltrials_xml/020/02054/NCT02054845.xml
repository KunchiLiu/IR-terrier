	<brief_summary>Approximately 60 % patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) receive Levodopa therapy eventually develop response fluctuation motor symptom , rigidity , freeze akinesia . Patients experience 'off'-period next dose dopaminergic medication need , call 'wearing-off'-phenomena . Wearing-off also accompany non-motor symptom depression , anxiety , pain think disability . Together , motor non-motor symptom major impact quality life patient partner caregiver . Patients wearing-off often experience severe anxiety panic symptom incongruent severity motor symptoms 'off ' period . These symptom include stress , dizziness , pounding/racing heart , dyspnoea hyperventilation . This type anxiety call wearing-off related anxiety ( WRA ) might consequence hypersensitivity towards somatic manifestation effect wearing-off period . This bodily misperception major consequence patient 's feeling behaviour . The experienced anxiety often consciously link wearing-off therefore well recognize neurologist . Treatment usual response fluctuation physiotherapy , consist physical exercise mobility problem , freeze , dyskinesia , etc . This kind training hardly touch upon mental aspect role anxiety integral element response fluctuation . Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT , include exposure vivo ) sometimes use treat WRA , seem unsatisfactory result since change body awareness sufficiently address . Also , method use cognitive therapy focus elimination WRA often realistic since wearing-off symptom remain even increase disease progression . As yet , know alternative intervention option . This study focus new intervention integrate element physiotherapy , mindfulness , CBT ( mainly exposure ) , Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) psycho-education . Objective : The current proposal aim investigate effect multidisciplinary non-verbal intervention awareness modulation WRA improve self-efficacy , mobility , mood , quality life compare usual care . Study design : Randomized control clinical trial . Study population : Thirty-six PD patient experience WRA . Intervention : Patients PD randomly allocate one two group ( n= 18 ) . One group receive experimental 'body-awareness therapy ' , second group receive regular group-physiotherapy ( treatment usual ) . Both intervention take 6 week 2 session per week duration 1,5 hour perform . Main study parameters/endpoints : The General Self-Efficacy Scale primary outcome measure assess prior , directly 18 week intervention .</brief_summary>
