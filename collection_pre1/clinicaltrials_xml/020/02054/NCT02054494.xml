	<brief_summary>HIV-infection associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Especially patient low CD4+ count high incidence structural heart disease . Myocardial T1 relaxation time , well T1-derived extracellular volume fraction relatively new method non-invasive myocardial tissue characterization , include diffuse myocardial fibrosis . In study HIV-patients high low CD4+ count examine 3T MRI scanner ( Ingenia 3T , Philips Medical , Best , Netherlands ) . Scanning protocol include common SSFP sequence , STIR image LGE [ Late gadolinium enhancement ] . All HIV patient treat HIV outpatient clinic hospital 's Internal Medicine department unremarkable history cardiac disease . Patients recruit Germany . In order obtain reference value , subgroup healthy , age-matched control include study . Aim study show differences T1- ECV-values investigate subgroup . In addition , also want create cut-off value healthy affect myocardium asymptomatic HIV-infected patient . This study could show whether myocardial T1 map potential screening parameter begin heart disease part HIV-infection , whether application routine diagnostic reasonable .</brief_summary>
