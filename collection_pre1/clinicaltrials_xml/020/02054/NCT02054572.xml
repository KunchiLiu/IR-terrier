	<brief_summary>This phase 1 , open-label study evaluate pharmacokinetics , biotransformation , excretion [ 14C ] AMG 416 . Approximately six ( 6 ) adult male female subject end stage renal disease require hemodialysis enrol receive 750 nCi [ 14C ] -labeled AMG 416 formulate 10 mg AMG 416 administer single 2 mL intravenous dose end hemodialysis . Subjects spend first approximately 12 day confinement clinic ( day -1 completion day 11 study procedure ) . Blood sample , complete collection dialysate , dialysis membrane ( necessary ) , urine ( available ) , feces analyze radioactivity content accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) . Following confinement period , subject return site outpatient basis accordance routine dialysis session day 39 . Blood dialysate sample dialysis membrane collect specified time outpatient visit period .</brief_summary>
