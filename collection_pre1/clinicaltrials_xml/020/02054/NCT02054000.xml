	<brief_title>Intracoronary Tirofiban No-Reflow Phenomena</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The no-reflow phenomenon one common cause adverse cardiovascular event patient ST-elevated myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Re-canalization infarct relate arterial ( IRA ) flow relate well ventricular performance low mortality rate patient STEMI . In addition , no-reflow phenomenon may limit benefit re-canalization IRA . In recent year , many mechanical pharmacological treatment strategy include adjunctive administration glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( GPI ) propose patient STEMI . Although current guideline recommend small molecule GPI administer upstream bolus follow continuous infusion patient STEMI , change clinical practice may obviate need GPI dosage route current practice . Previous study show intravenous intracoronary administration GPI improve prognosis significantly reduce mortality patient STEMI . Recently , Ongoing Tirofiban Myocardial infarction Evaluation-2 ( ON-TIME 2 ) trial find use tirofiban start pre-hospital phase upstream therapy primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) continue 18 hour infusion procedure show improvement marker reperfusion . Additionally , reduction demonstrate death recurrent myocardial infarction urgent target vessel revascularization thrombotic bailout . However , current literature insufficient data regard role intracoronary administration GPI inhibitor patient STEMI develop no-reflow phenomenon . The goal study evaluate acute effect intracoronary administration tirofiban no-reflow phenomenon patient STEMI occurrence no-reflow phenomenon undergo primary PCI .</detailed_description>
