Children unwilling unable eat drink produce Keto body . Theoretically , addition glucose IV solution would prevent catabolic metabolism reduce keto body blood concentration lead faster objective subjective improvement child 's condition . The propose study double blind randomize clinical trial . Children receive either NaCl 0.9 % NaCl 0.9 % + 5 % glucose randomly number bag . The type solution know pharmacy . Study aim : - Primary aim : compare number hospitalization among dehydrated pediatric patient treat either one IV fluid mention . - Secondary aim : To evaluate possibility hypoglycemia secondary hyperinsulinism response rapid administration glucose . Study population : The study include 700 child 6 month 18 year age . It conduct 18 month Pediatric ED Carmel Medical Center . Currently , data regard use dextrose contain solution lack . As dehydration one common medical problem encounter physician pediatric ED , outmost importance evaluate optimal IV solution use setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize double blind study . 700 child 6 month 18 year age dehydrate unable drink 's parent sign inform consent form participate study ( see inclusion exclusion criterion ) . Our pharmacy department prepare identical bag half contain NaCl 0.9 % half NaCl 0.9 % + 5 % dextrose . The bag randomly number use SAS ( Statistical analysis system ) . Only pharmacy department know content bag . The child receive bolus 20 mL/Kg IV fluid . A repeat bolus give accord clinical decision bag . A blood glucose level take 2 hour initiation study glucometer order ascertain hypoglycemia occur secondary hyperinsulinism fast glucose administration . A urine test order check presence ketone also do . The end point study moment physician decide whether hospitalize release patient ER . On day follow visit emergency department , parent ask answer questionnaire child 's well . The questionnaire complete hospital child admit telephone child discharge . In addition inclusion exclusion criterion , child IV catheter could introduce , child 's blood glucose 2 hour fluid IV administration 60 mg/dl need IV antibiotic surgical intervention decide ER stay take study . The data analyze use PASW ( predictive analysis software ) statistic . Chi square use order check statistically significant difference group .</detailed_description>
