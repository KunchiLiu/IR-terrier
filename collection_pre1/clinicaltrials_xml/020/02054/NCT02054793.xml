	<brief_summary>This research do test safety anti-cancer activity combination investigational drug call orteronel , drug call itraconazole treatment castration-resistant prostate cancer . Orteronel investigational drug know 17,20-lyase enzyme inhibitor , mean block formation male sex hormone . Itraconazole approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment various fungal infection fingernail/toenail infection serious fungal infection . While show evidence activity prostate cancer prior study , approve use cancer . The FDA allow use orteronel itraconazole research study . In addition antifungal property , itraconazole discover function block angiogenesis ( blood vessel formation tumor ) block cellular pathway think important prostate cancer know Hedgehog pathway . Investigators hypothesize block male sex hormone production orteronel increase reliance Hedgehog pathway prostate cancer cell block itraconazole combination two drug effective either alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Study Evaluating Orteronel ( Without Prednisone ) Combined With Itraconazole In Men With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway signal may important prostate cancer progression pathway upregulated castration-resistant state . More potent ( maximal ) castration achievable CYP17 inhibition , use orteronel , may upregulate Hh pathway activation . Itraconazole administer high dos ( 600 mg/day ) may function modest Hh inhibitor . In pilot phase II trial , investigator show single-agent high-dose itraconazole produce PSA reduction 29 % men metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , reduce circulate tumor cell count 62 % patient unfavorable baseline count , prolong progression-free survival compare historical data . Moreover , clinical response itraconazole appeared correlate Hh pathway suppression , measure GLI1 mRNA analysis serial skin biopsy . Investigators propose evaluate potent CYP17/lyase inhibitor , orteronel , combination itraconazole escalate dose level ( 100 mg BID , 200 mg BID , 300 mg BID ) men non-metastatic metastatic CRPC conduct open-label phase Ib/II trial . Importantly , unlike relate compound , ketoconazole , itraconazole rarely result adrenal suppression . Side effect previously see high dose itraconazole ( 600 mg/day ) mild include nausea , rash , diarrhea , vomit , hypokalemia , edema , headache , hypertension , fever , pruritis , abnormal liver function test . Of note , orteronel give without concurrent prednisone trial . This combination itraconazole corticosteroid lead Cushing 's syndrome ( hypercortisolism ) impair corticosteroid metabolism CYP3A4 . Therefore , study provide opportunity evaluate steroid-free orteronel combination regimen . If combination safe tolerable , subsequent study would aim compare clinical efficacy orteronel-itraconazole versus orteronel alone use randomize phase II trial design .</detailed_description>
