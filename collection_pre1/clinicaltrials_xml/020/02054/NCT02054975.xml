	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize control trial lower vs. high dose vitamin D supplementation D-deficient asthmatic child , determine necessary sample size outcome measure large multisite study , examine possible relationship effect size various biological marker may important pathophysiology childhood asthma . Aims study : 1 . Evaluate effect size relationship serum 25OH-vitD omega-fatty acid ( FA ) biomarkers , supplementation lower high dose vitamin D , immune function , asthma severity . 2 . Characterize change innate adaptive immune function inflammatory response asthmatic D-deficient youth baseline vitD supplement , dietary O6 : O3FA status vitD dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Pediatric Asthma : Randomized Controlled Open-label Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 120 youth meeting eligibility criterion screen vitamin D deficiency , find deficient , offer enrollment study . Eligible child assent whose parent/guardian consent participate randomize low dose vs. high dose vitamin D take across 3-month period time . Blood , questionnaires , pulmonary function test obtain baseline end study . Weekly phone call check question concern participant family may . Aims Hypotheses : Aim I : Evaluate effect sizes relationship omega-FA vitD biomarkers , pre- post- low high dose vitamin D supplementation , diet , immune function , asthma severity . Aim II : Characterize change innate adaptive immune function inflammatory response asthmatic D-deficient youth baseline vitD supplement , O6 : O3FA status vitD dose . Exploratory : Compute effect sizes/odds ratio difference pulmonary function , self-reported asthma severity , depressive symptom , hospitalization/ED visit , medication change base treatment group . Effect size calculate continuous outcome variable : Effect Size ( ES ) = Average post-test score - Average pre-test score Average standard deviation Odds ratios categorical asthma severity variable compute logistic regression treatment group covariates . Examine difference pulmonary function test , self-reported asthma severity , depressive symptom , hospitalization/ED visit , medication change base treatment group . Omega fatty acid intake allergic status include potentially mediate variable .</detailed_description>
