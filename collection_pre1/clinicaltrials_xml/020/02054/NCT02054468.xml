	<brief_title>Rocuronium Dose Finding Study After Single-shot Steady-state Propofol Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular block agent worldwide use standard component modern balance anesthesia regime . They administer facilitate tracheal intubation , reduce laryngeal trauma optimize surgical condition . The dose usually recommend facilitate tracheal intubation approximates least two time drugÂ´s effective dose ED-95 ( dose require 95 % effect ) depend choice neuromuscular blocking agent . This overdose administered induce deep paralysis fast onset action provide clinically acceptable intubate condition . Moreover , clinical experience show dose-relationship neuromuscular block agent estimate steady-state anesthesia necessarily correlate dose-response curve drug anesthetic induction . Therefore , discrepancy apply dose clinical outcome measure , intubate condition , become apparent . This might related effect co-administered anesthetic neuromuscular junction . While inhaled anesthetic augment paralyze effect non-depolarizering muscle relaxant dose-dependent fashion depend duration anesthesia , little known interaction intravenous anesthetic propofol non-depolarizing blocking agent rocuronium . We hypothesize intravenous administration propofol also influence potency rocuronium dependant duration application . This study , therefore , design determine dose-response relationship rocuronium single-shot steady-state propofol anesthesia clinical setting . The primary endpoint ED-50s ED-95s rocuronium anesthetic induction single-shot propofol 30minutes steady-state propofol anesthesia . The secondary endpoint slop intercept respective dose-response-curves , onset duration muscle paralysis recovery neuromuscular blockade . Materials &amp; Methods We investigate patient schedule elective low-risk surgical procedure general anesthesia . Patients allocate two experimental group . After neuromuscular monitoring establish remifentanil infusion , patient group `` Induction '' receive single-shot propofol follow injection rocuronium endotracheal intubation . Patients group `` Maintenance '' anaesthetize induction dose propofol follow 30 minute total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA : propofol/ remifentanil ) rocuronium administer . Airway manage use laryngeal mask tracheal intubation . During surgery , anesthesia maintain TIVA . Onset duration neuromuscular blockade spontaneous recovery monitor electromyography . Postoperatively , patient monitor 60 minute post-anesthesia care unit .</detailed_description>
