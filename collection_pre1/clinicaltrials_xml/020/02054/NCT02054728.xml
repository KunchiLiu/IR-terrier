	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training During Right-heart Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last year , respiratory muscle training ( RMT ) patient impaired respiratory muscle function , e.g . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , increasingly apply . RMT do apply increased respiratory effort several minute via apparatus provide inspiratory stenosis . Threshold IMT® ( Philips Respironics ) example training device , market several year use conduct study apply RMT . For example , show training Threshold IMT® patient COPD increase inspiratory muscle strength , endurance functional capacity ameliorate dyspnea quality life . Furthermore , patient suffer cardiac illness also affect respiratory muscle impairment , add cardiogenic dyspnea . RMT help improve dyspnea physical exercise capacity patient well . To date , study perform address acute hemodynamic effect inspiratory muscle training . However , special interest : COPD well heart failure patient show increased prevalence pulmonary hypertension . In case suspect pulmonary hypertension , patient usually subject right-heart catheterization ( RHC ) arrive definitive diagnosis ass severity etiology potentially present pulmonary hypertension . RHC also sensitive method exclude intracardial shunt COPD patient . In study , patient routinely subject RHC mention reason instruct RMT use Threshold IMT® RHC . Two day advance begin guide training get familiar Threshold IMT® . The device 's inspiratory resistance set 9 41 cm H2O . A single training session consist 7 cycle 2 min inspiratory training , follow 1 min break ( total duration 21 min ) . RMT conduct 20-30 % individual inspiratory muscle strength , measure beforehand . During RHC procedure patient conduct RMT instruct suspected hemodynamic effect document .</detailed_description>
