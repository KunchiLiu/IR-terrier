	<detailed_description>Intracerebral hemorrhage bleed brain parenchyma . It major cause stroke , associate significant morbidity mortality . Brain injury intracerebral hemorrhage occur two phase . The early phase involve mechanical compression brain tissue expand hematoma . In late phase , brain edema , especially perihematomal edema , develop cause compression may lead brain herniation death . Several factor implicate development brain edema , include inflammation result oxidative stress cause iron-rich hemoglobin release lysed erythrocyte brain tissue . This study investigate neuroprotective role acute phase reactant , haptoglobin , minimize development perihematomal edema follow intracerebral hemorrhage . This protein protect brain tissue hemoglobin degradation product form haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex subsequently clear spleen . Notably , different allele haptoglobin exist human , vary affinity hemoglobin . Investigating association different allele degree perihematomal edema formation primary goal study . The investigator also look marker inflammation , matrix metalloproteinases , analyze level expression subject different allele haptoglobin .</detailed_description>
