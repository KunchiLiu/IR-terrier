	<detailed_description>This randomize double-blind clinical trial . Potential subject identify member Center Urogynecology Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery Cleveland Clinic main campus . Eligible patient agree participate provide write informed consent administer collaborator list IRB Cleveland Clinic main campus . All subject predetermine surgeon undergo sacrospinous ligament colpopexy management vaginal apex prolapse hysterectomy . The participant randomize one two group : `` local analgesia injection '' `` normal saline injection '' accord computer-generated randomization schedule random block size use SAS statistical software package ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Randomization do nurse coordinator involve participant recruitment injection time surgery . All patient provider blind assignment . The assignment keep envelope give pharmacy day patient 's scheduled procedure . The pharmacy dispense correct intervention base randomization . In addition standardize evaluation include history physical examination , patient ask complete functional assessment questionnaire well surgical pain scale preoperative visit . Prior discharge hospital , patient provide envelope pre-labeled questionnaire bring home . Prior discharge , ask complete surgical pain scale . Subjects call day discharge , week 1 , week 2 , week 4 week 6 procedure remind complete appropriate questionnaires/forms provide . They bring form 6-week postoperative visit . All questionnaires self-administered . Completion questionnaires additional assessment specific participation study usually include part standard care sacrospinous ligament colpopexy . Sacrospinous ligament colpopexy perform standard fashion . The approach do either enter vagina along anterior posterior wall apex . Approach side suspension base surgeon 's preference . Prior entry , apex vaginal vault first identify visualize old hysterectomy scar . Allis clamp use demarcate new vaginal apex ensure apex suspend adequately sacrospinous ligament , identify transvaginally palpation ischial spine . Once vaginal entry make , sharp blunt dissection perform pararectal space one side . Identification ischial spine confirm position coccygeus-sacrospinous ligament complex . Once complex freed overlie areolar tissue , Briesky Navratil retractor place retract rectum away site suture placement help visualization ligament complex . The CapioTM device use place suspension suture . 3 suture place : 2 delayed-absorbable ( 0 PDS ) 1 permanent ( 0 prolene ) . All suture place one half two fingerbreadth ( 2-3cm ) medial ischial spine sequential fashion . After placement , rectal exam do ensure suture place rectum coccygeus-sacrospinous ligament complex visualize carefully ensure surgical site hemostatic . The absorbable-delayed suspension suture place vaginal epithelium level neoapex permanent suture place subepithelial tissue . Injection sacrospinous ligament perform prior tie suspension suture accord group patient randomize . A pudendal nerve block kit needle syringe use administer injection . The spacer remove , allow needle point enter ligament 10mm depth injection . The injection place 3 location ( ~3mL injection total 10mL ) along center sacropinous ligament previously place suture . Proper injection technique perform injection ( e.g . confirmation extravascular placement needle tip prior injection ) . One two injection ( bupivacaine vs. normal saline ) deliver pharmacy administer depend upon group patient randomize . Preoperative data include follow : - Patient age , race , vaginal parity , menopausal sate , tobacco use , BMI , prior prolapse surgery , preoperative prolapse stage ( see Appendix demographic data sheet ) - Assessment functional status , surgical pain scale - Labs ( Hb/Hct ) Intraoperative data include follow : - Surgery date - Surgeon - Side Colpopexy - Concomitant procedures - EBL Postoperative data include follow : - Days hospital - Pain medication requirment hospitalization - Prior discharge hospital : surgical pain scale ; localization pain - POD # 1 : Labs ( Hb/Hct ) - Time surgery [ incision ] discharge ( hour ) - 1st postoperative week oDaily surgical pain scale localization pain oDaily pain medication use oAt end week 1 : Assessment functional status - 2nd postoperative week oDaily surgical pain scale localization pain oDaily pain medication use oAt end week 2 : Assessment functional status - 4th postoperative week ( end week 4 ) oAssessment functional status oSurgical pain scale localization pain - 6th postoperative week ( end week 6 ) oAssessment functional status oSurgical pain scale localization pain - Date 6-week postoperative - Need intervention pain : trigger point injection , PFPT referral , reoperation All paper form use data collection keep research cabinet dedicate project lock time , locked office Cleveland Clinic .
