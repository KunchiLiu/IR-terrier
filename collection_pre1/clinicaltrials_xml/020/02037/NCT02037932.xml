	<criteria>Patient 1880 year age . Patient document , previously treat untreated saccular intracranial aneurysm , 4 20 mm unruptured rupture , suitable treatment balloon assist coil embolization . Target aneurysm neck ≥4mm large diameter neck ratio 2 less . Patient Hunt Hess Score 3 less . Patient premorbid mRS 3 less . Patient patient 's legally authorize representative provide write informed consent . Patient willing comply study followup requirement . Inability obtain informed consent . Patient &lt; 18 &gt; 80 year age . Target aneurysm dissecting , fusiform , mycotic , arteriovenous malformationrelated . Aneurysm treat previously stentassisted coiling . Implantation stent balloonassisted coil combine stent balloon assist coiling . Target aneurysm deem unsuitable balloonassisted coil treat physician prior procedure . Target aneurysm treat total coil length comprise less 80 % second generation MicroVention Hydrogel Coils . Balloonassisted coil perform use balloon catheter MicroVention Scepter balloon ( Scepter C , Scepter XC , future Scepter configuration ) . Patients target aneurysm plan coil one procedure ( i.e . staged procedure ) . Patients one aneurysm require treatment . ( However , second small low risk aneurysm require therapy may allow . ) Patients life expectancy ≤ 9 month .</criteria>
