	<brief_summary>Deaths due advance liver scarring ( liver cirrhosis ) continue increase , liver disease 3rd lead cause premature death United Kingdom . The majority liver disease lifestyle relate ( alcohol , obesity associate type 2 diabetes , inject drug use ) therefore reversible caught precirrhosis stage . However , current liver function blood test poor inadequate , subsequently large burden liver disease currently miss . A variety noninvasive liver biomarkers ( blood imaging test ) develop identify liver disease accurately earlier stage scar . The identification liver disease community , previous study discover large burden previously unidentified significant liver disease , therefore feasible place develop new liver disease investigation pathways use noninvasive marker . In collaboration Department Health , Nottingham University Hospitals commence pilot community liver disease pathway two General Practices Nottingham February 2012 . Patients liver risk factor ( hazardous alcohol use , obesity type 2 diabetes ) invite take part pathway . Patients undergo simple blood test ( AST : ALT ratio BARD score ) , high test result require referral liver stiffness scan ( Fibroscan ) perform community setting . High threshold scan value review consultant liver specialist community liver clinic . Preliminary finding show pathway accurately identifies patient early liver scar previously unidentified significant liver disease . The participate General Practitioners also note striking number patient finally engage important lifestyle change follow pathway implementation . A second phase pilot pathway , 2 Inner City General Practices total practice population c.14,000 patient commence June 2013 . We subsequently design cohort study , pilot participant consent follow long period . We assess future liver-related cardiovascular event ( include death ) , perform qualitative patient interview assess reason persistence lifestyle change liver disease investigation . We hypothesize stratification liver disease community unearth significant amount previously undetected significant chronic liver disease . Moreover , evaluate whether stratification liver disease use test predict future liver cardiovascular disease death , whether stratification impact patient 's future lifestyle choice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To establish community base cohort risk factor liver disease stratification liver disease severity use non-invasive biomarkers . 2 . To establish incidence liver cardiovascular morbidity mortality community cohort . 3 . To explore quantitative qualitative indicator potential alteration patient lifestyle follow stratification liver disease inform future intervention development . 4 . To evaluate novel blood marker liver fibrosis cirrhosis large cohort primary care patient Study Configuration : Longitudinal Cohort Study long-term follow Setting : Primary Care , Nottingham Number Participants : Prospective consecutive recruitment East Midlands - approximately 500 patient per annum 4 year cohort inception period . Total anticipated cohort size 2,000 participant . Description Interventions : - Serum blood sampling ( AST : ALT ratio , serum store future liver biomarker development ) - Transient Elastography ( Fibroscan ) - Qualitative Interviews ( limit approximately 30 patient ) - Consent longitudinal data follow-up approach future lifestyle intervention trial - consent patient tag MRIS database . Duration Study : 48 month cohort inception long term longitudinal follow cardiovascular liver relate outcome mortality data . Outcome Measures : 1 . Incidence liver ( cirrhosis ) cardiovascular disease ( symptomatic coronary cerebrovascular disease ) . 2 . All cause morbidity mortality . 3 . Quantitative qualitative lifestyle measure ( include body mass index , exercise level , alcohol consumption ) . Patients decide participate community cohort require perform specific action attend study visit ( unless reason state ) . Usual clinical care ( liver-related non-liver relate ) continue study period . Patients consent long term longitudinal data follow-up use Medical Research Information Service ( MRIS ) database . All patient enrol community cohort prospectively tag MRIS . In particular , investigator request individual patient alert MRIS concern prevalent cardiovascular disease event ( angina , myocardial infarction stroke ) , liver cirrhosis cause death . Patients consent undertake qualitative research evaluate process community stratification . A purposeful sample patient complete community biomarkers pathway invited participate qualitative follow experience pathway subsequent lifestyle change . A researcher , trained qualitative research method , perform semi-structured interview , assess lifestyle change occur follow liver pathway stratification . Specifically , change alcohol consumption , diet exercise explore evaluate , assessment relationship liver pathway stratification ( investigation result lifestyle advice offer pathway ) . Interviews perform either face-to-face , case perform Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit , telephone - case voice record occur allow analysis information provide . An example interview proforma utilized qualitative interview provide separately . Patients consented donate biosamples ( include blood urine ) Nottingham Health Sciences Biobank inception cohort . An appointment make NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit witness write consent allow donation biosamples . Samples collect trained research nurse , also form part research team . These biosamples utilize future research novel biomarkers liver cardiovascular disease , include proteomics metabonomics . Where participant agree future use sample destroy accordance Human Tissue Act , 2004 . In future , investigator plan trial assess novel exercise dietary intervention , subsequent effect patient lifestyle parameter future cardiovascular risk . Patients form community cohort consent contact regard future trial ; however individual trial subject ethical approval write consent .</detailed_description>
