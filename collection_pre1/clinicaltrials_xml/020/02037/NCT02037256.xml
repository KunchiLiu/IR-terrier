	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study peripheral blood hemapoietic stem cell mobilization combination bortezomib G-CSF ( filgrastim ) multiple myeloma non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient . Giving chemotherapy peripheral stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Filgrastim Promoting Stem Cell Mobilization Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition Bortezomib mobilization protocol result increase level circulate peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) &gt; = 2-fold blood apheresis collection 4-days collection protocol . II . To achieve median neutrophil engraftment 12 day . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test co-mobilization lymphoma myeloma cell bortezomib G-CSF use real time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) patient flow cytometry ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 38+/CD138+ cell ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient . II . To determine effect Bortezomib extent mobilization dendritic cell subset , plasmacytoid dendritic cell ( pDC ) 1 pDC2 DC1/DC2 ratio flow cytometry . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP A : Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-9 begin apheresis day 5 . Patients undergo apheresis 2 day , receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second target collection obtain filgrastim alone first day collection Bortezomib plus filgrastim mobilization , prior receive administration filgrastim . Second apheresis continue target stem cell dose reach maximum 4 day . Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation receive high dose chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) infusion follow standard care procedure . GROUP B : Patients receive filgrastim SC day 1-8 receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 4 day 7 , administration filgrastim . Patients undergo apheresis day 5-8 . Within 2 month mobilization , patient undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation receive high dose chemotherapy PBSC infusion standard care . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
