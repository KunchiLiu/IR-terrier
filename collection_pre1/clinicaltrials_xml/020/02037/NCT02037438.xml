	<detailed_description>SMART DOCS randomize comparative clinical trial design evaluate new approach outpatient medical care . In current sleep medicine practice , consultation last one hour le allotted assessment , diagnosis , planning , implementation sleep disorder among patient health care provider . Patients expect convey complex medical history relevant symptom , clinician must effectively appropriately diagnose create treatment plan give period time . New technology home-based diagnostic test electronic access diagnostic result outcome provide functional advantage delivery healthcare outpatient setting . The propose project challenge seek compare traditional diagnostic treatment medical outpatient approach patient-centered outcomes coordinated-care management ( PCCM ) approach sleep medicine . New refine method , algorithm , tool expect improve clinical practice patient 's experience care . The specific aim study determine whether new patient-centered outcome coordinated-care management ( PCCM ) approach sleep medicine provide good care improve health patient compare conventional diagnostic/treatment outpatient medical care ( CONV ) approach . Patients randomize one two arm ; Conventional Diagnostic/Treatment Outpatient Medical Care ( CONV ) Patient-Centered Outcomes Coordinated-Care Management ( PCCM ) . Randomization conduct use permuted block design . Each new patient consecutively see Stanford Sleep Medicine Center patient see Stanford Primary Care suspect new sleep disorder inform study . The patient notify study randomize trial could assign either CONV PCCM arm . The patient also apprise consent grant access clinical data collect evaluation treatment .
