	<brief_summary>An estimate 2.2 million child age 5 year die diarrheal disease year . Most burden diarrheal disease think preventable improvement sanitation , water quality , hygiene . Large scale intervention promote behaviour either rigorously test produced sufficient change warrant roll scale . Research determinant hand wash behaviour identify disgust shame key motivator . Evidence support theory disgust natural behavioural reaction object carry disease risk , thus may act key motivator health relate behaviours water treatment . Whether knowledge harness increase efficacy hand wash safe water campaign Bangladesh elsewhere yet rigorously test . The investigator develop intervention utilizes disgust shame elicit message promote hand wash soap point use water treatment low income housing compound urban Dhaka . The investigator test efficacy intervention traditional public health intervention base increase knowledge health risk germ transmission use randomize controlled trial . The study sample break follow four arm . 1 . Standard Public Health Intervention Water Treatment 2 . Standard Public Health Intervention Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing 3 . Disgust Shame Based Intervention Water Treatment 4 . Disgust Shame Based Intervention Water Treatment &amp; Hand This design allow u compare outcome hand wash water treatment standard public health intervention disgust shame base intervention well test overall efficacy program comparing control . Data collect compound baseline , three month midline six month endline give u practical analytical benefit longitudinal dataset . Compounds participate interactive , educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meeting . For Disgust Shame group , meeting emphasize disgust shame relate unsafe water and/or hygiene practice , whereas Standard group 's meeting resemble typical public health intervention explain risk method contamination . At first meeting , compound receive one month free trial late compound base chlorine dispenser model treat drinking water . A randomly select half also receive one month free trial late compound base handwash station . At end month , sale meeting investigator measure compound member ' willingness pay trialled product give opportunity purchase keep hardware Becker-DeGroot-Marschek ( BDM ) style auction . In assess impact intervention , investigator primarily interested whether prevalence safe water hygiene behaviour differ treatment arm time . The best measurement approximate behaviour prevalence physical observation ( presence residual chlorine , hand cleanliness inspection ) , structure observation behaviour , rapid physical observation ( physical state hardware/drinking water ) , self-report water treatment hand wash behaviour willingness pay necessary product . The investigator also attempt measure track change personal determinant behaviour feeling disgust shame related hand wash water treatment behaviour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design To rigorously test main study hypotheses investigator use stratify , cluster randomize trial . Sample compound divide four stratum base compound size presence gas randomly assign one four study arm . Thus proportion compound arm within stratum . Strata 1 . Gas &amp; Fewer 8 household per compound 2 . Gas &amp; 8 household per compound 3 . No Gas &amp; Fewer 8 household per compound 4 . No Gas &amp; 8 household per compound Study Arms 1 . Standard Public Health Intervention Water Treatment 2 . Standard Public Health Intervention Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing 3 . Disgust Shame Based Intervention Water Treatment 4 . Disgust Shame Based Intervention Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing Via randomization , half compound assigned standard treatment group one two half disgust shame group three four . Within halve , one third receive water treatment two third receive water treatment hand wash . Randomization allow u infer causality analyze difference outcomes stratification increase statistical power inference . Field Staff The investigator three field staff designation , Field Research Assistants ( FRAs ) , Field Intervention Specialists ( FISs ) Field Assistants ( FAs ) . FRAs responsible baseline , midline endline data collection well structured observation . FAs responsible fee collection visit . FISs responsible remain visit . Site Selection Based literature review hypothesis test , investigator determine study would feasible would provide benefit poor housing compound Dhaka city . To identify specific site intervention would take place , investigator create list feasibility criterion ( see appendix 2 ) receive recommendation ICDDR , B Research Investigators experience urban Dhaka . The investigator send two FRAs evaluate recommend site use list . With evaluation investigator select six community : Mohammedpur , Mirpur , Badda , Korail , Khilgaon Bashabo . Piloting Phase The first five specific aim , involve development new technique , subject pilot phase . Aims One Two To develop disgust shame intervention water treatment water treatment hand wash investigator refine long list potential intervention script content . Our Qualitative Research Investigator member his/her team field test review item list , systematically change , remove add item list become feasible intervention script culturally appropriate appear effective . The Qualitative team use focus group discussion depth interview primary tool assess field test . Aim Three To develop group version Becker-DeGroot-Marsckek ( BDM ) auction staff Economist along Qualitative Research Investigator team FRAs field test review different variation auction determine feasible appear produce accurate measurement true willingness pay community . The Qualitative team use focus group discussion depth interview primary tool assess field test . Aim Four To develop survey instrument allow u measure behavioural determinant hand wash water treatment , investigator perform multiple pilot revision questionnaire small sample group similar sample . Revisions make base qualitative review subject ' impression quantitative review gather data . In quantitative review investigator perform principal component analysis factor analysis data refine scale behavioural determinant already define and/or investigate whether determinant worth measure . Aim Five The investigator short list new measurement idea investigator field test review prior implementation . For detail list , see `` Data Collection '' section . Implementation Visit 1 : Sample Enrollment , Baseline Data Collection Set-up Promotion Meeting Within choose field site , FRAs search compound , match essential criterion ( see ) , match least 2 preferred criterion ( see ) locate least 75 footstep apart . Our field team make several visit six month study enrolled compound . During visit investigator conduct different activity include household survey , structured observation , physical observation . The investigator ask consent compound member verbally courtyard meeting , ask member come consensus sign compound head manager . In write consent form study activity describe briefly make simple easy administer understand . For specific activity investigator ask individual 's verbal consent , serve reminder individual still willing take part activity . Taking write consent activity visit could make visit even longer . Signing paper document several time could make participant confused concern read write . For household member miss first courtyard meeting , investigator repeat information process . If agree , FRAs move next suitable compound . If agree sign form , FRAs record stratification data perform baseline data collection consist two household questionnaire six household physical observation form ( see `` Data Collection '' detail questionnaire physical observation ) . Later , FROs use stratification data determine stratum randomly assign treatment arm compound . Household representative participate baseline data collection randomly select pool compound member present visit 1 . To ensure random selection , FRA first arbitrarily assign number household member present . He/she write number small plastic ball drop ball cup . He/she shake cup pour one ball . The number ball correspond first household approach data collection . The FRA ask present member household responsible collecting water . This person ask participate , he/she decline , FRA pour another ball cup repeat procedure . These step repeat six consent compound select . The first two give questionnaire physical observation form last four , physical observation . Essential compound criterion - Between 3 15 House ` hold - Shared water source - Physical space exist hold compound meeting nearby - No intervention go time - Population Bangali Preferred criterion - Use water source visible others - Shared kitchen - Shared toilet visible common area Visit 2 : First Meeting- Promotion Free Trial FISs conduct three hour integrate behaviour change/product promotion program take place compound convenient meeting place nearby . The content program , vary treatment arm , develop pilot briefly describe `` Meeting Content Hardware '' . At end program , compound offer one month free trial hardware specific study arm ( see `` Meeting Content Hardware '' ) . Visit 3 : Reminder Visit Roughly two week first meet compound receive check-up reminder visit . FISs meet available individual two small group . The FIS reiterate message first meet discuss understanding agreement message order understand reduce perceived barrier new behaviour . Visit 4 : Setup Second Meeting BDM Auction Coaching Roughly three week first meet , FISs visit compound set time date second compound meeting prepare compound member auction . FISs meet group two four prospective bidder hour explain detail process hold multiple mock auction . Visit 5 : Second Meeting- Promotion Sales Roughly one month first meeting , free trial end , FISs return treatment compound conduct promotion sale meeting . The promotion segment one half hour behaviour change/product promotion program similar first meeting contain fresh material . In second one half hour segment meeting , FISs measure compound member ' willingness pay trialled product give opportunity purchase keep hardware Becker-DeGroot-Marschek ( BDM ) style auction . Compounds willing pay offer price offer option keep hardware assure least 75 % compound keep product endline ( detail Auction section ) . Fee Collection Visits Every month year sale meeting , compound visit FA collect fee take rapid observation data ( detailed `` Data Collection '' ) . Visit 6 : Midline Data Collection Three month baseline data collection , FRAs return compound collect midline data consist two household questionnaire six household physical observation form ( see `` Data Collection '' detail questionnaire physical observation ) . FRAs attempt use household , present return compound second attempt , FRAs use randomization strategy first visit select new household . Visit 7 : Structured Observation Half way midline endline data collection separate team FRAs perform 5 hour structure observation hand wash water treatment behaviour representative subgroup sample . More `` Data Collection '' . Visit 8 : Endline Data Collection Six month baseline data collection , FRAs return compound collect endline data consist two household questionnaire six household physical observation form ( see `` Data Collection '' detail questionnaire physical observation ) . FRAs attempt use household , present return compound second attempt , FRAs use randomization strategy first visit select new household . Meeting Content Hardware : Hardware Water Treatment One wall mount liquid chlorine dispenser One 40 liter reservoir tap Hand Washing One reuse 1.5 liter water bottle fill soapy water ( laundry detergent mixed water ) Meeting Content All compound : All receive water treatment promotion intervention , whether standard disgust shame base . Two third randomly select receive hand wash promotion along water treatment . Standard Public Health Intervention : The standard public health intervention meeting model typical pre-existing high quality water treatment and/or hand wash intervention . The content include explaining/demonstrating germ enter body via untreated water and/or unwashed hand , make u sick lead death , risk reduce practice safe water and/or hand hygiene behaviour . Disgust Shame Based Intervention : The disgust shame meeting contain similar explanations/demonstrations contamination mechanism risk , place emphasis presence fecal matter contaminate object . FIS ' use vivid harsh local term equivalent `` crap '' `` shit '' try elicit strong reaction participant . They try communicate information sometimes unknowingly serve feces family wash hand soap treat drinking water . They emphasize fecal matter spread people , especially neighbour , try encourage people care others behaviours others think behaviour . Pending piloting , meeting also contain promotion positive identities—being good mother , strong father good Muslim—to stand contrast shameful disgusting activity . The content term use determine qualitative investigation community member . Data Collection Questionnaire All compound survey baseline , three month midline six month endline . The questionnaire instance largely excepting correction make implementation small change administer different time . The questionnaire measure self-reported usage , report neighbour ' usage , knowledge practice pertain hand wash safe water , perception risk severity diarrhoea , norms/ beliefs/ feelings/ reaction relate disgust shame , social networking , demographic information . These measurement allow u study difference behaviour behavioral determinant time group . Physical Observation One follow take 6 household per compound time questionnaire administer also structure observation . Chlorine residual testing store drinking water ( take baseline ) Hand cleanliness inspection child ( see score sheet appendix 4 ) Hand wash demonstration mother The investigator ask demonstrate wash hand defecation . The investigator evaluate performance outline appendix 4 . Others investigator may include pending piloting : Hand rinse water test via H2S test ( see appendix 13 previous principle interpretation ) Other finger cleanliness check Wiping finger white material evaluate darkness Wiping finger oil blotter paper Drinking water quality test via H2S test Rapid Physical Observation Rapid observation take place compound visit consist identify location usability/usage status hand wash water treatment hardware . Structured observation There one structure observation visit halfway midline endline data collection visit . FRAs conduct 5 hour structure observation hand wash water treatment behaviour sub-group compound representative sample . Hand hygiene water treatment behaviour assess use score sheet appendix 6 . Auction/Willingness Pay After courtyard meeting , investigator conduct experimental auction elicit individual household willingness pay ( WTP ) monthly rent-to-own subscription chlorine dispenser reservoir . The investigator use Becker-DeGroot-Marschek ( BDM ) procedure elicit WTP , whereby participant bid predetermine randomly assign price confidentially keep envelope . The investigator collect individual bid list find low bid , compare price envelope . In auction , low participant bid exceeds preassigned price , participant group win auction pay price envelope . The investigator assume mechanism incentive compatible participant bid truthfully bid affect transaction price . The investigator aim keep actual sale price low compound opportunity keep dispenser . Payment data After sale meet investigator measure continue enrollment maintenance safe water ( safe water hand-washing ) station monthly basis . Qualitative Data Collection : During implementation qualitative team regularly visit representative sub-group sample gather data intervention go , perceive give u idea need change meeting survey . The standard investigator use determine frequency qualitative work follow : Roughly one every five compound participate in-depth interview one every 18 compound take place focus group discussion . These number may vary depend data redundancy .</detailed_description>
