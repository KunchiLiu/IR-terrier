	<brief_title>Duration Benefit OnabotulinumtoxinA Treatment Chronic Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recognizing commitment evidence-based science pathway optimize clinical outcome patient chronic migraine ( CM ) believe investigator initiate study ( IIS ) : 1 . Help clinician recognize importance scheduling patient CM interval exceed 12 week . 2 . Provide biopsy evidence support sensory mechanism involve mechanism action ( MOA ) onabotulinumtoxinA ( BTX ) . This exclude potential valuable contribution denervation motor neuron , may support balance understandable mechanism BTX treat CM . 3 . Provide clinician important educational information patient well manage expectation use BTX manage CM answer critical question : 1 . How long take BTX begin provide clinical benefit ? 2 . What expect duration benefit ? - Failure understand unmet expectation either real otherwise result define BTX treatment failure patient and/or clinician . 4 . Provide validation patient ' report short duration action BTX patient misinterpret non-responders BTX prematurely . 5 . Ascertain subject initially report short duration BTX response continue experience similar pattern effect repeat injection cycle . 6 . Provide first detailed longitudinal assessment BTX response . 7 . Correlate onset duration benefit subject receive BTX . 8 . Observe factor predictive duration BTX response . This study propose accomplish goal exploratory comparison clinical efficacy natural history BTX measure weekly time interval . Subjects report short ( &lt; 10 week ) duration benefit subject report long ( &gt; 10 week ) duration clinical benefit provide primary comparison . Histological examination ( subset subject ) neuronal change associate regeneration terminal neuronal endplate use support clinical observation . This study follow subject 3 injection cycle 36 week . Biopsies perform consent subject prior first second injection cycle . Group Assignment At Visit 3 , subject assign one three group ( Groups A , B , C ) base answer follow question : 1 . Since last BTX treatment , think improvement chronic migraine ? If answer Q1 yes , subject answer Q2 Q3 . If answer , subject assign Group C answer require : 2 . How many day take first notice benefit BTX injection ? 3 . How long feel receive benefit BTX ( number week ) ? Subjects assign 3 group : 1 . Group A subject report 10 less week benefit BTX ; 2 . Group B subject report &gt; 10 week benefit BTX ; 3 . Group C subject report minimal ( &lt; 30 % ) benefit BTX . Consistency subject ' perception BTX benefit 12 week compare response 24 36 week , though Group assignment remain defined 12 week . This exploratory study conduct Headache Care Center Springfield , MO . Thirty-six subject , 18 year old history chronic migraine enrol . The study consist 5 visit subject . At Visit 1 ( day 1 baseline ) follow study procedure perform : - Informed Consent obtain - Migraine , medical medication history obtain - Physical neurological exam perform - Urine pregnancy test perform applicable - Vital sign collect At Visit 2 ( day 29 +/- 3 day ) follow study procedure perform : - Update medical medication history - Urine pregnancy test perform applicable - Vital sign collect - Review baseline diary - Complete Migraine Disability Assessment Scale ( MIDAS ) - Complete Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) - Complete Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) - Complete State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) - Complete Sleep Quality Questionnaire - Punch biopsy neuronal regrowth ( subset subject ) - onabotulinumtoxinA injection At Visit 3 ( day 113 +/- 3 day ) follow study procedure perform : - Update medical medication history - Urine pregnancy test perform applicable - Vital sign collect - Complete Subject Global Impression Change ( SGIC ) - Complete Physician Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) - Complete Migraine Disability Assessment Scale ( MIDAS ) - Complete Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) - Complete Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) - Complete State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) - Complete Sleep Quality Questionnaire - Complete duration response onabotulinumtoxinA question - Punch biopsy neuronal regrowth ( subset subject ) - onabotulinumtoxinA injection At Visit 4 ( day 197 +/- 3 day ) follow study procedure perform : - Update medical medication history - Urine pregnancy test perform applicable - Vital sign collect - Complete Subject Global Impression Change ( SGIC ) - Complete Physician Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) - Complete Migraine Disability Assessment Scale ( MIDAS ) - Complete Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) - Complete Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) - Complete State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) - Complete Sleep Quality Questionnaire - Complete duration response onabotulinumtoxinA question - onabotulinumtoxinA injection At Visit 5 ( day 281 +/- 3 day ) follow study procedure perform : - Update medical medication history - Urine pregnancy test perform applicable - Vital sign collect - Complete Subject Global Impression Change ( SGIC ) - Complete Physician Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) - Complete Migraine Disability Assessment Scale ( MIDAS ) - Complete Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) - Complete Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) - Complete State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) - Complete Sleep Quality Questionnaire - Complete duration response onabotulinumtoxinA question</detailed_description>
