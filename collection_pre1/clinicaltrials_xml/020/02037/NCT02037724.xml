	<brief_summary>The consequence iron deficiency anemia woman enormous , especially develop country , condition adversely affect productive reproductive capability . The study seek : 1 ) compare change iron status indicator among woman receive iron-rich organic food supplement versus ferrous sulfate supplement , 2 ) determine suitable level food supplement need prevent/reduce iron deficiency anemia among woman develop country setting . A double-blind , randomize , control , intervention trial implement woman childbearing age , 60 woman iron deficiency anemia 60 woman iron deficiency . After screen potential subject ( 500 expect ) , approximately 30 recruit four study group ; assume 30 % dropout rate , detect increase 30 % ferritin significant two time point 80 % power alpha value 0.05 . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize four group consist : 2 control group ( daily 60mg ferrous sulfate ( FS-60 ) daily 10mg ferrous sulfate ( FS-10 ) ) , 2 test group ( daily 60mg iron-rich supplement ( IRS-60 ) 10mg iron-rich supplement ( IRS-10 ) ) . Subjects take daily FS-60 IRS-60 supervision 8 week subject take FS-10 IRS-10 take supplement supervision 12 consecutive week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design involve screen 500 female adult student staff University Ghana meet initial inclusion criterion . Screening involve pregnancy test , assessment hemoglobin , ferritin also administration health history questionnaire . Thereafter , 120 eligible subject enrol randomized recieve treatment . All subject complete 3-day dietary record ( include 2 weekday 1 weekend ) baseline endline ( i.e . one week prior treatment completion ) . The dietary data analyze use nationally-generated food composition table together ESHA food processor software . In addition , body weight height measure use standard method baseline end study . Weekly monitoring side effect record . Fasting blood sample collect baseline endline enable determination anemia status indicator include serum ferritin , transferrin receptor full blood count , together C-reactive protein .</detailed_description>
