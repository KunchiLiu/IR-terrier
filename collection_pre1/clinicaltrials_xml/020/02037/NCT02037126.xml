	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate feasibility estimate efficacy psilocybin-facilitated treatment cocaine use . We also monitor impact psilocybin-facilitated treatment use drug outcome relevant cocaine involvement ( e.g. , criminal involvement ) . MRI assessment unique aspect study . As potential biological mechanism psilocybin 's effect include change default mode network functional connectivity ( Carhart-Harris et al. , 2012 ) , determine psilocybin 's therapeutic effect mediate change . Moreover , Glx ( brain metabolite reflect glutamate ) abnormalities show play role cocaine addiction , determine psilocybin impact Glx anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals eligible participate provide inform consent complete baseline questionnaire randomly assign double-blind manner Psilocybin Active Placebo group . The first MRI assessment take place shortly thereafter use 3T head-only Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectroscopy scanner ( Magnetom Allegra , Siemens medial Solutions , Malvern , PA ) , optimize neuroimaging application . Preparation session ( see ) drug administration session take place room Clinical Research Unit design comfortable , aesthetically please ( i.e. , living-room like ) , safe ( e.g. , furniture sharp corner glass object ) possible , directly adjacent , private restroom . All participant undergo four weekly preparation session approximately 2 hour . The purpose session : 1 ) develop strong therapeutic alliance participant guide ( Dr. Hendricks ) secondary monitor ( Dr. Cropsey ) ; 2 ) establish comfort rapport participant remainder research team ; 3 ) discus participant ' aspiration regard drug administration experience ( e.g. , What participant hope gain experience ? ) ; 4 ) discus treatment rationale putative mechanism action psilocybin ( e.g. , insight reorientation boost motivation quit abstinence self-efficacy , reduction withdrawal/craving secondary mood improvement ) ; 5 ) obtain detailed personal history participant , focus factor contribute current difficulty ; 6 ) prepare participant drug administration , include detailed account potential effect drug ; 7 ) discus aspect drug administration protocol ( i.e. , logistics procedure ) , include plan action event participant experience acute distress ; 8 ) administer cognitive-behavioral treatment cocaine use . Any participant demonstrates significant anxiety , discomfort , unease regard drug administration conclusion four preparation session provide two additional preparation session . If session unsuccessful mitigate participant 's anxiety , discomfort , unease , participant remove study . Approximately one week final preparation session , participant instruct eat low-fat breakfast prior present drug administration session 8:00 , approximately 1 hour drug administration . A urine sample collect verify drug-free status participant encourage relax reflect drug administration . The drug administration session take place course 8 hour . The guide secondary monitor present participant throughout session ( least one individual always present participant , even brief interval guide monitor may use restroom ) . During time , participant encourage lie , use eye mask block external visual distraction , use headphone supportive music program play . Participants instructed focus attention inner experience throughout session . Any participant reporting significant distress provide reassurance verbally physically ( e.g. , supportive touch hand shoulder ) . Although contemporary study report need pharmacological intervention , event psychological distress insufficiently manage reassurance alone , medication administer guidance study physician . Blood pressure assess regular interval via automatic blood pressure monitor ( e.g. , pre-administration , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 minute post-administration ) , medication treatment acute hypertension administer blood pressure exceed 190 systolic 100 diastolic . Sessions videotape review verify session procedure . Seven hour drug administration , major drug effect subside , participant complete questionnaire assess experience . Participants release care friend family member orient emotionally supportive participant ( arrange preparation session ) instruct drive automobile engage potentially dangerous activity remainder day . Participants provide guide 's pager number feel need support evening . Within 2 day drug administration session , participant meet guide approximately 2 hour discuss reflect experience . The guide ass potential adverse effect time . The second MRI session take place shortly thereafter . Participants meet guide per week next 4 week emphasis integration medication session experience context achieve abstinence cocaine ; continue cognitive-behavioral treatment cocaine use provide follow-up meeting . Long-term assessment visit take place 3 6 month final follow-up meeting . A battery measure deliver time . At conclusion 6-month assessment meeting , participant debrief .</detailed_description>
