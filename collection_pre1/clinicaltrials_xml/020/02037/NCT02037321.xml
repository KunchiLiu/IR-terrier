	<detailed_description>Background : Vegetarian diet associate reduced risk preventable cardiometabolic disease type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . It unclear whether replacement animal protein vegetable protein cardiometabolic advantage . Objectives : To improve evidence-based guidance dietary guideline health claim development , propose conduct series systematic review meta-analyses effect plant-based protein replacement animal protein cardiometabolic risk factor include : ( 1 ) blood lipid , ( 2 ) glycemic control , ( 3 ) blood pressure , ( 4 ) body weight , ( 5 ) uric acid , ( 6 ) marker non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , ( 7 ) kidney function injury . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Long term ( ≥ 3 week ) , randomize , control trial investigate effect exchange plant proteins animal protein outcomes previously mention human include . Studies acute feed design , randomize , lack suitable control include . Both isocaloric non-isocaloric study include . Data extraction : Independent investigator ( ≥2 ) extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , pulse form , dose , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean±SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Risk bias study quality assess use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool Heyland Methodological Quality Score ( MQS ) , respectively . Outcomes : The propose synthesis assess set outcomes related different area cardiometabolic risk : ( 1 ) blood lipid ( establish therapeutic target prevention cardiovascular disease - LDL-C , apo-B , non-HDL-C ) , ( 2 ) glycemic control ( glycated blood protein , fast glucose insulin , Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance [ HOMA-IR ] ) , ( 3 ) body weight , ( 4 ) uric acid , ( 5 ) blood pressure ( systolic BP diastolic BP ) , ( 6 ) marker NAFLD ( image spectroscopy endpoint liver fat biomarkers hepatocellular injury [ transaminases ] ) , ( 7 ) kidney injury function ( creatinine , urea , creatine clearance , estimate glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] , albumin-to-creatine ratio [ ACR ] , albuminuria , proteinuria ) . Data synthesis : Separate pool analysis conduct area cardiometabolic control use Generic Inverse Variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Exceptions make use fixed-effects model &lt; 5 included trial irrespective heterogeneity small trial pool large precise trial absence statistically significant heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochran 's Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analysis include study design , dose , vegetable protein type , animal protein comparator , follow-up , baseline value , study quality . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analysis ( e.g . age , sex , level feed control [ metabolic , supplement , dietary advice ] , washout crossover trial , energy balance background diet , composition background diet [ total % energy fat , carbohydrate , protein ] , change cholesterol intake , change glycemic index , etc. ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . Publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot application Egger 's Begg 's test . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Four Knowledge Users also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Significance : The propose project demonstrate improvement longterm health measure . This demonstration aid knowledge translation relate effect plant proteins cardiometabolic risk , kidney disease management , metabolic syndrome , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim improve health outcome inform healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research .</detailed_description>
