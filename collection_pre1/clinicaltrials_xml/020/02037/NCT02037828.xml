	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) worldwide lead still increase cause chronic morbidity mortality . It estimate 8.2 % adults population disease . Its mortality rate double 2002 1970 accord data America . COPD 4th lead cause death worldwide . The early prediction earlier intervention COPD one major task pulmonary medicine 21st Century . The important issue COPD delay diagnosis . Previous study find accelerated loss force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1.0 ) individual consider indicator develop COPD . The rapid decline spirometry among geriatric population one characteristic COPD , usually appearance symptom . Therefore functional test still objective method diagnosis COPD guide prevention treatment clinical practice . This functional predictive system , due low sensitivity , difficult discover high-risk population earlier stage disease . As ventilation dysfunction appear , patient 's pathophysiologic change would reversable completely . It urgent search sensitive specific biomarkers correlate decline pulmonary function occurrence COPD large-scale prospective epidemiological study . The core pathophysiologic process COPD abnormal inflammatory response airway lung toxic particle gas . The inflammation occur early lung function impairment . Therefore , early detection inflammation may theoretically predict occurrence COPD thus may guide early intervention . It rational establish completely new predict system base early inflammation discovery rather function test . Then convenient large-scale population screen COPD , even use high-risk group periodic medical examination project . So achieve early intervention prevent disease progression improve quality life , crucial research find sensitive specific biomarkers correlate accelerate FEV1.0 decline Chinese population . It helpful establish early warning model COPD among Chinese thus improve ealy diagnosis intervention COPD . The predict system may great value prevent development disease , improve quality life , reduce burden decrease mortality rate . Proteomics technique protein chip technique provide u high throughput screen method figure characteristic inflammatory metabolic marker disease . It use search biomarkers relate lung function loss . EBC collect exhale gas good non-invasive method explore pathologic process airway . Thus design study . This study divide two part : screening target biomarkers identify biomarkers . The first step screen target biomarkers . 20 COPD patient 20 control enrol study EBC reserve . Proteomics technique protein chip technique use screen COPD specific biomarkers . The second step biomarkers screen first step make sure predict rapid decline lung function . The study community base , multicenter prospective cohort design , include total 2,400 study subject . EBC reserve baseline follow two year . Case group define subject rapid decline lung function new COPD patient . Control group select accord 1:1 matching age gender case group . ELISA apply compare expression biomarkers two group baseline . The first step : screening COPD biomarkers Case Group : Inclusion criterion 1. age 40 75 year old ; gender limit . 2 . Stable COPD 3 .
