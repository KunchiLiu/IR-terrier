	<brief_summary>Besides major ESD-related complication , minor adverse event ESD also commonly notice . Pain one minor ESD-related complication . . The cause pain associated ESD gastric polypectomy think associate transmural burn transmural air leak . How control localize pain patient suffer pain ESD appear new medical interest . There study management strategy pain ESD . Glucocorticoids use reduce inflammation tissue damage various clinical setting include inflammatory disease , rheumatic disease , . The efficacy glucocorticoid reduce pain surgery recently investigate . Glucocorticoids think locally inhibit collagen deposition fibrosis finally reduce scar-tissue formation . Especially systemic steroid easy achieve continuous effect stable serum concentration . If pain partially associate acute inflammation , assume intravenous dexamethasone could helpful relieve pain ESD base previous study . aim assess efficacy single dose postoperative intravenous dexamethasone pain relief ESD .</brief_summary>
