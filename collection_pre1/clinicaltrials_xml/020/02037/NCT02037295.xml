	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Free acute chronic disease ( especially GI disorder ) determine medical history , physical examination laboratory test . Individuals may take laxative drug must discontinue 3 week admission . Age 1845 ( order minimize affect age nutrient absorption ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because unclear chronic illness substance abuse could affect nutrient absorption exclude volunteer chronic disease current substance abuse . This especially important limited number study subject study make hard control confounders . We therefore exclude subject history clinical manifestation : Current smoking Type 2 diabetes ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ) Endocrine disorder , Cushing disease , pituitary disorder , hypo hyperthyroidism HIV infection ( selfreport ) , due effect weight body composition HIV medication use treat HIV Active tuberculosis ( selfreport ) Asthma active daily treatment medication Pulmonary disorder include physician diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease obstructive sleep apnea syndrome Cardiovascular disease , include coronary heart disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , peripheral artery disease Hypertension ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ) , treat uncontrolled Gastrointestinal disease , include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . Crohn disease ulcerative colitis ) , malabsorption syndrome ( e.g . celiac disease ) , gastric ulcer ( active ) irritable bowel syndrome . Lactose intolerance Anemia ( define hemoglobin &lt; 11 mg/dl ) , leucopenia ( define white blood cell count &lt; 4,000/microL ) thrombocytopenia ( defined platelet count &lt; 150,000/microL ) Liver disease , include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease current elevate liver enzymes 1.5 time normal range AST , ALT GGT history physical exam indicate potential liver disease describe Giannini et al Evidence chronic renal disease define estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min evidence overt proteinuria urine dipstick . Central nervous system disease , include previous history cerebrovascular accident , dementia , neurodegenerative disorder Cancer require treatment past five year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer clearly cured opinion investigator carry excellent prognosis Behavioral psychiatric condition would incompatible safe successful participation study ( major depression , schizophrenia presence psychotic symptom ) Eating disorder anorexia nervosa , bulimia binge eat syndrome Taking weight loss drug Weight change 5 % total body weight 3 month admission Use antibiotic probiotic agent within 6 month prior minimize potential effect substance gut microbiota . Use antacid ( Proton pump inhibitor , H2 antagonists aluminum/magnesium hydroxide ) 3 month prior study assessed selfreport modify gastric pH might affect gut microbiota well Evidence alcohol and/or drug abuse ( 3 drink per day use drug , amphetamine , cocaine , heroin , marijuana ) The following exclusion criterion necessary substance give test perform study Known allergy vancomycin Known allergy heparin history heparininduced thrombocytopenia Personal history evidence bleed disorder All individual fully inform aim , nature , risk study prior give write informed consent . The study inform consent obtain principal associate investigator , research physician physician assistant work clinical research unit .</criteria>
