	<brief_summary>Low back pain ( LBP ) one common medical problem encounter daily life ; relate disability work absence account high economical cost Western society . Low-back pain diverse group mix pain syndrome ( neuropathic nociceptive ) different molecular pathology different structural level display similar clinical manifestation . Currently , limit biomarkers ( mostly image ) clinical finding use objectively help physician precise anatomic diagnosis lead safe cost-effective treatment patient ( reduction direct indirect cost improvement treatment efficacy ) . The main aim trial identify `` omics biomarkers '' associate susceptibility chronic/persistent LBP different pathophysiology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Study Identify New `` Omics '' Biomarkers Chronic/Persistent Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective observational multinational clinical study , case control design . Investigators compare `` omic biomarkers '' patient without persistent chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) . `` OMIC '' biomarkers investigate genetics , glycomics activomic . Genetics GWA study already obtain important result pain research ; however concern low back pain , yet suitable genotype-phenotype correlation helpful stratify patient . Glycomics emerge field recently identify priority next decade US National Academies Science . Many common complex disease associate specific change glycan structure . In addition , common genetic polymorphism influence glycosylation consequent difference glycome composition could important diagnostic prognostic marker . The first study report protein glycosylation large human population sample recently publish partner consortium . Reliable identification valid association specific glyco-phenotypes predisposition development progression specific disease require analysis thousand patient . Activomics : combine data enzymatic activity numerous numerous post-translational modification protein integrated model provide dynamic characterization current state organism . In project information numerous protease , kinase , phosphatases glycosidases collect used complement exist phenotype information .</detailed_description>
