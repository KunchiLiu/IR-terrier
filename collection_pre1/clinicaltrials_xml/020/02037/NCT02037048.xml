	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil follow surgery response base concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy work treat patient cancer esophagus , gastroesophageal junction , gastric cardia . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , paclitaxel , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy follow surgery response base chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ability response adapt adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improve 1 year recurrence free survival ( RFS ) compare historical data patient &gt; 50 % remain viable tumor induction chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate symptomatic , endoscopic , pathologic response induction chemotherapy . II . To determine rate R0 resection induction chemotherapy . III . To establish toxicity profile tri-modality regimen . IV . To assess recurrence free survival ( RFS ) overall survival ( OS ) trimodality therapy regimen entire cohort patient achieve pathologic response . V. To assess pattern failure assess rate distant metastatic control ( DMC ) locoregional control ( LRC ) tri-modality therapy regimen . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pattern Ki-67 expression patient LRA esophageal cancer induction chemotherapy . II . To explore relationship Ki-67 expression clinical pathologic response parameter well survival outcome . III . To evaluate relationship human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) overexpression ( base immunohistochemistry ) gene amplification ( base fluorescence situ hybridization ) clinical pathologic response parameter survival outcome . OUTLINE : INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV continuously 44 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Approximately 4-5 week completion induction chemotherapy , patient undergo surgical procedure . The choice surgical procedure discretion operate physician . ADJUVANT THERAPY : Within 6-12 week surgery , patient undergo radiation therapy 28 day . Patients positive pathological response also receive oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil induction chemotherapy , begin day 1 , 15 , 29 concurrent radiation therapy . Patients negative pathological response receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients locoregional disease induction therapy undergo surgery may receive chemoradiotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel determine primary oncologist . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 4-5 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
