	<brief_title>Does Residual Muscular Weakness Lead Increase Respiratory Complications Bariatric Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients interested bariatric surgery would contact Dr. Marema Dr. Koppman . Dr. Marema Dr. Koppman determine , patient qualify bariatric surgery . Patients undergo thorough preoperative workup . After optimization medical condition patient would schedule bariatric surgery . This current clinical practice . One investigator would determine patient would qualify study . Then one investigator would approach patient explain study detail . Patients would able give informed consent refuse participate . Patients refuse participate study need sign consent data collect internal quality control ( IRB approval file ) . The patient would schedule bariatric surgery treat per current clinical practice . All patient would undergo similar anesthetic . At end procedure , NMBA reversal agent give , patient would randomize either control study group . Intraoperative Anesthestic Management : Patients receive sedative medication , typically midazolam 2-4mg iv . An infusion dexmedetomidine start . Patients young 65 year receive load dose 1mcg/kg 10 minute . In patient older 65 year 0.5 mcg/kg give load dose . After administration load dose infusion continue throughout duration surgery dose 0.1-1mcg/kg/h . The infusion discontinue end surgery . General anesthesia induce single dose Lidocaine Propofol either Succinylcholine Rocuronium give provide intubate condition . The patient 's trachea intubate mechanical ventilation start . General anesthesia maintain infusion dexmedetomidine propofol titrate desired level anesthesia . Ketamine administer adjunctive analgesic dose 0.5 mg/kg . Neuromuscular blockade appropriate surgical condition provide either long act neuromuscular block agent ( NMBA ) , Rocuronium Vecuronium , anesthesia provider discretion . At conclusion operation degree NMB/paralysis assess NMBA reversal administer ( see detailed description ) . Patients extubated end surgery transport PACU . Monitoring Neuro-Muscular Block ( NMB paralysis ) : A signal send brain muscle via electrical impulse nerve . Electrical impulse apply externally provoke muscle contraction . This technique use monitor degree paralysis induce administration NMBA . NMBAs interrupt impulse signal nerve muscle . External stimulation also NOT lead muscle contraction paralyze patient . Once body metabolizes NMBA signal travel nerve muscle provoke muscle twitch . This recovery gradual meaning initial twitch weak gradually get strong . Also muscle fatigue faster NMBA present ( fade ) . This mean similar , repetitive stimulation twitch get weak . In anesthesia attribute examine determine degree muscle relaxation , , dose NMBA reversal give appropriate dose . There two different way monitor NMB : qualitative quantitative . Qualitative ( current management ) - Control Group : The paralysis monitor tactile ( feel ) visual ( see ) determine twitch strength fade repetitive stimulation . This determine dose reversal . After reversal give anesthesia provider wait determine twitch strong fade . Then patient extubated transported PACU . Quantitative ( propose management ) - Study Group : The paralysis would monitor sensor ( acceleromyography - AMG ) measure twitch-strength ulnar nerve stimulate ( detailed explanation ) . This objective data allows anesthesia provider titrate NMBA reversal best effect assure adequate return full muscle strength . Then patient extubated transported PACU . AMG : The technical term way assess muscle contraction call acceleromyography ( AMG ) . AMG rely 2 stimulate electrode usually place along ulnar nerve wrist sensor place groove thumb index finger ; sensor detects acceleration movement ( bend ) produce thumb response electrical stimulation ulnar nerve ( TOF-WatchÂ® SX Monitor ) . When thumb contract accelerate piezoelectric sensor , degree movement sense , convert electrical signal proportional force thumb contraction . AMG yield signal measure give indication degree neuromuscular block . Randomization : Patients randomized time NMB reverse . Depending result patient study control group . Randomization do statistical software call R online web program call random.org . Power analysis : reduction risk respiratory event postoperative period 30 % 17.5 % alpha 0.05 power 0.8 allocation approximately even group ( n1=n2 ) total sample size n=362 , critical z=1.96 , calculate G Power 3 Data analysis : primary Intention treat analysis reflect clinical reality , secondary analysis per protocol Definition RE , adapt Ziemann-Gimmel et . al . f1000research 2012 Murphy et . al . Anesth Analg 2010 ; 107 ( 1 ) :130-7 Protocol Changes : Randomization occur described time anesthesia provider feel `` comfortable '' base qualitative measurement TOF . If patient randomize intervention group ( quantitative measurement ) reversal give base AMG ( TOF Watch ) . The change protocol : 1 . If 30 minute time point adequate AMG measurement obtain reversal administer . 2 . If administration reversal 30 minute elapse AMG le 90 % patient emerge anesthesia . 3. administration reversal intervention group occur least 4 twitch measure consistently AMG . The previous suggest time-point suggest review article Brull Murphy give 3 twitch seem early patient may regain TOF great 90 % . Dealing miss TOF data : If patient randomize analyzed accord group ( ITT ) . linear regression log transformation do exist trace . There best-/worst case scenario sensitivity analysis . Missing value randomly sample five scenario analyze determine impact ( sensitivity analysis ) . ( Imputation ) Also best/worst case scenario analyze : best case : patient regain TOF 100 % bad case : TOF reduce 5 % last measurement - physiologically unlikely TOF reduce great extend time .</detailed_description>
