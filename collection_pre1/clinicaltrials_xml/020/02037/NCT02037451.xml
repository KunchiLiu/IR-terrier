	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive degenerative disease central nervous system deficit . The clinical symptom Parkinson 's disease include follow motor task : difficult initiate movement , perform rhythmic movement serial movement , ability learn motor movement also affect . The primary treatment Parkinson 's disease medical treatment ; surgery use need . Rehabilitation physical therapy , aim improve patient 's quality life function , non-invasive treatment value PD patient . Auditory cue technique widely apply training patient Parkinson 's disease , research revealed auditory cueing could improve motor performance . However , mechanism treatment technique still unknown . This study investigate effect auditory cue rhythmic finger movement patient Parkinson 's disease . To investigate mechanism auditory cueing , neurophysiological data motor cortex excitability blood flow cortical cortex obtain use Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) .</brief_summary>
