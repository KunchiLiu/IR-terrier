	<brief_summary>This prospective observational cohort multinational clinical study . There biomarkers help predict patient acute low back pain ( LBP ) transform chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) . Human variability different common comorbidities complicate picture make stratification patient correct subgroup difficult . However , drug act target specific molecular pathway therefore efficient subgroup patient share common molecular pathology common genetics . Both CLBP disc degeneration know heritable . Little investigation take place genetic variant CLBP . The main aim trial identify `` omics biomarkers '' associate transition acute ( single episode low back pain ) persistent/chronic LBP ( pain last 12 week ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Trial Identify Biomarkers Involved Transition From Acute Persistent Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators link relate clinical data multiple `` omics '' analysis patient develop persistent chronic symptom ( define pain persist 3 month ) , episode acute LBP . The development persistent chronic pain assess 3 month acute episode . `` OMIC '' biomarkers investigate genetics , epigenetics , glycomics activomic . Genetics genome wide association study ( GWAS ) already obtain important result pain research ; however concern low back pain , yet suitable genotype-phenotype correlation helpful stratify patient . Epigenetic regulation universal tool high organism use adapt change environment . While environmental factor , diet influence enzymatic process directly present , prolonged effect achieve cell memory epigenetic mark . Various element membrane signal transduction system report regulated epigenetic mechanism . Glycomics emerge field recently identify priority next decade US National Academies Science . Many common complex disease associate specific change glycan structure . In addition , common genetic polymorphism influence glycosylation consequent difference glycome composition could important diagnostic prognostic marker . The first study report protein glycosylation large human population sample recently publish partner consortium . Reliable identification valid association specific glyco-phenotypes predisposition development progression specific disease require analysis thousand patient . Activomics : combine data enzymatic activity numerous numerous post-translational modification protein integrated model provide dynamic characterization current state organism . In project information numerous protease , kinase , phosphatases glycosidases collect used complement exist phenotype information . `` Omics '' data compare stratify population accord pain characteristic , pain intensity , response treatment duration pain . In subgroup patient , `` omics '' data compare stratify population accord pain pathophysiology : discogenic pain , spinal stenosis , facet joint pain , sacroiliac joint pain , low back pain radicular pain ( radicular pain predominant ) widespread low back pain .</detailed_description>
