	<brief_summary>This study prospective , cross-sectional observational single centre study assess feasibility intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging ( CLI ) breast cancer wide local excision ( WLE ) specimens dissected lymph node . The sample image use LightPathTM Imaging System . The LightPathTM Imaging System consist light-tight box mount ultra-sensitive lens radiation-shielded camera . This study measure correlation margin status WLE specimen metastatic status dissect lymph node determine LightPathTM Imaging System histopathology . This pilot study assess feasibility proceed pivotal study evaluate benefit LightPathTM Imaging System clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject 's blood glucose level measure day surgery . Subjects blood glucose level &lt; 12 mmol/l receive intravenous injection 5 MBq/kg , maximum 300 MBq 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) prior surgery . Breast cancer surgery perform per standard care . SLNB perform use dose 150 MBq technetium 99 ( 99mTc ) nanocolloid patent blue dye . The resected WLE specimen lymph node image LightPathTM Imaging System . A member research team operate surgeon capture LightPathTM image intra-operatively . Prior CLI , WLE specimen place specimen holder . CLI perform accord LightPathTM Imaging System instruction use . All CLI perform 1 3 hour post injection 18F-FDG . The WLE specimen undergo standard care histopathological analysis positive margin define either invasive carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) within 2mm specimen surface . Lymph node also examine accord standard care histopathological analysis . The CLI result use influence surgical clinical decision-making . All staff operate theatre recovery area care patient , pathology staff process surgical specimen wear badge dosimeter . Staff handle surgical specimen also wear ring dosimeter .</detailed_description>
