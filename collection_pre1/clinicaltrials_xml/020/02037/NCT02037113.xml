	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-center study . The patient peripheral arterial disease underwent abdominal aortograms runoff ( arteriogram low abdominal aorta artery legs ) Intravascular Ultrasound stent deployment enrol study . All patient participate study treat accord standard care . HYPOTHESIS The high degree plaque burden land zone effect restenosis peripheral artery intervention . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To determine intravascular ultrasound parameter stent deployment outcome Femoro-popliteal Disease 2 . To determine clinical risk factor outcomes Femoro-popliteal Disease 3 . To obtain data eventually support development predictive model ISR Femoro-popliteal Disease METHODOLOGY Visit 1 : After consent give The subject receive standard follow-up care . A member research team collect information subject 's age , sex , ethnicity , medical information subject 's medical record . Visits 2-5 : 1 day enrollment , month 3 ( +- 2 week ) , 6 ( +- 2 week ) , 12 ( +- 2 week ) The subject complete standard follow-up appointment TTUHSC . This may include Doppler ultrasound . A member research team record information medication , ultrasound , need additional care relate subject 's stent . The subject complete questionnaire leg pain mobility .</brief_summary>
