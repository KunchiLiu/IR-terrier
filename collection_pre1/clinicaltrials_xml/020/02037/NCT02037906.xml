	<brief_summary>Research Problem : Shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ) dramatically change management renal ureteral calculus disease . In vitro study suggest progressive increase lithotripter energy output voltage could produce best overall stone comminution comparison constant deescalating energy output . However , possible beneficial impact slow rate SWL comminution stone stone free rate mask marginal benefit energy output escalation . The Escalating SW method add benefit less renal tissue injury . Research Significance : The present study signifies evaluate stone free rate three group patient renal stone treat different SWL energy output ( Escalating , Constant Reduction energy output ) . Research Objectives : The aim research project study effect dose adjustment strategy success rate Shock Wave Lithotripsy clinical set optimize condition successful Shock Wave Lithotripsy . Research Methodology : This clinical trial conduct tertiary care university hospital . 150 patient refer Shock wave lithotripsy unit evaluated eligibility randomize three group ( Dose Escalation , Dose reduction constant dose ) . Parameter three group compare detect treatment difference .</brief_summary>
