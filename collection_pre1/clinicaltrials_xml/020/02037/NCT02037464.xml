	<brief_title>CAPSAICIN Trial : Assessing Capsaicin Chemopreventive Agent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale A large body evidence support role dietary factor prostate cancer development progression . Most evidence suggest diet high fat include red meat low micronutrient anti-oxidants , increase risk disease . We interested therapeutic potential dietary agent , capsaicin ( CAP ) . Capsaicin active compound chili pepper , related plant . Pre-clinical study find capsaicin potent growth inhibitory pro-apoptotic effect . It think consumption capsaicin supplement may clinical benefit subject localize prostate cancer choose manage active surveillance improve surgical outcome patient undergoing radical prostatectomy . Objective ( ) Primary • To assess effect capsaicin daily therapy expression ki67 p27 biomarkers post-treatment biopsy prostate specimen RP . Secondary - To assess effect therapy repeat oral dose capsaicin two time daily Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) kinetics men active surveillance localize prostate cancer - To assess effect therapy repeat oral dose capsaicin two time daily grade presence prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PIN ) post-treatment biopsy - To assess effect therapy repeat oral dose capsaicin two time daily expression marker apoptosis , cell cycle , TRP-V1 TRP-V6 - To assess safety tolerability capsaicin therapy men active surveillance ( AS ) prostate cancer - To assess alteration prostate volume time recurrence Endpoint ( ) Primary • Determine effect capsaicin therapy expression ki67 p27 biomarkers post-treatment biopsy Secondary - Determine effect capsaicin daily therapy PSA kinetics men active surveillance localize prostate cancer - To evaluate effect capsaicin daily therapy grade presence prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PIN ) post treatment biopsy - To assess effect capsaicin therapy expression marker apoptosis , cell cycle , TRP-V1 TRP-V6 Safety Tolerability - Adverse event ( AEs ) - Clinical laboratory evaluation ( PSA , electrolytes , biochemistry , hematology , cholesterol ) Pharmacodynamic - Levels serum capsaicin ( CAP ) - Levels serum testosterone ( T ) Study Design This phase II , open label , single centre study evaluate efficacy safety repeat oral dose one CAP capsule twice time daily 6 month prior prostate biopsy men active surveillance localize prostate cancer , well 6 week prior radical prostatectomy ( RP ) . Study Population One hundred men men monitor ( sixty active surveillance ( AS ) forty patient schedule undergo radical prostatectomy ) eligible participation . Subjects must satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . A sufficient number enrol achieve least 100 complete subject</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject &gt; 19 year age 2 . Subject histologically document diagnosis prostate adenocarcinoma 3 . Being monitor active surveillance ( see Table 1 ) favourable risk prostate cancer define follow : 1 . Clinical stage T1b , T1c , T2a T2b time diagnosis 2 . Clinical ( diagnostic biopsy ) Gleason score &lt; 6 3 . PSA &lt; 10.0 ng/ml ( ug/L ) 4 . Tumour material recent prostate biopsy available sample ( 10 unstained slide ) collect determination ki67 p27 biomarker expression . 5 . Scheduled active surveillance mandate transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guide biopsy within 6 12 month Day 1 study 1 . Previous malignancy ( include curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ) within previous 5 year . ( Ta bladder cancer negative surveillance cystoscopy within past 2 year may include . ) 2 . No previous current treatment ( medical therapy radical intervention ) prostate cancer exclude biopsy 3 . Inability undergo TRUS biopsy 4 . Concurrent administration follow medication permit protocol : 5 αreductase inhibitor Cytotoxic chemotherapy Immunotherapy Hormonal therapy ( megestrol , medroxyprogesterone , cyproterone , diethylstilbestrol , hyrodcortisone , etc . ) Nonsteroidal antiandrogens ( bicalutamide , nilutamide , flutamide , etc . ) Luteinizing hormone release Hormone ( LHRH ) analogue ( leuprolide , goserelin , etc . ) Ketoconazole PCSPES preparation think endocrine effect Medications inhibit cholesterogenesis ( 'statin ' medication , etc . ) 5 .
