	<brief_title>A Prospective Pilot Study Evaluate Effect Systemic Adjuvant Therapy Cognitive Brain Function Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer amongst woman worldwide , lifetime risk 7-8 % woman incidence rate range 19.3-89.7 per 100,000 woman develop developed country . More 1,383,500 case invasive breast cancer estimate diagnosed worldwide , approximately 1490 woman diagnose breast cancer Singapore every year . However , mortality rate lesser 6-19 per 100,000 woman favourable survival breast cancer high-incidence develop region . In Southeast Asian Chinese 5-year overall survival 75.8 % , although low Indians Malays 68 % 58.5 % respectively . These improve outcome largely due early detection availability successful treatment option . With rise prevalence disease improve survivorship , long term effect current treatment option become increasingly survivorship issues.An early Early Breast Trialists ' Collaborative Group ( EBCTCG ) meta-analyses , report adjuvant chemotherapy produce absolute 10-year survival improvement 7-11 % &lt; 50 year age , 2- 3 % age 50 -69 year . This benefit recently confirm update report adjuvant chemotherapy trial demonstrate recurrence mortality reduction compare no-chemotherapy trials.Hence , chemotherapy remain important strategy adjuvant setting . However , several study report reduced cognitive function proportion breast cancer patient receive chemotherapy , also know `` chemobrain '' effect . In patient , cognitive impairment range deficit memory , attention , concentration , executive psychomotor function deficit nearly cognitive domain report . Other study however dispute association , thus remain unclear cognitive impairment indeed potential risk systemic treatment . There number difference adjuvant chemotherapy regimen comprise anthracyclines and/or taxanes various regimen . An adjuvant regimen utilise weekly paclitaxel standard doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide show improve disease-free overall survival 3-weekly taxanes give standard anthracycline-based regimen In order minimise heterogeneity , study recruit patient utilise adjuvant chemotherapy regimen.Anti-hormonal therapy become mainstay adjuvant treatment hormone receptor-positive patient . Tamoxifen 5 year reduce recurrence rate throughout first 10 year ( RR 0路53 year 0-4 RR 0路68 [ 0路06 ] year 5-9 [ 2p &lt; 0路00001 ] ; breast cancer mortality third throughout first 15 year . In addition , use aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) post-menopausal breast cancer report confer significant 2.9 % decrease recurrence compare tamoxifen ( 9.6 % AI v 12.6 % tamoxifen ; 2P &lt; .00001 ) non-significant absolute 1.1 % decrease breast cancer mortality ( 4.8 % AI v 5.9 % tamoxifen ; 2P = .1 ) recent meta-analyses Dowsett et al.Compared chemotherapy , relative paucity data pertain endocrine therapy-induced cognitive change . Nonetheless , several pertinent study examine datasets within large context pre-existing large multicenter adjuvant hormonal therapy trial outline below.A grow body literature suggest adjuvant systemic therapy breast cancer may associate cognitive impairment , may persist year impair decision-making ability disrupt ability woman fulfill family , career , community responsibilities.The magnitude deficit may moderate depression , anxiety , fatigue , concomitant medication , genetics , education , intelligence , menopause.Studies associate cognitive change chemotherapy report since mid 1970s ; systematic research come mid 1990 's early 2000's.However , early study limit lack pre-treatment assessment , importance illustrate study Wefel et al.This one first prospective longitudinal study compare pre- post-treatment cognitive measure . Although mean difference patient receive 5- fluorouracil/doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide ( FAC ) chemotherapy normal control , intra-individual analysis patient demonstrate 61 % cognitive decline learning , attention processing speed . Without baseline assessment , 46 % patient normal post-treatment score would cognitive impairment miss , highlight cognitive dysfunction subtle small difference may clinically significant . Furthermore , although acute cognitive change chemotherapy common , long-term post-treatment cognitive change seem persist 17-34 % cancer survivors.Several additional longitudinal study since assessed cancer treatment-related cognitive difficulty use standard neuropsychological assessments.About 12-82 % patient detect cognitive impairment domains executive function , memory , psychomotor speed attention , frequent measure affect . These study use variety cognitive assessment tool control group , different treatment regimen vary test timepoints . A study compare breast cancer patient , majority expose adjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane-based chemotherapy , breast cancer patient chemonaive healthy control , report great deficit process speed verbal ability domains chemotherapy-exposed group . Therefore , research need need look factor contribute decline thereafter , long-lasting impairment.Of interest , cognitive deficit detect cancer patient pre-chemotherapy several study . For instance , Wefel et al describe 33 % woman current cohort exhibit cognitive impairment even systemic therapy.Another study report 23 % impairment cognition prior adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy.These could relate psychological variable stress , anxiety depression , factor differ socioeconomic , educational intrinsic cognitive level . Research need look factor contribute decline thereafter , long-lasting impairment . These data also suggest systemic therapy-associated cognitive change need examine within broad context risk factor biological process associate cancer development.Inclusion assessment confound factor could play role influence cognitive function vital . Fan et al study report fatigue , menopausal symptom cognitive important adverse effect chemotherapy improved patient period 1-2 years.In comparison , hormonal therapy minimal impact . Self-perceived cognitive deficit may reflective objective test score hence interest evaluate . In population-based study Denmark consist woman &lt; 60 year old receive adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy tamoxifen compare healthy control , show patient 3 time likely healthy control rate cognitively impair 6 month , although neuropsychological test reveal evident consistent pattern cognitive change patient groups.Most clinical data cognitive function anti-hormonal therapy selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMS ) tamoxifen , although focus aromatase inhibitor increase recent year . A substudy ( designate CoSTAR trial ) pool subject pre-existing National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) Study Tamoxifen Raloxifene ( STAR ) randomize woman =35 year old increase risk breast cancer Gail model evaluation either tamoxifen raloxifene.The substudy require woman perform 83-minute standardized test battery cover multiple domain . Outcomes cognitive test similar group . In landmark NSABP Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ( P-1 ) include 13,388 woman increase breast cancer risk , treatment 5 year tamoxifen result reduce risk breast cancer 49 % relative placebo.A separate report document result P-1 Symptom Checklist assessment encompass self-report domain span cognition , musculoskeletal pain , vasomotor symptom , nausea , sexual problem , bladder problem , body image vaginal symptoms.The cognitive assessment include question relate concentration , forgetfulness , avoidance social affair , tendency towards accident . There little difference cognitive dysfunction group . Notably , 2 study , evaluation conduct period active therapy . To address issue , study Paganini-Hill et al population-based case-control study examine 1163 woman 55-75 year old diagnose primary breast cancer.Previous tamoxifen user classify short-term user ( &lt; 4 year ) long-term user ( =6 year ) compare never user . Women use tamoxifen 4-5 year memory problem report physician compare never user ( 3.8 % vs 1.5 % , p=0.04 ) , especially woman currently tamoxifen . However , difference see among never past user suggest limited long-term sequela . Even among premenopausal population tamoxifen , significantly low processing speed appear interfere executive functioning report cross-sectional study compare woman adjuvant tamoxifen healthy controls.Clinical data effect aromatase inhibitor cognitive function emerge . The large dataset come International Breast Intervention Study II ( IBIS II ) study postmenopausal woman increase risk breast cancer receive either anastrozole placebo 5 year , test do 0 , 6 24 month . No difference cognitive function 2 group detect . However neurocognitive test do period treatment previously describe study postmenopausal hypoestrogenic population . As , effect AIs could blunted.In substudy Anastrazole , Tamoxifen Combined ( ATAC ) trial recruit patient localize breast cancer adjuvant tamoxifen , anastrozole combination therapy , 94 patient ATAC trial compare 35 non-cancer control . Their mean length study time 36 month . The patient group significantly impair compare control group measure verbal memory ( p=0.026 ) processing speed ( p=0.032 ) . Comparisons anastrozole tamoxifen do cross-sectional longitudinal study , demonstrate anastrozole expose group experience worse cognitive impairments.There poor verbal visual learn memory study Bender et al,44 prospective longitudinal study show nine-fold five-fold increase risk cognitive decline anastrozole tamoxifen group respectively relative healthy control ; common domain affect process speed verbal memory.A neuropsychological substudy carry pivotal Tamoxifen Exemestane Multinational ( TEAM ) trial randomize patient adjuvant exemestane 5 year adjuvant tamoxifen 2.5-3 year follow exemestane 2-2.5 year .The neuropsychological assessment carry pre-endocrine therapy year treatment , include 80 tamoxifen 99 exemestane user . Interestingly , exemestane user perform statistically bad healthy control cognitive domain , tamoxifen user significantly bad verbal memory executive functioning compare healthy control , significantly bad information process speed compare exemestane user . However , postulate exemestane 's mildly androgenic property may ultimately preserve cognition.A recent cognitive test report Breast International Group ( BIG ) 1-98 study randomize woman adjuvant monotherapy tamoxifen letrozole 5 year , sequential therapy letrozole follow tamoxifen vice versa reveal woman take letrozole 5th year well overall cognitive function take tamoxifen ( p=0.04 ) .A significant improvement composite cognitive function group observe year 5-6 treatment cease . In summary , repect AIs , great cognitive decline observe anastrozole compare tamoxifen , less decline see exemestane letrozole.Larger study clearly need validate finding . Results many study need interpret cautiously , various limitation study pertain field . Many study hamper variety inherent methodological problem . These include lack baseline assessment , lack longitudinal design , failure control physical psychosocial confounding factor hormonal factor , depression , anxiety , fatigue educational level.Furthermore , study also differ considerably respect regimen dose chemotherapy receive , previous exposure anti-hormonal therapy length time post-treatment . In addition , limitation several study lack pre-treatment evaluation cognitive function.This especially problematic make impossible determine whether deficit present treatment detect change baseline . The timing cognitive function assessment completion therapy also uniform . Most study lack non-treated comparison group fail measure potential moderator cognitive function . Several study fail include comprehensive assessment multiple domain cognitive function , occasionally rely use self-report questionnaire . Importantly , cognitive study Asian population grossly limit . Certain biological pathway , genetic polymorphism epigenetic change could lead alteration cognitive function subgroup people expose chemotherapy . For example , several genetic polymorphism multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) identify may influence P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) function , one study polymorphisms C3435T exon26.P-gp present blood brain barrier affect amount drug uptake brain actively transport cell . Polymorphisms associate low expression functionality P-gp may cause increased vulnerability chemotherapy-induced cognitive change . Oxidative stress frequent cause DNA damage neuronal cell , associate various neurodegenerative disease include Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease . DNA damage repair system link neurodegeneration ataxia telengectasia xeroderma pigmentosum . So far relation cognitive function level DNA damage post-chemotherapy well study . As mention , certain study detect high expect rate cognitive impairment pre-chemotherapy . In addition high level oxidative DNA damage find woman breast cancer.These data consistent research link certain DNA repair polymorphism decrease DNA repair capacity thus increase cancer risk . Hence , change cognitive function follow chemotherapy evaluate within context genetic factor increase cancer risk also increase risk cognitive dysfunction pre-treatment . Certain polymorphisms base-excision pathway may also worthwhile study importance modulate oxidative stress cancer risk.Cytokines play role central nervous system function , include modulation neuronal glial cell functioning , neural repair metabolism dopamine serotonin , important neurotransmitter cognition . Longitudinal study interferon-a IL2 cancer population show decrement cognitive performance , particularly domains information process speed , executive function , spatial ability reaction time.Both chemotherapy persistent fatigue link increased cytokine levels.Genetic polymorphism identify influence cytokine activity associate Alzheimer 's disease depression . However , far relationships polymorphisms chemotherapy-induced cognitive change well study . The catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) valine genotype link chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment breast cancer survivor worthwhile study . Chemotherapy mouse model also demonstrate decrease hippocampal cell proliferation , increase histone acetylation decrease histone deacetylase activity . Hence , would therefore relevant study particular candidate mechanism likely influence cognitive change certain susceptible individual . Inclusion assessment confound factor could play role influence cognitive function vital . Fan et al study report fatigue , menopausal symptom cognitive important adverse effect chemotherapy improved patient period 1-2 year . In comparison , hormonal therapy minimal impact them.But , even use increasingly sophisticated performance-based assessment , subtle difference often miss along obscurity neural circuit structure underlie cognitive change . For reason , neuro-imaging tool gain advantage provide opportunity examine effect chemotherapy brain cognition . However , study limit field therefore need brain image study . MRI emerge noninvasive method potential produce high resolution contrast image brain . From anatomical finding , adjuvant chemotherapy associate long-term injury white matter also damage gray matter associate functional deficit . An early study Inagaki et al . compare 51 adjuvant chemotherapy treat breast cancer patient 55 patient receive chemotherapy , show chemotherapy patient small volume key area involve cognitive processing . The patient show strong positive correlation volume loss performance WMSR ( Wechsler Memory Scale Revised ) test attention memory . A serious weakness study failure consider effect adjuvant endocrine therapy lack prechemotherapy baseline assessment . Only three study date investigate integrity white matter tract structural connectivity use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Results reveal structural neural change time well indicated region specific difference inherent cognitive deficits.The corpus callosum , area important communication hemisphere , exhibit reduced white matter integrity may explain reduced processing speed report chemotherapy-treated patient . The effect endocrine treatment consider analysis provide drawback proper interpretation . Another study show decreased Fractional Anisotropy ( FA ) frontal temporal white matter tract well increase Mean Diffusivity ( MD ) frontal white matter . A significant correlation also see FA score neuropsychological test ( attention process speed ) chemotherapy-treated patient . White matter organization , particularly frontal , parietal occipital white matter tract , negatively impacted chemotherapy correlate strongly cognitive functioning score . This suggest microstructural white matter change abnormality may underlie report cognitive dysfunction find chemotherapy treated cancer patient , especially cerebral white matter vulnerable neurotoxins.In addition small number structural imaging study , limited number functional imaging study assess neural change chemotherapy treated cancer patient . Combining anatomical/structural assessment functional imaging technique provide wide window evaluation onto functional change associate cognitive deficit . To understand underlying functional change associate poor executive function process chemotherapy patient , study Saykin et al one first incorporate work memory assessment functional MRI readout . This one first prospective longitudinal study compare pre- post-treatment work memory N-back task . Although author report group difference task performance expect main effect work memory load performance baseline , patient assess one month post-chemotherapy show increased activation posterior frontal parietal region compare control less bilateral activity anterior frontal region . This study illustrate cognitive change associate chemotherapy may subtle reliably detect standard neuropsychologial assessment underscore importance potential use functional MRI elucidate underlie neurobiological changes.Interestingly , investigate declarative memory 14 breast cancer patient three year follow chemotherapy , patient show less activity bilateral frontal gyrus postcentral gyrus great activation parahippocampal , bilateral cerebellum , cingulate precuneus exhibit normal cognitive assessment cortisol level ( measure distress ) compare control . The increased activation several brain area compare control indicate patient require great global neural effort control attempt recall task information . More interestingly , study show type chemotherapy regimen contribute differential patient verbal memory impairment ; CMF treat patient show low prefrontal cortex activity encode compare patient adriamycine/cyclophosphamide/taxol regimen . This indeed highlight importance distinguish different type chemotherapy treatment . Although functional MRI gold standard evaluation brain function , indirect measure functional readout represent underlie neuronal mechanism involve . Other method investigate assess mere brain activity directly detect underlie mechanism cognitive dysfunction chemotherapy patient . Only two PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) image study conduct date . A recent study conduct 5 year post-chemotherapy patient . Patients exhibit low rest metabolism frontal cortex basal ganglion . A major drawback study lack baseline assessment inhomogeneous study group eight patient tamoxifen treatment.Another PET/CT study ass brain metabolism chemotherapy 128 patient still ongoing.Results many study need interpret cautiously , various limitation study pertain field . Many study hamper variety inherent methodological problem . These include lack baseline assessment , lack longitudinal design , failure control physical psychosocial confounding factor hormonal factor , depression , anxiety , fatigue educational level . Furthermore , study also differ considerably respect regimen dose chemotherapy receive , previous exposure anti-hormonal therapy length time post-treatment . In addition , limitation several study lack pre-treatment evaluation cognitive function . This especially problematic make impossible determine whether deficit present treatment detect change baseline . The timing cognitive function assessment completion therapy also uniform . Most study lack non-treated comparison group fail measure potential moderator cognitive function . Several study fail include comprehensive assessment multiple domain cognitive function , occasionally rely use self-report questionnaire . Importantly , cognitive study Asian population grossly limited . Taking shortcomings consideration , design study intend minimise bias mention . The chemotherapy regimen utilise limited anthracyclines taxanes ; specifically use patient give doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( AC ) 4 cycle follow weekly paclitaxel 12 cycle per adjuvant breast cancer study Sparano et al chemotherapy regimen commonly use division . Furthermore , baseline pre-treatment assessment CANTAB imaging assessment , longitudinal study design , uniform evaluation take 6 month one year post-chemotherapy start one year anti-hormonal therapy cut-off point CANTAB imaging assessment . We also attempt minimize bias analyze confounders anxiety , depression hormonal fluctuation use questionnaire also recruit control group healthy subject similar age , gender social background .</detailed_description>
