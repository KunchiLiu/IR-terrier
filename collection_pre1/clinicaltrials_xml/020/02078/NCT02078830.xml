	<brief_summary>The objective study assess efficacy 3M™ Tegaderm™ CHG I.V . Securement Dressing entry-site EVD reduce quantity microorganism ( CFU/cm2 ) time period 5 day surrogate marker EVD-associated infection [ 1 , 2 ] , compare nonantimicrobial polyurethane 3M Tegaderm™ Transparent Film Dressing . We aim investigate , adjunct additional CHG-impregnated device routinely basis daily care valuable effective option reduce contamination EVD entry-site consecutive colonization catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomised Study Use CHG Dressing Entry Site EVD 's Reduce EVD-associated Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomised , parallel group , single-centre Phase IV trial compare change quantity microorganism ( CFU/cm2 ) time period 5 day ( primary endpoint ) surrogate marker EVD-associated infection [ 1 , 2 ] , patient undergo EVD dress entry site 3M™ Tegaderm™ CHG I.V . Securement Dressing ( study arm ) versus 3M™ Tegaderm™ I.V . Advanced Dressing ( standard arm ) . Secondary objective comparison regrowth ( CFU/cm2 ) every 5th day routine change device , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) culture every 2nd day sonication catheter tip explantation ( secondary endpoint ) . We hypothesize bacterial contamination ( CFU/cm2 ) EVD entry-site 5 day compare baseline ( bacterial regrowth since baseline ) subject treated 3M™ Tegaderm™ CHG I.V . Securement Dressing significantly low compare subject treat 3M™ Tegaderm™ I.V . Advanced Dressing . Quantitative microbiology catheter tip ( sonication ) might reduce external intervention , well CSF culture . We use internal pilot study design [ 3 ] . The three step procedure include : - initial sample size calculation - sample size review - final analysis .</detailed_description>
