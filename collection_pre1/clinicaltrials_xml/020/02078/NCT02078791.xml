Infiltration , GPST Group 2 , Group 3 GPST+ Infiltration The sample size approximately 30 alpha risk 0.05 , low risk beta 0.2 , 29 subject need detect difference equal great 0.25 unit . It assume proportion control group 0.8. estimate loss rate 20 % follow-up . Fibromyalgia patient attend chronic pain unit refer family doctor specialist . These patient painful symptom could control first level health care health centers.Not form part study patient fibromyalgia discomfort cervical area preferably.To include study patient acceptance participation require informed consent.Anesthesiologists assign patient three different group accord intervention take place ; infiltration , TRP ( Problem Solving Therapy ) intervention . When patient meet 8-10 start TRP group . Each group direct trained professional nursing . If n't enough sample search Fibromyalgia Associations . The information variable enter database ( Excel ) import statistical program ( SPSS ) analysis . Qualitative variable express frequency percentage quantitative mediated central tendency ( mean standard deviation ) dispersion.The relationship variable analyze χ2 , comparison mean ( t-student ) , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Spearman , depend type variable.Multivariate analysis perform try determine factor may promote improve quality life / patient .
