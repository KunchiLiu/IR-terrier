	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify biomarkers potentially actionable mutations/ activate molecular pathway evaluate impact molecular profile information patient gynaecological cancer . The hypothesis study : - Analysis gynaecological tumour sample allow u identify novel and/or actionable molecular change may drive therapeutic strategy management cancer . - Molecular profiling improve outcome novel targeted-agent treatment clinical trial - Molecular profiling pair sample ( primary/recurrent primary/metastatic ) provide new insight mechanisms underlying drug resistance metastasis gynaecological cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances understand cancer biology lead rapid expansion molecularly target therapeutic pre-clinical clinical development last decade . The systematic sequencing cancer genome reveal individual tumour frequently harbor multiple `` driver '' somatic mutation confer growth advantage positive selection . Importantly , many alter protein result mutation identify study fact actionable , i.e . `` druggable '' , target . Hence , evaluate drug efficacy tumour select combination histopathology molecular analysis potential result great therapeutic gain . The premise behind personalised cancer medicine include : ) genetic aberration exist human malignancy ; ii ) subset aberration frequently exist across multiple tumour type functional relevance driver oncogenesis tumour progression ; iii ) molecular effect genetic aberration potentially actionable target ; iv ) medicinal compound safely effectively modulate target patient tumour . The key challenge optimise personalised approach cancer therapy ensure patient tumours harbour specific molecular/ genetic aberration specifically match particular drug combination drug . In respect , molecular analysis tumour identify somatic mutation and/or genetic aberration examples enrichment strategy assist match patient drug treatment gain increase interest oncology communityGenetic heterogeneity gynaecological cancer underpin observed variation patient outcome . Hence , ability characterise unique genetic feature patient 's tumour critical step identify optimal therapeutic strategy individual.It anticipate validated process molecular profiling fully establish NUHS , eventually integrated patient care much early stage . The spectrum development molecularly-targeted agent rapidly expand , increasingly likely future cancer management require molecular histological subtype one 's tumour define order decide appropriate treatment strategy . By initiate first step towards development well-validated , cohesive , streamline efficient process molecular profiling , eventual aim obtain formal accreditation cancer physicians NUHS/NCIS , NCC KKH able unequivocally use data patient care .</detailed_description>
