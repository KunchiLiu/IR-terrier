	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin type A ( Botox A ) show great success treat certain urologic condition . A recent study document Botox inject around ureteral orifice ( place tube connect kidney bladder enters bladder ) , placement ureteral stent ( small rubber tube facilitate drainage urine kidney bladder ) , result marked decline amount stent pain experience patient . This find quite remarkable stent commonly use many Urologic condition , stent produce remarkable degree patient discomfort . Despite great improvement pain reduction , irritative voiding symptom [ frequent need void , urgency , burn urination ( dysuria ) nighttime void ( nocturia ) ] ameliorate Botox injection ureteral orifice . However , already well documented clinical setting , administration Botox bladder muscle , show reduce irritative symptom .
