	<detailed_description>Background : The primary purpose cancer screen reduce mortality disease population find cancer early treatable stage . The cancer important health problem suitable target screen . With approximately 6 000 new case year Sweden ( Cancer register ) , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common cancer Sweden five-year survival rate close 60 % , detect early stage rate 90 % . Both large precursor stage - adenomatous polyp ( Muto , Vogelstein ) - cancer could detect sensitive method analyze blood stool . Removal adenomas protective effect colorectal cancer development ( Winawer , Muller , Thiis-Evensen ) , consequentially , colorectal cancer screen program also potential decreasing future incidence disease . The screening test must free unwanted side effect , inexpensive , also simple take easy interpret ( Armitage ) . Furthermore , high sensitivity specificity prerequisite screen test use program average risk population . Indirect test : The commonly use screen test guaiac base fecal occult blood test ( Hemoccult® ) . Four large RCTs demonstrate 16 % decreased CRC mortality test screening ( Mandel , Kronborg , Hardcastle , Lindholm ) . More advanced fecal immunological test ( FITs ) high sensitivity , marginally increase specificity , available . FIT demonstrate presence human blood dietary restriction need . Direct test : The main advantage endoscopy direct visualization colorectum possibility obtain tissue sample suspect cancer lesion histopathology remove adenomatous polyp . Recently , three RCTs sigmoidoscopy primary screen test demonstrate reduced disease specific mortality around 30 % , also reduce incidence CRC much 40 % ( Atkin , Segnan , Schoen ) . Up , large randomize controlled study average risk population publish demonstrate disease specific mortality reduction colonoscopy primary screening test . Compliance : compliance proportion individual offer screen test actually take test ( Armitage ) . The compliance screen program major determinant program effectiveness - participate contribute mortality reduction achieve screen program low participation number death prevent . A call Swedish study colorectal cancer screening : The Swedish minister Health Social affair , Göran Hägglund , fund task force 2011 order design study effectiveness colorectal cancer screen average risk population Sweden . The present study design base data need get well outcome colorectal cancer screen Sweden . All county participate except Stockholm Gotland , due already implemented CRC-screening program Hemoccult® , county Västernorrland . Material Methods - study population : In total 200 000 individual resident Sweden randomize Register total population ( Register total population ) . The randomized individual turn 60-years old calendar year randomization . Twenty thousand individual invite primary screening colonoscopy , 60 000 individual invite high sensitive FIT , positive , subsequent colonoscopy 120 000 person serve control . The inclusion period set three year repeat test two year FIT arm . Invitation procedures - FIT : All individual randomize FIT primary screen test regular mail receive invitation participate study . The invitation include brochure information incentive study need follow-up colonoscopy case positive test . The invitation contain FIT-kit two separate test sample instruction take test . With invitation pre-paid return-envelope . Colonoscopy : All individual randomize colonoscopy arm receive invitational letter regular mail include brochure information incentive study . The invitee inform shortly mail receive appointment colonoscopy , send endoscopy clinic area residency . Controls : The individual randomize control arm contact informed participation control study . If individual would contact Head secretariat ask control , information give . Interventions - FIT-arm : We plan two round FIT , one first year one third year . We follow finding perform interim analysis suggest round FIT carry scientific committee deem necessary . Two test per round ask without dietary restriction . If 60 % invitee comply send FIT test laboratory ( experience ongoing screen program county Stockholm Gotland ) 10 % positive , generate approximately 1 200 colonoscopy year FIT-arm except year four number generate colonoscopy estimate 2 400 due second round re-testing . Colonoscopy-arm : A primary screening colonoscopy carry estimate adherence 50 % , approximately 10 000 colonoscopy carry . The examination perform without sedation follow standard bowel clean preparation . The endoscopy center accredit quality examiner investigate . The preparation bowel standardize . All detail follow European guideline ( von Karsa , Rembacken ) . There thorough evaluation endoscopist quality aspect accord set guideline . This carry use specific quality register IT-system data success rate colonoscopist , finding side effect enter estimate 17 000 colonoscopy . In study registry , adverse advent pain , bleed perforation also collect . The register data continuously cross-linked data National Patient register ( Patient register ) Swedish Causes Death register ( Cause death register ) order find severe adverse event . Follow-up : Follow-up time set 15 year inclusion invitation primary endpoint colorectal cancer mortality incidence interim analysis 5 10 year . Data 200.000 individual randomize population register obtain Causes Death register ( 19 ) Cancer register ( 1 ) . Regarding secondary outcome , information retrieve national registry Patient register ( 18 ) . Ethical consideration : The study process approved regional Ethics Review Board Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden ( No . 2012/2058-31/3 ) . Statistical analysis : The lifetime cumulative mortality colorectal cancer Sweden 1 % 15 year . With 80 % power 2.5 % significance level accord Bonferroni method present study need randomize 20 100 person colonoscopy arm , 60 186 FIT arm 120 372 control arm . Based previous study , estimate reduction mortality 30 % examined FIT subsequent colonoscopy approximately 50 % individual examine primary colonoscopy . The compliance estimate 60 % FIT-arm approximately 10 % positive test invite follow-up colonoscopy 80-90 % adherence rate . Compliance primary colonoscopy estimate 50 % suppose low contamination opportunistic screening .</detailed_description>
