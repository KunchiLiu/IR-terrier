	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify genetic variant associate high risk doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity contribute towards develop predictive algorithm comprise clinical genetic factor select patient avoid treatment anthracyclines . Hypothesis study certain functional variant gene encode metabolize enzyme and/or target doxorubicin pharmacology pathway may increase risk doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin one cornerstone therapies adjuvant chemotherapy early stage breast cancer . Cumulative dos 240mg/m2 ( 4 cycle doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ) 300mg/m2 ( 6 cycle doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ) typically administer adjuvant setting , associate &lt; 1 % chance severe cardiotoxicity , thus consider 'safe dose range ' . However , Blanco et al recently report childhood cancer survivor CBR3 ( metabolize enzyme doxorubicin ) V244M homozygous G genotype increase risk cardiomyopathy follow exposure anthracyclines dos low 101-150mg/m2 , suggest safe dose threshold individual certain genotype . We previously study several gene doxorubicin pharmacology pathway , include CBR1 , CBR3 , AKR1C3 , find correlation functional variant CBR3 AKR1C3 doxorubicin-induced myelosuppression . The CBR3 G allele present 50-60 % Singapore population , postulate common variant may similarly modify risk anthracyclines-induced cardiomyopathy adult breast cancer patient . Post-treatment echocardiography routinely perform patient complete adjuvant anthracyclines-containing chemotherapy . We believe high-risk individual may subclinical reduce left ventricular ejection fraction may future increase risk congestive cardiac failure presence risk factor ( eg hypertension , anemia , serious infection , etc ) . Identifying individual could therefore important early treatment ACE inhibitor may improve cardiac function . Confirming correlation genetic variant include CBR3 V244M also help develop predictive algorithm future identify patient anthracyclines avoid .</detailed_description>
