	<detailed_description>Background Neuroendocrine tumor Neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) heterogeneous slow-growing neoplasm , occur 1-4/100,000 people per year . They origin endocrine cell derive entodermal stem cell characterize endocrine metabolism typical pathologic pattern . Slow metabolic rate NET , small lesion size variable anatomical localization represent major limit lesion diagnosis . The diagnostic workup NET rely conventional morphological imaging procedure include compute tomography ( CT ) , ultrasound ( US ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) combine gamma camera functional imaging , namely whole-body somatostatin receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) . SRS show higher diagnostic accuracy CT NET diagnosis primary metastatic site , still room improvement . Novel PET tracer specifically developed NET may increase diagnostic accuracy considerably outline . Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) As NET high affinity somatostatin receptor , scintigraphic method develop early ninety allow vivo imaging . SRS use Indium-111-DTPA-octreotide ( Indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy ) , widely use diagnostic test . Although rather sensitive helpful whole body stag compare traditional imaging method , technique pitfall , one poor spatial resolution , lead development PET-based imaging . Gallium-68-DOTA-peptide PET In past decade , several positron emit tracer develop NET image . 68Ga-DOTA-peptides group PET tracer specifically bind somatostatin receptor ( SSTR ) over-expressed NET cell . Gallium-68-DOTA-peptides structure summarize ( 1 ) active part bind SSTR ( TOC , NOC , TATE ) , ( 2 ) chelant ( DOTA ) ( 3 ) isotope ( 68Ga ) . Indications perform 68Ga -DOTA-peptides study NET patient include : staging , re-staging therapy , identification site unknown primary tumor patient proven NET secondary lesion selection case eligible therapy somatostatin analogue . 68Ga-DOTA-TOC first tracer employ NET image report present high tumor non-tumor contrast high sensitivity compare SRS . The study large patient population ( 84 pt NET ) , report sensitivity ( 97 % ) DOTA-TOC PET superior CT ( 61 % ) SRS ( 52 % ) detection NET lesion , especially case small tumor nodal bone level . In comparison study 51 patient well differentiated NET , PET Gallium-DOTA-TOC perform good CT SRS early detection bone NET secondary lesion ( sensitivity 97 % , specificity 92 % ) . 68Ga-DOTA-TATE characterized high affinity SSTR2 considerably high affinity 111In-DTPA octreotide . In recent study , 51 patient establish NET ( 35 negative 16 equivocal uptake SRS ) examine 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET . 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET identify significantly lesion SRS change management 36 patient ( 70.6 % ) , subsequently deem suitable peptide receptor-targeted therapy . Rationale study 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy current standard detection NET , even though diagnostic accuracy less optimal . In past decade , several 68Ga-DOTA-peptides develop NET imaging , show good detection NET 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy small number study . These study several limitation , importantly inclusion rather small heterogeneous patient population . The aim study prospectively compare diagnostic accuracy 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy well-defined population consecutive patient establish GEP-NET patient suspicion NET indication scintigraphy . Objective The objective study compare diagnostic accuracy Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/CT Indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy ( SPECT/CT ) diagnosis gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( GEP-NET ) consecutive patient establish GEP-NET patient suspicion NET indication scintigraphy . The working hypothesis Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/CT superior Indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy ( SPECT/CT ) term sensitivity specificity . Methods The present study multi-center assessor-blind diagnostic case-control study Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/CT compare Indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy ( SPECT/CT ) consecutive patient establish GEP-NET patient suspicion NET indication scintigraphy . The study conduct University Hospital Basel , Bern University Hospital , CHUV Lausanne . The University Clinics Nuclear Medicine Basel , Bern Lausanne , well Endocrinology , Diabetes Clinical Nutrition Bern accrue consecutive patient establish GEP-NET patient suspicion GEP-NET meet eligibility criterion . All patient undergo Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/CT index test Indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy standard test . Both result compare histology follow-up result diagnostic gold standard .</detailed_description>
