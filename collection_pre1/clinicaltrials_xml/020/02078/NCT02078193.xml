	<brief_title>Efficacy Belatacept Reducing DSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate patient convert belatacept combination MMF corticosteroid respect DSA titer . Patients study convert CNI belatacept baseline attempt down-modulate antibody production B-cells . Dosing calculate per prescribe information dose maintenance phase ( 5mg per kg every 28 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipients cadaveric , live related living unrelated kidney transplant positive DSA titer ( two positive test ) enrol within 6 month DSA detection . Patients stable renal function . Stable renal function define one SCr value +/ 10 % baseline SCR within 3 month enrollment ( eGFR &gt; /= 35 &lt; /= 75 mL/min/1.73m^2 ) . Patients EBV seropositive Males female , 1875 year age ; Patients currently receive MPA ( CellCept daily myfortic daily ) , cyclosporine tacrolimus corticosteroid part immunosuppressive regimen Patients willing convert belatacept cyclosporine tacrolimus . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment . The test perform baseline visit . Effective contraception must use trial , 4 week follow discontinuation study medication ; Patients willing able participate full course study write informed consent obtain . Multisolid cellular organ transplant ( e.g . combine pancreas , liver , islet , bone marrow ) , either concurrent previous ( exception second kidney transplant allow ) ; Evidence graft rejection treatment acute rejection within 14 day prior Baseline visit ; Patients receive investigational drug within 4 week prior study entry ; Patients HLA identical Patients EBV seronegative Presence clinically significant infection require continued therapy , chronic infection ( e.g . HIV , Hep B Hep C ) , malignancy ( within last 5 year , except excise squamous basal cell carcinoma skin ) , lymphoma renal toxicity would interfere appropriate conduct study ; Evidence severe liver disease ( incl . abnormal liver profile i.e . AST , ALT total bilirubin &gt; /= 3 time ULN ) severe diarrhea active peptic ulcer disease would interfere appropriate conduct study ; Abnormal physical laboratory finding clinical significance within 2 week inclusion would interfere objective study ; Patients symptoms significant somatic mental illness evidence drug and/or alcohol abuse ; Patients receive &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone dose ; History hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical structure belatacept ; Patients make DSA antibody ; Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( local ) ; female childbearing potential unwilling use effective studyapproved contraceptive plan become pregnant ; Sexually active fertile men must use effective birth control partner woman child bear potential ; Any medical condition , opinion site investigator base recall chart review would interfere complete study , include limited visual problem cognitive impairment .</criteria>
