	<criteria>The patient confirm diagnosis Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia either CP AP . Accelerated phase define disease 1 following : ≥15 % &lt; 30 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow ; ≥30 % blast + promyelocytes peripheral blood bone marrow ; ≥20 % basophils peripheral blood bone marrow ; platelet count &lt; 100x109/L unrelated therapy ; clonal evolution . The patient either fail , demonstrate intolerance , combination prior failure intolerance , prior treatment least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI 's ) . Failure TKI treatment may either primary ( never achieve response ) secondary resistance ( loss response ) . TKI treatment failure define 1 following : CHR 12 week ( whether lose never achieve ) partial cytogenetic response 24 week ( ie , 1 35 % Phpositive ) ( whether lose never achieve ) major cytogenetic response 52 week ( ie , ≤35 % Phpositive ) ( whether lose never achieve ) progressive leukocytosis , define increase white blood cell ( WBC ) count least 2 consecutive evaluation , least 2 week apart double nadir ≥20000/μL absolute increase WBC ≥50000/μL posttreatment nadir Intolerance TKI therapy define 1 following : grade 3 4 nonhematologic toxicity resolve adequate intervention grade 4 hematologic toxicity last 7 day , document inability sustain TKI therapy recurrent grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity reinitiation therapy grade 2 great toxicity unacceptable patient Patients must complete previous anticancer therapy least 2 week prior first plan dose omacetaxine , except note , must fully recover side effect previous therapy . In patient rapidly proliferate disease , hydroxyurea may administer study entry , clinically indicate , control disease . In case , complete hematologic response ( CHR ) must sustain least 4 week accelerate CML , least 8 week chronic phase CML , follow discontinuation hydroxyurea , consider CHR . Patients may receive anagrelide 28 day ( country product register ) . Leukapheresis allow 24 hour prior first treatment cycle omacetaxine . Patients must adequate hepatic renal function evidence bilirubin 2.0 time upper limit normal range ( ULN ) low , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) asparate aminotransferase ( AST ) 3 time ULN low , serum creatinine 1.5 time ULN low . Patients nonclinically significant elevation bilirubin 5.0 g/dL ( 85500 μmol/L ) due know suspect Gilbert 's disease eligible ; must document medical history page case report form ( CRF ) . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 Patients men woman least 18 year age . Patients must able willing provide write informed consent prior study related procedure . The patient must take precaution become pregnant produce offspring . Women must nonchildbearing potential ( surgically sterile postmenopausal least 12 month , confirm folliclestimulating hormone [ FSH ] &gt; 40 IU/L ) agree use medically accept method contraception duration study 90 day treatment . Men must surgically sterile agree use medically accept method contraception duration study 90 day treatment . Acceptable method contraception include abstinence , barrier method spermicide ( exclude cervical cap sponge ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , steroidal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) conjunction barrier method . Other criterion may apply , please contact investigator additional information The patient New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV heart disease , active ischemia , uncontrolled cardiac condition angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia require therapy , uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure . The patient myocardial infarction previous 12 week . ( Prior study entry , electrocardiogram [ ECG ] abnormalities screen must document investigator medically relevant . ) The patient receive radiotherapy within 30 day prior start study drug , recover acute toxicity associate prior approve therapy include investigational drug . The patient another concurrent illness would preclude study conduct assessment , include , limited , another active malignancy ( exclude squamous basal cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer ) , uncontrolled medical condition , uncontrolled active infection ( consider opportunistic , life threatening , clinically significant ) , uncontrolled risk bleeding , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . The patient underwent autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant within 60 day prior receive first dose omacetaxine evidence ongoing graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , GVHD require immunosuppressive therapy . The patient human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match donor eligible allogeneic transplantation CML treatment . The patient know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know active human tcell lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) I/II disease , whether treatment . The patient know active hepatitis B C. The determination active hepatitis B C leave investigator . The patient lymphoid Ph+ blast crisis blast phase CML . The patient participate another clinical investigation within 30 day enrollment receive another investigational agent . The patient receive omacetaxine history hypersensitivity .
