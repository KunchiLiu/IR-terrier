	<criteria>18 year age old . Histologically confirm GBM World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade IV variant ( gliosarcoma , glioblastoma oligodendroglial feature , giant cell glioblastoma ) . Uneqivocal evidence first tumor recurrence progression initial treatment regimen ( prior enrollment study ) , consist surgical intervention ( biopsy and/or resection ) , radiation , temozolomide chemotherapy , assess MRI CT scan brain without contrast within 14 day prior start SL701 . If receiving corticosteroid , dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . Patients unable undergo MRI noncompatible device enrol , provide CT scan obtain sufficient quality . For patient , image technique perform throughout study , purpose assess tumor response PD . For patient undergone resection recurrent progressive tumor prior study enrollment , follow condition must apply : Recovery effect surgery . Residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI perform : No later 96 hour ( h ) immediate postoperative period ; At least 4 week postcraniotomy ( 7 day stereotactic biopsy ) , within 14 day prior start SL701 , corticosteroid dosage stable decrease least 5 day . Patients resection recurrent progressive disease must measurable disease . At least 56 approximately 76 patient treat must measurable disease , define least one , contrastenhancing lesion measure least 1 cm 2 plane ( axial , coronal , sagittal ) . No evidence hemorrhage baseline MRI CT scan Grade ≤ 1 either postoperative stable least two consecutive scan . Recovery prior therapy toxicity , define resolution treatmentrelated adverse event ( AEs ) Grade ≤ 1 pretreatment baseline ( except alopecia lymphopenia ) . At least 12 week prior radiotherapy start SL701 unless new enhancement outside radiation field unequivocal histopathologic evidence recurrent tumor . No chemotherapy investigational agent least 3 week prior start SL701 , least 6 week elapse time last dose nitrosoureas . Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) A2 positive . A tumor tissue sample provide immunohistochemical analysis relevant antigen , immune marker potential prognostic factor . Preferably paraffin block 1012 unstained slide submit prior study entry . Patients tumor sample unavailable inadequate permit participate study ; however , absence available/adequate tumor specimen must document . Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score ≥ 70 % . Adequate organ function , include follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/μL , platelet ≥ 100,000/μL . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × ULN . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 × ULN . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day prior start SL701 treatment . Female patient childbearing potential sexually active male patient must agree use acceptable form contraception heterosexual activity ( ie , oral contraceptive , double barrier method , hormonal injectable , transdermal , implanted contraceptive , tubal ligation , vasectomy sexual partner ( ) &gt; 40 day Screening , study , 60 day last dose study drug . Men donate semen study 60 day last dose study drug . Female patient without childbearing potential ( spontaneous amenorrhea &gt; 12 month surgically sterilize tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy &gt; 6 month Screening ) eligible inclusion without contraceptive use restriction . Able willing comply protocol requirement , opinion investigator . A write voluntarily sign informed consent must obtain patient legally authorize representative , accordance local regulation , initiation study related procedure . The patient legally authorize representative must able read understand inform consent form ( ICF ) . Prior cancer chemotherapy , bevacizumab ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] /VEGF receptor [ VEGFR ] direct agent ) , investigational agent recurrent/progressive GBM prior bevacizumab part initial therapy ( prior chemotherapy investigational agent permit part initial therapy ; VEGF/VEGFRdirected agent permit ) . Contrastenhancing tumor follow : Multifocal ( define two separate area contrast enhancement measure least 1 cm 2 plane contiguous either fluidattenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) T2 sequence ) ; Associated either diffuse subependymal leptomeningeal dissemination ; ≥ 4 cm dimension . Requirement systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 4 mg/day dexamethasone equivalent requirement increase dose systemic corticosteroid 7 day prior start SL701 treatment . Surgical resection major surgical procedure within 4 week prior start SL701 , stereotactic biopsy within 7 day prior start SL701 . Radiation therapy , local therapy ( except surgical reresection ) , systemic therapy follow first recurrence/progressive disease . Excluded local therapy include stereotactic radiation boost , implantation carmustine biodegradable wafer ( Gliadel ) , intratumoral convectionenhanced delivery administered agent , etc . Active infection require intravenous antibiotic . History cancer ( GBM ) within past 2 year metastatic local recurrence potential could negatively impact survival and/or potentially confound tumor response assessment within study . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( eg , uncontrolled New York Heart Association Class 3 4 congestive heart failure , uncontrolled angina , history myocardial infarction stroke within 6 month study entry , uncontrolled hypertension clinically significant arrhythmia control medication ) . Known immunosuppressive disease active systemic autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus , human immunodeficiency virus infection , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , take immunosuppressive agent within 4 week prior start SL701 treatment . Patients vitiligo , type 1 diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement therapy , psoriasis require systemic therapy , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Any condition investigator 's opinion make patient unsuitable study participation . Requires therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin baseline ; patient must warfarin warfarinderivative anticoagulant least 7 day prior start study drug ; however , therapeutic prophylactic therapy lowmolecular weight heparin allow . Has history know coagulopathy increase risk bleed history clinically significant hemorrhage within 12 month start study drug . Has evidence intratumoral peritumoral hemorrhage baseline MRI scan ≤Grade 1 either postoperative stable least 2 consecutive MRI scan Has gastrointestinal bleeding hemorrhage/bleeding event National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) &gt; Grade 3 within 6 month start study drug .</criteria>
