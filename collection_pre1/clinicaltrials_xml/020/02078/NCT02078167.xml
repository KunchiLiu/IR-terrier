	<brief_title>Long Term Efficacy Tolerability Nutraceutical Combination ( Red Yeast Rice , Policosanols Berberine ) Low-moderate Risk Hypercholesterolemic Patients : Double-blind , Placebo Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Many epidemiological study show serum cholesterol level strongly relate cardiovascular risk [ 1 , 2 ] . Consequently lower cholesterol level fundamental prognostic goal primary secondary prevention cardiovascular event . The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzime A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor , commonly know `` statin '' forefront strategy manage hypercholesterolemia , especially patient high high risk cardiovascular disease , view establish efficacy reduce cardiovascular mortality morbidity primary secondary prevention [ 3 , 4 ] . However , 10-15 % patient result intolerant statin , even low daily dose almost one-third statin user discontinue therapy within one year begin [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , use statin reduce cardiovascular risk clinical practice rarely encourage primary prevention patient , especially primary prevention , refuse statin fear possible side effect . Some nutraceutical product may represent alternative treatment consider mentioned case , patient marginally high hypercholesterolemia [ 4 , 6 ] . Since use full- dose nutraceuticals entail tolerability concern , combination nutraceuticals different synergic mechanism action low safer dosage could preferable . In particular , recent year grow interest nutraceutical combination contain monakolin ( biologically active component red yeast rice ) , berberine policosanols ( MBP-NC ) . The cholesterol lower effect MBP-NC consume conjunction standard Mediterranean healthy diet observe large Italian study carry general practitioner ( GPs ) [ 7 ] , patient intolerant one statin [ 8 ] , patient metabolic syndrome overweight [ 9 , 10 ] elderly hypercholesterolemic subject [ 11 ] . Moreover , MBP-NC mixture report direct protective vascular effect , similar pharmacological lipid lower agent , improvement endothelial dysfunction [ 12 ] improvement aortic stiffness [ 13 ] . Another recent study report 2-month treatment MBP-NC improved insulin sensitivity patient metabolic syndrome [ 14 ] . However , hitherto cholesterol lower effect MBP-NC evaluate long term double-blind placebo control study . The aim single centre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety 24 week treatment MBP-NC mixture low -moderate risk hypercholesterolemic patient . Materials Methods Population A cohort 66 consecutive outpatient newly diagnose primary hypercholesterolemia previously treat applied Lipid Clinic Department Internal Medicine University Siena ( Italy ) , consider enrolment study . The inclusion criterion ( 1 ) age 18 60 year , ( 2 ) body mass index ( BMI ) 18,5 ad 29,9 Kg/m2 , ( 3 ) serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) 150 mg/dL estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk &lt; 20 % accord Framingham risk score . The exclusion criterion ( 1 ) history cardiovascular disease coronary risk equivalent , ( 2 ) secondary hyperlipidemia cause diabetes mellitus , renal , liver thyroid disease , ( 3 ) alcohol consumption &gt; 40 g/day , ( 4 ) estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk &gt; 20 % accord Framingham risk scoring , ( 5 ) muscular disease abnormally elevate creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) level drug treatment anti-platelet , anti-inflammatory , hypolipidemic agent hormone replacement therapy , either on-going time previous 2 month . Instead , patient stable anti-hypertensive treatment least 3 month include . All patient instruct maintain habitual physical activity study period . At screen visit , patient instruct follow hypolipidic diet ( low- cholesterol/ low-saturated fat diet approximately consist 55 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein , 25 % lipid ) run-in period 3 week , patient meet inclusion criterion , randomize receive pill MBP-NC ( N=30 ) placebo ( N=30 ) day dinner , addition hypolipidic diet . The placebo pill , identical taste appearance MBP-NC pill , consist inactive compound . Randomisation blind provide Rottapharm Madaus S.p.A ( Monza , Italy ) . The composition patent proprietary combination nutraceuticals investigate follow : red yeast rice extract 200 mg ( equivalent 3 mg monacolins ) , berberine 500 mg , policosanol 10 mg , folic acid 0.2 mg , coenzyme Q10 2 mg asthaxantin 0.5 mg ( Armolipid Plus , Rottapharm Madaus S.p.A , Italy ) . The study conduct accordance guideline Declaration Helsinki , revise 2000 2008 , study protocol approve Ethics Committee University Hospital Siena . Written inform consent obtain patient . Clinical anthropometric evaluation All patient underwent physical examination baseline 4 , 12 , 24 week treatment . All determination make Lipid Clinic 09.00 AM , overnight fast 12 h. Height weight measure near 0.1 cm 0.1 Kg , respectively . BMI calculate weight kilogram divide height square meter . Brachial blood pressure measure physician mercury sphygmomanometer patient seat least 10 min average 3 measurement consider analysis . Waist circumference also measure visit midway low rib iliac crest use anthropometric tape . In patient , body composition [ fat mass ( FM ) percentage , fat-free mass ( FFM ) fat-free mass/fat mass ratio ( FFM/FM ) ] assess anthropometry bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) use single-frequency 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analyzer ( BIA 101 RJL , Akern Bioresearch , Florence , Italy ) . All BIA measurement carry operator accord standard tetrapolar technique , patient supine position least 20 min . The electrode place dorsal surface right foot ankle right wrist hand . Biochemical measurement In patient fast venous blood sample draw baseline 4 , 12 24 week order ass serum level total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) . All lipid parameter ( TC , TG , HDL-C LDL-C ) measure use colorimetric method ( Autoanalyzer Menarini , Florence , Italy ) . In order monitor safety MBP-NC patient , time point , serum level glucose , uric acid , CPKw , gammaglutamiltranferase ( É£GT ) transaminases also assess . Tolerability monitor record symptom . Medication compliance assess count number pill return clinic visit .</detailed_description>
