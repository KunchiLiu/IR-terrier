	<brief_summary>Presently Canada , 29 % death due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , cost $ 20.9 billion annually . The investigator , therefore , bring together unique network investigator different stage career range discipline ( nutrition , cardiology , diabetes , image , physic , clinical trial , statistic , laboratory medicine , primary care , genetics , psychology , knowledge translation ( KT ) , epidemiology ) international recognition , experience connection , undertake multi-centre study test ability dietary Portfolio PLUS approach 3 year reduce progression plaque build-up carotid artery assess Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) individual hypercholesterolemia . The dietary portfolio cholesterol-lowering food ( viscous fibre , soy protein , plant sterol nut ) proven many study effective cholesterol-lowering diet enhance increased level monounsaturated fat ( MUFA ) low glycemic index food . Will enhance dietary strategy ( dietary Portfolio PLUS ) reduce progression carotid atheromatous lesion , LDL-C blood pressure reduce number hyperlipidemic individual require statin ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As Western population age body weight increase , need dietary strategy reduce Coronary Heart Disease ( CHD ) risk continue . The investigator position put together dietary approach significant advance current dietary advice CHD risk reduction . The investigator believe study use image functional technique need 1 ) demonstrate improvement estimate CHD risk base anatomical change rather serum risk factor . 2 ) encourage popular uptake clinical use combination dietary strategy 3 ) stimulate large long term trial CHD event . Participants study recruit 4 academic centre across Canada ( Quebec , Toronto , Winnipeg Vancouver ) . They low moderate risk category base current Canadian Cardiovascular Society 's ( CCS ) Guidelines 2012 would normally consider initial treatment lifestyle . All participant first screen ultrasound presence plaque carotid artery randomize one 2 treatment arm : Portfolio Plus diet ( test ) modify DASH diet ( control ) , give routine clinical advice follow visit 3-month interval 6 month twice yearly remainder 3 year trial . Prior start either diet , participant undergo screen ultrasound examination right leave carotids enable selection individual whose intima-media thickness would 5-30 % cut point consider Mannheim Consensus relevant arterial thickening ensure relatively low risk group , yet measurable arterial thickening . The main outcome MRI assessment maximum vessel wall volume . This assessment repeat year 3 . It emphasize outset dietary portfolio DASH-like diet associate benefit term cholesterol reduction provide equal encouragement randomize test control group . Portfolio DASH-like dietary advice consist half hour individual session dietitian baseline , 3 , 6 month 6-month interval . Prior start diet , instruction give achieve dietary goal . At follow-up visit , participant ' complete 7-day diet record discuss original advice reinforce . Every effort make obtain study blood sample carotid image data subject designate time regardless adherence dietary aspect study protocol . All subject include intention-to-treat analysis .</detailed_description>
