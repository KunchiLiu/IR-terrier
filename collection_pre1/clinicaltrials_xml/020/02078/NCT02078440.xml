	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate relative bioavailability , rate extent absorption bromocriptine male female child adolescent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patient , age 10 less 18 , feed condition . It undetermined pharmacokinetic profile bromocriptine-QR type 2 diabetes child age 10- less 18 year differs appreciably healthy adult . Bromocriptine extensively metabolize liver ( namely CYP3A4 ) . Studies child demonstrate little difference clearance among child 10 year age compare adult ( Blanco et al , 2000 ) . However , difference blood volume factor may impart difference could affect pharmacokinetic property bromocriptine-QR . Therefore , study ass pharmacokinetics child age 10-to less 18 year type 2 diabetes . After describe profile bromocriptine-quick release patient population , follow study conduct evaluate safety efficacy treat child adolescent type 2 diabetes . The pharmacokinetic profile bromocriptine determine follow administration single , weight-adjusted dose CYCLOSET ( bromocriptine mesylate ) tablet . The study single period , bioavailability study 30 patient . The study duration 3 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study CYCLOSET ® 0.8 mg Tablets Children Adolescent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study multi-center , single dose , open-label , 1-period design . Thirty ( 30 ) patient enrol study least twenty-four ( 24 ) patient expect complete study . Male female patient confirm Type 2 Diabetes , non-or ex-smokers , age 10 less 18 year select accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients admit clinical site least 10 hour prior drug administration occur within 2 hour wake morning Day 2 . Ondansetron hydrochloride administer orally , approximately 6 hour dose time Cycloset ( bromocriptine mesylate ) . Subjects weigh 50 60 kg receive 6mg ondansetron hydrochloride ( liquid 7.5 ml ) subject weigh ≥60 kg receive ondansetron hydrochloride 8 mg ( liquid 10 ml ) . A single , weight-adjusted dose CYCLOSET ( bromocriptine mesylate ) , approximately 0.048 mg/kg , administer orally 240 mL water morning , 10-hour overnight fast , thirty minute start standardize breakfast meet American Diabetes Association diet recommendation . On day 2 , supervise overnight fast , patient awaken , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse rate body temperature ) measure first blood sample ( T= 0 ) collect . Seventeen ( 17 ) blood sample collect pharmacokinetic sampling 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 24 36 hour post drug administration . Finger stick blood glucose level obtain every hour first 4 hour follow administration bromocriptine mesylate , additionally deem necessary study physician . Safety evaluate assessment adverse event laboratory test vital sign .</detailed_description>
