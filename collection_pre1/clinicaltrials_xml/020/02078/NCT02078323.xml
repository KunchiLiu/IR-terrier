	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand drug call Linaclotide improve bowel function abdominal pain patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome Constipation ( IBS-C ) well examine whether Linaclotide alters communication brain pelvic-floor region . Linaclotide show improve abdominal pain bowel symptom IBS-C , approve FDA treatment condition . However , exactly drug work relieve abdominal pain discomfort human clearly know . Studies animal model suggest patient IBS-C hypersensitivity gut . Consequently , IBS-C patient , rapid excessive conduction signal brain central nervous system region towards pelvic-floor ( anorectal axis ) reverse direction . The investigator hypothesize treatment Linaclotide may improve/normalize signal thereby improve bowel symptom . Investigators test theory use new , noninvasive ( establish ) method study communication pathway brain gut .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Linaclotide 's Effect Bi-directional Brain Gut Axis IBS-C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>modulate mechanism thereby improve visceral pain . Investigators propose three specific aim : 1 . Examine hyperexcitability afferent-pelvic floor brain axis 60 patient IBS measure cortical evoke potential ( CEP ) sensory threshold electrical stimulation rectum anus administration linaclotide placebo period 10 week . 2 . Study efferent brain pelvic floor axis stimulate cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation record anal rectal motor evoke potential ( MEP ) 60 IBS-C patient . 3 . Determine locus neuronal modulation i.e neuroenteric change due central peripheral neuronal sensitization , evoke anal rectal MEPs selectively stimulate lumbar sacral nerve bilaterally , compare segmental transcranial-induced MEPs .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>During previous year , patient must recurrent abdominal discomfort pain least 3 day per month last 3 month associate two follow symptom ( 36 ) : ) improvement defecation ; ii ) onset associate change frequency stool ; and/or iii ) onset associate change form ( appearance ) stool . No evidence structural disease ( exclude colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy barium enema ) . Patients 50 eligible enroll unless colonoscopy , sigmoidoscopy barium enema within ten year prior screen . Individuals age 50 would require undergo one diagnostic procedure present alarm symptom rectal bleeding , unexplained weight loss anemia ) . There plan undergo procedure part research protocol . Therefore , individual require procedure refer back treat physician ( due reach age 50 require general screening colon check age , due alarm symptom ) enrol study . No evidence metabolic problem ( exclude laboratory test ; comprehensive blood count metabolic panel require within six month screen visit . If none available patient 's electronic record record provide external provider , complete blood test exclude clinically significant metabolic abnormality ) . The P.I . decide value fall range represent clinical significance . Women childbearing potential must agree urine pregnancy test screen avoid pregnancy throughout study . On prospective symptom/stool diary patient report ) presence abdominal pain/discomfort least 2 day per week ; ii ) hard lumpy stool &gt; 25 % loose watery stool &lt; 25 % bowel movement ( IBSC ) ; ( iii ) loose watery stool &gt; 25 % bowel movement hard stool &lt; 25 % Bowel Movements ( IBSD ) ; &gt; 25 % hard loose stool within one week ( IBSM ) Patients laxative abuse , anorexia nervosa , bulimia ; Patients take opioids ( e.g . codeine morphine ) , antispasmodic ( dicyclomine hyoscyamine ) , muscle relaxant ( e.g . cyclobenzaprine ) . If patient take drug supplement , P.I . determines may able safely come medication , patient may eligible rescreen , pending two week minimum washout enrollment ; Patients active episodic major depression enrol referred treatment , necessary . Patients history depression achieve stable remission eligible . Patients comorbid illness , severe cardiac disease , chronic renal failure previous gastrointestinal surgery except cholecystectomy appendectomy ; Patients neurologic disease ( e.g . head injury , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , stroke , spinal cord injury ) brain disorder prone cause seizure ; Patients experience impaired cognizance ( mini mental score &lt; 15 ) and/or legally blind ; Women pregnant likely conceive ( woman potential pregnancy must use contraceptive measure include ) ; Patients ulcerative Crohns colitis ; Patients rectal prolapse , anal fissure , anal surgery inflame hemorrhoid . Patients find condition eligible enrollment due potential discomfort probe placement . If patient exclude due anal fissure inflame hemorrhoid achieves full remission initial screening , may eligible rescreening .</criteria>
