	<brief_title>Gut Microbiome Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Scientific Background Infertility major health problem affect 15 % married couple . About half case attributable female factor , among anovulation lead cause . About 5 % woman reproductive age anovulatory due polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . In addition effect fertility , PCOS cause major health cosmetic problem significantly affect quality life woman . PCOS associate cardiovascular morbidity Type 2 diabetes mellitus , unclear whether caused ovarian dysfunction result common denominator . - PCOS - The clinical picture : The polycystic ovary syndrome consist anovulation , acne , hirsutism ( result hyperandrogenism ) , reverse serum LH FSH ratio . A large proportion woman PCOS overweight , significant proportion woman PCOS decrease peripheral insulin sensitivity . The direct cause insulin resistance still enigmatic . All feature place woman PCOS group patient related metabolic syndrome . Baranova et al . ( 2011 ) even state `` seem appropriate consider polycystic ovary syndrome ovarian manifestation metabolic syndrome '' . - Genetics Not woman PCOS affect relative familial cluster common , brother woman PCOS high serum level androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . The eventual clinical expression PCOS result genetic predisposition also nutritional factor . Family study use several approach analysis suggest 40 candidate gene , possibly responsible syndrome . Among gene steroidogenic pathway , gonadotrophin receptor signal transduction pathway , insulin signal transduction pathway growth factor signal transduction pathway . Except association polymorphism CYP11 hyperandrogenism none candidate gene definitively associate PCOS . The inheritance pattern PCOS clear , evidence favor autosomal dominant mode others support . Recently methionine 196 arginine polymorphism exon 6 TNF receptor 2 gene ( 676 T -- &gt; G ) show associated hyperandrogenism PCOS , genotype influence clinical biochemical variable related hyperandrogenism insulin sensitivity associate obesity . A role Calpain 10 gene PCOS susceptibility also suggest , variant LH receptor . The sex hormone bind gene also show promise disappoint . The mode X-chromosome inactivation appear associate risk sister discordancy PCOD , specific gene implicate respect . As many complex disorder , heritability polycystic ovarian syndrome elude investigator . Although familial aggregation study demonstrate clearly genetic component syndrome , simple Mendelian model characterize mode inheritance . Instead , multiple locus epigenetic modification may play role phenotype . The candidate gene approach rely upon improved statistical technological method analyze potential gene base biologic plausibility . Pathways affect steroidogenesis , insulin resistance , gonadotropin function , obesity provide potential gene investigation . Obstacles phenotypic variability , lack male phenotype , multiple attempt analysis , small sample size hamper effort . Genome wide Analysis become gold standard elucidation genetic background many disease . The recent comprehensive analysis PCOD vs. control conduct Chen et al ( 2011 ) , candidate gen define , mechanistic understanding possible causality still far away . - Gut Microbiota - General : The post genomic era lead several breakthrough understand human physiology . One prominent realization alimentary tract harbor 100-fold living ( bacterial ) cell body . This discovery make possible ability define presence bacterial strain DNA signature , without need culture . Furthermore , definition strain allow allocation major taxonomic division , turn enable legitimately call `` profiling '' gut bacterial population diversity . Thus new term coin `` microbiota '' designate total population gut microbe . In addition , also possible define presence specify enzyme enzyme family gut microbiota , enable turn outline overall gut microbial metabolic capacity . It major interest characterize vary taxonomic metabolic profile , pertain specified human pathology physiological state . Once microbiota profile associate specific human pathology characterize , key question arises egg hen . Namely , causative , pathological state microbiota show associate ? On several issue recent study prove microbiota likely causative , experimental transplantation microbiota mouse lead development state reminiscent human disease . Yet difference microbiotas human population various location across globe raise likely possibility ethnicity , diet environmental factor meaningful effect gut microbiota . All tell , study association gut microbiota many human condition could reveal major subject interest , mostly towards possible understanding causality well suggestion future corrective measure . - Women Women go several major physiological transition lifetime . The first puberty , follow conception pregnancy , usually life , last menopause . It likely would associate dynamic change gut microbiota , pioneer study show recently pregnant woman 's gut microbiota profoundly alter compare non-pregnant woman . Furthermore , evidence accumulate regard specific alteration gut microbiota several morbid state , likely woman 's pathology , anovulatory infertility associate PCOS , could associate specific alteration gut microbiota profile . Naturally , `` egg vs. hen '' question importance difference anovulatory ovulatory woman find , tackle almost outset . - Overall Study Objective Is difference gut microbial population normal ovulatory woman woman suffer PCOS , , role causation syndrome ? Specific Aims - Is difference microbial population profile woman PCOS normal ovulatory woman ? - Can carbohydrate-poor diet physical activity induce change gut microbial population woman PCOS ? Detailed Study Design Specific Aim I : Is difference microbial population profile woman PCOS normal ovulatory woman ? A group 30 woman diagnose PCOS standard Rotterdam consensus criterion 30 normal ovulatory woman provide stool sample 3-5 initial day menstrual bleeding . Serum hormone metabolic profile obtain concomitantly . Samples submit DNA sequence GGA laboratory ( Prof. Dani Bercovich ) , use technique describe previously . The result datasets analyze laboratory Dr. Omry Koren , Faculty Medicine Galil , use method previously use . Caveats Potential Pitfalls It possible gut microbita two group show either taxonomic difference difference putative metabolic enzyme profile . Nevertheless , assume least one two arm yield positive product , since polycystic ovary share character metabolic syndrome , amply documented portray distinct microbial population profile comparison healthy individual . Specific Aim II : Can carbohydrate-poor diet physical activity induce change gut microbial population woman PCOS ? A change diet know many year favorably affect ovulatory function patient PCOS , well alleviate associate cosmetic concern . Most significantly , carbohydrate element diet central change , alongside addition physical activity . We prescribe carbohydrate-poor diet ( append table ) study group concomitant physical activity program ( 45 minute brisk walk , 4-5 time week ) . After two month change lifestyle repeat hormonal metabolic profile , well obtain second stool sample . A secondary interest would examine whether exists difference microbiome woman would succeed diet would , whether initial bacterial population profile result diet .</detailed_description>
