	<brief_summary>The purpose study give understand level physical activity , occurrence fatigue quality life amongst multiple myeloma survivor local set . As multiple myeloma survival improve , vital focus intervention help maximize QOL . A positive correlation may suggest exercise intervention . The hypothesis multiple myeloma survivor perform low level physical activity . Higher level physical activity associate high level QOL low fatigue level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Level Physical Activity Its Associations With Fatigue Quality Life Multiple Myeloma Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma associate treatment often result persistent symptom fatigue , pain , neuropathy diminish functional performance affect survivor 's quality life ( QOL ) . And survival multiple myeloma continue improve , physical activity may supportive therapy help address multitude QOL concern . Physical activity modifiable behavior , propose important non-pharmacologic intervention improve health-related outcome among cancer survivor . The American College Sports Medicine examine evidence impact physical activity cancer survivor , conclude physical activity safe cancer patient , cancer treatment , may lead improved physical functioning , decrease physical fatigue , improve QOL number cancer survivor group , include hematopoietic malignancy . While small number study suggest exercise may reap benefit QOL fatigue multiple myeloma survivor , none conduct local context.Given limit evidence , primary objective preliminary study estimate prevalence physical activity among local sample multiple myeloma survivor , investigate association report fatigue quality life .</detailed_description>
