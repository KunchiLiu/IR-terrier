	<brief_summary>Radiographs use aid dentist detect presence cavity deciduous teeth child . This procedure globally recommend conventional clinical examination usually overlooks cavity . However , real benefit perform dental radiograph purpose still unclear . Besides hazard ionize radiation , radiograph could provoke overtreatment child ; hence , dentist would tend restore teeth would really necessary . Nowadays , preferable overlook cavity treat teeth unnecessarily . Therefore , investigator aim perform study compare two different strategy detect cavity deciduous teeth child : one base clinical examination perform alone use radiographs adjunct clinical examination . To compare strategy , investigator consider outcomes related child 's health welfare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Radiographic Examination Diagnosis Treatment Decision Caries Lesions Primary Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite clinical guideline throughout world indicate clinician take two bitewing detect caries lesion primary molar asymptomatic child , evidence recommendation base cross-sectional study perform laboratorial set use convenience sample . The benefit impact perform radiographs diagnosis treatment decision caries lesion primary teeth , consider relevant outcome patient , evaluate yet . Thus , aim study evaluate impact perform radiographic examination detect caries lesion primary teeth compare visual inspection perform alone , consider different outcome relate validity child 's health welfare . For , three different study carry accord follow specific aim : ( 1 ) evaluate validity radiographic examination adjunct visual inspection detect proximal caries lesion primary molar child low high caries experience cross-sectional design ; ( 2 ) evaluate impact radiographic examination adjunct visual inspection diagnostic treatment decision caries lesion primary teeth study ; ( 3 ) evaluate impact radiographic examination adjunct visual inspection detect caries lesion primary teeth operative need follow-ups impact oral health quality life randomize clinical trial . To reach objective , 250 child age 3 6 year look dental treatment dental school randomly allocate two group accord diagnostic strategy use caries detection : visual inspection perform alone ( control group ) visual inspection associate radiographic examination ( experimental group ) . After elaboration treatment decision plan two examiner , child treat followed-up 2 year , evaluation 12 24 month ingress child study . The primary outcome number dental surface dental treatment need follow-up , consider aim ( 3 ) . Then , child allocate control group reevaluate use radiographic examination , performance two strategy detect proximal caries lesion evaluate , use temporary separation orthodontic rubber one week reference standard method . Moreover , new treatment plan perform compare treatment plan base visual inspection alone . These two part research carry reach aim ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , respectively . Our work hypothesis radiographic examination would actually exert little influence outcomes related validity child 's health welfare , visual inspection would enough diagnostic strategy caries detection primary teeth .</detailed_description>
