	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer 4th cause cancer relate death USA many Western Countries . The incidence disease almost corresponding mortality rate . For reason pancreatic cancer consider global lethal disease . Even treatment improve , resection rate patient suffer ductal adenocarcinoma remain around 30 % 5 year survival rate 20 % . Because low incidence pancreatic cancer general population , population-based screening cost/effective . Anyway last two decade , data literature demonstrate pancreatic cancer phenotypic expression know genetic syndrome existence familial risk develop pancreatic cancer . In particular last condition , call familial pancreatic cancer ( FPC ) , increase risk associate number family member affect . In prospective epidemiological study , demonstrate positive family history pancreatic cancer present 10 % consecutive probands . The identification population risk , suggestion early surgical treatment pancreatic cancer improve prognosis , particular , identification pre-neoplastic lesion PanIN IPMN associate natural history FPC , contribute development National International guideline surveillance individual increase risk . Even , today , consensus reach inclusion criterion clinical surveillance program , screen modality target lesion . Traditionally individual 10 fold relative risk develop pancreatic cancer consider suitable screen program . However , recently , CAPS group suggest include surveillance program individual 5 fold high relative risk . Early pancreatic cancer , IPMN PanIN lesion consider target lesion clinical screening , however concrete possibility detect PanIN lesion surveillance program remain debatable uncertain.The image modality technique use exist program , alone combination , magnetic resonance ( MR ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , endoscopic retrograde cholagiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Anyway tendency use low aggressive modality MR EUS emerge recent recommendation . The result clinical study quite uncertain difficult compare due different screen modality inclusion criterion . The yield FPC screen program publish literature range 50 1.3 % . The cost/effectiveness surveillance program FPC already demonstrate . The aim study analyze preliminary result prospective clinical surveillance program individual risk pancreatic cancer use low aggressive , MR base , screen . Patients enrollment Patients increase `` genetic '' risk develop pancreatic cancer enrol MR surveillance program Karolinska University Hospital . The patient enrol study 3 different way : relative probands treat pancreas cancer karolinska University Hospital positive family history pancreatic cancer positive anamnesis associate genetic syndrome , subject , `` genetically '' increase risk , refer u swedish center , subject refer u general partitioners . Inclusion criterion screen All individual 10 fold high relative risk respect general population develop pancreatic cancer include study . In case suspect know genetic syndrome , patient detect correspond gene mutation enrol . Screening modality All patient fulfil inclusion criterion enrol clinical study specific inform consent . Basically complete familial personal anamensis ( include pedegree ) clinical examination obtain patient . A blood sample collect bio-bank Karolinska University Hospital . An MR/MRCP secretin perform patient . If result MR negative ( finding detect ) one year screening , modality recommend . Only patient anomaly MR undergo EUS without FNA and/or MDCT scan . Patients positive anamnesis suggestive know genetic syndrome offer specific genetic test ( BRCA1/2 , SPINK1 , PRSS1 , p16 , STK11 ) respective genetic counselling . Target lesion screen Due low specificity sensibility available technique order detect PanIN lesion , lobulocentric atrophy area consider target screen . Macroscopic pre-neoplastic lesion ( IPMN ) pancreatic solid mass consider lesion suitable detection screening .</detailed_description>
