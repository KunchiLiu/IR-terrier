	<brief_summary>Though Disruptive Disorders Childhood Adolescence major source morbidity fill large proportion special education slot , specific pharmacologic treatment available child Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder . Other disruptive child usually say `` '' Oppositional Defiant Conduct Disorder . These diagnosis useful descriptively specific treatment implication In course treat adolescent explosive temper severe mood swing Depakote ( divalproex sodium ) , investigator learn young child manifest symptom seem identical constituting adolescent disorder . They special education program respond psychostimulants . The investigator systematically collect data child use screen criterion study adolescent . Since Depakote use treat seizure child twenty year , great deal know safety profile pediatric population . The investigator treat 7 child , age 7-12 , whose recurrent temper outbursts chronic mood lability respond individual/family therapy . After parent sign informed consent child give assent , subject would receive open label Depakote dose sufficient reach blood level 50-100 micrograms/ml six week . The family receive supportive therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depakote ( Divalproex Sodium ) Children With Temper Dysregulation Severe Mood Swings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis test whether child age thirteen symptom cluster target protocol ( explosive temper outburst severe mood swing , Explosive Mood Disorder ) show response open label Depakote adolescent show . An addition protocol see hypothesis hold double blind placebo control condition . The investigator complete open treatment six child find criterion select treatment responsive group adolescent adult also work five six child . The investigator propose test finding double blind condition . There change overall safety profile treatment . The change addition placebo phase . All child receive active treatment point . In addition , investigator hypothesize clinical syndrome temper irritability tend resolve development family exhibit bipolarity first degree relative exhibit temper outburst . This hypothesis study follow-up study . Data Summary OPEN TRIAL Patient Age Dose Acute Outcome Long Term Outcome 1. age 10 1000mgs Good Excellent 2 . 12 1000mgs Fair-good Poor ( non-compliant 3 . 10 1000mgs Excellent Good 4 . 9 1000mgs Excellent Very good 5 . 12 1000mgs Poor Poor 6 . 7 500mgs Excellent Good-excellent 7 11 500 mg Dropped 3 week ; never take med Poor BACKGROUND The disruptive disorder childhood adolescence conduct , oppositional-defiant , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Of , latter specific pharmacologic treatment . The two reliably describe problem behavior special education class , chemical dependency unit family court treatment implication . In previous communication , investigator describe adolescent subject temper outburst severe mood swing . The investigator label syndrome Explosive Mood Disorder ( EMD ) draft tentative criterion temper outburst irritable mood swing ( see Inclusion Criteria EMD ) . The goal study demonstrate Depakote help certain type problem child , one whose disruptiveness associate mood dysregulation . The investigator hypothesize subject ' mood dysregulation aggressive disinhibition `` limbic '' pathology . The limbic system heavily implicate behavior emotion , work previous investigator suggest episodic dyscontrol result limbic irritability . Since carbamazapine valproic acid use limbic seizure bipolar spectrum disorder , investigator predict subject would improve divalproex sodium ( Depakote ) , enteric coat form valproic acid . The investigator treat thirteen patient meet criterion criterion open label divalproex sodium . In case , strikingly beneficial result , include sharp decline frequency severity temper outburst severity mood swing . The typical patient would progress irritation screaming , door-slamming , property destruction fight explosively , i.e. , without intermediate step . When explode , patient 's affect frustration tolerance would fluctuate throughout day . The mood could irritable , normal silly always unpredictable . The patient chronic interpersonal difficulty , especially authority figure , thus serious problem family , school work common . They tend end deviant peer , since others could tolerate unpredictable interaction . Though patient meet criterion Conduct Oppositional Defiant Disorder , diagnose heterogeneous describe Depakote responder . Cyclothymia Bipolar II Disorder capture chronic , maladaptive interaction peer authority figure . Intermittent Explosive Disorder miss plus connection mood dysregulation . Borderline Personality imply specific type interpersonal pathology ( idealization , devaluation , manipulation ) necessarily present . The close match investigator find literature patient `` Emotionally Unstable Character Disorder '' ( EUCD ) . This diagnosis describe young adult extreme irritability , mood swing , chronic maladaptive behavior , clear response mood stabilize agent ( lithium carbonate ) . However , even diagnosis capture explosiveness prominent sample Depakote responder . The investigator therefore decide use term Explosive Mood Disorder ( EMD ) capture temper outburst mood lability . Campbell report hospitalized conduct disorder child affective ( opposed predatory ) aggression improvement lithium Findling report similar finding similar outpatient treat risperidone . The key feature irritable mood swing directly address study . In addition , study childhood aggression Autism , Tourette Syndrome , Bipolar Disorder mental deficiency suggest role risperidone . Nonetheless , still clear alternative pharmacological treatment temper drive irritable mood swing available . The investigator treat ten subject meet screen criterion EMD open label Depakote 1000mgs . Baseline evaluation include full medical psychiatric interview , Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Psychiatry-III-R record total number explosion previous week thirty day . The latter estimate obtain many source possible . At minimum , patient one parent give estimate . As many source possible also ask estimate lability patient 's mood previous week thirty day . Each week information would obtain previous week global assessment make whether patient unimproved , minimally improve , much improve much improve . Twelve adolescent agree participate , two drop receive adequate trial . The ten adolescent show clear improvement mood number explosion , latter typically decline 90-100 % . All ten adolescent patient judge least much improve psychiatrist , parent patient . These result later replicate double-blind , placebo control condition . Teachers parent approach investigator child age 13 ask u treat . The investigator obtain permission collect open label data youngster . The completion open-label data lead current study .</detailed_description>
