	<brief_summary>This open-label , dose-escalation ( Phase 1a ) expansion ( Phase 1b ) study evaluate safety tolerability KPT-330 determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) patient solid tumor malignancy . The study drug KPT-330 Selinexor work block high level exporter proteins cancer cell tumor suppressor protein ( TSP , proteins help protect cell become cancerous ) growth regulatory protein ( GRP , proteins help control growth cell ) remain nucleus `` activate '' form . The idea use drug blockage export proteins nucleus result stop growth tumor cell . Based mechanism action , KPT-330 new class drug call Selective Inhibitor Nuclear Export ( SINE ) . The purpose research study find information drug : high dose KPT-330 give safely , side effect may cause , examine body affect study drug concentration blood ( call pharmacokinetics PK ) , examine effect study drug body ( call pharmacodynamics PD ) gain information usefulness treating cancer . Benefits study include chance disease control patient treatment refractory cancer standard treatment available . Common side effect ( 35-73 % ) humans mostly mild reversible . These include nausea , loss appetite , fatigue , vomit weight loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study KPT330 Asian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , phase 1a ( dose escalation ) 1b ( dos expansion ) study evaluate safety tolerability oral Selinexor Asian patient advance solid malignancy . After initial screen visit registration study , patient assign 3 different schedule , start dose 50 mg/m2 ( Schedule 1 ) give weekly ; 40 mg/m2 ( Schedule 2 ) twice weekly dosing schedule three time week 20mg/m2 ( Schedule 3 ) dosing schedule choose study . For Schedule 2 , drug administration occur twice weekly , day 1 3 first two week ( e.g . Monday Wednesday Tuesday Thursday ) Schedule 3 , drug administration occur three time week day 1 , 3 5 ( ie : Monday , Wednesday Friday ) . For Schedule 1 , one cycle 4 week 4 dos Selinexor . In Schedule 2 , one cycle 3 week 4 dos Selinexor . In Schedule 3 , one cycle 4 week 12 dos Selinexor . Dose escalate use 3+3 design . Patients difficulty tolerate treatment ( e.g. , due anorexia , nausea , fatigue ) dose level may dose reduce 4-10 mg/m ( 2 ) increment lowest dose 11 mg/m ( 2 ) . Aggressive use supportive medication often sufficient mitigate eliminate tolerability problems.Supportive care include antinausea/ anti-emetic therapy , acid suppression ( H2-blockers and/or proton pump inhibitor ) , glucocorticoid , anti-diarrheal therapy , standard treatment may administer per institutional guideline prophylactically symptomatic patient . A 3+3 design use dose escalation . A minimum 3 patient enrol per cohort . Once 3 patient enrol cohort complete least six day dose target dose , 3 additional patient may add cohort . After 6 patient accrue dose level , dose level close accrual safety assessment 3 6 patient perform safety cohort meet end cycle 1 . If dose level well tolerate 4 week target dose , dose escalation perform next cohort . Dose escalation 3+3 design proceed follow : - At least 3 patient enter cohort . Once 3 patient enrol cohort complete least six day dose target dose , 3 additional patient may add cohort . - If none patient cohort experience DLT 4 week target dose , dose escalation continue per protocol design - If one patient experience first cycle DLT , three additional patient add cohort ( maximum 6 evaluated cohort ) additional patient experience DLT ( i.e . 1 6 patient cohort experience DLT ) , dose escalation per protocol allow . - If DLT observe 2 subject cohort 3 6 subject dose level , low dose level test , additional 3 subject enrol low dose level . - If , follow dose escalation , 2 patient cohort experience first cycle DLT , dose label Maximally Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) RP2D previous dose &lt; = 1/6 patient experienced DLT . If 3 subject treat previous low dose level , additional 3 subject also recruit total 6 subject dose level . - However additional cohort patient may enrol dose MTD dose . If dose level 3 reach criterion determine MTD meet , dose escalation dose level may occur discussion investigator , Karyopharm PI.If one patient cohort develop DLT Cycle 1 , least 5 additional patient enrol dose level . If additional DLTs dose level , dos escalate 30-40 % subsequent cohort include &gt; =3 patient . If one DLT occur first 3 patient enrolled cohort , additional 3 patient enrol . If another DLT occur dose level ( i.e. , 2 DLTs/6 patient ) , dose consider MTD , RP2D define dose level dose , provide dose level &lt; =25 % low high ( intolerable ) dose test . This protocol design guide maximal escalation , ensure patient safety . In order achieve , safety cohort review meeting investigator , Karyopharm , PI , decision make dose escalation scheme . The recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) define next low dose level MTD . The MTD dose level &gt; 1 3 patient &gt; = 2 6 patient experience DLT , provide dose level &lt; =25 % low high ( intolerable ) dose test . If project RP2D &gt; 25 % low high dose test , additional cohort &gt; =3 patient add dose intermediate intolerable dose next low dose . Once RP2D reach , approximately 60 patient may enrol Dose Expansion cohort . The dose schedule Dose Expansion Phase Dose Escalation Phase . There maximum duration participation patient enrol study . However anticipated patient remain study prolong period , Extension study protocol make available near future.The dose use expansion phase study RP2D ( low dos ) determine dose escalation phase study .</detailed_description>
