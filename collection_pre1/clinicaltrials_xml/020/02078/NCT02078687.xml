	<detailed_description>Project background : The study base follow-up cohort preterm infant bear week 32 , discharge neonatal department randomize protein supplement breastfeed discharge . If preterm child breastfed , receive premature infant formula discharge . Since three group prematures , feed differently discharge , useful follow 6 year age specifically examine follow area : Metabolic syndrome : Unlike past , survival rate preterm infant high . Most expected survive . The question extent child increase morbidity compare child born term , quality life affect fact bear prematurely . There previously show link child bear SGA later development type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disaster . Too rapid catch-up growth also increase possible risk develop metabolic syndrome mature child . The question whether also case child bear prematurely whether risk . The problem want provide adequate amino acid protein synthesis , approach growth peer fetuses also ensure development brain essential fatty acid , maybe tolerate rapid `` catch-up '' - growth . A study compare preterm born child age 4-10 year mature child bear age find group preterm birth increase systolic diastolic blood pressure high insulin level . This true regardless whether child bear SGA AGA birth . This conclude metabolic abnormality preterm similar find child born term SGA . The article mention concept `` fetal programming '' . This cover hypothesis suggest fetus risk uterus adapt best survive , adjustment permanent . The team publish article , find impaired insulin sensitivity preterm infant ( SGA AGA ) compare mature AGA child . Insulin sensitivity great mature AGA . Next come mature SGA eventually premature . To show importance area , point diabetes mellitus type 2 , 35 % low birth weight . In try find way interesting , relevant , see diet first month life impact metabolic complication later life . Allergy : It unknown whether preterms increase risk develop allergic symptom . Breastfeeding reduces risk develop allergic disease , cow milk-based infant formula increase risk . The preterm infant study complete hospitalization fortifier contain cow 's milk protein , preterm infant formula cow milk base . It therefore interesting see increase incidence allergic symptoms one group . An article form basis study two group child , one group consist child birth weight less 1500 g , second group consist child birth weight 2500 g , describe difference incidence atopy . Another study study incidence food allergy area 13,980 child , find 4.23 % diagnosed age six . There difference incidence categorization GA . The first study mention study also appearance wheezing . This do use spirometry . The result lifetime risk preterm birth 43 % develop wheezing , 17 % mature birth . Besides wheeze low GA birth associate decreased lung capacity , reduce force vital capacity ( FVC ) force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) asthma . A relevant question whether child develop respiratory symptom solely basis born preterm nutritional type influence risk development . Growth catch-up : Some study gradually study prematurely born child 's growth compare control child - especially first period discharge neonatal unit . As know , human milk best composition relation child 's need . There make study nutrition preterms human milk fortify human milk state get pure milk , great risk malnutrition discharge good strategy provide breast milk multinutrient enrichment . In study mother milk half daily quantity enrichment . Though , request long-term study determine long-term effect . Other study follow prematurely born child 20 year age 11 year age compare control group normal weight , preterm birth . Outcome height , weight , BMI . In one case also head circumference . One study conclude low birthweight child ( VLBW ) small control group . In particular SGA boys small . The second study conclude extremely immature child poor growth early childhood , catch-up 11 year age . All prematures remain less control group . A comparison nutrition discharge follow-up beyond 1 year age interest able optimize nutrition growth extremely premature infant , AGA SGA . A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan study reveals body composition bone , muscle fat . A study whether scan use detect body composition , conclude DEXA good tool . It quick ( minute ) survey provide minimal radiation , interesting scan 3 group project elucidate whether difference body composition thus whether nutritional type provide good basis best growth . The study , build RCT ( randomize control trial ) 33 child GA le 35 week birth weight 1,750 gram receive either 1 ) standard replacement 2 ) enrich compensation 2 month discharge , find difference body composition weight gain . It call large study longer follow-up . Another study , PhD project , divide child several group depend Nutrition ( 1 : enrich substitute 2 : standard replacement 3 : human breast milk ) , find DEXA scan 6 month age , group 1 low fat mass group 3 low lean ( muscle ) mass high fat mass . So , difference body composition depend nutrition . It may sound logical , affect child later life ? - , way ? From example previous study , one conclude optimal nutrition preterms development continue lack clarification preterm infant grow discharge whether one type nutrition well . Hypotheses : - Nutrition discharge affect premature child 's growth first year life . - Catch-up growth proceeds 1 year age . - The growth pattern prematures bear SGA different prematures bear AGA . - There increase allergy prematures , fed premature formula enrich mother milk discharge compare mother milk without enrichment . - Premature child feed preterm formula extend risk develop metabolic syndrome basis excessive growth first month life . - It possible premature SGA child great risk develop metabolic syndrome basis excessive growth first month life . - Fat mass lean mass vary among prematures depend nutrition first month discharge . Purpose project : 1 . Investigate whether long-term effect growth cessation enrichment breast milk 2 , 3 6 year age . 2 . Examine relationship protein intake 4 month age ( correct ) blood pressure , HbA1c serum cholesterol 6 year age . 3 . Uncover incidence allergy symptom eye nose , skin , stomach / intestinal respiratory tract incl affect lung function child bear prematurely . 4 . Elucidate whether increase risk metabolic syndrome child bear prematurely nourished different way . 5 . Investigate whether preterms different fat distribution nutrition 4 month correct age affect . 6 . Illuminate catch-up growth child bear prematurely 6 year age . Planned study : 1 . Weight , height , head circumference , blood pressure 2 . Registration allergy symptom airway symptom . 3 . Blood test diabetes , screen metabolic syndrome allergy . 4 . Questionaires investigate allergy symptom . 5 . A dexa scan see body composition fat , muscle bone . Randomization : The child randomize could eat ( breast bottle ) gestational age 34-42 . Twins triplet randomly assign group . At randomization impartial person department child hospitalize , pull envelope information kind nutrition , child discharge 4 month correct age . Statistics : Originally , strength calculation prior randomization project . This show need 85 child feed group . A total 320 child original project enrol . However , waiver 1 year age , 278 child remain follow-up . Wilcoxon rank-sum test t-test continuous variable , categorical variable chi2test use compare nutritional group . Multiple logistic regression model use compare clinical relevant variable possible influence growth various dietary group . Growth analyze Z-score delta z-score calculate relevant reference compare nutritional group growth . Allergy risk metabolic syndrome calculate use method odds ratio . Project Period : From 2004 - 2008 form three group preterm child clinical randomization . A Ph.D. dissertation make subsequently deal preterm growth 1 year age , nutrition composition breast milk mother preterm baby . Between age 2 3 year , child come control follow-up Ph.D . The child become 6 year July 2010 - 2014 , also invite follow-up check current Ph.D. project . The child follow respective department / hospital Kolding , Skejby , Holb√¶k Odense . Ethical consideration : For inclusion randomize control study parent sign acceptance include follow-up 6 year age . The initial randomized control study approve Ethics Committee 1 July 2004 ( J. Nr.VF20030208 ) . As part 6-year follow-up , add approve Protocol 1-8 . In addition , permission Data Inspectorate original project change 2007 ( J . No 2007-41-1349 ) extend 2016 .</detailed_description>
