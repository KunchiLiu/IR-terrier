	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia occur nearly 20 % laparotomy incision account almost 400,000 ventral hernia repair annually United States . There even high incidence incisional hernia recurrence prior repair patient obese . Each subsequent hernia repair lead increase morbidity durability . It infrequent many surgeon advise overweight obese patient lose substantial weight prior complex incisional hernia repair . However , quite difficult individual lose 8 pound month safe , rapid , sustainable fashion . This base losing 2 lb . per week utilize diet exercise alone . Many patient incisional hernia physically debilitate engage substantial physical activity lose weight . Traditional laparoscopic bariatric surgery ( i.e . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) SG ) , feasible , technically challenge endeavor since prior abdominal surgery increase amount intra-abdominal adhesion . Furthermore , still subset patient candidate laparoscopic weight loss surgery inability tolerate pneumoperitoneum due underlie physiologic dysfunction . - Novel minimally invasive endoscopic technique may help obese patient incisional hernia lose weight safe rapid fashion . Early case report small case series gastric bypass revision utilize endoscopic technique show promise efficacious weight loss . There report achieve nearly 20-25 % excess weight loss . Abu Dayyeh colleague also demonstrate endoscopic gastric plication primary weight loss procedure feasible , report follow-up 3 months.8 Brethauer , et al . Cleveland Clinic perform transoral gastric volume reduction weight management 18 patient ( TRIM TRIAL ) . They utilize Restore Suturing System ( Restore device ) report mean decrease BMI -4.0 ± 3.5 kg/m2 . Mean excess weight loss 27.7 % ± 21.9 % report adverse events.9 There also report weight loss improve insulin sensitivity secretion.10 Laparoscopic gastric great curvature plication afford mean 50.7 % excess weight loss 12 months.11 The intent study demonstrate endoscopic suture primary option weight-loss surgery . Preliminary report show procedure technically feasible durable effect procedure vary widely among study participants.12 The investigator view technology bridge morbidly obese patient , need subsequent surgery another surgical disease , improve body habitus decrease postoperative morbidity mortality . The aims investigator study : - Feasibility endoscopic gastric sleeve plication - Define technical aspect endoscopic suture sleeve plication - Provide long-term follow-up weight loss resolution co-morbidities - Time endoscopic procedure incisional hernia repair - Photographic evidence stomach endoscopic plication incisional hernia repair There several advantage propose study . First avoid enter intra-abdominal cavity . Second , procedure perform solely suture obviate need staple may increase risk gastric leak staple line.13 Lastly , avoid place endoscopic intra-luminal device intragastric balloon duodenal-jejunal sleeve . Limiting factor device high rate premature device withdrawal due intolerance . Furthermore , effect short-lived device need remove 12 week offer mean 23.6 % excess weight loss.13 , 14 The implication study far-reaching . Once efficacy demonstrate enough weight loss achieve patient safely quickly undergo incisional hernia surgery , investigator conduct retrospective case-control cross-matched study delineate true benefit . If true benefit , randomize control study employ future .</brief_summary>
