	<brief_summary>When patient undergo vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , often make embryos safe transfer back womb . These excess embryo frozen store future use . Frozen embryo transfer ( FET ) therefore important option IVF extra embryo . FET take place ideal condition uterine receptivity uterine endometrial lining thickness appropriate developmental stage embryo . A common way prepare uterus FET use medication ( Estrogen Progesterone ) imitate normal menstrual cycle monitor endometrial lining development transvaginal ultrasound . Progesterone ( P4 ) may administer vaginally intra-muscularly ( IM ) . The mode Progesterone administration base upon local convention , expert ' opinion patient ' preference . All mentioned modality common daily practice IVF clinic across world . The current medical literature present high quality evidence superiority one form Progesterone administration FET . The investigator know fresh embryo transfer cycle natural follicle continue function produce Progesterone corpus lutea , report difference pregnancy rate luteal vaginal P4 compare IM P4 support , investigator reassurance regard frozen embryo transfer . The aim study compare vaginal versus IM route administration P4 FET cycle well-designed trial . Since many outcome variable possible , investigator choose concentrate one might shed light possible biological difference two mode Progesterone administration ; uterine contraction . Uterine contraction previously recognize possible factor compromise success rate patient undergo IVF treatment . Progesterone consider uterine relaxant level blood versus level uterus differ mode administration : blood level higher give IM whereas uterine P4 concentration higher give vaginally . The investigator interested see whether IM progesterone frozen embryo transfer present different uterine contraction pattern vaginal administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterine Contractions Mode Progesterone Frozen Embryo Transfer ( FET ) Cycles : Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize un-blinded clinical trial compare uterine contraction frequency FET cycle two medicated protocol uterine line programming . This study involve new medication , mode administration , merely design array evaluation two exist well-established protocol . Women undergo Frozen embryo transfer ( FET ) blastocyst stage Toronto Centre Advanced Reproductive Technologies ( TCART ) approach take part study . Pre-study Screening Baseline Evaluation : Study subject recruit voluntarily TCART clinic . The attend physician screen identify potential female patient undergo vitro fertilization ( IVF ) blastocyst FET cycle . The staff physician explain general rational . The protocol study explanation well actual recruitment perform nurse fellow part treat team . If patient give consent , randomize ( computer generate block randomization ) one treatment group ( vaginal P4 IM P4 ) . FET medicate cycle protocol include ten day Estrace ( micronized 17b-estradiol ) start day 3 cycle dose 4 mg daily 5 day follow 8 mg daily 5 day . Routine monitoring take place 10th treatment day - cycle day 13 - involve longitudinal scan uterine cavity endometrial thickness pattern . This study visit routine one part investigator standard care . The study patient ' monitor include one additional measurement ( uterine contraction frequency count number contraction per minute ) . After achieve sufficient endometrial proliferation ( â‰¥7 mm thickness triple layer pattern ) estrogen exposure , patient start progesterone use . Patients randomize vaginal progesterone arm start treatment 200mg P4 suppository 3 time day . Patients randomize IM progesterone arm start treatment 50mg P4 IM injection daily . Blastocyst transfer perform 6th day P4 exposure . Standard care subject change study . The usual management though include repeat Ultrasound image day transfer : purpose study , ultrasound monitoring perform embryo transfer document endometrial thickness , endometrial pattern endometrial contractility ( wave ) count number contraction per minute . For uniformity measurement purpose objectivity , monitoring perform TCART 2 highly qualify ultrasound technician involve patient management blind route P4 administration . Routine management follow embryo transfer procedure : patient continue Estrace Progesterone . All patient ( study control ) resume vaginal progesterone ( 200mg P4 suppository 3 time day ) .</detailed_description>
