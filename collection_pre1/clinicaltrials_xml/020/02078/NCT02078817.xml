	<brief_title>Ketamine Adolescents With Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression frequently emerge adolescence associate severe outcome . Current intervention lead remission many adolescent . Treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) adolescence ominous prognostic indicator lifetime suffer increase risk suicide . Efforts direct toward novel intervention could alter perilous course . Theoretically , restoration healthy development critical window would substantially improve outcomes lifespan . Ketamine noncompetitive , high-affinity antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor long used induction maintenance anesthesia child adult , recently investigate rapid antidepressant effect . Randomized , double-blind , saline-controlled trial adult TRD demonstrate single , subanesthetic infusion intravenous ( IV ) ketamine 0.5 mg/kg 40 minute produce rapid ( within 2 hour ) antidepressant response ( Ibrahim et al. , 2011 ; Zarate et al. , 2006 ) . Recent evidence suggest serial dos ketamine may even effective may lead prolonged remission ( aan het Rot et al. , 2010 ; Murrough et al. , 2012 ) . Our current research use serial dose IV ketamine among adult veteran TRD 2-week period show promising result , response rate 92 % among 12 participant date . No result study examine effectiveness either single-dose serial-dose ketamine yet publish adolescent TRD . Because ongoing neurodevelopment adolescence , think confer enhanced neuroplasticity , possible adolescent TRD could show great response sustain remission adult TRD . The biological mechanism depression impact ketamine uncover adult ( Zarate et al. , 2013 ) . Characterization neural mechanism underlie ketamine response non-response adolescent TRD represent significant advance . The specific aim preliminary study follow : Aim # 1 : To determine efficacy repeated-dose subanesthetic IV ketamine among adolescent patient TRD . Hypothesis : Based previous result adult TRD , predict response rate improve course six treatment ketamine . Aim # 2 : To explore durability antidepressant response repeat dose IV ketamine 4-week observational period . Hypothesis : Based inherent neuroplasticity adolescence due ongoing neurodevelopment , adolescent may show durable clinical response see adult . Aim # 3 : To study neurobiological mechanism response ketamine . We examine relevant biological system use several different brain imaging index measure intracellular function peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
