	<brief_summary>This research do learn approach remove Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) patient carrier bacteria outpatient setting among household member sexual partner . MRSA type bacteria germ cause bad infection skin make people sick . The bacteria see high number person Baltimore area hospital throughout country . MRSA spread person person , particularly home among family member sexual partner . There three thing investigator hope learn research study : First , investigator want find way prevent MRSA infection outpatient setting . By ask question , investigator want look thing may increase risk type bacteria family member . Second , investigator soap oral rinse ( Chlorhexidine ) medication ( antibiotic ; Mupiricin ointment ) show effective removing MRSA . The investigator want determine antibiotic soap best use everyone household individual know MRSA . Third , investigator , want learn bacteria look inside . The investigator laboratory test sample collect , learn MRSA bacteria grow , reproduce develops behave differently type MRSA bacteria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) kill patient United States ( U.S. ) Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . Further , person live Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) experience MRSA infection significantly high rate general population ( 12.3/ 1000 person year compare 1 2/1000 person year ) MRSA remain substantial reason hospital admission among patient population . Colonization Staphylococcus aureus major risk factor infection person live HIV AIDS ( PLWHA ) eradication MRSA colonization reduces occurrence subsequent infection patient . Household contact MRSA colonization increase failure rate decolonization . The clinical practice guideline MRSA management Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) recommend provide decolonization person repeat skin soft tissue infection well household contact ; however , guideline report evidence limit support recommendation . Additionally , recommendation include sexual partner outside home mount evidence MRSA transmission sexual partner sexual network . Strategies reduce spread MRSA among people live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) vitally need reduce disparity . To assess colonization prevalence among PLWHA , conduct epidemiologic evaluation MRSA among person within Johns Hopkins University AIDS Service ( JHUAS ) . The study include 500 subject ( 65.8 % male ) along sexual partner 35 subject . The MRSA colonization prevalence 16.8 % among subject 37 % ( 17/35 ) sexual partner ( unpublished data ) . These finding demonstrate exceptional difference colonization prevalence PLWHA compare US population support need research understand decolonization regimen evaluate outcome individual decolonization compare inclusion household and/or sexual partner intervention . We propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) among 100 PLWHA ( 50 per arm ) within JHUAS evaluate individual versus household/sexual partner decolonization intervention . The specific aim propose RCT : 1 . To compare MRSA decolonization protocol colonize individual ( index ) versus index plus household member and/or routine sexual partner ( ) . H0 : Index plus household/sexual partner ( ) decolonization associate low occurrence MRSA colonization 6 month completion decolonization protocol . 2 . To estimate intervention effect size develop intervention fidelity assessment plan scale intervention large multi-city R01 application . 3 . To determine molecular characteristic antimicrobial susceptibility clinical colonize isolates among index patient well household member .</detailed_description>
