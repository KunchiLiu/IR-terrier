	<brief_summary>Many individual cystic fibrosis experience growth failure . The reason clear , inflammation gut patient seem one important reason . Glutathione important normal function intestine lung . Glutathione function decrease inflammation thin mucus . However , cystic fibrosis , glutathione get trap inside cell , travel surface cell perform proper function . Moreover , glutathione show improve nutritional status patient AIDS cancer . Investigators hypothesize supplementation oral glutathione pediatric individual cystic fibrosis could improve growth failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplementation Oral Reduced Glutathione Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) know principally pulmonary consequence . However , individual CF , early manifestation pulmonary , gastro-intestinal . Many child experience growth failure . Chronic gut inflammation also develop . Research also establish lung function score significantly correlate Body Mass Index ( BMI ) weight percentile CF . Therefore , intervention improve gastro-intestinal dimension CF early childhood potential ameliorate course disease life span patient . Both Cochrane Database review recent review commission Cystic Fibrosis Foundation find fair evidence current nutritional guidelines.Therefore , press need treatment CF growth failure effective less invasive current treatment . The discovery CF associate significantly diminish efflux reduce glutathione ( GSH ) cell body offer new perspective pathophysiology disease . GSH play several important role ; among important following : 1 ) primary water-soluble antioxidant ; 2 ) mucolytic capable cleave disulfide bond ; 3 ) regulator immune system function . The relationship redox ratio ( GSH : GSSG ) total glutathione ( GSH+GSSG ) initiation inflammation well establish research literature . GSH also important component epithelial lining fluid intestine , help keep intestinal mucus thin , serve defend intestinal system reactive oxygen specie , keep inflammation check normal circumstance . GSH FDA-approved treatment AIDS-related cachexia . The grow recognition GSH system dysfunction CF , couple establish research literature role GSH gastro-intestinal function weight gain non-CF context , suggest new intervention growth failure early childhood CF patient . Specifically , investigator hypothesize oral glutathione could effectively treat CF growth failure pediatric patient .</detailed_description>
