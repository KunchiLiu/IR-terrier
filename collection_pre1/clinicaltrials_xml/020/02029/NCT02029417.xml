	<brief_title>Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate , Cytarabine , Decitabine Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study complete response rate follow OAG ( omacetaxine mepesuccinate , cytarabine ) newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia patient unfit intensive induction therapy . II . To assess toxicity OAG use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study disease-free overall survival OAG decitabine newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia patient unfit intensive induction therapy . OUTLINE : INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cytarabine subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID day 1-14 . Treatment induction therapy repeat every 28 day 4 course patient achieve complete response ( CR ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients alternate course decitabine OAG . Patients receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) day 1-5 . Patients alternate OAG course , comprise cytarabine SC BID day 1-7 omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
