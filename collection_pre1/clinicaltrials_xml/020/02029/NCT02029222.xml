	<brief_summary>Patients lung cancer may develop second primary tumor recurrent disease previous radiotherapy . Surgical salvage therapy mainstay therapeutic option . However , case irresectable disease , re-irradiation consider . Also postoperative setting , re-irradiation consider surgical salvage case feature pathology specimen indicate high risk subsequent recurrence . However re-irradiation , high risk 43 % grade 3 ( late ) toxicity 5 year ( include possible fatal complication ) relatively low chance locoregional control 50 % 5 year . One three patient survive re-irradiation without recurrence severe complication . Improvements risk radiation-induced complication oncological outcome thus warrant . Compared conventional radiotherapy photon ( CRT ) , particle therapy ( PT ) potential inflict maximum damage tumor minimum collateral damage neighbor healthy tissue . Given cost particle therapy ( PT ) considerably high conventional radiotherapy ( RT ) photon , necessary establish whether high cost worthwhile light expect advantage . Thus , clear evidence situation PT outperform conventional photon treatment need . Publications topic rare . The recent publication analyze result 37 NSCLC patient 9 re-irradiated least 50 Gy use helical tomotherapy [ Kruser press ] . We propose silico trial investigate extend proton 12C-ion therapy decrease amount irradiate normal tissue lung cancer patient treat radiotherapy initial radiotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For silico planning study treatment plan perform center already operate experience treatment planning . Photon treatment plan carry Maastricht , proton treatment plan University Pennsylvania C-ion treatment plan University Wisconsin . A dataset state-of-the-art image data available . 25 patient include accord a-priori define selection criterion . Each patient function control . For reason , number patient per tumor group limit 25 patient per tumor group ( power = 80 % , alpha = 5 % ) . The datasets store secure website host MAASTRO . High quality CT-images use radiotherapy treatment planning . If available , secondary image information FDG-PET MRI use GTV delineation . All relevant OARs delineate primary secondary studyset . GTV/CTV use accordingly actual treatment . New DVH 's calculate add OAR . Dose restriction re-irradiation plan define individual patient base DVH dose primary photon treatment plan . Photons plan direct Aperture Optimized Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . Protons plan use active beam delivery Intensity Modulated proton therapy ( IMPT ) carbon-ions pencil beam delivery treatment planning technique gantry . Each participate center use treatment planning system accord standard practice center . The GTV PTV margin determine individual institute accord treatment technique treatment modality . The tumor dose , overall treatment time ( OTT ) equal number fraction use treatment modality . Photon , proton C-ion treatment compare base dosimetric parameter normal tissue . In addition , NTCP fix tumor dose expect TCP determine . Cobalt Gy equivalent dos use report proton carbon-ion dose . In case proton , constant RBE value 1.1 used tumor normal tissue . The RBE carbon-ions calculate base model use participate center . Dose follow structure take account : - Lungs - Spinal court - Heart - Oesophagus</detailed_description>
