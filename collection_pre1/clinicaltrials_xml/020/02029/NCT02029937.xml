	<brief_summary>The overall objective multicenter trial determine whether use low-cost , high-resolution microendoscope diagnostic upper endoscopy improve efficiency accuracy endoscopic screen esophageal squamous cell neoplasia . This multicenter clinical trial novel technology , miniaturize , low cost ( &lt; $ 3 , 500 ) microscope device use upper endoscopy image gastrointestinal epithelium . This high-resolution microendoscope ( HRME ) develop collaborator RICE University provide &gt; 1000X magnified image esophageal mucosa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our central hypothesis HRME improve efficiency clinical impact endoscopic screen surveillance esophageal squamous cell neoplasia provide in-vivo optical biopsy comparable standard histology . Specifically , HRME allow detailed evaluation Lugol 's abnormal area , allow selective biopsy removal neoplastic mucosa . We hypothesize improve accuracy diagnostic yield mucosal sample . We also hypothesize HRME provide additional , accurate information regard presence neoplasia impact upon physician 's decision obtain mucosal biopsy perform endoscopic therapy ( endoscopic mucosal resection ablation ) . This could potentially minimize number unnecessary biopsy enable physician perform endoscopic therapy time initial examination , rather delay endoscopic treatment another procedure follow pathologic confirmation initial biopsy . Primary Aims : 1 . To compare efficiency HRME + Lugol 's chromoendoscopy ( HRME + LC ) Lugol 's chromoendoscopy alone ( LC ) diagnosis esophageal squamous cell neoplasia . Efficiency define : 1 . Diagnostic Yield : The number neoplastic biopsies/total number biopsy obtain patient receive biopsy . 2 . 'Patients save ' : # patient receive biopsy 3 . Procedure time : Total procedure time HRME-LC arm compare LC arm . 2 . To prospectively determine potential clinical impact HRME + Lugol 's chromoendoscopy ( HRME-LC ) Lugol 's Chromoendoscopy ( LC ) determine HRME change decision perform endoscopic therapy ( endoscopic mucosal resection ablation ) perform mucosal biopsy . 3 . To prospectively compare performance characteristic HRME-LC LC prediction squamous esophageal neoplasia flat mucosa mucosal lesion use histopathology gold standard : ( ) To determine sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value identification neoplasia per biopsy per patient analysis 4 . To determine cost-effectiveness HRME-LC LC alone endoscopic screen surveillance esophageal squamous neoplasia US China .</detailed_description>
