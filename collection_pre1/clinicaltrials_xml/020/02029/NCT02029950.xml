	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose pomalidomide combination chemotherapy treat patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , daunorubicin hydrochloride , etoposide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Pomalidomide may kill cancer cell stop blood flow cancer stimulate white blood cell kill cancer cell . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) pomalidomide may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide After Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pomalidomide give time early lymphocyte recovery follow intensive induction time sequential therapy ( TST ) cytosine arabinoside ( cytarabine ) , daunorubicin ( daunorubicin hydrochloride ) etoposide ( AcDVP-16 ) patient newly diagnose intermediate- poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . II . To evaluate safety , tolerability toxicity pomalidomide give time early lymphocyte recovery follow induction AcDVP-16 chemotherapy adult newly diagnose intermediate- poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia high-risk MDS . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety , tolerability toxicity pomalidomide give continuation therapy follow induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy adult newly diagnose intermediate- poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia high-risk MDS . II . To document response ( complete remission [ CR ] , CR incomplete count recovery [ CRi ] , partial remission [ PR ] ) AcDVP-16 follow pomalidomide time lymphocyte recovery newly diagnose adult intermediate- poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) high-risk MDS , include duration response , disease-free overall survival . III . Correlative pharmacodynamics study : ) characterize effect pomalidomide functional dynamic different lymphocyte subpopulation ( effector T [ Teff ] , regulatory T [ Treg ] , natural killer [ NK ] cell ) impact tumor-associated antigen ( TAA ) -specific T cell immunity give follow induction maintenance ; b ) examine presence minimal residual disease ( MRD ) pomalidomide administration induction continuation therapy ; c ) examine cereblon expression primary leukemia cell diagnosis sort T cell prior pomalidomide treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pomalidomide . INDUCTION : Patients receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 ( patient may otherwise receive idarubicin hydrochloride IV 10-15 minute day 1-3 daunorubicin hydrochloride unavailable ) , etoposide IV 3 hour day 8-10 . At time early lymphocyte recovery ( day +14 ) , patient also receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) 10-21 day . CONSOLIDATION : Patients achieve CR CRi receive cytarabine base treatment discretion treat investigator , possible regimen comprise cytarabine IV continuously day 1-3 , 10-12 daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 , high- medium-dose cytarabine IV every 12 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 1-4 course . CONTINUATION : Patients achieve CR CRi undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant receive pomalidomide PO daily day 1-21 begin 6 week follow blood count recovery . Treatment repeat every 4-6 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
