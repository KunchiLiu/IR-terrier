	<brief_summary>MOST phase II trial conduct adult patient advance solid tumor progression least 1 prior treatment regimen . The study aim ass whether 12-week treatment target therapy select base alteration ( ) detect tumor sufficient stabilize disease compare longer treatment , patient present alteration , regardless primary disease site cancer type . All targeted therapy administer MOST study already obtain marketing authorization ( MA ) evaluate indication define MA . Each patient enrol receive matching target therapy 12 week ( induction treatment ) . At end period : - patient tumor response continue target therapy , - patient progression discontinue target therapy withdrawn study orient towards standard treatment - patient stable disease 12 week randomize order determine continue stop target therapy . About 80 patient treat 5 treatment group open enrollment , group correspond available targeted therapy .</brief_summary>
