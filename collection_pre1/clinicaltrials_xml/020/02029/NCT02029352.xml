	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequently occur nonmelanoma skin cancer Caucasians , represent approximately 80 % case . Incidence rate men woman Netherlands 165 157 per 100,000 person-years respectively still rise 3-10 % annually . In 2009 , lifetime risk develop first histologically confirm BCC men approximately 1 5 ( 21 % ) woman 1 6 ( 18 % ) . A simplified classification BCC include follow three histological subtypes : nodular ( 40,6 ) , superficial ( 30,7 % ) infiltrative BCC ( 28,7 % ) . Superficial BCCs ( sBCCs ) differ subtypes tend appear young age , usually occur trunk often multiple . This subtype fast grow incidence . A characteristic feature BCCs low risk metastasize , though untreated may induce considerable functional cosmetic morbidity locally invasive . Surgery first treatment choice BCC . However due rise incidence extensive workload entail , non-invasive topical treatment often choose sBCC grow epidermis superficial dermis therefore easily accessible topical treatment . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , imiquimod cream 5-fluorouracil cream available topical treatment sBCC however tumour free survival rate equal high tumour free survival rate surgical treatment . Next efficacy , available topical treatment associate local skin reaction treatment site , mainly erythema erosion ( imiquimod cream 5-fluorouracil cream ) pain burn sensation ( PDT ) . This create need additional alternative non-invasive topical treatment . The active constituent green tea promising support anti-BCC-carcinogenesis effect several epidemiological , cell culture animal study . The so-called polyphenols know catechin active constituent green tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) major active catechin . EGCG think cytotoxic effect skin cancer cell availability inhibition cell growth induction apoptosis . It also suggest EGCG play role inactivation β-catenin signalling , important component WNT pathway . Sinecatechins 10 % ointment ( Veregen® ) standardize extract green tea leave specie Camellia sinensis , contain mainly green tea polyphenols , particularly catechin ( 85 % ) . The lead catechin sinecatechins ointment EGCG . It approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) genital wart adult . There clinical trial human subject topical EGCG sBCC yet . With trial first try validate anti-carcinogenic potential topical EGCG human sBCC . We assess effectiveness sinecatechins 10 % ( Veregen® ) versus placebo topical treatment sBCCs .</brief_summary>
