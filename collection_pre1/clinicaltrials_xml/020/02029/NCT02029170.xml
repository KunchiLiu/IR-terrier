	<brief_summary>Unstable ankle fracture commonly treat operatively . After operative reduction fixation fracture , vary rehabilitation regime include non-weightbearing 6 week active range motion exercise removal cast brace , early protect weightbearing rigid cast . Several paper report early weightbearing may decrease ankle stiffness , muscle bone atrophy , aid early return activity . However , early weightbearing may risk displacement fix fracture . Rehabilitation operative treatment ankle fracture still clear . We hypothesize ankle function assess 12 month operation ankle fracture early weightbearing inferior non-weightbearing superior non-weightbearing respect time return normal daily life time full weightbearing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study noninferiority , randomize controlled trial patient present multiple center . The primary outcome measure Olerud-Molander score assess 12 month operation unstable ankle fracture . The Olerud-Molander score compare experimental group ( early weightbearing ) control group ( non-weightbearing ) 12 month follow-up examination . The Olerud-Molander score widely use validate scale ass ankle function ankle fracture . It self-administered patient questionnaire score zero ( totally impair ) 100 ( completely unimpaired ) base nine different item : pain , stiffness , swell , stair climbing , run , jumping , squat , support work/activities daily live . The secondary objective determine whether early weightbearing superior non-weightbearing respect time return normal daily life time full weightbearing . Other objective determine safety assess number participant adverse effect hardware failure , reduction loss , non-union , delay union group . The sample size determine use method appropriate noninferiority trial , assume 90 % power significance level 0.05 . To find whether early weightbearing inferior nonweightbearing operation ankle fracture , 192 patient require 90 % power low limit one-sided 95 % confidence interval difference two treatment noninferiority margin -8 , add 20 % assume drop-out . Determination noninferiority margin base clinical significance . In previous study early weightbearing versus nonweightbearing ankle fracture surgery , Simanski et al . report group show good result Olerud-Molander score ( 87 vs. 79 point ; p=0.25 ) . In group , majority patient reach preinjury level activity . The difference Olerud-Molander score two group 8 point favor early weightbearing . Their study come population similar trial population intervention similar study current trial . We decide noninferiority margin 8 point difference adequate prove noninferiority experiment group ( early weightbearing ) control group ( nonweightbearing ) . If subject discontinue prior completion 12 month , last observation carry forward intent-to-treat analysis . Subjects cross treatment arm , example , patient non-weightbearing group weightbear early , analyze accord initial group allocation intent-to-treat analysis . Additionally , as-treated ( per-protocal ) analysis also conduct patient complete 12 month follow-up protocol assign .</detailed_description>
