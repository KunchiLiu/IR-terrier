	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Rationale : A diagnostic laparoscopy frequently use method confirm diagnosis appendicitis . However recently evidence-based laparoscopic criterion determine appendicitis define . If doubt presence appendicitis appendix usually remove . In single centre prospective pilot study 134 patient investigator able define Laparoscopic APPendicitis ( LAPP ) score . In current study investigator validate LAPP score order decrease negative appendectomy rate 50 % . Eventually score lead decrease morbidity . Objective : To decrease negative appendectomy rate 50 % . Study design : A multicenter prospective validation study Study population : All patient , ≥18 year , operate diagnostic laparoscopy clinical suspicion appendicitis . Sample size calculation , perform statistician/ epidemiologist Trial Coordination Centre , show need analyse 778 patient . Intervention ( applicable ) : Patients operate appendicitis 2008 2009 ( n=843 ) , retrospectively analysed negative appendectomy . This cohort serve control group . In control group intervention give , LAPP score yet define . In 778 prospective analyse patient , LAPP score use diagnostic laparoscopy . With LAPP score investigator intend halve number negative appendectomy . Main study parameters/endpoints : A decrease negative appendectomy rate 9 % 5 % . This decrease lead increase miss appendicitis ( occur within 30 day ) , define require surgical re-intervention appendicitis appendicular infiltrate ultrasound CT-scan . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk implementation LAPP score minimal . In theory , use LAPP score might lead increase risk miss appendicitis . This might lead increase morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Laparoscopic Appendicitis Score ; Multicenter Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE During last decade , laparoscopic approach suspicion appendicitis become common surgical practice . In case appendix look normal guideline Dutch Society Surgeons advice remove . [ 1 ] The morbidity negative appendectomy approximately 6 % also lead additional cost . [ 2 ] However , recently criterion ass appendix laparoscopy publish . In recently perform pilot study investigator define Laparoscopic APPendectomy ( LAPP ) score . [ 3 ] The LAPP score easy applicable score use diagnostic laparoscopy evaluate appendix presence absence 5 laparoscopic criterion appendicitis . In prospective cohort , use LAPP score would lead positive predictive value 99 % negative predictive value 100 % . The goal current study validate LAPP score prospective multicenter validation study . Our hypothesis application LAPP score lead reduction 50 % negative appendectomy compare retrospective cohort center . The investigator choose compare negative appendectomy rate prospective multicenter validation study retrospective control group . The control group consist 843 patient operate 5 center 2008 2009 negative appendectomy rate 9 % . The ideal design would cluster center randomize trial . In case half hospital ask use LAPP score half assess appendix conventional way . The investigator feel feasible , already present LAPP score national congress surgeon . In addition , publication result LAPP study surgeon might already start use LAPP score least evaluate appendix differently . [ 3 ] 2 . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : To reduce negative appendectomy rate 50 % compare retrospective control group . Secondary Objective ( ) : - The percentage miss appendicitis exceed 1 % . - Analyse sensitivity rate . - Cost used material operation . - Cost form histology review pathologist remove appendix 3 . STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort design , multicenter prospective validation study 778 patient suspect appendicitis indication diagnostic laparoscopy . The investigator expect fulfill inclusion within one half year . This cohort compare multicenter historical cohort . Each center control group . 4 . STUDY POPULATION Population ( base ) All patient operate suspicion acute appendicitis . The preoperative work-up standardize study ; therefore investigator stick protocol hospital . The clinical decision operate patient make surgeon call . Only patient undergo ( diagnostic ) laparoscopy include study . A total 778 patient must include . The investigator intend fulfill inclusion within one half year . This duration base prevalence appendicitis Netherlands . Annually , 16.000 appendectomy perform , combination eight participate center , investigator think feasible period . Sample size calculation The sample size calculation perform accord method William D. Dupont Walton D. Plummer ( PS Power Sample Size Calculations ) . For sample size calculation investigator perform retrospective cohort analysis 2008 2009 5 hospital Netherlands ( Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Assen , Nij Smellinghe Ziekenhuis Drachten , Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen , Medisch Centrum Leeuwarden Martini Ziekenhuis Groningen ) . During period 843 patient operated suspicion acute appendicitis diagnostic laparoscopy , 9 % remove appendix turn normal ( appendix sana ) . In order half negative appendectomy rate power 0.8 alpha 0.05 , 544 patient prospective group need . Our previous prospective analysis ( LAPP study ) retrospective data show approximately 15 % include patient another diagnosis ( Crohn 's disease , rupture ovarian cyst etc . ) , additionally investigator expect another 15 % exclusion example clear laparoscopic view appendix ( figure 1 ) . Therefore investigator need 778 patient multicenter prospective validation study . Important mention , sample size calculation take sensitivity rate account , expect sensitivity around 100 % . However , investigator calculate percentage report result section . 5 . TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational product/treatment Use LAPP score . The LAPP score consist 5 question concern criterion appendicitis , 1 question answer 'yes ' appendix remove , question answer 'no ' appendix remove . The five question : - Is perforation and/or necrosis appendix ; - Is appendix thicken ; - Is mesentery appendix thicken ; - Is presence injected vessel serosa appendix ; - Are adhesion around appendix . 5.2 Use co-intervention ( applicable ) Not applicable 5.3 Escape medication ( applicable ) Not applicable . 6 . INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT Not applicable , study concern research medicinal product . 7 . NON-INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 8 . METHODS 8.1 Study parameters/endpoints 8.1.1 Main study parameter/endpoint The main endpoint study reduce negative appendectomy rate 50 % . The gold standard histological examination pathologist . The pathologist considers appendix inflame least ( local ) ulceration infiltration polymorphonuclear neutrophil mucosa submucosa ( endo-appendicitis ) present , either combination transmural inflammation , necrosis , perforation peri-appendicular inflammation . In case inflammation without mucosal ulceration find , contralateral part appendix transverse slice examine . [ 4 ] An appendix consider normal sign inflammation find abnormality find like rare entity carcinoid , adenocarcinoma appendix parasite infection . 8.1.2 Secondary study parameters/endpoints ( applicable ) - The percentage miss appendicitis ; exceed 1 % . In theory LAPP score might lead increase miss appendicitis . This might happen patient early mild appendicitis without 5 laparoscopic criterion appendicitis . The investigator define 'missed appendicitis ' confirm appendicitis appendicular infiltrate CT-scan re-operation ( within 3 month ) . - Cost use material operation . - Cost form histology review pathologist remove appendix . 8.1.3 Other study parameter ( applicable ) Not applicable 8.2 Randomisation , blind treatment allocation All include patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy , procedure LAPP score use basis result appendix remove . 8.3 Study procedure There additional procedure patient undergo study . 8.4 Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason . 8.4.1 Specific criterion withdrawal ( applicable ) For whatever reason patient free withdraw study . After patient ask participate study emergency department surgical ward sign informed consent form , he/she usually wait time he/she operate . In theatre LAPP score use . Postoperatively patient still decide withdraw study , although decision remove remove appendix already make . The patient prospective follow 12 month period patient still decide withdraw study , save data form delete database . 8.5 Replacement individual subject withdrawal There need replace patient withdrawn . In sample size calculation investigator anticipate 40 % rate withdrawal several reason . 8.6 Follow-up subject withdraw treatment These patient usual follow-up patient operate suspicion appendicitis . In case patient see postoperatively twice outpatient clinic . 8.7 Premature termination study - At 2 different time interval , 50 75 % total number patient include study interim analysis perform . The percentage miss appendicitis evaluate . When percentage miss appendicitis exceeds 2 % , study terminate . - The percentage miss appendicitis lead serious adverse event ( like persistent significant disability incapacity , life threaten death ) exceed 1 % . This evaluated time study . 9 . SAFETY REPORTING 9.1 Section 10 WMO event In accordance section 10 , subsection 1 , WMO , investigator inform subject review accredit METC anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit METC , except insofar suspension would jeopardise subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep inform . 9.2 AEs , SAEs SUSARs 9.2.1 Adverse event ( AEs ) See also section 8.7 . Serious adverse event cause miss appendicitis report immediately occur . If miss appendicitis lead prolongation hospitalization le 10 day investigator consider adverse event take action unless exceeds 2 % inclusion every quartile patient . Adverse event like persistent significant disability incapacity , life threaten death report immediately least within 7 day web portal ToetsingOnline . Adverse event define undesirable experience occur subject study , whether consider related [ investigational product / experimental intervention ] . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investiga¬tor staff record . 9.2.2 Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) A serious adverse event untoward medical occurrence effect dose : - result death ; - life threaten ( time event ) ; - require hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation ; - result persistent significant disability incapacity ; - congenital anomaly birth defect ; - Any important medical event may result death , life threatening , require hospitalization , may consider serious adverse experience , base upon appropriate medical judgement , event may jeopardize subject may require intervention prevent one outcomes list . The sponsor report SAEs web portal ToetsingOnline accredit METC approve protocol , within 15 day sponsor first knowledge serious adverse reaction . SAEs result death life threaten report expedite . The expedited reporting occur later 7 day responsible investigator first knowledge adverse reaction . This preliminary report another 8 day completion report . 9.2.3 Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSARs ) Not applicable study . 9.3 Annual safety report Not applicable study . 9.4 Follow-up adverse event All AEs follow abate , stable situation reach . Depending event , follow may require additional test medical procedure indicate , and/or referral general physician medical specialist . SAEs need report till end study within Netherlands , define protocol . 9.5 [ Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) / Safety Committee ] The following doctor take place Independent Data Monitoring Committee ; - Prof. dr.
