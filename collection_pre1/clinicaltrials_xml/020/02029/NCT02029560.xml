	<brief_title>Observational Study Evaluate Effect Thrupas® Capsule Cardiovascular System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BPH hypertension chronic senile diseases increase prevalence age . It report 25 % men 60 year old suffer BPH hypertension . Though two disease differ nature , hypothesis advance recent study diseases , increase sympathetic tone play important role pathophysiology . As medical treatment BPH , α-blockers widely select clinical study first line treatment patient LUTS , non-invasiveness superior clinical efficacy [ 1 , 5 ] . Such α-blockers increase urine flow decrease residual urine control excitement sympathetic nervous system distribute around smooth muscle prostate bladder neck . Through , α-blockers improve condition clinical symptom patient suffer LUTS due BPH , decrease need invasive surgery related BPH , also medical action decrease morbidity rate secondary complication BPH acute retention urine , deterioration renal function , bladder stone urinary tract infection . However , case patient hypertension medication , consider concomitant administration α-blockers , adverse event orthostatic hypotension dizziness due drop blood pressure concern . In regard , silodosin , alpha 1A adrenoceptor antagonist , proven low occurrence adverse event relate cardiovascular system little effect blood pressure compare α-blockers . Thus , study , aim see effect cardiovascular system ( blood pressure ) Thrupas® capsule administer every day 12 week patient LUTS suggestive BPH .</detailed_description>
