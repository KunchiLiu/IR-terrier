	<brief_summary>Guillian-Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) frequent cause acute neuromuscular weakness Western World occur age . GBS rpadily progressive 'inflammatory ' disorder perihperal nerve often lead sever paresis limb . Most GBS patient also sensory disturbance ( tingle dull feel ) pain . Some patient also double vision problem swallow . GBS mau also involve respiratory muscle , lead insufficient ventilation admission intensive care unit . GBS pateints vairable prognosis ; 20-30 % require mechnical ventilation period range week month , 20 % unable walk 6 month nad 3-5 % dy . Progression weakness GBS usually rapid reach peak within 4 week majority patient , many develop maximum deficit within 2 week . Thereafter , patient variable prognosis . GBS treatable disorder . Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) 2g/kg administer 5 day show effective administer within first two week onset symptom , consider treatment choice expert field . Although standard treatment GBS single course IVIg ( 2g/kg administer 5 day ) , many patient fail recover abd remain substantial disability . Patients GBS especially poor prognosis potentially may benefit powerful abd possible mechanistically rational therapy . Recent experimental evidence suggest complement activation palys crucial role development neuromuscular weakness GBS make complement inhibitor regulator attracive therapeutic target . Our hypothesis Eculizumab , function complement inhibitor , effective prevent progression weakness patient GBS .</brief_summary>
