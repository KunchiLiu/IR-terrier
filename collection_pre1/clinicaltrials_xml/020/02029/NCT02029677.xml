	<detailed_description>The expected duration participation study 6 month bariatric surgery depend participant ' weight loss insurance company requirement . A total 10 patient take part control group . The following procedure test do surgery : routine standard test require involved obesity surgery program ( history physical , blood work , ECG , nutritional assessment , psychological assessment sleep study ) . During preoperative evaluation participant start medical weight loss diet instruction provide program 's endocrinologist , nurse practitioner dietitian weight loss goal stipulate insurance company series additional laboratory test ( blood work ) do test hormonal response weight loss . This blood work , draw eat standardized meal , experimental procedure entire study . We measure several hormone associate obesity include ghrelin , obestatin , peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( PYY3-36 ) , adiponectin , Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , oxyntomodulin , leptin , insulin , glucose pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) . Measurements do 4 time interval surgery : enrollment , +1-month , +3-months , +6-months . This allow u look hormone level participant gradually lose weight . If participant reach insurance-dictated weight loss 6 month , study participation cease allow individual proceed surgery scheduling . Participants require fast overnight prior visit . An intravenous line place 0800 , subject fed standard breakfast ( 35 % fat , 15 % protein , 50 % carbohydrate ) consist 25 % estimate caloric need weight maintenance , consume 30 minute less . Blood take begin 30 minute standardized meal , time 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute meal total ghrelin , pancreatic polypeptide , PYY3-36 , active GLP-1 , insulin , glucagon , leptin , oxyntomodulin , glucose . An extra fasting sample obtain lipid total adiponectin . Three-quarters cup ( 148 mL ) blood draw analysis visit . Additionally , subject ask complete Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) three time research visit place single vertical mark across 100 mm length line , word anchor end , express positive negative rating , assess hunger , satiety , fullness . Each visit last approximately 4 hour .</detailed_description>
