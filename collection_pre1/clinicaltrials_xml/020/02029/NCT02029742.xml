	<brief_summary>The investigator propose culturally align community-based intervention multi-ethnic sickle cell disease ( SCD ) population , augment task-focused communication technology , improve self-managed adherence hydroxyurea ( HU ) decrease barrier use , support parent-youth partnership chronic disease self-management reinforce behavior daily medication use . Culturally align community health worker ( CHW ) well-established mean support chronic disease self-management underserved family , partnership medical home . CHWs identify address multiple barrier reinforce developmentally appropriate self-management help youth reach maintain best fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) level . However , strategy alone may insufficient achieve daily HU adherence . The investigator therefore propose feasibility trial test feasibility acceptability structure intervention CHW support address exist barrier improve HU use , augment daily cue-based parent youth text message reminder , efficiently extend CHW family support reinforce family partnership self-management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) inherit disorder affect blood cause anemia , painful sickle crisis , organ damage , reduce quality life high health care use . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) oral medication reduces disease symptom improve quality life increase amount fetal hemoglobin blood . Despite clinical promise hydroxyurea , many child SCD make take hydroxyurea daily health habit . General barrier medication adherence underserved population include lack trust medical staff , incomplete knowledge regard benefit hydroxyurea , factor impede access care transportation difficulty . Challenges specific hydroxyurea use include understanding importance maximize fetal hemoglobin level address concern hydroxyurea . Children adolescent also require developmentally appropriate transition self-management establish parent . Community-based health worker well establish mean provide support chronic disease management underserved family address multi-faceted barrier culturally , behaviorally developmentally align intervention . The investigator hypothesize Community Health Workers support , augment daily task-focused communication technology , improve self-managed adherence hydroxyurea .</detailed_description>
