	<brief_summary>The closed system , conventional negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) , usually avoid infected critical colonize wound . To observation , additional continuous irrigation tube attach beside suction tube NPWT system could provide effective drainage reduce occlusion suction tube , enable effective debridement dilute infected/necrotized tissue decrease incidence fistula provide relatively moist ambient . At institution , modify system combine `` triple-tube '' device allow continuous instillation become active efficient . The study investigate continuous triple-tube instillation suction could improve outcome acute severely infected open abdomen .</brief_summary>
