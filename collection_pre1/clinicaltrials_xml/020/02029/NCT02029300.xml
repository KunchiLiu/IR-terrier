	<brief_summary>There two route fiberoptic intubation perform - oral nasal . In general , nasal intubation conventional method may prefer choice certain procedure intra-oral surgery , anatomical reason limit mouth open . If nasal intubation indicate preferred , oral intubation usually perform . This study look explore whether nasal route significantly improve ease time successful fiberoptic intubation compare oral route child less equal 2 year age . This study also examine operator experience influence time tracheal intubation either route ? The investigator hypothesize nasal route fiberoptic intubation faster oral route , trainee expert , minimal difference expert trainee nasal fiberoptic intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Nasal Versus Oral Fiberoptic Intubation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal prospective randomize study compare effect nasal fiberoptic intubation versus oral fiberoptic intubation child less 2 year age . Other factor assesed include operator experience , ease time fiberoptic grade laryngeal view , time fiberoptic tracheal intubation , complication . This study look explore whether nasal route significantly improve ease time successful fiberoptic intubation compare oral route child less equal 2 year age . While also ask , operator experience influence time tracheal intubation either route ? The investigator hypothesize nasal route fiberoptic intubation faster oral route , trainee expert , minimal difference expert trainee nasal fiberoptic intubation .</detailed_description>
