	<brief_title>Iressa Re-challenge Advanced NSCLC EGFR-mutated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Gefitinib register first-line treatment EGFR-mutated NSCLC patient . There lack evidence second third line therapy category patient . Several case report describe successful re-administration gefitinib NSCLC patient achieve objective response initial administration gefitinib eventual progression . Objective : The primary objective study evaluate disease control rate ( DCR ; confirm complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) ) gefitinib use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) version 1.1 patient activate sensitise Epidermal Growth Factor mutation positive ( EGFR M+ ) NSCLC . The secondary objective study : objective response rate ( ORR ) accord RECIST , progression free survival ( PFS ) accord RECIST , overall Survival ( OS ) , EGFR Mutational status tumour tissue activate resistance EGFR mutation analysis association Veristrat assay ( Biodesix ) PFS OS assess .</detailed_description>

Measurable disease define least one lesion , previously irradiate , accurately measure baseline ≥ 10 mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥ 15 mm ) spiral CT MRI suitable accurate repeat measurement . WHO / ECOG / Zubrod performance status 02 . Possibility obtain tumour material start study treatment . Known severe hypersensitivity gefitinib excipients product treatment persistent radiation toxicity . Previous adjuvant chemotherapy allow . Progressive disease stable disease ( SD ) &lt; 12 week best response 1st line treatment EGFRTKI Consideration require radiotherapy lung time study entry near future Past medical history interstitial lung disease , druginduced interstitial disease , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease . Preexisting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis evidence CT scan baseline Known suspect brain metastasis spinal cord compression , unless treat surgery and/or radiation . Any unresolved chronic toxicity great CTC grade 2 previous anticancer therapy Concomitant use know CYP 3A4 inducer phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampicin , barbiturate , St John 's Wort Pregnancy breastfeed As judged investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( eg , unstable uncompensated respiratory , cardiac , hepatic , renal disease ) Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory find make undesirable patient participate study Other coexist malignancy malignancy diagnose within last 2 year exception basal cell carcinoma cervical cancer situ Life expectancy le 12 week Treatment nonapproved investigational drug within 30 day day 1 study treatment Involvement planning and/or conduct study ( applies NVALT staff staff study site ) Previous enrolment treatment present study .</criteria>
