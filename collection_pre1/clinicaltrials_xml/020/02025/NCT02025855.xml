	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine administer methadone mechanically ventilate patient medical intensive care unit ( ICU ) require continuous infusion sedatives analgesic decrease time mechanical ventilation , initiate within 48 hour admission . Patients meet enrollment criterion randomly assign receive methadone placebo addition standard care . Methadone long act pain medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) manage withdrawal opioids moderate severe pain . Both indication frequent concern critically ill patient require mechanical ventilation . These patient often require intravenous ( IV ) opioids manage pain experience due illness , procedure , mechanical ventilation . During time patient develop physical dependence , lead withdrawal symptom opioids stop dose reduce . These symptom include agitation , pain , diarrhea several others . Currently manage slow reduction dose IV opioid , lead prolonged time mechanical ventilation , associate increased morbidity . Administering oral methadone patient experience withdrawal symptom show reduce even eliminate symptom outpatient set . This also benefit patient ICU experience withdrawal intravenous opioids require stay . It may allow opioids discontinue quickly , allow short duration mechanical ventilation . The level pain sedation assess group randomize either methadone placebo addition current intravenous sedative analgesic agent . The duration mechanical ventilation assess group . Opioid withdrawal symptom may manifest mistaken delirium symptom . ICU delirium often manage antipsychotic medication . To assess methadone reduce need antipsychotic medication , administer antipsychotic dos record total consumption compare two group . Methadone associate abnormal heart rhythm rare instance . To ensure patient safety , data heart monitor collect compare two group assess QT interval prolongation .</brief_summary>
