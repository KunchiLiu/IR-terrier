	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis UC Disease affect colon . PillCam IBD may use visualization colon mucosa UC Disease patient . This study design evaluate yield clinical impact IBD capsule detect lesion associate UC Disease determine agreement PillCam Platform IBD capsule optical colonoscopy evaluation UC disease extent . Primary Scientific Objective To evaluate agreement PillCam IBD system optical colonoscopy evaluation UC disease extent ( Non-active disease , Proctitis , Left-sided colitis , Pancolitis ) Proposed Design Established UC disease patient whose clinical condition suggest ongoing disease activity , age 18 year , evidence symptomatic stricture obstruction would prevent capsule passage enrol study . Patients undergo bowel prep , follow PillCam IBD capsule examination colonoscopy examination . The Rapid video evaluate two reader , different site , colonoscopy video evaluate two physician , sit INCLUSION CRITERIA All subject must fulfill follow inclusion criterion : - Patients age 18 year - Patient know UC accord physician discretion - Patient least one positive inflammatory marker follow : - ESR - CRP - CBC - Patient indicate eligible standard care colonoscopy examination - Patient agree sign consent form EXCLUSION CRITERIA The presence follow exclude patient study enrollment : - Crohn 's Disease - Antibiotic Associated Colitis - Stool positive O &amp; P ( C &amp; S within 3 month enrollment ) - Other know infectious cause increase symptom - Known intestinal obstruction current obstructive symptom , severe abdominal pain accompany nausea vomit . - Definite long stricture see radiological exam . - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug include Aspirin , ( twice weekly ) 4 week precede enrollment - Suspected GI stricture , follow patency capsule study image study could prove patency GI tract . - Patient prior abdominal surgery gastrointestinal tract last 6 month , uncomplicated procedure would unlikely lead bowel obstruction base clinical judgment investigator . - Patient expect undergo MRI examination within 7 day ingestion capsule . - Patient know gastrointestinal motility disorder . - Subjects know suspected delayed gastric empty - Patient suffers condition , swallow problem , precludes compliance study and/or device instruction . - Patient Type 1 Type II Diabetes . - Patient allergy know contraindication medication use study . - Patient condition , preclude compliance study and/or device instruction . - Women either pregnant nursing time screening , child-bearing potential practice medically acceptable method contraception . - Concurrent participation another clinical trial use investigational drug device . - Patient suffers life threaten condition - Patients history clinical evidence renal disease and/or previous clinically significant laboratory abnormality renal function parameter .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 year Patient know UC accord physician discretion Patient symptom fresh bleed and/or bloody diarrhea and/or least one positive inflammatory marker within past three month follow : ESR CRP CBC Patient indicate eligible standard care colonoscopy examination evaluation disease activity routine screen dysplasia colorectal cancer Patient agree sign consent form Crohn 's Disease Antibiotic Associated Colitis Stool positive O &amp; P C. difficile toxin within 3 month enrollment Other know infectious cause increase symptom Known intestinal obstruction current obstructive symptom , severe abdominal pain accompany nausea vomit . Definite tight long stricture see radiological exam . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug include Aspirin , ( twice weekly ) 4 week precede enrollment Suspected GI stricture , follow patency capsule study image study could prove patency GI tract . Patient prior abdominal surgery gastrointestinal tract last 6 month , uncomplicated procedure would unlikely lead bowel obstruction base clinical judgment investigator . Patient expect undergo MRI examination within 7 day ingestion capsule . Patient known gastrointestinal motility disorder . Subjects know suspected delayed gastric empty Patient suffers condition , swallow problem , precludes compliance study and/or device instruction . Patient Type 1 Type II Diabetes . Patient allergy know contraindication medication use study . Women either pregnant nursing time screening , childbearing potential practice medically acceptable method contraception . Concurrent participation another clinical trial use investigational drug device . Patient suffers life threaten condition Patients history clinical evidence renal disease and/or previous clinically significant laboratory abnormality renal function parameter .</criteria>
