	<brief_summary>The trial include ) evaluation efficacy treatment strategy , design phase II trial , ii ) dose-finding part . The Phase II trial open label , non-randomized , multicentre trial without control group . A Bayesian approach use analyse EFS , assume cure model . We use three prior distribution EFS ; ( 1 ) enthusiastic prior distribution , ( 2 ) pessimistic prior distribution , ( 3 ) non-informative prior distribution . As patient outcome trial record , subsequent distribution outcome probability experimental treatment compute apply Bayes ' theorem , yield estimate EFS probability 95 % credibility interval ( measure Bayesian precision ) . Two interim analysis plan monitor efficacy data ( early stopping rule futility inefficacy ) . The final analysis efficacy make intention treat basis , include recruited patient , 3 year recruitment last patient . Due uncertainty dose cyclophosphamide give combination Busilvex last chemotherapy course patient complete response intensification chemotherapy treatment , dose-finding subtrial perform address issue ( Phase I part ) . The dose escalation cyclophosphamide perform use Continual Reassessment Method Bayesian framework .</brief_summary>
