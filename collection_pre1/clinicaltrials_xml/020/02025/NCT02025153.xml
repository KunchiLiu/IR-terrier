	<brief_summary>To determine whether central sensitization mechanism CPSP ( chronic postsurgical pain ) woman develop CPSP compare woman CPSP hysterectomy . This mechanism illustrate high pain score experimental pain model tonic heat stimulation , increase evoked mechanical temporal summation increase wound hyperalgesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Pain Programme Determine Mechanism Transition Acute Chronic Postsurgical Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain affect 9 % Singapore population result major socioeconomic burden . Chronic postsurgical pain ( CPSP ) persist 3 month could relate nerve injury make strategic model study transition acute chronic pain . CPSP occur 50 % surgery 32 % hysterectomy . Over 600000 hysterectomy perform US 2003 make CPSP significant problem . Investigators perform prospective cohort study determine whether increased central sensitization negative psychological experience involve transition acute chronic pain hysterectomy . Investigators recruit 444 woman undergo hysterectomy employ validate physical pain test include tonic heat stimulation , mechanical temporal summation wound hyperalgesia show related central sensitization . Pain catastrophizing ( negative thought pain ) state trait anxiety score assessed impact negative cognitive-affective experience CPSP . A phone survey perform 4 month determine primary outcome CPSP . Arterial spin label use delineate cerebral blood flow use arterial spin labeling , functional connectivity structural connectivity evaluate insula-anterior cingulate cortex difference 30 woman CPSP compare 30 woman without CPSP . In addition evaluate whether central sensitization , negative psychological experience activation brain region different woman CPSP hysterectomy , result study elucidate potential mechanism CPSP development guide future study potential novel therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
