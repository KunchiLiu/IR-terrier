	<brief_title>Development Ibudilast Alcohol Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol dependence ( AD ) chronic relapse condition affect 10 million Americans . To date , four pharmacotherapies approve FDA treatment alcoholism efficacy modest . Therefore , medication development AD represent high priority area . Ibudilast ( IBUD ) glial cell modulator inhibit phosphodiesterases ( PDE ) -4 -10 macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) . Preclinical data suggest neuroimmune modulation critical rewarding property drug abuse , include alcohol . Further , IBUD show enhance GDNF release vivo GDNF modulation implicate alcohol reinstatement animal , PDE inhibition show reduce alcohol intake mouse . Together , finding suggest neuroimmune modulation constitutes novel target treatment alcoholism . The objective study advance medication development alcoholism conduct initial Phase II study IBUD AD . Specifically , propose study consist randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design determine safety , tolerability , initial human laboratory efficacy IBUD sample 24 non-treatment seek individual either alcohol abuse dependence treat IBUD ( 50mg BID ) placebo . Participants complete two separate 7-day inpatient stay UCLA CTRC take study medication , complete IV alcohol challenge , take part stress-exposure cue-exposure paradigm . Specific aim test whether IBUD ( ) safe context alcohol administration , ( b ) attenuate alcohol-induced reinforcement , ( c ) dampen stress-induced cue-induced alcohol craving . In sum , study efficiently evaluate safety initial efficacy IBUD thereby screen novel medication AD elucidate potential mechanism IBUD may clinically efficacious . Results study inform whether randomize control trial IBUD alcoholism warrant .</detailed_description>
