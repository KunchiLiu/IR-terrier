	<brief_summary>Atrial Fibrillation atrial flutter ( AF/FL ) usually irregular beat heart rapidly grow cause hospitalization . Between 1993 2007 AF/FL hospitalization increase 203 % compare 71 % increase hospitalization . Changing procedure management ablation , transesophageal minimal impact trend need evaluate Emergency Department ( ED ) management option AF/FL may decrease hospitalization . The commonly used medication control heart rate metoprolol ( MET ) , beta blocker , diltiazem ( DT ) , calcium channel blocker . Beta blocker medication cause heart beat slowly less force . DT also help blood vessel open improve blood flow . Both DT MET use alone together medicines treat severe chest pain ( angina ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) rapid heartbeat . Both equally acceptable accord recent guideline AF/FL . There limited study compare MET DT rate control AF/FL . The initial goal AF/FL management Emergency Department usually rate control . The commonly used rate control medication metoprolol ( MET ) , beta blocker , diltiazem ( DT ) calcium blocker . Three major guideline , include American College Cardiology ( ACC ) American Heart Association ( AHA ) indicate beta blocker DT equally acceptable medication rate control AF ( 3,4,5 ) assume contraindication . There limited study compare beta blocker ( BB ) DT rate control AF : 1 . Demircan , et . al. , compare bolus intravenous BB DT 40 patient 20 minute period . No follow-up information 20 minute report . No attempt make look intermediate long term result . No patient convert normal sinus rhythm short treatment period slightly rate decrease 20 minute , DT versus BB ( 6 ) . 2 . Time medication administration heart rate rhythm control . Additionally , currently guideline consider BB DT medication slow AF/FL ; however , suggestion BB may slow heart rate AF/FL ( DT ) also increase AF/FL conversion AF/FL normal sinus rhythm ( 2 ) , aid maintaining normal sinus rhythm ( NSR ) cardioversion ( 10 ) . With recent onset AF/FL occur within 48 hour prior arrival ED , approximately 50 % AF/FL patient convert normal rhythm spontaneously within 24 hour arrival ED ( 6 ) , make evaluation current limited study difficult . Thus , investigator wish examine effect initial medication strategy time NSR large sample previously perform . 3 . A randomized study 48 patient China report significantly slow heart rate 20 minute DT 10mg IV versus metoprolol 5mg IV 30 minute ( 7 ) . 4 . A retrospective study post-operative coronary bypass patient show intravenous administration BB , esmolol , effective DT rate control conversion AF/FL ( 8 ) . 5 . Hassan et al report difference conversion regular rhythm esmolol verse DT small , powered , randomize study fifty ED patient ( 9 ) . Conversion sinus rhythm occur 10 patient ( 42 % ) DT group compare 10 patient ( 39 % ) esmolol group ( P = 1.0 ) . There statistically significant difference heart rate two medication 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 hour initiation esmolol DT infusion . Examples well quote strategy trial COURAGE trial publish New England Journal Medicine PROMISE Trial , worldwide multi-centered study near completion goal 10,000 patient , Charleston Area Medical Center ( CAMC ) enrol approximately 100 patient . In trial , patient evaluate chest pain randomize two treatment strategy subsequent outcomes record . Strategy trial attempt manage treatment initial management strategy determine randomization , , whether initial treatment affect long-term outcome . This prospective , randomize study compare outcome strategy use either MET DT patient AF present Charleston Area Medical Center ( CAMC ) ED . After presentation receive consent , patient randomize receive either MET DT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If either initial DT MET strategy show effective obtain rate rhythm control , decrease length stay ED , decrease admission readmission , potential : 1 . ) Major health cost saving ; 2 . ) Improved bed utilization hospital , frequently capacity unable accept transfer outlying hospital ; , 3 . ) Education ED non-ED health care provider optimal AF/FL medication option . Sample Preliminary information obtain CAMC 's Data Warehouse July 1 , 2011 June 30 , 2012 reveal 370 patient see Emergency Department ( ED ) either CAMC Memorial General Hospitals diagnosis AF/FL , without acute co-morbidity . The investigator identify Hospital patient enrol . The investigator enroll total 150 patient base follow : Prior data indicate conversion normal sinus rhythm 8 hour approximately 20 % . If investigator wish detect 25 % change medication investigator would need include total 150 patient ( 75 cohort ) reject null hypothesis conversion rate equal 2 medication probability ( power ) 0.8 Type I error &lt; 0.05 . The investigator use continuity-corrected chi-squared statistic Fisher 's exact test test hypothesis . Power analysis perform use GPower Version 3 . Procedures Potential study patient identify ED nurse member study team use inclusion exclusion criterion . ED nurse inform study charge nurse educate protocol research team . The purpose , content logistics study also describe ED physician participate study . Research assistant , available , notify cell phone pager see patient ED within 20 minute . The attend physician resident inform potential study patient . The attend physician resident give research associate/member study team permission discus study patient . If patient interested participating study , research associate/member study team discus detail study review consent form . It likely onset treatment DT MET delay 30 40 minute due consent process study enrollment . The attend physician must agree delay . At point attend physician discus study patient answer question . The physician resident initially talk patient trial Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative ( CITI ) training . General education ED staff make concern aim objective strategy study . If patient still interested willing participate , inform consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) privacy statement sign . Following consent , patient randomize either IV diltiazem ( DT ) IV metoprolol ( MET ) . Sealed envelope contain randomize treatment protocol maintain ED premise pull consecutively patient consent study . Inside envelope , specific treatment plan reveal . Treatment either DT MET initiate use standard CAMC protocol . Deviations randomly assign medication regimen would attend physician 's discretion pending vital sign response . If study drug stop change different type medication , patient 's participation continue medication document analysis result intent treat . The physician rotate General Memorial Hospitals . The investigator start Memorial Hospital , experience enrollment investigator may enroll patient Hospitals . Data Analysis Basic descriptive statistic include mean standard deviation continuous variable proportion frequency categorical variable use describe patient sample disease characteristic . To determine medication regimen ( MET v DT ) note descriptive analysis associate primary aim 1 treat AF/FL ED hospitalization ( Primary Aim-1 ) , investigator describe proportion patient rhythm control ( define normal sinus rhythm ) time ED discharge use Chi-square analysis continuity correction . Using statistical test , investigator describe proportion patient normal sinus rhythm time hospital discharge , patient admit CAMC . Possible confounders , include patient characteristic , co-morbid condition , ED event , deviation medicine regimen achieve NSR examine compare patient confounder without confounder interest use Chi-square continuity correction analyse data categorical , t-test Mann-Whitney U analysis data continuous . In addition , investigator examine effect medication regimen rate control ( defined heart rate &lt; 100 bpm ) ( Primary Aim-2 ) 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hour identical manner describe rhythm control include examination confounding variable . The proportion patient receive CAMC hospital admission versus discharge home ED describe two medication regimen use Chi-square analysis continuity correction determine one regimen result great percentage home discharge directly ED ( Secondary Aim-1 ) . The effect possible confounders include patient characteristic , ED event , achieve rate and/or rhythm control ED deviation medication regimen examine describe patient confounder without confounder interest need hospital admission use Chi-square continuity correction analyse data categorical , t-test Mann-Whitney U analysis , data continuous . Those confounders show associate ED discharge home include multivariate analysis ( binomial logistic regression ) examine medication regimen associate ED discharge home presence confounders . To determine medication regimen ( MET v DT ) associate decreased financial cost ( Secondary Aim-2 ) , ED cost examine 2 medication regimen patient use t-tests , Mann-Whitney U analysis . In addition , total cost hospitalization ( ED + hospital cost ) patient admit CAMC hospital ED examine medication regimen . Cost also examine relationship length stay examine cost /length stay two treatment group use statistical test . The need readmission atrial fibrillation reoccurrence report phone questionnaire ( Secondary Aim-3 ) compare two medication regimen use Chi-square continuity correction analysis . The investigator also determine rate control medication time phone interview associate freedom atrial fibrillation reoccurrence use chi-square analysis . Lastly , time discharge phone survey study completion ( maximum : 6 month ) determine investigator examine effect lag time ( 4- 6 month ) percentage patient require readmission and/or reoccurrence atrial fibrillation via chi square analysis . For applicable analysis describe , Fisher 's exact test substitute Chi square analysis appropriate . For comparison , p level &lt; 0.05 use determine statistical significance .
