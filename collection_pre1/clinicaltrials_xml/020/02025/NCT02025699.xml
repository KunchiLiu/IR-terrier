	<detailed_description>The TAILORED-Treatment consortium establish develop new tool aim increase effectiveness antibiotic antifungal therapy , reduce adverse event , help limit emergence antimicrobial resistance child adult . In reality , target antimicrobial therapy effectively achieve utilizing personalize data facilitate tailor optimized approach individual patient treatment . This best achieved utilizing knowledge gain host-centered pathogen-centered parameter health disease . Unfortunately , parameter traditionally , tend measure independently ( example use microbial culture PCR-based method microbial detection , measurement immune response infection and/or blood-based biomarkers host ) , use ad hoc basis without careful integration best treatment patient . However , recent advance development high-throughput sensitive molecular-based technology , on-line internet database access tool , bioinformatics analysis , mean goal personalized medicine treatment sight . Unfortunately however , currently exist technological gap recent state-of-the-art methodology ( example respect gain new insight novel host-pathogen interaction ) laboratory-to-bedside result benefit patient , physician society whole . The TAILORED-Treatment project design bridge technological gap order generate novel insight innovation readily exploitable maximum benefit multiple stakeholder field personalize medicine infectious disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Patients least one month old eligible inclusion . The LRTI disease group also fulfill follow criterion : Presence two follow sign respiratory distress : Tachypnea , Chest cough , Nasal flaring , Retractions , Rales , Expiratory wheeze and/or decrease breath sound The Sepsis group also fulfill follow criterion : Sepsis define combination systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) due infectious agent . SIRS determine accord publish criterion ( International Sepsis Definitions Conference , 2001 ) base ( adult ) : Heart rate ( high 90/min ) Respiratory rate ( high 20/min PaCO2 low 32 mmHg ) Core body temperature ( high 38°C low 36°C ) White blood cell count ( high 12,000 cells/ µl low 4,000/ µl ) SIRS define least two criterion , one must abnormal temperature white blood cell count Severe sepsis define sepsis plus one following : Cardiovascular failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome Two organ failure As normal physiological variable different child , SIRS criterion define separately child 18 . SIRS severe sepsis criterion per age group define detail `` Population/Inclusion criterion '' section , accord guideline International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference ( 2005 ) . The noninfectious disease group include : Patients noninfectious disease . Children group include blood sample study combine blood sample part standard care . An episode febrile infection past 3 week A proven suspect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection Presence obvious alternative cause respiratory distress , heart failure pneumothorax Patients nosocomial LRTI ( develop &gt; 3days hospitalization ) Posttransplant patient Congenital immune deficiency ( CID ) Active hematological malignancy Current treatment immunesuppressive immunemodulating therapy include : Chemotherapy , Radiotherapy High dose steroid &gt; 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent past two week , Monoclonal antibody Intravenous IgG ( IVIG ) , Cyclosporine , AntiTNF agent , Interferon ( kind ) Other severe illness affect life expectancy quality life : Moderate severe psychomotor retardation Moderate severe congenital metabolic disorder In child : Other severe illness affect life expectancy le one year .</criteria>
