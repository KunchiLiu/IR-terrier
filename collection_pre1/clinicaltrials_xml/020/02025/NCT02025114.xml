	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter phase Ib/II study , compose phase Ib dose escalation part phase II dose expansion part . Patients receive selumetinib combination gefitinib 250mg daily . This study enroll EGFR-mutated NSCLC patient develop acquire resistance EGFR TKI treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib Combination With Gefitinib NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>primary objective dose escalation part determine MTD and/or RP2D selumetinib combination gefinitib . Once MTD and/or RP2D determine phase Ib dose escalation phase , study drug selumetinib combination 250mg QD dose gefitinib evaluate phase II dose expansion phase study . The purpose dose expansion phase evaluate efficacy selumetinib combination gefitinib characterize safety , tolerability combination . 20 patient require phase II period . In expansion phase , 10 patient T790M 10 patient without T790M enrol . It assume 20 % response rate target clinical interest . If true response rate 20 % , probability observe response random sample 10 patient 0.107 . The false negative rate detect true 20 % response rate cohort approximately 10 % . Each cohort enrol 10 patient evaluate efficacy ; therefore 20 patient enrol dose expansion part . Patients treat MTD and/or RP2D phase Ib consider part require number patient phase II . Patients MTD RP2D contribute 20 patient require phase II part .</detailed_description>
