	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : We hypothesize RNAseq allow u learn causative agent necrotizing soft tissue infection ( NSTI ) risk factor involve acquire devastate infection Tissue biopsy obtain consented patient admit NSTI . Biopsies use standard clinical analysis bacterial specie present store later RNA sequence . RNA sequence identify bacteria present within infection site may detect use standard culture technique well reveal bacterial gene expression profile within NSTI site . Medical chart also review basic patient information well wound care management practice . We hope identify bacterial specie commonly present type infection well risk factor predispose individual NSTI 's .</brief_summary>
