	<brief_summary>Acne scar high prevalence , significant impact quality life therapeutic challenge dermatologist . Previous study show promising result treatment acne scar non-ablative fractional laser microneedling , however study compare technique . Therefore , objective study compare effectiveness treatment atrophic acne scar face non-ablative fractional erbium laser microneedling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Treatments Atrophic Acne Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne multifactorial inflammatory dermatosis pilosebaceous unit , affect 80 percent teenager approximately 20 percent adult . Scaring occur early acne development may affect 95 % patient disease . However , prevalence acne scar varies depend study . Acne scar cause impairment quality life describe risk factor suicide . Furthermore , also link poor self esteem , depression , anxiety lower academic performance . The common type acne scar atrophic , include : ice pick , roll scar boxcar scar . Many treatment use atrophic scar , include resurface procedure ( chemical peel , dermabrasion laser treatment ) , excisional procedure ( punch excision , elevation punch elliptical excision scar ) , application filler microneedling , latter since 2005 , satisfactory result minimum time recovery . Previous study show promising result treatment acne scar non-ablative fractional laser microneedling . Previous report also show latter associate rapid healing period , low complication rate low risk post inflammatory hyperpigmentation . However , study compare efficacy microneedling technique resurface . This study single-blinded randomized clinical trial , compare application non-ablative fractional erbium laser ProDeep 1340 nm technique induction neocollagenesis microneedling . The primary objective study compare effectiveness treatment atrophic acne scar face non-ablative fractional erbium laser microneedling . The secondary objective : ass degree satisfaction participant technique ; check tolerability incidence adverse effect technique ; assess time need recovery number day absent work social activity procedure evaluate opinion physical discomfort technique . For participant , questionnaire fill follow information : gender , age , skin type , profession , current previous history smoking , use medication , presence active acne . To assess degree scar participant , scale `` Quantitative Global Scarring Grading System Postacne Scarring '' apply . After evaluation , patient randomly allocate study group ( simple randomization ) . The randomization system perform Microsoft Excel randomization program . Patients group undergo three session laser treatment three treatment session microneedling , interval six week . Two independent dermatologist , blind group treatment patient belongs , apply Quantitative Global Grading System Postacne Scarring treatment , two month six month treatment . There clinical sign characteristic enable evaluator identify group patient allocate patient instructed provide information . Six month completion treatment , patient answer questionnaire ass perception degree improvement scar , pain treatment recovery time , assign value 0 10 , 0 mean maximum dissatisfaction 10 , maximum satisfaction . To detect difference one standard deviation range group ( laser microneedling ) , power 90 % α error ≤ 0.05 , 23 patient require group . Data insert Excel export SPSS v18.0 statistical analysis . Quantitative variable analyze mean standard deviation group compare Student 's test independent sample . To compare variation measurement group throughout session analysis variance repeat measure use . For analysis interobserver agreement intraclass correlation coefficient Bland - Altman method use . This project approve Committee Research Ethics Hospital participant sign inform consent .</detailed_description>
