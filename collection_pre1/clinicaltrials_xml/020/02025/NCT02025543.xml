	<brief_title>Confounder-Corrected Quantitative MRI Biomarker Hepatic Iron Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , multi-vendor study validate rapid magnetic resonance-based confounder-corrected R2* mapping method quantitative imaging biomarker liver iron concentration ( LIC ) . Excessive accumulation iron various organ , include liver , affect adult pediatric population , toxic require treatment aim reduce body iron store . Measurement LIC critical detection stag iron overload , monitor iron-reducing chelator therapy expensive side effect . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) widely available , accessible , safe technology , sensitive presence iron tissue . Translation MRI biomarker liver iron concentration broad clinical use require clinically feasible , precise , robust change scan parameter , calibrate validated reference standard LIC , reproducible across site manufacturer . There currently available MRI method meet requirement . R2*-MRI hold great promise meet requirement . R2* mapping perform rapidly whole-liver 3D coverage single 20 breath-hold .</detailed_description>
