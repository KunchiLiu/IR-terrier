	<brief_summary>This study compare safety effectiveness abiraterone acetate alone , follow addition prednisone ( participant 's disease worsen physician feel would lessen symptom toxicity ) versus current approve treatment regimen involve concomitant use prednisone conjunction abiraterone acetate . Additionally , study also examine participant stop respond treatment abiraterone acetate evaluate blood tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Clinical Trial Abiraterone Acetate Without Exogenous Glucocorticoids Men With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With Correlative Assessment Hormone Intermediates .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants treat abiraterone acetate ( AA ) 28-day cycle . Participants monitor ( weekly first two cycle , Day 1 subsequent cycle ) symptom persistent severe mineralocorticoid excess ( include hypertension , hypokalemia ) . For participant experience symptom persistent severe hypertension hypokalemia detail schema , prednisone 5 mg mouth twice daily add . We monitor symptoms AA toxicity include fluid retention fatigue . - For participation tolerate AA monotherapy without addition prednisone manage symptom persistent severe mineralocorticoid excess , prednisone 5 mg mouth twice daily added Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) progression . Participants continue study symptomatic radiographic progression take study another reason detail protocol . - Participants undergo pre-treatment progression tumor biopsy . Participants also undergo pre-treatment progression tumor biopsy assessment possible mechanism AA resistance . After progression biopsy perform , protocol therapy discontinue . Participants stop protocol therapy receive four cycle AA ask undergo second biopsy . - Correlative Studies : Participants undergo assessment serum corticosteroid intermediate Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) baseline subsequent treatment visit correlation symptom mineralocorticoid excess .</detailed_description>
