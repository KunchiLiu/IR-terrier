	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis Enhancement Th-1 response help poly TLR agonist ( Mw ) likely increase survival patient severe sepsis . Objectives To study whether immunomodulation Mycobacterium Mw help improve survival recovery organ function patient severe sepsis . This assessed help follow - Mortality two arm - Daily SOFA score - Ventilator free day - Time-to-vasopressor withdrawal - ICU length stay - Hospital length stay METHODS This proof concept study assess effect Mycobacterium w combination standard therapy versus standard therapy alone inflammatory profile sepsis due gram negative infection . A total 25 patient enrol group . The patient randomize balance receive either test drug placebo along standard care</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof concept study assess effect Mycobacterium w combination standard therapy versus standard therapy alone inflammatory profile sepsis due gram negative infection . The study conduct respiratory intensive care unit PGIMER , Chandigarh , period 1 year . A total 25 patient enrol group . The patient randomize balance receive either test drug placebo along standard care In addition standard therapy sepsis , patient randomize test arm receive single daily dose 0.3 ml Mw intra-dermal 3 consecutive day patient randomize control arm receive single daily dose 0.3 ml Mw-placebo intra-dermal 3 consecutive day . Study Duration Study duration patient 28 day . Follow period include study duration 28 day Study Outlines Timing Visits Eligible patient enrol due consent randomize one treatment arm . The enrolled patient monitor adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) throughout study period . All patient continue receive standard therapy till consider requisite</detailed_description>
