	<brief_title>Gait Training With Cognitive Tasks Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial involve subject diagnose Parkinson 's disease , accordance guideline establish London Brain Bank . Individuals often must execute one task simultaneously everyday life . When different activity require attention perform time , situation call Dual Task occur . Under normal condition , motor cortex area ( primary motor cortex , pre-motor cortex supplementary motor area ) responsible select range movement give action sequence , accordance demand task environmental restriction , onset movement bring motor cortex , basal nuclei continue execution , leave motor cortex free task require attention . However , Parkinson 's disease , automaticity promote basal nucleus compromise constant conscious control become necessary gait . Thus , activity concurrent function perform , frontal region become dedicated secondary task gait predominantly control defective basal nuclei , generates negative Dual Task interference gait . Given poor gait quality assess DT situation , individual PD instruct avoid circumstance . By contrast , recent evidence demonstrate gait training conjunction secondary activity capable improve variable relate DT gait performance PD . Considering treadmill gait training provide great regularity automaticity , allow subject divert attention cognitive function , study hypothesizes DT treadmill gait training combine cognitive task promote good gait performance individual PD . Patients invited participate study phone call . They recruit service list Neurology Hospital Onofre Lopes , Natal -Brazil . Randomization individual respect participation group do via randomization.com website , person unfamiliar training procedure ( rater 1 ) , assign color ( yellow green ) group . Opaque envelop number separated , inside envelope piece paper contain word `` yellow '' `` green '' . As new patient arrive training , rater 2 open envelope aware color code particular patient . Rater 3 , lead researcher , conduct assessment re-assessment procedure . The color code maintain secrecy raters 1 2 throughout entire study . Cognitive function assess use Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale ( MoCA ) . Its score range 0 30 , cover aspect relate visuospatial executive function , name , memory , attention , language , abstraction , delay recall , well temporal spatial orientation . Higher score correspond great cognitive function . Disease severity classify accord guideline propose Modified Hoehn Yahr Scale , compose seven stage , allow categorization side body balance physical independence . Its score range 0 ( sign disease ) 5 point ( confine bed wheelchair ) . Assessment degree motor functional impairment obtain use Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) . This study use item 2 3 scale , related ADLs motor exploration , whose score correspond 52 56 , respectively . Kinematic assessment overground gait perform Qualisys Motion Capture Systems ( Qualisys Medical AB , 411 13 Gothenburg , Sweden ) , record spatiotemporal variable gait , well angular variation hip , knee ankle joint . This system compose eight camera emit capture infrared light . The light reflect spherical passive marker position bony prominence standard body segment , order capture lower limb data . The camera connect computer , image collect stored . Data capture two-dimensional imaging process Qualisys Track Manager 2.6 acquisition software , recognize marker positioning , base combination image least two camera connect series , enable generation three-dimensional coordinate movement . To end , data transport 3D visual software ( C-Motion , Rockville , MD , USA ) , version Basic/RT 3.99.25.8 ) , allow reconstruction three-dimensional analysis body segment mark , thereby record movement execute gait . For kinematic assessment , use 15 19 mm-diameter marker position bilaterally follow structure : iliac crest , great trochanter , medial lateral epicondyle femur , medial lateral malleoli , calcaneus , head first metatarsal head fifth metatarsal . These marker denominate anatomical , since function demarcate axial joint , allow different segment delimit . The mark guide trajectory segment classify track , arrange four rectangular base ( cluster ) . The marker place base sacrum , middle third thigh middle third leg . Anatomical marker fix double-faced adhesive tape reinforce surgical tape , track marker couple body segment elastic band Velcro . Markers color rater volunteer , order preserve reliability marking . For gait training , use electric Gait Trainer 2 treadmill ( Biodex Medical System , NY , USA ) , walk area measure 160 x 51 centimeter ( cm ) , equip bar upper extremity support , heart monitoring bioimpedance sensor locate bar Polar Telemetry system ( POLAR , USA ) . Coupled treadmill Unweighing System ( Biodex Medical System , NY , USA ) , compose vertical standing frame carry weight support mean harness . However , patient use weight support system study harness use safety precaution training session . The study procedure perform two day , first assessment second intervention immediate reassessment . On first day , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale Modified Hoehn Yahr Scale apply . Next , weight height record . Finally , kinematic assessment overground DT gait carry . On second day , subject submit treadmill train kinematic reassessment overground DT gait . Assessment occur one day training . At onset kinematic assessment , marker placement equipment calibration , static collection perform inform system regard body segment position enable subsequent construction biomechanical model . The individual remain orthostatic position , arm cross chest , foot apart point towards one camera . Subjects film 3 second position . Next , anatomical marker remove order perform dynamic capture . Only track marker thigh leg segment remain place , well head fifth metatarsal , lateral malleolus calcaneus , correspond foot segment . At dynamic capture , individual instruct cover distance 8 meter , walk maximum speed , perform cognitive task . During 8-meter lap letter randomly draw individual ask say many word possible start letter . When patient unable recall word , subject also instruct stop , rather continue walk try remember . Ten dynamic collection conduct . On next day , Experimental Group ( n=11 ) underwent treadmill gait training simultaneously protocol cognitive task involve number attention executive function , verbal fluency , work memory spatial planning . The protocol create specifically study , base cognitive activity propose previous study . The training session last 20 minute . The first three minute allow subject familiarize treadmill . From 4th minute onward , volunteer walk 1 minute perform cognitive task , follow minute , walk . Thus , 17 remain minute treadmill alternate one minute treadmill training combine cognitive task follow minute treadmill training . The Control Group ( n=11 ) underwent treadmill training . Training last 20 minute group . Treadmill gait speed group report patient fast possible speed maintain suitable comfort level . Vital sign ( heart rate blood pressure ) monitor , session . Immediately treadmill training , DT overground gait reassess , use ten dynamic capture , procedure use first day . Kinematic data processing conduct Qualisys Track Manager 2.6 software ( QTM ) , marker name trajectory define . Next , data obtain QTM export Visual 3D program , three-dimensional reconstruction biochemical model carry . Statistical analysis conduct use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) , version 19.0 . Before analysis group , data distribution normality verify apply descriptive statistic procedure Kolmogorov-Smirnov ( K-S ) test . Measures central tendency dispersion use illustrate clinical , demographic anthropometric data . For data normal distribution , pair t-test used compare intragroup spatiotemporal angular variable , student 's t-test independent sample apply compare intergroup variable . The Mann-Whitney test use data non-normal distribution . A significance level 5 % set test .</detailed_description>
