However , complete colonoscopy challenge technical procedure , even expert gastroenterologist due variation patient anatomy , tortuous colon , loop endoscope . Such obstacle prolong colonoscopy , lead complication , decrease polyp detection , impact patient experience tolerance . The investigator propose evaluate efficacy new non-invasive abdominal binder ( ColoWrap® ) improve performance tolerance colonoscopy way randomize , blind clinical trial . Eligible participant undergo colonoscopy University North Carolina Hospitals ( UNCH ) recruit study randomize either ColoWrap intervention sham arm . Colonoscopy perform per usual operating procedure . The primary outcome time distal extent ( cecal intubation time ) . Secondary outcome include colonoscopy completion rate , use ancillary maneuver , medication usage , procedural difficulty , patient comfort , operator assistant fatigue pain . Efficacy assessed basis pairwise comparison group respect primary secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
