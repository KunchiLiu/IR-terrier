	<detailed_description>Context : The survival elderly patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cancer greatly reduce compare young subject . Several explanation propose : competitive comorbidity , frequent refusal standard therapy choice suboptimal treatment due fear toxicity . The comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) may influence decision-making process help manage elderly patient head neck cancer . The CGA multidimensional assessment general health status , use validated scale . It produce inventory problem serve develop individualized geriatric intervention plan care follow-up . Hypotheses : We postulate CGA geriatric follow-up improves 1 ) therapeutic decision-making process thanks well assessment patient 's functional reserve capacity support treatment , 2 ) overall survival , functional status nutritional status elderly patient HNSCC appropriate treatment personalize medical follow-up surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy rarely targeted therapy , adjustment treatment management comorbidities and/or treatment complication . Main objective : To assess impact CGA geriatric follow-up overall survival , functional status nutritional status elderly patient HNSCC . Secondary objective : To assess impact CGA therapeutic decision , toxicity and/or complication treatment , complete realization treatment , autonomy , institutionalization , total hospitalization stay , quality life elderly patient HNSCCs cost .</detailed_description>
