	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether IL-17 polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMNs ) central disease pathology CF . This determine demonstrate IL-17 PMNs present CF airway , correlate lung function measure , decrease patient treat IV antibiotic pulmonary exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist two part conduct parallel . In first part study , 14 subject recruit Clinically Stable Cohort . Subjects ask provide 1 gm expectorate sputum 40-ml blood . A cell count differential perform sputum follow analysis IL-17 PMNs fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) . IL-17 PMNs also isolate run remainder cell pellet column magnetic bead design purpose . These neutrophil lysed intracellular cytokine determine . Sputum supernatant store frozen analyzed presence IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-17A , TGF-β , TNF-α , neutrophil elastase . Clinical data capture subject 's clinical outpatient visit include lung function measure clinical culture result . IL-17 PMNs correlate lung function measure inflammatory mediator baseline . In second part study , 10 subject recruit Exacerbation Cohort . Subjects provide least 1 gram expectorate sputum 40-ml blood within 72 hour hospital admission . Sputum blood process analyzed described . Sputum blood also obtain end treatment ( within 72 hour completion IV antibiotic ) subject baseline determine manage physician . Clinical data capture subject 's hospitalization record include lung function measure clinical culture result .</detailed_description>
