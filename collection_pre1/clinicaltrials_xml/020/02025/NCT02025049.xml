	<brief_title>DP-b99 Treatment Acute High-risk Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre , multi-national , parallel-arm study compare placebo group DP-b99 group treat intravenously 1.0 mg/kg twice daily 2 consecutive day . The study enrol 30 patient high risk develop severe pancreatitis , assess Bedside Index Severity Acute Pancreatitis ( BISAP ) score 3 study entry . The primary study endpoint effect DP-b99 systemic inflammation acute pancreatitis reflect C-reactive protein ( CRP ) plasma level . The secondary endpoint safety DP-b99 population patient ( routine safety laboratory test , physical examination vital sign monitoring , ECG adverse event reporting ) , DP-b99 's effect plasma inflammatory marker ( interleukin-6 , matrix metalloproteinase 9 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ) well effect clinical course pancreatitis ( base change Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) score , contrast material-enhanced abdominal Computerised Tomography ( CT ) , versus placebo . Clinical trial material administration begin within 48 hour acute pancreatitis symptom onset . Subjects randomise ratio 1:1 receive either DP b99 placebo . The serum level DP-b99 end 2-hour infusion also monitor . The study duration per individual subject 14 day , consist screen evaluation follow 48-hour double blind treatment period , part in-hospital observation period least 6 day , follow-up final visit Day 14 .</detailed_description>
