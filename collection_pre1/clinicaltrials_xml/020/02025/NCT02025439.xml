	<detailed_description>The R21 research objective examine safety efficacy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) combine Amantadine ( TMS + Amantadine ) relative rTMS Alone Amantadine Alone person chronic state seriously impaired consciousness . The hypothesis provision rTMS+Amantadine provide safe yet synergistic effect induces accelerate functional recovery . This hypothesis base ( ) preliminary data indicate partially improve neurobehavioral function mechanistically relate rTMS-induced neural activity connectivity well improve integrity white fiber tract , ( b ) relationship dopamine ( DA ) common traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) impairment , ( c ) role DA mediating consciousness , ( ) commonality DA rTMS-targeted pathway , ( e ) clinical efficacy safety Amantadine , ( f ) mechanisms action Amantadine , ( g ) association rTMS Amantadine up-regulating brain derive neurotrophic factor . The rationale pair rTMS Amantadine complementary synergistic effect factor promote conscious behavior . The specific aim : ( 1 ) Demonstrate rTMS+Amantadine safely tolerate , ( 2 ) Determine neurobehavioral effect rTMS+Amantadine , ( 3 ) Characterize pre-and post-treatment neural change neural activation . Aim 1 base preliminary safety data safety data regard Amantadine . To address Aims 2 &amp; 3 use repeat measure baseline control design randomize treatment order yield three treatment group ; rTMS + Amantadine , rTMS Alone Amantadine Alone . Analyses Aims 2 3 involve compare treatment group accord neurobehavioral growth trajectory , mean amount neural activation connectivity within brain region , index fiber tract directionality .</detailed_description>
