	<brief_title>Image-guided Cryoablation Head , Neck Spine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant assign either group 1 MRI-guided cryoablation group 2 PET/CT guide cryoablation . Each participant 's placement make team radiologist , medical oncologist , surgical oncologist , radiation oncologist . After eligibility screen Group 1 : The investigator assess participant 's tumor Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . This safe standard exam show physician participant 's tumor locate . MRI scan typically take 60 minute . The investigator ask participant complete `` Quality Life '' questionnaire . Following participant 's baseline scan , physician schedule participant 's procedure Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating ( AMIGO ) suite . The participant place general anesthesia procedure . A cryoablation needle insert skin tumor use MRI guidance . The tip cryoablation needle form iceball used ablate tumor cell . The physician able see tumor procedure MRI scan . The procedure take 3 hour , participant spending approximately 2 hour post-treatment anesthesia care unit . The participant spend subsequent night hospital , discharge next day . The investigator ask participant return 1 month , 3 month 6 month post procedure . The participant ask complete Quality Life questionnaire 1 , 3 6 month follow visit . Group 2 : The investigator assess participant 's tumor Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan Computerized Tomography ( CT ) . These safe standard exams show physician participant 's tumor locate . PET/CT scan typically take 60 minute . The investigator ask participant complete `` Quality Life '' questionnaire . Following participant 's baseline scan , physician schedule participant 's procedure AMIGO suite . The participant place general anesthesia procedure . A cryoablation needle insert skin tumor use PET/CT guidance . The tip cryoablation needle form iceball used ablate tumor cell . The physician able see tumor procedure PET/CT scan . The procedure take 3 hour , participant spend approximately 2 hour post-treatment anesthesia care unit . The participant spend subsequent night hospital , discharge next day . The investigator ask participant return 1 month , 3 month 6 month post procedure . The participant ask complete Quality Life questionnaire 1 , 3 6 month follow visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm malignant tumor metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Participants malignant locally recurrent and/or metastatic tumor eligible cryoablation . All tumor shape size eligible ablation . Participants must sustain available treatment option ( radiation , chemotherapy , surgery ) verify Dana Farber Cancer Institute 's Head Neck Tumor Board . These case review team medical oncologist , radiologist , radiation oncologist , surgical oncologist . Participants must advance head , neck spine malignant tumor would potentially benefit minimally invasive procedure . Age 18 year old Because dose adverse event data currently available use cryoablation participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric III trial . Life expectancy great 8 week opinion refer clinician . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/microliter ( mcL ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/microliter ( mcL ) Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . Cryoablation perform near vessel head neck , deem necessary tumor may displace use saline injection ( hydrodisplacement ) . Tumor displacement nerve may require perform deemed appropriate avoid nerve injury . The effect cryoablation develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . MRIGuided Cryoablation CriteriaCohort 1 Participants must mass wellvisualized MRI . Since positron emission tomographycomputed tomography ( PETCT ) guidance require nuclear medicine department administer radionuclide material , default try use MRI guidance . PET/CTGuided Cryoablation CriteriaCohort 2 Patients must mass well visualized PET/CT . Tumors clearly see MRI show PET/CT ablate PET/CT guidance . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants tumor involve optic chiasm , brain , spinal cord eligible participation study . Furthermore , tumor encase major blood vessel ( carotid , jugular , vertebral ) exclude study due inability displace mass . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants may receive study agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition gadolinium contrast agent , contrast use anticipated procedure . Participants blood glucose level &gt; 200mg/dl prior baseline study , know ischemic disease , and/or impaired renal function ( eGFR &lt; 60ml/min ) eligible study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study gadolinium contrast agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gadolinium , breastfeed discontinue mother treated gadolinium . MRIGuided Cryoablation Exclusion CriteriaCohort 1 Pregnant woman exclude study gadolinium contrast agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gadolinium , breastfeed discontinue mother treated gadolinium . PET/CTGuided Cryoablation Exclusion CriteriaCohort 2 Based potential risk fetal loss , teratogenicity , fetal growth retardation carcinogenesis , PET/CT contraindicate pregnant patient . Pregnant woman exclude study PET/CT utilize radioactive diagnostic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother radionclide , breastfeed discontinue mother treat .</criteria>
