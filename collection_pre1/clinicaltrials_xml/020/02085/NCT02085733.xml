	<brief_summary>Background : Children present non-traumatic joint pain require different treatment depend cause pain . Septic arthritis , result bacterial infection joint , often require surgical procedure well long course antibiotic . In contrast , non-septic arthritis typically treated management symptom observation . Current diagnostic standard involve microbiologic examination fluid take affected joint . This procedure require patient sedate , fluid culture analysis take 72 hour . A single laboratory measure could easily obtain quickly analyze would aid fast diagnosis , few diagnostic test low cost diagnostic work-up condition . Recent research septic arthritis identify procalcitonin potential septic arthritis diagnostic indicator . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) secrete cell thyroid high level body facing infection . Procalcitonin level rise slowly first two hour peak 24 hour . Levels rise 100-fold peripheral blood stream time frame . Several study indicate PCT promise potential diagnostic indicator septic arthritis . Unfortunately , many study relatively small sample size involve pediatric population . Additional study PCT septic arthritis child help evaluate viability PCT diagnostic indicator . Research Question : Can serum procalcitonin assist clinical differentiation bacterial ( septic ) non-bacterial arthritis ? Methods : Patients present possible septic arthritis emergency department recruit study . Patients consent participate receive current standard care , include IV placement , laboratory test Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , white blood cell count ( WBC ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , x-rays consultation pediatric orthopedics . Patients participate study portion serum collect typical diagnostic test analyze PCT . Research assistant collect data medical record participant , include lab imaging result . Patients undergo surgery contact phone within 7 day ED visit confirm diagnosis .</brief_summary>
