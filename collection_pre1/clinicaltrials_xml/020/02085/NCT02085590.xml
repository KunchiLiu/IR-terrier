	<brief_summary>In present study , want investigate whether BCG-vaccination enhances innate immune response human vivo ( single ) human endotoxemia . In future experiment investigate whether BCG-vaccination reverse tolerant state observe upon second LPS administration . Our goal ultimately translate result clinic application reverse example sepsis-induced immunoparalysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects BCG Immune Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis major medical challenge associate high mortality rate . Release pro-inflammatory mediator result hemodynamic instability , coagulation abnormality end-organ dysfunction . Previous strategy aim treat sepsis inhibition pro-inflammatory mediator , however , approach fail . This might due fact majority septic patient succumb initial pro-inflammatory `` hit '' , die later time-point pronounce immunosuppressive state . This so-called 'immunoparalysis ' , render patient extremely vulnerable secondary infection , result trigger counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory pathway along pro-inflammatory response , already start begin sepsis . Immunoparalysis increasingly recognize override immune dysfunction sepsis . As consequence , reconstitution immunocompetence emerge new promising therapeutic target improve outcome sepsis patient . Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) one commonly administer vaccine worldwide . In addition protection tuberculosis , evidence suggest BCG immunization number additional beneficial non-specific immunological effect , hereby protect infection pathogen tuberculosis . The underlie immunologic mechanism fully elucidate . Recently demonstrate monocyte functionally reprogrammed enhanced lasting phenotype vaccination BCG . Production pro-inflammatory cytokine monocyte isolate volunteer BCG vaccination , find enhance upon ex vivo stimulation non-related pathogen , even month BCG vaccination . The observed effect propose due modulation innate immune system process call 'trained immunity ' . Upon stimulation pathogen , innate immune system become prim able react faster efficient secondary ( non-related ) stimulus , even month later . Monocyte `` training '' show rely epigenetic reprogramming , namely increased methylation histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) level cytokine TLR4 gene promoter region . Considering potentiate effect BCG innate host defense , could viable treatment option sepsis-induced immunoparalysis . However , effect BCG vaccination innate immune response human hitherto show ex vivo . It yet establish whether finding extrapolate human vivo situation , previous data group indicate ex vivo measurement accurately reflect vivo situation . The human endotoxemia model , healthy volunteer receive lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) derive Escherichia coli , widely use study effect systemic inflammation human vivo consider safe highly reproducible method investigate innate immune response . Furthermore , LPS administration result hyporesponsive state towards second LPS administration call `` endotoxin tolerance '' , resemble sepsis-induced immunoparalysis , thus use model investigate therapeutic intervention reverse condition . The intended target group novel therapy , sepsis patient , immunocompromised . Therefore , use live attenuate vaccine BCG could present risk disseminate mycobacterial infection . Therefore , use γ-irradiated ( inactivate ) BCG vaccine study . Recent , yet unpublished result group Prof. Netea show effect γ-irradiated BCG monocyte training comparable live vaccine . Furthermore , study group Prof. Netea ( CMO 2013/319 ) type dose γ-irradiated BCG healthy volunteer study ex vivo responses previously approve ethic committee . Study design : A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study healthy human volunteer experimental endotoxemia . In pilot study , enrol 20 subject . On day 1 , 10 subject receive γ-irradiated BCG-vaccination 10 subject receive placebo . On day 6 , subject undergo experimental endotoxemia .</detailed_description>
