	<brief_title>Investigation Use Acupuncture Treatment Spasticity Chronic Stroke Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke one lead cause death disability Canada . There approximately 50,000 new case every year . Stroke victim often experience decreased mobility significant disability result impaired motor control velocity-dependent muscle hypertonus ( spasticity ) low extremity . Over past 25 year , increase interest use acupuncture management stroke-related neurological deficit . Research question : Is acupuncture effective sham treatment reduce low extremity spasticity , improve gait speed chronic phase stroke recovery ? Methodology Recruitment : Forty patient recruited patient rehabilitation program university affiliate teaching hospital . Group Assignment Blinding : The study design randomize double blind format . Once identify , interested patient screen eligibility intake secretary randomly assign sham ( n=20 ) acupuncture treatment ( n=20 ) group use computer random-number-generation system . Sealed envelope contain group assignment deliver acupuncture-trained therapist deliver sham true acupuncture treatment . Treating therapist ' interaction standardize minimize therapist/participant interaction bias Treating therapist remain blinded outcome assessment result . Patients blind receipt true acupuncture sham needle . Outcome measurement do single assessor blind group assignment . Intervention : Subjects attend 4 acupuncture treatment session within 3 week period . Needles apply follow acupuncture point : Jiao 's foot motor sensory scalp point ( 2 total ) 2 additional standardize acupuncture point low leg bilaterally base Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) approach . Treatment needle pre-sterilized single disposable type , 0.20 mm size 40 mm length . The location acupuncture point clean alcohol ( 99 % ) swab . Needles leave place 20 minute . In true acupuncture group , needles insert depth participant report tingle sensation ( describe De-qi TCM approach ) . Subjects randomized control group treat retractable needle avoid transcutaneous insertion acupuncture point . Outcome Measures : The following outcome measure assess blind assessor . Primary outcome measures:2-minute walk test . Secondary outcome measure : ankle range motion self report soft tissue tightness . The outcome measure time frame set baseline completion intervention period 3 week . Analysis : Descriptive statistic include mean , standard deviation frequency use describe study participant , appropriate . Paired t-test use parametric variable , number step per minute , distance 2-minute walk test dorsi-flexion range motion . Significance set p small 0.05 . All statistical analysis two side perform SPSS ( V21 ) .</detailed_description>
