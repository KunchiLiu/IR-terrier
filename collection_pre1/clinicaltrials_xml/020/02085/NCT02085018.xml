	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) disease unknown cause area normal lung tissue replace scar . As result become hard lung extract oxygen air . IPF commonly progressive , around 50 % patient diagnosed disease die approximately 3 year . The common , troublesome symptom IPF breathlessness exertion , cough . No drug treatment unequivocally show improve death rate , significantly impact upon symptom , IPF . In recent year recognise cough cause small amount liquid come stomach `` go wrong way '' lung , process commonly know `` reflux '' . As liquid stomach usually acidic , patient ' lung may repeatedly expose small amount acid . Reflux unusually common IPF could potentially contribute debilitate cough find disease . However many potential cause cough IPF . Stomach acid efficiently `` switch '' drug call `` proton pump inhibitor '' , one call omeprazole . If reflux stomach acid contribute cough IPF , omeprazole might expect reduce cough . The purpose study therefore test whether omeprazole reduce cough patient IPF . Sixty patient IPF randomly allocate 3 month omeprazole placebo . Neither patient doctor aware treatment give , ie randomise `` double-blind '' , placebo -- control trial . Patients ' cough frequency measure treatment change cough frequency compare receive omeprazole receive placebo . Change cough frequency main thing aim compare , range measurement assess number patient eligible take part , agree randomisation provide outcome data , patient ' lung function , symptom score , amount reflux , amount inflammation lung .</brief_summary>
