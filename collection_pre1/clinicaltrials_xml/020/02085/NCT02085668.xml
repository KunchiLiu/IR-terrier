	<detailed_description>Heart failure major public health problem . It associate high mortality , frequent hospitalization represent large cost health care system . Therapies ameliorate high mortality morbidity heart failure focus abrogation activate neurohormonal system associate condition . These system include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system . Strategies ameliorate sympathetic activation primarily focus blockade beta-adrenoceptor mediate adverse effect activation system upon myocardium . This highly successful strategy beta-blockers result approximately 35 % reduction mortality well improvement hospitalization quality life attenuation disease progression . However , le full blockade effect sympathetic nervous system achieve use conventional dos beta-blockers . Moreover , insignificant fraction patient unable tolerate beta-blockers able up-titrated target effective dos , large part systemic nature agent , whereas renal denervation allow selective removal kidney 's contribution central sympathetic drive without blunt compensatory mechanism . The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis also find key system involve heart failure disease progression may inhibit renal sympathetic denervation . Therefore , clear need exist strategy beneficially manipulate sympathetic activation characteristic heart failure disease process . Cardiorenal syndrome major comorbid condition patient advance chronic heart failure . In set renal hypoperfusion and/or activation neurohormonal cytokine system reduction glomerulofiltration . Renal function find major determine prognosis patient . Strategies ameliorate cardiorenal syndrome actively pursue . There considerable priori evidence suggest sympathetic nervous system , particular renal sympathetic , key factor progression cardiorenal syndrome impair tubulo-glomerular feedback . In particular renal sympathetics reduce renal perfusion vascular alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation well , indirectly , stimulation local release adenosine cause afferent glomerular arteriole constriction . We hypothesize disrupt renal sympathetic afferent efferent activity salutary adenosine inhibitory mediate effect demonstrate use renal denervation approach . A number study hypertension patient indicate Symplicity Catheter System safely denervate kidney without significant periprocedural complication . In small first-in man pilot study , involve seven normotensive patient chronic heart failure , six month renal denervation 6-min walk distance improve significantly patient ' self-assessment well-being also improve . No procedural post procedural complication follow renal denervation patient 6 month intensive follow-up found . The investigator believe therapeutic renal denervation use Symplicity Catheter promise therapy patient elevate sympathetic activity , CHF .</detailed_description>
