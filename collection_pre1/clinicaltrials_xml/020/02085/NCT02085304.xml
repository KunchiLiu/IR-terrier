	<brief_summary>A glioblastoma ( GBM ) common malignant primary brain tumor , yet easy control . Recent study show survival improves patient get aggressive surgery remove tumor start radiation ( RT ) chemotherapy ( chemo ) treatment . Surgery , RT chemo part regular cancer care GBM . RT usually do daily dos 5 day week 6 week . Beams radiation aim tumor site plus normal brain tissue around tumor area . GammaKnife® ( GK ) radiosurgery also deliver radiation large dose one day . GK send beam precise target ( tumor location ) little normal brain tissue nearby . This study compare GK treatment usual RT treatment surgery , chemo . We want know : - How well treatment keep tumor grow back . - What effect ( good bad ) treatment . - How rate quality life . - How treatment affect ability think , understand , reason , remember . - How rate ability think , understand , reason , remember . - If use certain type MRI scan show difference new tumor growth change cause treatment . - If certain feature find tumor cell help doctor predict tumor respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Resection Gliadel® Wafers , Followed Temodar® With Standard Radiation GammaKnife® New GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine single fraction GK radiosurgical treatment resection bed achieve equivalent local control survival patient GBM GTR , Gliadel® implant temozolomide therapy compare patient receive standard postoperative RT temozolomide , offer improve quality life preserve cognitive function . In Phase I , propose 20 patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) undergo gross total resection ( GTR ) Gliadel® ( carmustine ) wafer implantation resection cavity time eligible study . These patient receive Gamma Knife® ( GK ) radiosurgery resection cavity margin within 4 week follow surgical resection within 24 hour start temozolomide ( Temodar® ) induction therapy . Temozolomide ( Temodar® ) maintenance therapy would administer 12 month . In Phase II , propose 60 patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) undergo gross total resection ( GTR ) Gliadel® ( carmustine ) wafer implantation resection cavity time initial resection eligible study . These patient randomize either standard fractionate conformal radiation therapy ( RT ) Gamma Knife® ( GK ) radiosurgery resection cavity margin . Fractionated RT would administer concurrent temozolomide Gamma knife® radiosurgery resection cavity margin administer within 24 hour start temozolomide induction therapy . Both GK RT administer within 4 week follow surgical resection . Temozolomide ( Temodar® ) maintenance therapy would administer patient arm study 12 month . It believe patient benefit enrollment study regardless treatment arm randomize . All patient receive focally aggressive surgical resection Gliadel® implant addition temozolomide prevention focal distant recurrence . Patients randomize receive GK radiosurgical treatment resection bed margin may benefit increased local control base prior non-randomized study . However patient treat non-standard fashion may subject high incidence focal radiation necrosis high incidence failure beyond resection margin compare standard patient . The GK treat patient however , spar standard 6 week RT postoperatively . It hypothesize receive GK therefore improve quality life respect less fatigue , lack hair loss decrease incidence delay cognitive decline associate standard RT .</detailed_description>
