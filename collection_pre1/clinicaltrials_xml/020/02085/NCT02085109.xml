	<brief_summary>Rationale : Despite successful effort low atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration , substantial residual cardiovascular risk still present . An additive strategy lower residual risk may via raise high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol concentration , particular major protein constituent apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I ) . However , recent evidence show raise HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentration always cause reduction cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk . To understand important know target molecular mechanism underlie shift HDL fraction cardioprotective activity . There increase evidence particularly apoA-I protein HDL fraction atheroprotective . It important verify whether effect intervention actually increase apoA-I production since result formation de-novo small pre-beta HDL particle full capacity resorb cholesterol arterial wall return liver secretion ( reverse cholesterol transport ) . The investigator propose evaluate , double-blind human intervention study , difference intestinal apoA-I gene expression , healthy subject , consumption high fat ( HF ) low fat ( LF ) meal . Additionally investigator propose evaluate effect theobromine intestinal apoA-I expression . Based several study , theobromine improve cardiovascular risk parameter among elevation apoA-I HDL cholesterol concentration . It however unknown whether effect theobromine originate elevated apoA-I production , suggest improve functionality , decreased clearance , suggest reduce functionality . The investigator therefore propose also evaluate usage theobromine well way increase intestinal apoA-I mRNA protein expression , consumption HF meal . The investigator double-blind human intervention study . The theobromine add third arm LF condition . Study design : The propose study randomize , double-blind cross-over design . The total study duration 17 day , consist 3 experimental day postprandial test , separate 1 week wash-out period . Study population : Ten apparently healthy male subject , age 18-60 year , without history gastrointestinal disorder complaint . Intervention : During three experimental day , subject consume milkshake : one HF milkshake , one LF milkshake one LF milkshake supplement 850 mg theobromine . Total follow-up postprandial test 5 hour .</brief_summary>
