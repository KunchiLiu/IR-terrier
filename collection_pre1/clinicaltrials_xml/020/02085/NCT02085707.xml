	<detailed_description>Introduction : Patients young 70 year displace femoral neck serious condition . The FNF ( femoral neck fracture ) associate low activity level , hip pain substantially reduce QoL ( quality life ) . Individuals high-energy fracture , cause e.g . car accident fall great height , general healthy often normal bone quality femoral neck . In case , FNF rarely affect femoral neck rather trochanteric area femoral shaft . Relatively young individual low-energy fracture tend additional morbidity lower bone quality . The literature indicate 5 % displaced FNFs patient age 55 - 70 year . 3535 patient age 55 - 70 year register Norwegian Arthroplasty Registry Norwegian Hip Fracture Registry period 2005 - 2012 . Little research lack consensus guidance appropriate treatment patient render choice treatment health economic aspect great challenge . In study aim answer patient age 55 - 70 year displace low-energy FNF treat THA ( total hip arthroplasty ) lead well functional outcome osteosynthesis ( stabilization use hip pin ) patient-related factor identify predispose FNF ? Background : Displaced low - energy FNF patient age 55 - 70 year usually treat internal fixation implantation prosthesis . For patient old 70 year , several randomize study compare THA treatment option [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ; study find high mortality morbidity THA . Most orthopedics would probably recommend closed reposition osteosynthesis patient young 60 year [ 6 ] . Screw fixation procedure often short duration less invasive , risk need new operation failure higher prosthetic surgery . With reoperation risk complication higher first operation . How affect mortality , morbidity functional outcome patient group uncertain . Studies show low morbidity earlier mortality prosthetic surgery [ 7,8,9 ] . On hand reoperation rate fail osteosynthesis 28 - 42 % versus 10 % THA ; recent study show reoperation rate THA 5 % [ 1,2,3,4,5,10 ] . This clinical social economic importance . A study McKinley Robinson ( 2002 ) conclude THA fail osteosynthesis ( screw fixation ) associate significantly high prevalence certain complication THA first intervention [ 11 ] . Frihagen collaborator report twice many complication prosthetic surgery fail osteosynthesis ( screw fixation ) prosthetic surgery first intervention [ 12 ] . Young patient low - energy FNF often diseases condition may increase risk fail osteosynthesis . Reasons may use medication ( steroid , epilepsy medication ) , alcoholism type substance abuse presence risk factor osteoporosis [ 13 ] . Several review article meta - analysis conclude THA associate low rate complication well functional outcome treatment alternative [ 7,9,14,15 ] . Most orthopedic department Norway treat displace FNFs patient 70 year age close reduction osteosynthesis different type prosthetic surgery . Osteosynthesis usually do fluoroscopy transparent light stretch table type cannulate screw ( Hip pin ) . Hemiprostheses total hip prosthesis use joint replacement surgery . Goals project : Map patient - related factor predispose displaced FNF patient age 55 - 70 year . Map bone density measure Dexa two type surgical procedures. , Map complication functional outcome osteosynthesis ( 2 screw ) THA patient age 55 - 70 year displace FNF randomize multi center study Study procedures : This randomize multicenter study patient operate either THA osteosynthesis ( 2 screw ) functional outcome , complication reoperations compare 2 group . All patient age 55 - 70 year displace FNF low - energy trauma eligible study . Before inclusion patient sign REC - approve information sheet . Patient data record , surgery discharge . Additional control do 4 12 month . Excluded patient receive treatment local hospital would choose irrespective study . If close reduction result satisfactory position highly probable osteosynthesis fail , prosthetic surgery perform . Randomization stratify hospital block-randomized anonymous block size . Written inform consent obtain . The patient give registration number randomize one 2 treatment option . This do premade opaque seal envelope registration number contain information treatment method . Power calculation show uncover difference 10 HHS ( Harris Hip score ) ( standard deviation 15 ) , 80 % statistical power 5 % level significance , 36 patient need group . In addition one expect 15 - 20 % participant group discontinue study . From previous study assume difference Harris Hip score 10 group clinically relevant difference . If secondary endpoint complication reoperations consider , assumption make 30 % complication find osteosynthesis group 10 % complication prosthesis group , 59 patient need group . The reduction result ostesynthesis record surgery . A point system use check close reduction placement screw optimal [ 20 ] . They study split two arm , patient one arm treat closed reduction osteosynthesis fluoroscopy . The arm shall treat THA , cement reverse hybrid . The operation 2 screw quicker THA . The orthopedist duty shall include randomize patient . Tests physical mental level function do surgery researcher research coordinator . The patient enrol normal emergency operation program operate consecutively accord medical priority . No operation delay due inclusion study . The main surgeon assistant do least 25 similar operation earlier able operate patient include study . Budget : We apply fund different source . Hospitals ordinary budget provide main funding . Extra cost require Dexa measurement cover operating budget . Fundings seek `` buy extra time '' . The work do ordinary working hour within current salary researcher physiotherapist unless funding obtain .Salary part - time employee research collaborator seek externally . We apply fund additional - patient consultation , unsuccessful also finance ordinary hospital budget . Ethics , privacy data protection : The project approve Regional Independent Ethics Committee 3 July 2013 , 2013/1023 Regional Committee Medical Health Research Ethics ( REC ) South East . Inclusion patient group require close planning definition goal . The test result information record study use reach project 's goal . All information treat anonymously without identification patient ( name , personal number applicable information ) . A code link patient information test name list . After finalization project , information delete accord internal guideline . Only authorized personnel within project link actual patient name list . Information FNF send Norwegian Hip Fracture Registry Bergen patient consent . Participation study voluntary . The patient time without give reason withdraw study . This consequences treatment . Patients wish participate , sign inform consent form . Scientific clinical significance / translational science : There little research hypothetical assumption displace femoral neck fracture age 55 - 70 year may due low bone quality osteoporosis . There still need high quality study , special incidence osteoporosis treatment Norway . The project lead u worthy information treatment , functional outcome complication patient age 55 - 70 year displace FNF Norway review data Norwegian Hip Fracture Registry . Based present literature , limited information general health , type osteoporosis mental status group . The study lead increase knowledge population help choose one option treat FNF patient age 55 - 70 year . Clinical result clarify choice treatment reduction osteosynthesis versus THA . In way project contribute scientific translation knowledge clinical science clinical practice .</detailed_description>
