	<brief_title>Clofarabine Daunorubicin Hydrochloride Cytarabine Followed By Decitabine Observation Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect clofarabine induction consolidation therapy overall survival comparison standard therapy ( daunorubicin [ daunorubicin hydrochloride ] &amp; cytarabine ) newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient age &gt; = 60 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate complete remission ( CR ) rate , duration remission , toxicity/treatment-related mortality clofarabine comparison standard therapy ( daunorubicin &amp; cytarabine ) newly-diagnosed AML patient age &gt; = 60 year . II . To evaluate feasibility consolidation reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -identical donor patient achieve response induction therapy , include incidence successful engraftment , acute chronic graft-versus-host disease , transplant-related mortality , impact overall survival comparison patient receive chemotherapy . III . To evaluate duration remission disease-free survival patient complete remission follow completion consolidation therapy subsequently randomize receive schedule low-dose decitabine maintenance comparison observation . IV . To perform expression methylation profile patient receive decitabine correlate integrate epigenetic signature response decitabine . V. To examine epigenetic profile remission marrow patient randomize observation vs. decitabine determine whether epigenetic signature apparently morphologically normal bone marrow predictive relapse response decitabine maintenance . VI . To explore possible association response clofarabine ABC-transporter P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) . VII . To assess intensity expression CXC chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4 ) diagnostic leukemia cell correlate parameter establish prognostic factor . VIII . To assess entire spectrum somatic mutation affect pathways diagnosis AML elucidate association gene mutation outcome . IX . To examine impact smoking , obesity , regular acetaminophen use , regular aspirin use , benzene exposure , live rural/farm environment underlie exposure lifestyle factor associate AML development overall survival ( OS ) . X . To investigate potential correlative result array comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) finding acute myeloid leukemia patient characteristic . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare health-related quality life ( QOL ) ( physical , functional , leukemia-specific well-being ) fatigue elderly AML patient receive standard induction therapy receive clofarabine . II . To measure change health-related QOL occurs time ( within treatment group ) . III . To comprehensively assess patient function time study enrollment . IV . To determine component comprehensive geriatric assessment QOL scale predict ability complete AML treatment . V. To describe impact transplant QOL AML patient age 60 . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( STANDARD THERAPY ) : Patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 10-15 minute day 1-3 cytarabine IV continuously day 1-7 . Patients residual disease achieve aplastic bone marrow day 12-14 ( i.e. , &lt; 5 % blast &lt; 20 % cellularity markedly/moderately hypocellular ) may receive second course induction therapy begin sooner day 14 . ARM II : Patients receive clofarabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Patients residual disease achieve aplastic bone marrow day 12-14 ( i.e. , &lt; 5 % blast &lt; 20 % cellularity markedly/moderately hypocellular ) may receive second course induction therapy begin sooner day 21 later day 56 . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) CR incomplete marrow recovery ( CRi ) induction therapy proceed consolidation therapy . Patients 60-69 year age achieve `` morphologic leukemia-free state '' induction therapy HLA-identical donor proceed allogeneic stem cell transplantation . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Beginning within 60 day documentation CR CRi , patient receive consolidation therapy arm randomize induction therapy . ARM I ( STANDARD THERAPY ) : Patients receive cytarabine IV 1 hour twice daily day 1-6 . Treatment repeat every 4-6 week 2 course . ARM II : Patients receive clofarabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 4-6 week 2 course . Patients remain CR completion consolidation therapy proceed maintenance therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning within 60 day completion consolidation therapy , patient receive maintenance therapy randomize 1 2 arm . Patients eligible randomization decitabine maintenance recovery consolidation follow accord Arm I . ARM I : Patients undergo observation monthly 12 month . ARM II : Patients receive decitabine IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 month absence unacceptable toxicity . ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients begin reduced-intensity condition 30-90 day initiation induction therapy . CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -7 -3 , busulfan IV 2 hour every 6 hour day -4 -3 ( total 8 dos ) , anti-thymocyte globulin IV 4-6 hour day -4 -2 . TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 4 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
