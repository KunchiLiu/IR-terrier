	<brief_summary>To collect evidence safety administer donor-derived regulatory macrophage ( M reg ) preparation living-donor renal transplant recipient context international European Union fund consortium aim evaluate cellular immunotherapy solid organ transplantation ( The ONE Study ) . It anticipate immune regulation induce M reg therapy eventually use reduce need conventional immunosuppression transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ONE Study M Reg Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decades immunosuppressive drug development produce array powerful pharmacological agent , various drawback associate treatment leave considerable room improvement . By harness power suppressive mechanism human immune system , regulatory cell therapy may able support peripheral tolerance induce level donor-specific unresponsiveness allows reduction use conventional immunosuppression organ transplant recipient . Several alternative regulatory cell type identify potential adjunct immunotherapy solid organ transplantation approach stage development would allow clinical test early-stage trial . The EU-funded international ONE Study consortium aim answer question whether M reg treatment , immunoregulatory cell-based therapy , advance clinical management solid organ transplant recipient . This particular M reg trial aim explore potential M reg therapy adjunct immunosuppressive treatment living-donor renal transplant recipient clinical protocol design share investigator The ONE Study group test additional regulatory cell therapy separate trial .</detailed_description>
