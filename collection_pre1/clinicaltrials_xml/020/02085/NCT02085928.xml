	<brief_summary>Lateral epicondylitis ( LE ) common cause lateral elbow pain . Intratissue percutaneous electrolysis ( EPI technique ) novel minimally invasive approach consist application galvanic current puncture needle produce local inflammatory process soft tissue reparation affect tissue . The purpose study evaluate clinical ultrasonographic effectiveness multimodal program use intratissue percutaneous electrolysis technique exercise short term patient chronic lateral epicondylitis , determine whether clinical outcome achieve decline time . This study observational one-way repeated measure design . 36 patient clinical set present lateral epicondylitis ( mean age = 38 , mean time since injury = 12.6 month ) receive one session EPI per week 4-6 week , associate home program eccentric exercise stretching . The main outcome measure severity pain ( VAS , digital algometer , Cozen Thompson test ) , disability ( DASH questionnaire ) , structural tendon change ( ultrasound ) , hypervascularity ( power doppler ) patient 's perception overall outcome ( 4-point scale ) . Measurements 6 , 26 52 week follow-up include recurrence rate ( increase severity pain disability compare discharge ) , perception overall outcome success rate . Paired Student t-tests Chi square test apply data . Enrollment study end September 2012 . All outcome measure register significant improvement pre-intervention discharge . Most patient ( 30 , i.e . 83.3 % ) rat overall outcome 'successful ' 6 week . The ultrasonographic finding reveal hypoechoic region hypervascularity extensor carpus radialis brevis change significantly . At 26 52 week , participant ( 32 ) perceive 'successful ' outcome . Recurrence rate null discharge , 6 , 26 52 week follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients receive one session EPI technique per week 4 week ( 6 week pain persist ) associate home program consist eccentric exercise ( EccEx ) stretching , initiate 24 hour session . The EccEx stretch program taught physiotherapist first session monitor subsequent session . At discharge , patient instruct perform EccEx daily first 6 week follow-up period . The EPI technique perform ultrasound-guidance clinically relevant area ( area maximum tenderness palpation ultrasonographic degenerative tendon change ) use intensity 4-6 milliampere ( mA ) 3 second , approximately 3 time . The investigator use EPI machine ( Cesmar Electromedicina S.L. , Barcelona , Spain ) GE Logiq E Portable Ultrasound Machine GE Linear probe 12L-RS ( 5-13 mhz ) ( GE Healthcare , Wisconsin , EEUU ) . During EPI technique , patient place supine position , affect elbow place position 90째 flexion maximum pronation . The elbow sterilize sonographic transducer , enclose sterile cover sterile apply gel , place lateral epicondyle ( first approach ) humeroradial joint head radius capitulum humerus ( second approach ) , remain throughout procedure . A common target area deep surface common extensor tendon ( origin ECRB [ extensor carpus radialis brevis ] EDC [ extensor digitorum communis ] ) ( first approach ) deep surface ECRB , capsule lateral ulnar collateral ligament ( second approach ) . A 0.3 x 25mm . ( 1 inch ) needle insert 30째 45째 angle skin direction lateral epicondyle ( first approach ) 80째 angle skin , needle tip direct towards humeroradial joint ( second approach ) . In first approach needle advance parallel longitudinal plane tendon ( in-plane approach ) ; whereas second approach needle advance along short plane humeroradial joint ( out-of-plane approach ) . Real-time ultrasonographic imaging provide guidance procedure . Once needle reach target tissue , readjustment needle position make order ensure correct stimulation . The generation galvanic current creates white image ( hyperechoic ) result liberation hydrogen gas due electrolysis . Oral paracetamol use necessary purpose pain relief . The eccentric exercise program consist three series 10 repetition eccentric work , repeat twice daily ( morning afternoon ) , maximum load ( initially one kilogram ) optimal functional pain-free range . From maximum wrist extension radial deviation , rapid wrist flexion movement perform , follow 2-second hold final position . In series patient give rest period 2-3 minute . This formula use duration physiotherapy program . The concentric contraction phase return start position nullify help hand . The stretch program consist stretch exercise epicondylar muscle consist three series 7 repetition twice day ( morning afternoon ) , perform sit position flexed wrist finger , ulnar deviation elbow extension reach stretch limit without bounce , hold 45 second , 30-second rest repetition .</detailed_description>
