	<detailed_description>1 . Background : The prevalence gastroesophageal-junction cancer increase Denmark 400 patient per year . The 5-year overall survival le 10 % 2/3 patient , consider resectable . Even 1/3 , treat surgical intervention neoadjuvant chemotherapy , overall-survival approximately 30 % . The current Danish intend curative treatment consist esophagectomy a.m. Ivor Lewis extend lymphadenectomy abdomen thorax . Furthermore , perioperative chemotherapy consist 6 series neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Unresectable patient receive palliative chemotherapy resection . Peritoneal wash cytology recommend prediagnostic modality gastric cancer . The method use detect free peritoneal cancer cell abdominal cavity , even macroscopic carcinomatosis present . Carcinomatosis find 19 % gastric cancer patient , often peritoneum . Positive peritoneal cytology ( C1 ) identify 7 % gastric cancer patient without metastasis ( C1M0 ) . Lots study indicate C1-disease independent prognostic predictor decrease survival , increased recurrence rate , comparable M1 patient ( i.e . patient distant metastasis ) . The American Joint Committee cancer recommend C1 patient treat non-surgically - even M1 disease identify . On basis , PWC use identify patient great risk recurrence , thereby candidate intend curative treatment . It fact , though , C1M0 patient well survival C1M1 patient . Currently , level-1 evidence support specific treatment C1M0 patient , research require approach patient group comprehensive way . Therefore , focus group study C1M0 patient , difference opinion . Furthermore , evidence base gastric carcinoma , GEJ-cancer patient group , examine . Results investigator regard treatment C1M0 patient : Lee et al . find median survival 21 month 4 month gastrectomized versus non-gastrectomized patient . Lorentzen et al . find median 5-year survival 71,4 % 25 % gastrectomized patient , C1 stag laparoscopy convert preoperative chemotherapy versus persistent C1-disease preoperative chemotherapy . Another interesting treatment modality C1M0 patient extensive intraperitoneal lavage ( EIPL ) examine Japanese study group . 88 C1M0 patient randomize three group ; 1 . Gastrectomy , 2 . Gastrectomy + intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( IPC ) , 3 . Gastrectomy + IPC + EIPL . Group 3 compare group 2 significant good 5 year overall survival 43,8 % versus 4,6 % ( p &lt; 0,0001 ) . Further research require establish specific guideline C1M0 patient . 2 . Purpose : Peritoneal wash cytology ( PWC ) perform standard prediagnostic modality Rigshospitalet patient , gastric- GEJ cancer , consider resectable precede multidisciplinary conference . Most study past 20-years focus gastric cancer , specifically GEJ-cancer . This study determine usefulness peritoneal wash cytology , thereby , verify standard regard GEJ-cancer . Furthermore , determine effect neoadjuvant chemotherapy free peritoneal tumor cell , correlate overall survival . See outcome measure detail description . This study intend validation standard . 3 . Methods Our current algorithm include peritoneal washing perform two different time point : A . Staging laparoscopy use one port technique After pneumoperitoneum oversight abdomen establish , puncture create subhepatically midclavicular line pigtail catheter ch . 10 . - 500ml sterile 37°C NaCl inject catheter manually disperse throughout abdomen position operate table different position . - At least 200ml fluid aspirate subhepatically catheter . - 100ml analyse experienced pathologist malignant cancer cell . B . Initially , operation ( transthoracic esophagectomy ) : either open operation robot assist Robot assist : technique Open operation : • After abdominal incision exploration 500ml °C sterile NaCl manually disperse abdominal cavity . - Peritoneal washing aspirate subhepatically - Further algorithm describe 4 . Recruiting patient : 90 consecutive patient biopsy verified GEJ-cancer include . Because PWC already standard guideline group patient Rigshospitalet , direct inclusion patient . 5 . Study design : Prospective feasibility study . Patients consider candidate intented curative therapy , accord The Danish Esophagus- , GEJ- Gastric Cancer Association ( DECV ) , include . Furthermore , patient must undergo evaluation multidisciplinary panel specialist include specialty surgical gastroenterology , thoracic surgery , oncology , pathology , radiology , clinical nuclear medicine . 6 . Data : Patient data obtain internal system Rigshospitalet include OPUS , LABKA , PatologiWEB , ORBIT . The following preoperative data obtain : - age , sex , initial symptom , tumour stag ( TNM version 7 ) histology characteristic , disease anamnesis , chemotherapy treatment , medicine anamnesis , comorbidity , postoperative complication , mortality , specific regard PWC injected volume NaCl , procedure time , aspirate amount fluid , cytology finding . 7 . Approval : Authorization data retreatment approve The Danish Data Protection Agency . Approval The Danish Ethics Committee apply , study validation standard guideline . 8 . Finances : The following contributor finance study : The Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Mogens Andreasen Fonden , Familien Erichsens familiefond , Rigshospitalet . All expense cover . 9 . Results Both negative positive result publish national and/or international journal . 10 . Practical feasibility The relevant patient medical expertise find surgical gastroenterology department Rigshospitalet . 120 stag laparoscopy perform per year handle gastric cancer patient . Persons department involve study agree allocate time resource study . Furthermore , department technician affiliate institution full time basis , go provide development , optimization , assistance project associate GEJ-cancer .</detailed_description>
