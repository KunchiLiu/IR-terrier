An intervention regular email contact IBD nurse may especially benefit transition community gastroenterology practice geographic region difficulty access gastroenterology care . The lack continuity care may lead delay treatment may associate poor clinical outcome . Research Question Hypothesis : Our primary question whether regular email contact IBD nurse improve health outcome . We hypothesize interaction , augment continuity care lead increase patient satisfaction , increase medical adherence , improve transition readiness , decreased disease activity , consequently decrease costly visit emergency department hospitalization . Study Design : Multi-center randomized control clinical trial Study population inclusion/exclusion criterion : This study comprise adolescent subject recruit IBD clinic Hospital Sick Children , McMaster Children 's Hospital Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario meet follow inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) diagnosis IBD ; ( 2 ) least age 16 year old ; ( 3 ) planning undergo transition care follow gastroenterologist either academic center community ; ( 4 ) access email mean telecommunication . We exclude subject reside Canada enrol Ontario Health Insurance Plan exit pediatric care . Registration OHIP , even reside different province , require monitoring health utilization . Health Implications : Our study may demonstrate cost-savings decrease non-routine healthcare utilization couple improvement health outcome may support widespread use routine email-based interaction IBD ally health provider pediatric-adult transition period .</detailed_description>
