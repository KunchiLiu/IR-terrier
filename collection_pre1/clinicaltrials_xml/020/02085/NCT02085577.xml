	<brief_summary>Patients daily use opioids may develop high postoperative pain level , often need high dos morphine therefore pain may difficult treat . A low dose old anesthetic drug , ketamine , administer surgery possibly reduce pain morphine consumption patient . Our purpose investigate effect low dose ketamine morphine consumption pain spine surgery patient daily use opioids . Our hypothesis low dose ketamine reduce morphine consumption , pain side-effects spine surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Intraoperative Ketamine Opioid Consumption Pain After Spine Surgery Opioid-dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid-dependent patient develop hyperalgesia often high opioid consumption postoperatively due opioid tolerance . Intraoperative ketamine subanesthetic dos possibly reduce hyperalgesia reduce opioid-tolerance patient . Ketamine non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist work block NMDA receptor central peripheral nerve system . It use general anesthesia drug also property include lower central excitability reduce postoperative opioid tolerance model opioid receptor . Further possibly reduce chronic pain block wind-up effect block NMDA receptor . Our purpose investigate effect intraoperative ketamine opioid consumption pain spine surgery opioid-dependent patient . Our hypothesis ketamine reduce opioid consumption reduce postoperative pain side effect compare placebo .</detailed_description>
