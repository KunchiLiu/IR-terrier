	<brief_summary>Dementia frequent cognitive disorder among elderly individual . Its prevalence 15-20 % population age 65 . The common form dementia among elderly demented patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( prevalence 70 % ) Vascular dementia ( VD ) ( prevalence 30-40 % ) .There also high rate ( 40 % ) coexisting AD VD among dementia patient , define mixed dementia . Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) pre-dementia phase cognitive decline . It also consider prodromal phase VD AD . Its basic clinical feature include : cognitive concern , reflect change cognition , report patient informant ( i.e. , historical observe evidence decline time ) , objective evidence impairment one cognitive domain ( i.e. , formal cognitive testing ) , well preservation independence functional ability demented ( i.e. , significant impairment social occupational functioning ) . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) investigate treatment numerous diseases 300 year . The principal effect HBOT increase solubility oxygen plasma level sufficient support tissue minimal oxygen supply carry hemoglobin . Clinical study publish year present convince evidence hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) covet neurotherapeutic method brain repair . Thus , seem HBOT might efficient clinically feasible method capable increase tissue/cellular oxygenation effectively evoke neuroplasticity chronically vascular-lesioned area post microvascular lesion phase . This prospective , randomized , control cross , study evaluate effect HBOT patient suffer Mild Cognitive Impairment Vascular Subcortical Ischemia .</brief_summary>
