	<detailed_description>Observational , prospective , post-authorisation multicentre study . The study include patient recent diagnosis ( &lt; 3 month ) MDS CMML , receive immediate active/support treatment observation approach ( `` wait see '' ) initially adopt , per normal clinical practice participate site . The minimum follow-up period participant patient 36 month recruitment , survival document , differentiate 1 . Patients start immediate active treatment : data collect every 3 month every time event arises active treatment phase . After final dose initial treatment therapy , data collection take place every 6 month post-treatment follow-up phase , regardless number time patient attends medical appointment , minimum 36 month ' follow-up start active treatment . 2 . Patients initial treatment strategy support treatment observation : minimum follow-up period 36 month establish date inclusion study , data collection every 6 month whenever event occur , regardless number time patient attend medical appointment . The need treatment MDS ( CMML , applicable ) period consider event , data collect every 3 month time event occur entire active treatment phase . After final dose initial treatment therapy , data collection take place every 6 month post-treatment follow-up phase , regardless number time patient attends medical appointment , minimum 36 month ' follow-up start active treatment . Patients include consecutively , without treatment prescription decision affect decision include patient study . Indeed , order ensure presence patient MDS different prognosis patient CMML , inclusion stratify follow three cohort , include patient receive immediate treatment initially opt observation/support : - Group 1 : Patients low intermediate-1 risk MDS per International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) 1 . - Group 2 : Patients intermediate-2 high risk MDS per IPSS . - Group 3 : Patients type CMML per prognosis index CMML Prognostic Scoring System ( CPSS ) 2 . A total 600 patient expect recruit 50 site . Primary objective : To assess clinical evolution time diagnosis patient MDS CMML , within normal clinical practice . The study assess event free survival ( EFS ) depend therapeutic strategy initially adopt investigator diagnosis MDS CMML normal clinical practice condition . EFS define period time elapsed diagnosis condition ( MDS CMML ) appearance one follow event : - Progression disease , - All-cause death , - Appearance clinically significant condition require change initial therapeutic strategy , - Appearance adverse event* require treatment suspend . *This apply patient include study , active support treatment . Secondary objective : 1 . To describe demographic , clinical ( include MDS CMML classification per WHO 2008 ( 5 , 19 ) ) , analytical characteristic patient recently diagnose MDS CMML . Clinical characteristic include health assessment per CIRS-G scale ( Cumulative Illness Rating Scale Geriatrics ) , comorbidity rating SMD ( MDS-CI ) Della Porta Malcovatti , 20 scale use across participate site normal clinical practice , performance status patient per ECOG scale . 2 . To describe therapeutic strategy initially apply patient MDS CMML , base clinical characteristic ( specific cytogenetic alteration , adverse event , etc . ) , age , health status ( CIRS-G scale ) , ECOG IPSS ( IPSS-R ) CPSS , addition reason adopt different initial therapeutic strategy . 3 . To analyse response MDS/CMML treatment base IWG ( International Working Group ) response criterion myelodysplasia , modified 2006 . 4 . To describe patient evolution base time-dependent response parameter . - Time Progression disease ( TTP ) per IWG response criterion modify 2006 . - Evolution acute myeloblastic leukaemia ( AML ) ( median time transformation AML ) . - To analyse progression free survival ( PFS ) inclusion study document progression MDS CMML death follow-up . - Overall survival ( OS ) measure date diagnosis disease date all-cause death , applicable . - Assessment overall response rate dependence red blood cell platelet transfusion . 5 . To document tolerance profile ( safety ) treatment administer normal clinical practice condition . 6 . To describe use healthcare resource relate initial therapeutic strategy MDS CMML normal clinical practice , financially measure , explore possible difference treat/do treat option different therapeutic regimen administer . 7 . To describe clinically significant event require change initial therapeutic strategy ( count EFS , primary objective study ) .</detailed_description>
