	<brief_title>MK-3475 Melanoma NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While recent advance treatment metastatic melanoma NSCLC ( non-small cell lung cancer ) agent target PD-1 striking , remain significant need develop therapy patient untreated brain metastasis exclude prior trial MK-3475 majority study diseases . The brain common site disease spread many solid tumor , notably metastatic melanoma NSCLC . 10-40 % patient metastatic melanoma develop brain metastasis lifetime &gt; 75 % brain metastasis autopsy . Overall , historical melanoma patient cohort report median survival patient brain metastasis order 2.5 - 4 month despite use whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) surgery . One old patient series show median survival &lt; 4 month melanoma patient brain metastasis neurological death rate &gt; 30 % despite treatment intracranial metastasis whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . Among NSCLC , 10 % brain metastases presentation another 30 % develop course disease . Survival development brain metastasis dismal NSCLC melanoma . Multifocal disease common disease , half patient CNS disease present one brain lesion . Patients untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial systemic therapy two reason : ( 1 ) historically prognosis poor ( overall survival ≤ 4 month ) ( 2 ) experimental drug presume penetrate blood brain barrier ( BBB ) BBB penetration well study . In melanoma , example , one phase III study evaluate ipilimumab exclude patient untreated brain metastases another study evaluate ipilimumab dacarbazine exclude patient history brain metastasis , regardless prior treatment . A subsequent trial ipilimumab patient untreated brain metastasis indeed show drug activity treat CNS disease . In initial vemurafenib study , patient progress unstable CNS metastasis exclude . The pivotal BRIM-3 trial exclude patient brain metastasis unless metastasis definitively treat three month prior trial enrollment . Both temodar sorafenib cross BBB . Initial study sorafenib alone combination chemotherapy exclude patient active brain metastasis . A combination study temodar sorafenib patient without brain metastasis show modest activity patient without history prior temodar , think favorable part due local therapy . Although number study conduct melanoma patient untreated brain metastasis use establish therapy , initial clinical trial novel agent exclude patient . A recent trial dabrafenib , inhibitor mutate B-raf , exception long-standing paradigm . A phase I/II study agent include subset patient untreated brain metastasis . At 2010 meet European Society Medical Oncology , Long et al report nine ten patient untreated cerebral metastasis enrol trial shrinkage brain lesion . This basis recent phase II trial dabrafenib specific patient untreated brain metastases61 . In NSCLC , small number trial show combination chemotherapy regimens induce response CNS untreated brain metastasis median PFS 4 month . These study demonstrate asymptomatic brain metastasis , similar asymptomatic metastasis site , treat systemically clinical trial , drug activity CNS necessarily different metastatic location . Current standard care brain metastasis require immediate local intervention ( base symptom , location , size , concern feature ) craniotomy resection radiation therapy . As adjunct standard craniotomy , LITT emerge new , minimally invasive local therapy treat previously surgically inaccessible brain metastasis . Not cell death instantaneous , thus decrease risk delay intra-tumoral hemorrhage , another theoretical advantage use LITT part management brain metastasis hyperthermia break blood brain barrier edge coagulation region thereby possibly increase access chemotherapeutic agent lesion . In patient either craniotomy LITT perform , biopsy tumor surround normal brain also obtain time local therapy . The purpose trial study activity MK-3475 untreated brain metastasis melanoma NSCLC . Given promise initial result MK-3475 disease lack data patient untreated brain metastasis thus far , trial study treatment patient population . Additionally , patient melanoma trial require local therapy craniotomy LITT least 1 brain lesion prior systemic therapy , thereby allow acquisition brain tumor tissue correlative study biomarkers may predictive clinical response CNS systemically . We also require biopsy extra-cerebral metastasis feasible , particularly tissue brain lesion obtain patient NSCLC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma NSCLC : 1 . Patients metastatic melanoma must least two untreated brain metastasis include : At least one cerebral metastasis require local intervention amenable craniotomy LITT therapy either due symptom , lesion size , location , edema hemorrhage ( `` surgical lesion '' ) . Alternatively , patient may eligible one cerebral metastasis resect prior enrollment tumor tissue available analysis . At least one ADDITIONAL cerebral metastasis least 5 mm OR twice MRI slice thickness , less 20 mm , asymptomatic require local therapy time enrollment ( `` clinically evaluable lesion ( ) '' ) . OR 2 . Patients stage IV NSCLC least one cerebral metastasis least 5 mm OR twice MRI slice thickness , less 20 mm , asymptomatic require local therapy time enrollment ( `` clinically evaluable lesion ( ) '' ) . 2 . Age &gt; 18 3 . Adequate organ function 4 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 5 . Any number previous treatment exception previous inhibitor PD1 ; prior systemic therapy must administer least 2 week administration MK3475 6 . Life expectancy least 3 month 7 . A history radiotherapy brain metastasis allow , provide least 14 day lapse prior initiation MK3475 . Any lesion present time WBRT include stereotactic radiotherapy field NOT consider evaluable unless document progressed since treatment . 8 . PDL1 expression least 5 % cell tumor tissue site require patient NSCLC . PDL1 expression require patient melanoma . Expression determine Merck use inhouse assay . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function : 10 . For woman childbearing potential , agreement use two acceptable method contraception , include one barrier method , study 6 month discontinuation MK3475 . 11 . For men female partner childbearing potential , agreement use latex condom , advise female partner use additional method contraception study 6 month discontinuation MK3475 . 12 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day commencement treatment premenopausal woman . 13 . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Symptoms may present surgical lesion prior resection LITT must resolve follow local therapy ( ie symptom attributable clinically evaluable lesion ) 2 . Radiotherapy local therapy within 14 day enrollment 3 . The use corticosteroid control cerebral edema treat neurologic symptom allow . Lowdose steroid use ( ≤10 mg prednisone equivalent ) corticosteroid replacement therapy allow 4 . Presence leptomeningeal disease 5 . Presence active autoimmune disease . Autoimmune thyroid disease allow thyroid function within normal range 6 . Pregnancy breast feed . 7 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 8 . Either concurrent condition ( include medical illness , active infection require treatment intravenous antibiotic presence laboratory abnormality ) history prior condition place patient unacceptable risk he/she treat study drug medical condition confounds ability interpret data study . 9 . Concurrent , active malignancy ( cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma ) 10 . Any contraindication MRI ( i.e . patient pacemaker metal implanted medical device ) . An MRI safety questionnaire require prior MR image . 11 . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . 12 . Evidence interstitial lung disease .</criteria>
