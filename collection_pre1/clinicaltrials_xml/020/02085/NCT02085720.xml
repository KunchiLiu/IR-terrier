	<brief_summary>Objective : Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome ( OSAS ) common form sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) cause sleep fragmentation , daytime sleepiness , cognitive function impairment , poor health status addition increase risk cardiovascular complication . OSAS equally common among middle-aged male Caucasian Hong Kong ( HK ) Chinese population prevalence least 4 % . However , prevalence OSAS elderly population Asia include HK unknown . Study Design : A sleep questionnaire conduct 1000 subject age least 60 yrs elderly community center focus symptom OSAS , subjective sleepiness , restless leg syndrome , sleep-related habit routine , addition past medical history medication . Home sleep study ( EMBLETTA ) capable record sleep ( single EEG channel ) , respiratory event , snore , respiratory effort oximetry perform 300 subject randomly . Those negative technical inadequate EMBLETTA study high pre-test probability moderate severe OSA invite undergo hospital-based polysomnography confirmation sleep apnoea status . Subjects AHI &gt; 15/hr regardless symptoms AHI 5-15/hr plus comorbid condition excessive daytime sleepiness offer continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) titration follow CPAP treatment , serial assessment subjective sleepiness , quality life , cognitive function . Outcome measure : prevalence rate SDB ( AHI &gt; 10 , &gt; 15 &gt; 30/hr ) , OSAS , sleep disturbance , restless leg syndrome ( RLS ) . In addition , examine factor predictive presence SDB population , assess CPAP acceptance , compliance , treatment outcome OSAS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common form sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) characterize repetitive episode cessation breathe sleep due upper airway collapse . It cause sleep fragmentation , disable daytime sleepiness , impaired cognitive function poor quality life . In addition , OSAS associate non-fatal fatal cardiovascular consequence include sudden death , addition increase risk road traffic accident . OSAS equally common among middle-aged male Caucasian Hong Kong ( HK ) Chinese population prevalence least 4 % . However , prevalence OSAS elderly Southeast Asia unknown . Sleep disturbance , daytime sleepiness , SDB non-respiratory cause include insomnia , restless leg syndrome common elderly . There also frequent sometimes prolonged nocturnal awakening , lead decline sleep efficiency ( total time asleep percentage time bed ) . However , disruption sleep architecture exaggerate presence OSAS . The associated hypersomnolence exacerbate normal tendency old people sleep day , affect functional independence . While OSAS produce large negative impact health quality life , recognition always straightforward presence co-morbidities normal age-related change sleep quality behavior . Once OSAS suspect , relatively easy diagnose , usually respond well treatment CPAP . Method A sleep questionnaire conduct 1000 subject age least 60 yrs elderly community center focus symptom OSAS , subjective sleepiness , restless leg syndrome , sleep-related habit routine , addition past medical history medication . Home sleep study EMBLETTA device capable record sleep ( single EEG channel ) , respiratory event , snore , respiratory effort oximetry perform 300 subject randomly . Descriptions device validity method use collect display data publish previously among local Chinese population . It multi-channel screen tool measure airflow nasal cannula connected pressure transducer , provide AHI base recording time . It also detect respiratory abdominal effort effort sensor differentiate obstructive central event . The body position detect built-in sensor . Respiratory event score desaturations least 4 % occur absence move artifact irrespective co-existing change snore heart rate . A hypopnea define decrease airflow 50 % baseline least 10 second . Data include analysis total record evaluation time 4 hr longer obtain EMBLETTA study . Those negative technical inadequate EMBLETTA study high pre-test probability moderate severe OSA invite undergo hospital-based polysomnography confirmation sleep apnoea status . As OSA may increase risk cardiovascular mortality , elderly subject AHI ≥ 15 AHI ≥ 5 plus either cardiovascular risk factor Epworth Sleepiness Score ( ESS ) score ≥ 10 receive patient education program . Subjects agree CPAP therapy offer basic CPAP education package consist 10-min CPAP education programme respiratory nurse explain basic operation care CPAP device mask , educational brochure OSA CPAP treatment Chinese , careful mask fitting , short trial CPAP therapy automatic CPAP machine ( AUTOSET CPAP ) device ( RESMED , Sydney , Australia ) approximately 30 minute acclimatization afternoon . Attended CPAP titration perform AUTOSET auto-titrating device hospital . Throughout night next morning nurse duty would deal discomfort relate CPAP treatment . The CPAP pressure patient set minimal pressure need abolish snoring , obstructive respiratory event airflow limitation 95 % night determine overnight AutoSet CPAP titration study . The patient subsequently follow physician nurse CPAP clinic 1 month 3 month later deal problem CPAP device mask fit . Subjects agree home CPAP treatment prescribe nasal CPAP unit time clock assess objective compliance ( run time ) . ESS , sleep apnea-specific quality life index ( SAQLI ) , cognitive function test perform baseline 3 month CPAP treatment .</detailed_description>
