	<brief_summary>Individuals anorexia nervosa ( AN ) long observed demonstrate symptom common obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , particular , obsessive fear normal weight lead dangerous food restriction , well many compulsive ritual food . Both AN OCD seriously handicap often resistant conventional therapy . Given two condition often co-occur associate still unknown genetic risk factor , aim project identify share distinct pattern brain activity . The investigator propose use functional magnetic resonance imaging compare brain response among adolescent AN , OCD , age-matched healthy individual . Specifically , study investigate function distinct brain circuit relate core aspect related disorder . The investigator use three task relate set shifting , global vs. local processing , reward . Based evidence deficit cognitive flexibility ability change behavior , investigator hypothesize adolescent AN OCD show hypoactivity frontostriatal circuitry cognitive task , adolescent AN show hyperactivity limbic region reward task . This study first directly compare brain activation pattern use functional neuroimaging AN OCD . The goal determine abnormal brain activity relate symptom formation , account share characteristic amongst disorder , whether deficit specific circuitry underlie unique defining feature . The study share unique element functional brain circuitry reflect new , emerge approach classification psychiatric illness , one base identifying unique combination biological risk factor link related condition . This approach widely believe critical step forward develop brain-relevant targeted strategy preventative intervention .</brief_summary>
