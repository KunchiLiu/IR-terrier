	<brief_summary>The puncture vascular access hemodialysis patient remain challenge even hand experience dialysis nurse . Unsuccessful puncture associate resource wastage , traumatism AV shunt , shorten effective dialysis time poor patient satisfaction . The use ultrasound emergency department nurse technician without prior ultrasound experience patient difficult intravenous access show several study efficient . The investigator expect achieve similar result cannulation AV shunt dialysis nurse staff short learning program . To show , investigator aim conduct trail standard cannulation technique ( inspection , palpation ) compare ultrasound-assisted method term efficacy , safety patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Assisted Puncture AV Fistulas Chronic Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The vascular access play central role patient end-stage renal disease undergo chronic hemodialysis . It well document various previous study confection dialysis access subsequent complication represent major cause morbidity , hospitalization additional cost chronic dialysis patient . In European country patient undergo chronic hemodialysis use arterio-venous fistula permanent vascular access . Because anatomical difference individual accompany chronic disease affect patient ' vessel , cannulation arterio-venous fistula challenge nurse personal puncture failure necessitate repeat attempt rare . The latter often time-consuming result loss effective dialysis ' time reduce proceeded total blood volume , associate high rate local complication due repeat traumatisms vascular wall lead severe pain reduce patient satisfaction . In investigator ' dialysis unit , dialysis nurse able puncture fistula refers experience nurse try cannulate fistula thorough visual palpatory evaluation . In case another failure , nursing team refers dialysis physician , perform short diagnostic bed-side ultrasound vascular access rule presence thrombosis large hematoma . Using ultrasound-guidance provide physician inform localization depth ideal puncture site , dialysis nurse try puncture fistula . This often lead great loss time reduce effective dialysis dose , increase need human resource low patient satisfaction . The use ultrasound emergency department nurse technician without prior ultrasound experience patient difficult intravenous access show several study efficient . The method safe , procedure rapid , patient satisfy , success rate high ultrasound train emergency physician need physician intervention reduce . The achievement similar result AV fistula cannulation hemodialysis patient would suitable . The use ultrasound patient recognize difficult fistula dialysis nurse short ultrasound learn program provide index nurse enable achieve high rate satisfactory double-needle puncture , usual blood flow rate full dialysis length less time loss increase patient satisfaction . With study prospective , single-centre , randomize , control study investigator aim show use ultrasound dialysis nurse patient difficult fistulas make punction fistula easier assess fistula visually manually . Objective The use ultrasound patient recognize difficult fistula dialysis nurse short ultrasound learn program provide index nurse enable achieve high rate satisfactory double-needle puncture , usual blood flow rate full dialysis length less time loss increase patient satisfaction . With prospective , control trail investigator want demonstrate hypothesis . Methods A portable ultrasound device use nursing staff short learning program . Precise location AV shunt segment depth assessed case difficult shunt . This procedure compare standard inspection palpation method .</detailed_description>
