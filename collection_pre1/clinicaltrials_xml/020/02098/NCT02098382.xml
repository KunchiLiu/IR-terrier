	<detailed_description>Nowadays rise need non-pharmacological cervical ripening method use prostaglandin frequently limit various contraindication . Dilapan-S hygroscopic uterine neck dilator . Its mode action consist hydrophilic property device absorb fluid surround tissue structure , thus expand volume Dilapan-S stick subsequently exert radial pressure surround structure ( uterine neck ) dilate progressively . Endocervical pressure uterine neck result mechanical dilatation pressure endocervical structure also stimulate production endogenous prostaglandin , promote cervical ripening collagenolytic action . Although Dilapan-S widely use labor pre-induction , publish study data compare clinical efficacy safety female with/without caesarean section medical history lacking .</detailed_description>
