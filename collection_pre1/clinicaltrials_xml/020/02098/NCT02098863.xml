	<brief_summary>Despite important work previous sickle cell disease ( SCD ) cohort study , remain many understudied area require investigation . An important knowledge deficit slow progressive process chronic end-organ dysfunction . The majority organ dysfunction become apparent young adult year , comprehensive assessment adult understanding predictor adulthood organ dysfunction insufficient . Similarly , role disease-modifying therapy , hydroxyurea , prevent organ dysfunction later life clear . Extended follow-up patient transition adulthood imperative understand long-term implication pediatric sickle cell care . This observational study collect data systematic fashion participant ' regular clinic visit answer objective describe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The St. Jude Pediatric SCD Program develop comprehensive plan care span age 0 25 , provide structure screen monitor disease progression complication infancy , childhood , young adulthood . From age 0 18 , SCD patient follow St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital . At age 18 , care transfer Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Center Memphis routinely follow age 18 25 year . After age 25 , participant follow invited return St. Jude every 6 year study related test participant elect come study death . Three St. Jude Affiliate location also sit enrollment protocol patient age 0 18 year . These include St. Jude Affiliate site locate : Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; Peoria , Illinois ; Charlotte , North Carolina . Approximately 500 additional participant expect enrolled affiliate site . This protocol collect data SCD participant birth end life . The SCD plan care provide specific sequence laboratory image study perform accord patient 's age expect course illness . The following health outcome systematically monitor patient SCD : hematologic index , pulmonary function , cardiac function , renal function , cognitive function , cerebral vasculopathy , vitamin D deficiency bone health , parvovirus B19 immune status , ophthalmologic status , splenic function . These test use direct patient 's clinical management initiate therapy necessary . In study , result test collect entered study database , provide longitudinal data inform health outcome research regard SCD course alter disease-modifying therapy , addition facilitate future interventional project . Primary Objectives : - To establish longitudinal clinical cohort patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) serve research resource facilitate evaluation health outcome SCD pediatric care adulthood . - To facilitate collection biological sample patient SCD use future study investigate genetic epigenetic contribution disease severity , response treatment , morbidity mortality . Secondary Objectives : - To determine incidence , prevalence , severity SCD complication adverse health condition within SCD cohort five stage development adulthood : newborn period ( birth 6 month ) , infant/pre-school stage ( age 6 month 6 year ) , early school stage ( age 6 12 year ) , adolescent stage ( age 12 18 year ) , year transition young adulthood ( age 18 25 year ) , adulthood ( age 26 year ) . - To identify evaluate risk factor premature mortality long-term morbidity patient SCD , include relate disease-modifying therapy , end-organ damage , genetics , neurocognitive deficit , psychosocial factor , behavioral cause . - To investigate long-term effect hydroxyurea therapy preservation organ function , growth development , frequency severity disease complication , long-term medical , neurocognitive , psychosocial toxicity . - To determine functional aspect Transition Adult Care Program within clinical research cohort evaluate disease specific health literacy readiness relation healthcare utilization adult care .</detailed_description>
