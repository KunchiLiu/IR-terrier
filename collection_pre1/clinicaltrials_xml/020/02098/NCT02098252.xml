	<detailed_description>Intracranial arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) relatively uncommon increasingly discover lesion lead significant neurological disability death.1 Population-based data suggest annual incidence discovery symptomatic AVM approximately 1.1 per 100 000 population.7 . AVMs commonly present follow intracranial hemorrhage seizure , although contemporary brain imaging technique , increase number incidental lesion found.2 Intracranial AVMs typically diagnose age 40 year old , 50 % patient present follow intracranial hemorrhage , fear sequela harbour AVM.3 An AVM-related seizure report presenting feature 20-25 % cases4 , 5 although sometimes successfully manage anti-epileptic agent , AVMs lead intractable seizure spite medication . Other presentation include headache , focal neurological deficit , pulsatile tinnitus.1 The available natural history study indicate overall risk initial hemorrhage approximately 2 % 4 % per year , although long-term consequence term probability death long-term disability follow intracranial hemorrhage remain unclear.6-8 Mortality first hemorrhage report occur 10-30 % patient rupture AVM , although recent data suggest mortality rate may lower 10-20 % survivor long-term disability.9-11 Hemorrhagic presentation consider reliable risk factor repeat hemorrhage.6 , 8 Unfortunately , natural history data available sufficient quality ( Level V ) support make management recommendation . Over last decade , substantial development management intracranial AVMs . There evolution microsurgical well endovascular radiosurgical technique treat lesion . As management option evolve , individual combine modality treatment protocol develop different institution management AVMs . Current interventional therapy brain arteriovenous malformation ( BAVMs ) vary include open neurosurgical resection , radiosurgery , endovascular management , either alone combination . The choice management largely dependent decision local physician make treatment team , recent survey demonstrate substantial variability decision-making almost AVMs.12 Interventional therapy , perform , assume decrease risk initial subsequent hemorrhage therefore lead well long-term outcome , assumption yet proven . Although question AVM treatment modality appropriate first choice ( surgery , radiosurgery , embolization ) remain controversial , consensus reach several circumstance . Surgical evacuation hematoma exert significant mass effect uncontested appropriate management , although many patient hemorrhagic presentation necessarily meet threshold surgical indication . Almost management choice remain debatable.13 , 14 A systematic review propose approximately 7.1 % surgical candidate , 6.6 % endovascular candidate , 5.1 % radiosurgical candidate face permanent neurological deficit treatment.15 The epidemiological study Davies et al , use Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base surrogates location discharge , show bad outcomes surgical endovascular management rupture unruptured AVMs.16 Current choices interventional therapy brain arteriovenous malformation vary , decision make case-by-case basis , local clinical team . Often decision change result one particular attempt treatment modality become available . All interventional therapy perform assumption decrease risk initial subsequent hemorrhage lead well long-term patient outcome . Despite laudable goal , reliable evidence interventional management unruptured bAVMs beneficial , patient judge need interventional therapy , patient present rupture , randomize evidence embolization beneficial . Although clinical trial data exist effect interventional therapy even AVM hemorrhage , contentious issue present whether interventional therapy consider patient incidentally discover AVMs , whose lesion bleed . In patient unruptured AVMs , best management strategy remain unknown , intervention propose context randomize trial . The potential role embolization : Although endovascular AVM embolization occasionally eradicate lesion without surgery radiation therapy select case , although embolization may potentially improve safety efficacy surgical radiosurgical treatment case , remain contentious issue whether worth accept additional risk endovascular treatment great overall benefit patient brain AVMs treatable surgery radiation therapy . Some series report satisfactory results.20 It possible overall morbidity mortality combine interventional management strategy increase embolization add surgical radiosurgical procedure.17 Therefore , pre-surgical pre-radiosurgical embolization offer , randomize allocation embolization embolization , within context trial . Primary objective : In spirit care trial , primary objective trial accompany registry offer best management possible patient brain AVMs ( rupture unruptured ) term long-term outcome , despite presence uncertainty . Management may include interventional therapy ( neurosurgery , radiosurgery , alone combination , without endovascular procedure , alone combine ) conservative management . An expert multidisciplinary study group review patient individual basis determine eligibility trial registry part study . The trial design test whether conservative management interventional therapy reduce risk disable stroke death . Secondary objective : To determine interventional management effective prevention neurological event 10 year . To determine morbidity mortality relate therapy . To follow-up record neurological event neurological status patient brain AVMs recruit manage institution , regardless management strategy choose . Hypotheses A ) Randomized comparison interventional treatment conservative management : Primary hypothesis : Treatment cerebral AVMs decrease number disable neurological event cause presence AVM ( exclude peri-operative complication ) 30 15 % within 10 year . ( n = 266 minimum ) Secondary hypothesis : Treatment cerebral AVMs accomplish acceptable up-front risk , define occurrence permanent disable neurological complication le 15 % patient ) B ) Nested trial Role embolization treatment Brain AVMs mean Primary hypothesis : Pre-surgical pre-radiosurgery embolization cerebral AVMs decrease number treatment failure ( failure achieve angiographic cure ) 20 % 10 % ( n= 440 ) . Secondary hypothesis : Embolization cerebral AVMs accomplish acceptable risk , define permanent disable neurological complication 8 % ( 3.4 12.6 % , 95 % C.I. ) . The study design prospective , multi-center , randomize , control trial registry . Treatment assignment mask ; Interim study result keep confidential . The primary outcome composite event death cause disable stroke ( hemorrhage infarction reveal image result mRS &gt; 2 ) . Functional outcome status measure Rankin Scale , widely use outcome measure stroke . The secondary measure outcome include adverse event , rupture , angiographic occlusion lesion .</detailed_description>
