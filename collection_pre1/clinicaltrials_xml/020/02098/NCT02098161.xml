	<brief_title>Phase 2 LCL-161 Patients With Primary Myelofibrosis ( PMF ) , Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis ( Post-PV MF ) Post-Essential Thrombocytosis Myelofibrosis ( Post-ET MF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take LCL161 mouth Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , +/- 3 day . You fast 2 hour 2 hour take LCL161 . This mean food time . You able 8 ounce fluids water , milk , non-citrus juice . Each cycle 28 day . If vomit dose LCL161 , make dose . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , take first dose study drug clinic . You stay clinic 4 hour first dose study drug . After first dose , take study drug home . You bring unused study drug study visit . It important take study drug doctor tell . Do miss tablet . If doctor think need , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , physical exam , screen physical exam within 3 day Day 1 Cycle 1 . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 3 , 4 , every 3 cycle ( Cycles 7 , 10 , 13 , ) : - You physical exam - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . - You complete symptom questionnaire . If doctor agrees , may blood draw local doctor 's office laboratory . You fill questionnaire local doctor 's office . The study staff also call every 4-6 week . You ask feel side effect may . This phone call take 10-15 minute . You return MD Anderson every 3 cycle ( Cycles 7 , 10 , 13 , ) . On Day 1 Cycle 4 every 6 cycle ( Cycles 10 , 16 , ) , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease cytogenetic testing . If doctor think need , may ask return clinic often . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up call . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 7 day finish take study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You complete symptom questionnaire . Follow-up Call : About 30 day end-of-treatment visit , study staff call ask feel side effect may . This phone call take 10-15 minute . This investigational study . LCL161 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
