	<brief_summary>Regorafenib oral medication interfere cancer cell growth reduce growth blood vessel around tumor . This study help find regorafenib useful drug treat patient adenoid cystic carcinoma . Regorafenib approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use cancer , remain experimental drug yet approve use adenoid cystic carcinoma . In study , patient initially treat dose regorafenib low FDA approve cancer attempt decrease risk side effect . It possible low start dose may effective high FDA approve dose . If patient well low dose least month treatment , physician may consider increase dose FDA approve dose .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must pathologically cytologically confirm adenoid cystic carcinoma . Cancers arise nonsalivary gland primary site allow . Patients must recurrent and/or metastatic disease amenable potentially curative surgery radiotherapy . At least 2 week must elapse since end prior systemic treatment ( 4 week bevacizumab contain regimen ) radiotherapy resolution treatmentrelated toxicity NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 ( tolerable grade 2 ) back baseline ( except alopecia , lymphopenia , hypothyroidism ) . Any number prior therapy recurrent/metastatic ACC allow . Patients must RECIST v1.1 measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must documentation new progressive lesion radiologic image study perform within 6 month prior study enrollment ( progression disease interval allow ) and/or new/worsening disease relate symptom within 6 month prior study enrollment . Note : This assessment perform treat investigator . Evidence progression RECIST criterion require . Patients must archival tissue primary tumor metastasis available correlative study . Either paraffin block twenty unstained slide acceptable . If twenty slide available , less amount may acceptable discussion Principal Investigator , Dr. Alan L. Ho . Patients must agree undergo biopsy malignant lesion . Biopsies need do either investigator person perform biopsy judge tumor accessible biopsy biopsy pose great risk patient . Patients may also exempt frozen tumor tissue collect within 12 month study enrollment Principal Investigator deem appropriate/sufficient analysis protocol . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % , ) . Life expectancy least 12 week ( 3 month ) determine investigator . Life expectancy least 12 week ( 3 month ) determine investigator . Subjects must able understand willing sign write informed consent form . A sign informed consent form must appropriately obtain prior conduct trialspecific procedure . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow laboratory requirement : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN subject liver involvement cancer ) Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN subject liver involvement cancer ) Lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Amylase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min Platelet count ≥ 100,000 /mm3 , hemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9 g/dL , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 . Blood transfusion meet inclusion criterion allow . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 2 week prior start study drug . Postmenopausal woman ( defined menses least 1 year ) surgically sterilize woman require undergo pregnancy test . Subjects ( men woman ) childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception begin sign consent form least 3 month last dose study drug . The definition adequate contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Subject must able swallow retain oral medication . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , definitive radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) study treatment . Concurrent therapy bisphosphonates denosumab bone metastasis allow . Palliative radiation nontarget lesion also allow . Prior use regorafenib . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg [ NCICTCAE v4.0 ] repeat measurement ) despite optimal medical management . Concurrent use another investigational drug device therapy ( i.e. , outside study treatment ) , within 4 week trial entry ( sign inform consent form ) . Concurrent use strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g . clarithromycin , grapefruit juice , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , posaconazole , telithromycin , voriconazole ) . strong CYP3A4 inducer ( e.g . rifampin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , St. John 's Wort ) . Use herbal remedy ( e.g . St. John 's wort [ Hypericum perforatum ] ) Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day start study medication . Active clinically significant cardiac disease include : Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) &gt; Class II . Active coronary artery disease medically treat . Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy beta blocker digoxin . Unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) , newonset angina within 3 month randomization , myocardial infarction within 6 month randomization . Therapeutic anticoagulation VitaminK antagonist ( e.g. , warfarin ) allow medication dose and/or INR/PTT consider stable treat physician . If dose and/or INR/PTT stable , therapeutic anticoagulation VitaminK antagonists allow close monitoring . Anticoagulation heparin heparinoids allow . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Any hemorrhage bleeding event ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 week prior start study medication . Subjects thrombotic , embolic , venous , arterial event , cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month start study treatment . Subjects past current diagnosis another malignancy interfere conduct trial . Patients past current cancer diagnose ACC allow enroll investigator believe interfere trial conduct . Patients phaeochromocytoma . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection current chronic active hepatitis B C infection require treatment antiviral therapy . Active infection would impair ability patient receive study treatment . Symptomatic metastatic brain leptomeningeal tumor ( asymptomatic treat metastatic brain leptomeningeal tumor allow ) . Presence nonhealing wound nonhealing ulcer tumor relate . Renal failure require hemoor peritoneal dialysis . Patients seizure disorder require medication .
