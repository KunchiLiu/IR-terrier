	<brief_title>Trial Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Intervention Overweight Mothers Their Children Ages 3-5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity young child remain significant public health issue . Interventions target age group need , successful . The effective childhood obesity prevention intervention young child thus far involved significant parent engagement , suggest family-based intervention take account need parent child need . But , 2 3 adult either overweight obese , risk obesity increase least one child age 5 home . So obesity among adult high , maternal obesity one strong predictor child obesity , mean intervene overweight obese mother could effective way prevent development obesity young child . Many family-based parent-targeted intervention conduct thus far broadly targeted dietary intake physical activity , handful success change child behavior . Interestingly , evaluate dietary determinant childhood obesity , sugar-sweetened beverage ( SSB ) consumption consistently associate obesity across study , overall caloric intake , fruit vegetable consumption , intake add dietary fat . Consumption SSBs make 5-18 % preschooler ' recommend daily energy intake , average 176 calorie day consume drink caloric carbonate beverage , fruit drink , sport drink , 100 % fruit juice . Few intervention target reduction SSBs fruit juice child , result study child age 4-12 found replace SSBs noncaloric beverage lead low increase BMI z-scores time . Reducing SSB consumption adult equally important child , adult consume 21 % calorie SSBs alone , consumption SSBs associate high risk obesity , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease . Several adult intervention study show replace caloric beverage , include SSBs , water noncaloric beverage lead weight loss absence prescribe change . While research indicate reduce SSB consumption child adult lead change weight , yet know mother-targeted behavioral intervention successfully reduce intake SSBs fruit juice preschool-aged child . Because mother face many barrier weight control behavior change , include time demand lack childcare , need intervention uniquely target need mother child , minimize mother ' need travel , prevent rearrange schedule , minimize amount time spend participation order successful weight loss change child 's behavior . This intervention develop focus change small set behavior , primarily SSB consumption , mother child age 3-5 . Guided Social Cognitive Theory , intervention target increase self-efficacy , outcome expectation , limit setting , self-monitoring , decrease perceived barrier behavior change . In addition , mother ask make small change behavior promote modest weight loss . The evidence traditional behavioral weight loss intervention research adapt focus make small diet physical activity change suitable mother young child deliver primarily via mobile-based website text message reduce time demand increase adherence . Mother-child dyad ( N=42 ) randomize either Smart Moms intervention group ( n=21 ) waitlist control group ( n=21 ) receive modify version intervention 6-month assessment .</detailed_description>
