Subjects must consent outpatient admission CTRC . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect HPA axis function . 2 . Subjects liver function test great two time normal , compromise liver function interfere HPA axis activity . 3 . Subjects Addison 's disease , Cushing 's disease diseases adrenal cortex likely affect HPA axis function . 4 . Subjects history current psychotic disorder bipolar affective disorder may interfere HPA function . 5 . Subjects receive synthetic glucocorticoid therapy , exogenous steroid therapy , treatment agent , interfere HPA axis function within one month time test . 6 . Subjects take opiate , opiate antagonist , benzodiazepine . ( Subjects maintain SSRI 's , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic ( sleep ) 8 week longer NOT exclude ) . 7 . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . 8 . Subjects acute illness fever may affect HPA axis activity . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . 9 . Subjects &gt; 30 % ideal weight BMI great 35 consider study participation base clinical judgment study staff . 10 . Subjects unwilling maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) three day prior stress task procedure . 11 . Persons ferrous metal implant pacemaker since fMRI use . 12 . Subjects claustrophobic . 13 . Males . 14 . Women take birth control pill , Depo Provera ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) . Inclusion Criteria CocaineDependent Women . Women meet criterion cocainedependence previous three month ( current ) . Exclusion Criteria CocaineDependent Women . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion current dependence ( within 2 month ) substance cocaine . Nicotine dependence affect HPA function therefore would ideal exclude subject nicotine use . Because comorbidity cocaine nicotine dependence , would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment . Alcohol also know affect HPA function , however enhance recruitment effort , individual alcohol dependence abuse include study require medically supervised detoxification . Inclusion Criteria NonDependent Healthy Control Women . As . Exclusion Criteria NonDependent Healthy Control Women . Women meet DSMIV criterion past current substance dependence ( nicotine ) .</criteria>
