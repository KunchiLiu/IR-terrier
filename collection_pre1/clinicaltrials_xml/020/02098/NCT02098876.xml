	<detailed_description>The past two decade register major advance cardiovascular medicine improve patient ' survival quality life . One area major research innovation field percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , non-surgical procedure use treat narrowed heart artery stent . Stents metallic tubular support place inside blood vessel relieve obstruction restore blood flow heart muscle . Stents could also coat drug ( drug-eluting stent - DES ) improve local heal inhibits growth scar tissue ( smooth muscle fibrous cell ) within vessel otherwise could lead re-narrowing . The investigator study evaluate two FDA-approved DES , currently use , respect coronary vessel heal long term patency . These include XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus drug-eluting stent ( X-EES ) Abbott Vascular Resolute IntegrityÂ® Zotarolimus drug-eluting stent ( R-ZES ) Medtronic , Inc , show large clinical trial safe effective . This study evaluate effect apparently subtle difference stent design two platform may important effect regional plaque response blood flow dynamic immediately stent deployment stent heal scar formation 12 month follow . Several aspect R-ZES compare X-EES design may result favorable regional plaque response blood flow dynamic immediately stent deployment . These include compliant stent design make single sinusoidal wire connector strut likely comformable curve angulated coronary vessel . In heart vessel angulate , feature may make major difference outcome study already suggest . Whereas , narrow artery curve angulated , use X-EES could result straighten vessel 's natural curvature disturbance flow pattern . In contrast , use R-ZES angulated artery could cause less hemodynamic disturbance . There great deal data suggest disturbance local blood flow pattern creation eddy current ( 'turbulent ' blood flow ) could adversely affect stent heal exacerbate neointimal tissue growth . Using two intravascular image technology , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) , study aim investigate difference scar tissue coverage within stented region degree narrow edge stent patient undergo clinically-indicated PCI ( R-ZES X-EES ) 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
