	<brief_summary>This prospective , multi-centre , post-approval clinical study assess safety performance Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System aid identification active caries lesion occlusal surface human teeth . Following identification potential caries lesion oral examination ICDAS ( International Caries Detection Assessment System ) guideline , disclose solution apply cause area active demineralization ( loss calcium ion ) luminesce - capture intra-oral camera produce mapping image tooth surface . For purpose study presence / absence luminescence use indicator lesion activity / inactivity . The study deem success level agreement elevate luminescence Calcivis System , area expect lesion activity rat Investigators ICDAS staging , 70 % , due chance correlate well publish data active non-cavitated lesion molar various stage eruption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Approval Clinical Study Evaluate Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries ( tooth decay ) significant clinical public health problem . The development caries lesions involve net mineral loss dental tissue , lead progressive loss tooth structure surface , associate pain disease . Detecting , assess , diagnose treat lesion core activity dentistry . Currently main detection diagnosis aid visual inspection use probe , together X-ray image . Determination activity status lesion ( likely progress ) require assess treatment need . Currently methods problematic involve clinician 's subjective assessment / monitoring lesion progression number visit . Therefore , prospective , multi-centre , post-approval clinical study design assess safety performance Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System clinical setting . The device evaluation - Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System comprise hand-held specialise intra-oral camera take image lesion tooth surface immediately application disclose solution contains photoprotein . This photoprotein detect free calcium ion tooth surface produce visible light signal caries lesion active . Patients attend routine dental appointment / patient dental practice register , identify Investigator meeting study inclusion exclusion criterion approach discus possible participation study . Patients give Patient Information Sheet read time consider participation . If agree participate , ask attend two study visit , one week apart . Written inform consent take study procedure conduct . At Study Visit 1 , pre-imaging demographic oral hygiene information collect . All occlusal surface teeth ( 12 possible molar pre-molars ) clean Dentist , brush dental paste rinse tap water use 3-in-1 air / water spray , accord Tooth Cleaning Protocol . The Dentist perform oral examination identify note ICDAS score tooth image Calcivis System . Colour photograph take standard intra-oral camera select molar surround mucosa . Each tooth select image air dry 5 second immediately application disclose solution imaging . Images one sound tooth one unrestored erupt , erupt third molar ICDAS score 1,2 3 imaged . An additional two teeth may image ( remain erupt / erupt third molar / molar ICDAS score 1,2 3 ) , maximum four teeth . Immediately image complete , patient rinse tap water second colour photograph take standard intra-oral camera select molar surround mucosa . Any adverse event record . Post-imaging Questionnaires complete patient end Study Visit 1 , User Questionnaires complete end Study Visit day . Patients return one week Study Visit 2 . At visit , final oral examination conduct colour take standard intra-oral camera select molar surround mucosa . Any adverse event observe volunteered patient record . At end either Study Visit 1 2 , Dentist may share image teeth image Calcivis System patient .</detailed_description>
