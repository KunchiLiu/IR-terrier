	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine feasibility perform large multicenter phase III trial ass effect unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) . Prespecified feasibility criterion consist ability enroll potential study participant , include timely notification hospitalize patient ACS , capacity consent eligible individual , ability appropriately randomize eligible patient within 24 hour diagnosis . Additional feasibility objective involve ensure appropriate eligibility criterion , proper administration study drug , ability completely accurately collect clinical data interest . The final aim pilot study provide preliminary data , respect treatment effect variance , allow sample size calculation large trial give lack data available help guide process . The investigator hypothesize use UFH ACS result decrease duration hospitalization improve clinical outcome , duration hypoxemia duration moderate severe pain .</brief_summary>
