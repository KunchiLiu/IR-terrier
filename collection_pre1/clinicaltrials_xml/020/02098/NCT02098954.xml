	<brief_summary>Numerous evidence verify erlotinib could dramatically improve PFS OS non-small cell lung cancer harbor EGFR sensitive mutation , however , primary secondary resistance develop TKI treatment , doctor plenty research overcome TKI resistance . FAST ACT-2 study present , first line erlotinib combine chemotherapy could improve mOS 30 month NSCLCs harbor EGFR sensitive mutation , several study show sensitive mutation still exist TKI resistance , next generation TKIs ( BIBW2992 ) avaliable present , agent meet amplification ( Crizotinib ) expensive many Chinese patient could support . Thus , investigator hypothesis , first line TKI treatment , patient develop TKI resistance could still benefit second line TKI combine chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Combined With Chemotherapy TKI Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator enroll patient diagnose advanced non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer , patient EGFR TKI sensitive mutation develop TKI resistance first line treatment . After enrollment , investigator biopsy second line treatment find potential mechanism TKI resistance , EGFR mutation test sensitive resistant mutation exon 18 , 19 , 20 21 ; KRAS , BRAF PI3K mutation test , FISH MET HER-2 , investigator test evaluate primary secondary resistance , investigator test get overview EGFR mutation status patient develop TKI resistance . For second line treatment , patient receive 28 day gemcitabine platinum combine erlotinib scheme , 4 cycle combine chemotherapy , patient receive erlotinib treatment progression disease . For patient stable brain metastasis , combine chemotherapy begin local treatment , whole brain radiotherapy sterotactic radiosurgery . main endpoint study mean PFS , second endpoint study consist mean OS , 8 week ORR .</detailed_description>
