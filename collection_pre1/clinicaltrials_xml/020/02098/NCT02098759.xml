	<detailed_description>Overview study design This prospective study epileptogenesis TSC infant . In control subject one blood sampling perform infant observe prospectively . The study consist two phase : ( 1 ) prospective track epileptogenesis mean serial vEEG recording ; ( 2 ) treatment epilepsy diagnose clinical electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge . All patient enrol study participate first phase . The second phase concern child epilepsy electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge and/or clinical seizure , whose parents/caregivers give consent randomize part project . At baseline , patient undergo neuroimaging examination mean MRI , battery neuropsychological test , blood biomarker sampling , review medical history patient family . Epileptogenesis TSC infant track mean serial vEEG recording . In child diagnose epilepsy , standard therapy recommend first line antiepileptic drug give . Children clinical seizure , either notice caregiver , treat neurologist record video vEEG immediately diagnose epilepsy . Infants epileptiform discharge vEEG clinical seizure , parents/caregivers give consent , enter randomize part study . Those child randomize two group : group A diagnose epilepsy subclinical ( electroencephalographic ) epileptiform discharge , patient group B diagnose epileptic clinical seizure appear . All infant diagnose epilepsy receive standard therapy recommend first line antiepileptic drug start day diagnosis . Children whose parents/caregivers give consent randomize part project , follow serial vEEG epilepsy diagnose clinical seizure . Children without seizure epileptiform discharge vEEG follow without treatment . Blood sample biomarker study collect study entry , onset epileptiform discharge vEEG age 6 month , whichever applicable , onset clinical seizure , end follow-up ( age 2 year ) patient participate project . At age 24 month , TSC infants participate study undergo neuroimaging examination mean MRI , battery neuropsychological test , epilepsy analysis . Statistical consideration Full analysis set comprise patient participate study , include control group . This set divide subset : control group , TSC patient epilepsy , TSC patient epilepsy . Among TSC patient epilepsy , patient well-controlled seizure patient drug-resistant epilepsy identify . In full analysis set blood biomarkers analyse . Clinical analysis set comprise TSC infant enrol study clinical biomarkers epileptogenesis ( neuroimaging , vEEG , data medical history ) analyse set . Treatment analysis set comprise infant participate randomized part study efficacy antiepileptic treatment respect point epilepsy diagnosis ( electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge onset group A clinical seizure onset group B ) assess set . The interim analysis perform 70 % patient complete whole study . Final analyse perform last patient complete study ( age 24 month ) . Rationale study design This study compose two phase : ( 1 ) prospective track epileptogenesis mean serial vEEG recording ; ( 2 ) treatment epilepsy diagnose clinical electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge . All TSC infant enrol study well control child participate phase 1 , whereas child diagnose epilepsy participate phase 2 . The time point epilepsy diagnosis ( onset electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge clinical seizure ) randomly assign participate child central randomizer blind patient ' caregiver treat neurologist . The identification biomarkers ongoing epileptogenesis , well delineation point return , occurrence clinical seizure inevitable , require prospective study , start onset clinical seizure . To achieve clinical usefulness potential biomarkers , base analysis standard clinical test : neuroimaging mean MRI , EEG , blood sample . Our study use standard clinical test identify biomarkers epileptogenesis neuroimaging study , EEG , blood sample TSC infant onset seizure , track change measure parameter ongoing epileptogenesis . Investigators compare result obtain individual patient onset EEG abnormality , onset electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge , clinical seizure age 24 month . In order identify risk epilepsy among TSC patient , Investigators compare result obtain patient develop epilepsy remain epilepsy free . We also compare result obtain TSC child age-matched non-epileptic infant . The aim study establish early possible point diagnose epilepsy TSC infant . It widely accept clinical seizure precede progress deterioration EEG . Such deterioration see TSC infant develop clinical seizure . EEG standard , non-invasive procedure epileptic child . Therefore , EEG use track epileptogenesis set point biomarkers sample . Patients epileptiform discharge EEG recording enter blind , randomize part study , aim compare effect preclinical diagnosis treatment epilepsy vs diagnosis treatment clinical seizure appearance . To ascertain blinding study , report vEEG recording send treat neurologist , central randomizer . He provide treat neurologist diagnosis epilepsy epilepsy , without give detail EEG . If diagnosis epilepsy provide , mean either following : patient clinical seizure record videoEEG , electroencephalographic epileptiform discharge randomize group diagnose epilepsy point . Similarly , treat neurologist receives diagnosis epilepsy patient , know whether EEG normal , patient epileptiform EEG , randomize group diagnose epileptic onset clinical seizure . Taken together , treat neurologist patient 's parents/caregivers blind diagnostic approach patient , time , adequate treatment implement . Epileptiform discharge EEG precede clinical seizure , also reflect change brain may per se cause neurodevelopmental delay autism child . In animal model show epileptogenesis could interfere antiepileptic treatment implement onset clinical seizure . A recent study show initiation antiepileptic treatment onset clinical seizure onset epileptiform discharge EEG reduce risk mental retardation drug-resistant epilepsy . Amelioration epilepsy implementation antiepileptic drug clinical seizure onset also show neonate severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy . Current guideline epilepsy management TSC patient recommend treatment subclinical seizure equally standard treatment clinical seizure onset . Patients ' number Each patient identify study code , assign baseline visit . This code primary identifier patient throughout study . The code consist site identifier sequential patient number ( example : 01-001 ) . Once assign , patient 's code re-used change . Randomization procedures Patients epileptiform discharge vEEG note prior clinical seizure enter randomize part study . The time point randomization know treat neurologist keep study blind . Central randomizer provide diagnosis patient treat neurologist EEG recording . Randomization perform block randomization stratify centre . Patients randomize ratio 1:1 . Adverse event An Adverse Event ( AE ) adverse change patient 's baseline condition occur course study , irrespective relation epilepsy approach . However , important study test investigational product , undesirable effect epilepsy diagnosis onset clinical seizure consider study-related ( drug-related , investigational drug ) . Adverse event include : - epileptic seizure , unless worsen due late epilepsy diagnosis ; - plan medical surgical procedure , ie . vaccination , hospitalization relate control examination , like cardiologic follow-ups etc . - pre-existing disease medical condition worsen , However , event mention eCRF ( Others Comments section respective visit record ) . Seizures must report dedicated eCRF section . Parents patient experience seizure ask report number type seizure daily data transfer eCRF . For AE , relation study assess investigator report eCRF . If causal relationship AE project possible certain , relevant comment include justification must record eCRF . Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) AE fulfil follow criterion : - fatal - life-threatening - require hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , exception plan hospitalization - result persistent significant disability - medically significant require intervention prevent outcomes list All SAE regardless relation study must record eCRF report Project Coordinator ( Sergiusz Jóźwiak , IPCZD ) within 48 hour fax : +48 22 815 74 02 e-mail : sergiusz.jozwiak @ gmail.com The coordinator contact appropriate health authority well Scientific Advisory Board Ethics Committee .
