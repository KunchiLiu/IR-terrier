For heart attack survivor , massive reperfusion injury contribute heart failure carry high risk death long-term disability . To date , drug available reduce reperfusion injury heart attack patient . Our group demonstrate preclinical study combine two available medication ( milrinone esmolol ) give right onset reperfusion therapy greatly reduce heart muscle damage animal heart attack model .

If heart-protective effect observe preclinical study replicate human subject , propose therapy become first kind treat clinical reperfusion injury .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) lead cause death develop world . Following AMI , reperfusion therapy percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) standard care . PCI show meta-analyses decrease mortality compare thrombolysis . Despite improvement outcome , mortality AMI remain 4-6 % general population . PCI effective reduce mortality elderly patient . In fact , emergent reperfusion therapy may increase mortality age population . The worsen clinical outcome follow reperfusion therapy age population suggest reperfusion therapy per se actually exacerbate heart muscle damage , well-defined clinical process call myocardial reperfusion injury . Reperfusion injury pose continuous ( hour day ) heart muscle damage process follow PCI thrombosis . Excessive reperfusion injury offset net benefit coronary blood flow restoration AMI patient . For AMI survivor , massive heart muscle damage due ischemia/reperfusion injury lead congestive heart failure ( CHF ) carry high risk sudden death long-term morbidity . The inevitable lethal reperfusion injury follow reperfusion remain unsolved clinical problem . To date , drug available reduce reperfusion injury associate PCI modality coronary artery revascularization . A recent preclinical study group demonstrate combination therapy milrinone+esmolol give onset reperfusion reduces infarct-size animal model AMI follow reperfusion . In phase I clinical trial team , show combination therapy milrinone+esmolol safe patient AMI undergoing PCI . If infarct-size-limiting effect observe preclinical data replicate human subject , propose therapy become first kind treat clinical reperfusion injury . The propose project proof-of-concept study determine whether combination administration milrinone+esmolol onset reperfusion reduces infarct size patient S-T elevation MI ( STEMI ) . STUDY METHODS Targeted Enrollment Total enrollment 60 patient ( 30 active/30 placebo ) base power calculation achieve 30 % reduction cardiac biomarker . Inclusion &amp; Exclusion Criteria Men woman , 18 year age old , present within 12 hour onset chest pain , ST-segment elevation 0.1 mV two contiguous lead , clinical decision make treat PCI eligible enrollment . Patients cardiac arrest , ventricular fibrillation , cardiogenic shock , stent thrombosis , previous acute myocardial infarction , angina within 48 hour infarction include study . Patients occlusion leave main leave circumflex coronary artery evidence coronary collateral region risk initial coronary angiography ( time admission ) exclude . Patients pregnant include . Finally , patient disorder associate immunologic dysfunction ( e.g. , cancer , lymphoma , positive serologic test human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis ) recently 6 month presentation exclude . Drug Infusion Protocol After coronary angiography perform stent implant , patient meet enrollment criterion randomly assign either milrinone+esmolol group placebo group . Randomization perform use computer-generated randomization sequence . Approximately 5 minute stent deployment , patient milrinone+esmolol group start receive continuous intravenous drug infusion 10 minute . Milrinone esmolol ( 10 ml volume ) place two separate syrinx connect respective venous catheter . Dosage study drug : Syringe # 1 Milrinone 5 ug/kg/min Syringe # 2 Esmolol 10 ug/kg/min The dosage selection base publish clinical phase I study combination drug infusion produce minimal change hemodynamics without safety issue PCI therapy patient STEMI . Primary &amp; Secondary Endpoints The primary endpoint infarct-size reduction assess measurement cardiac biomarker creatine kinase ( CK ) . The principal secondary endpoint reduction CK-MB troponin I . Blood sample collect admission repeatedly 4-hr , 12-hr , 24-hr , 36-hr , 48-Hr 72-hr , respectively . The area curve ( AUC ) ( express arbitrary unit ) CK , CK-MB troponin I release measured patient computerize planimetry . The secondary end point infarct-size measured area delay hyperenhancement see cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , assess day 5 infarction . Other Endpoints We record cumulative incidence major adverse event occur within first 48 hour reperfusion , include death , heart failure , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , recurrent ischemia , need repeat revascularization , renal insufficiency , vascular complication , bleed . We also specifically assess infarct-related adverse event , include heart failure ventricular fibrillation . In addition , one month AMI , cardiac event record global leave ventricular function assess echocardiography . Statistical Analytical Plans 1 . General Considerations The primary secondary endpoint efficacy drug study analyse use appropriate statistical method . 2 . Safety Analyses All clinical signs/symptoms , know adverse reaction trial medication , medical event monitor record . They analyse use appropriate statistical method . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Informed Consent The investigator designate staff collect write consent patient study perform . Prior , investigator his/her delegate inform patient objective , benefit , risk requirement impose study , well nature study product . The patient provide information consent form clear , simple language . The patient give ample time inquire detail study decide whether participate study . Two original information consent form complete , date sign personally patient person responsible collecting informed consent . If patient unable read , impartial witness present entire inform consent discussion . The patient must give consent orally , capable , complete , sign personally date information consent form . The witness must complete , sign date form together person responsible collecting informed consent . The patient give one sign original consent form ; second original kept investigator . Confidentiality Data Patient Records All evaluation form , report record cod maintain subject confidentiality . The research data store stand-alone laptop PI password protect . Clinical information release without write permission subject , except necessary monitoring relevant authority .</detailed_description>
