Moreover reluctance one institution trial randomize patient variety treatment modality . For reason , investigator propose participation multi-institutional data share project concern repair EA participate center collaborate good understand outcomes perioperative care patient undergo correction problem . The primary objective create multicenter registry capture data relate perioperative course management child undergo PE repair surgery . This effort undertaken order augment safety quality improvement activity participate site . Investigators understand multiple methodology accomplish anesthesia perioperative pain control surgery . There little comparative data outcomes different possible management strategy . Given relative frequency surgeries center perform 20-50 procedure per year , practical one ( two ) center study procedure observational manner control randomized trial . Investigators ' aggregate multi-institutional data set use benchmarking local national safety quality improvement effort . Participating site provide report compare local site aggregate dataset specific perioperative outcome variable ( e.g . pain metric ) factor could associate improved outcome . Outcome variable include limited intraoperative hemodynamics , pain control , emergence agitation , apnea/airway obstruction , hemodynamic stability , time first ambulation , pain score hospital , total hospital day , time school work attendance , symptom post-traumatic stress . Secondary objective : Investigators ultimately look relationship specific management metric use epidural anesthesia vs. peripheral nerve block vs. local anesthesia wound infiltration primary outcome metric . In addition Investigators consider frequency long term Post Traumatic Stress behavior various measure pain control perioperative period . Study Design : Basic design : Prospective observational multicenter data registry Setting/Participants : - Patients age 8 30 year undergoing surgery Pectus Excavatum Repair hospital set - Up 20 hospital site Data Collection , Storage Release : The registry capture data relate perioperative management child undergo PE repair . Measures include demographic data , data degree deformity , perioperative management , intraoperative management , hospital course , surgical technique , complication , long term pain/psychological outcome .</detailed_description>
