	<detailed_description>Purpose : To develop negative work exercise regimen intervention posttraumatic osteoarthritis ( PTOA ) . Given medical management chronic PTOA similar idiopathic OA , investigator propose randomize , clinical trial pilot negative work exercise Veterans knee OA proof-of-concept study subsequent investigation people PTOA . Research Setting : DC VAMC , Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation Laboratory Participants : Men age 50 70 year history bilateral knee osteoarthritis consecutively recruit DC VAMC Rheumatology Service , Geriatrics Service , Primary Care Medical Service . Implications/Significance : The use negative work exercise enhance force attenuation property muscle innovative approach treatment OA PTOA , represent significant departure previous rehabilitation study concern arthritis . Use negative work paradigm may prove beneficial old Veterans OA active military personnel PTOA since similar muscle mechanic involve energy absorption knee joint gait . Despite functional importance lengthen muscle action protect weight-bearing joint affect arthritis , author aware study involve sole use negative work intervention OA PTOA . Addressing aims proposal would lay ground work need justify large clinical trial feature negative work paradigm soldier PTOA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men 50 y.o . 70 year old recruit propose study . Participant inclusion criterion include bilateral knee OA ( KellgrenLawrence Grade 2 3 ) sedentary ( e.g. , engage 3 exercise session per week 3 consecutive month ) . Gait aid orthoses preclude participation study . Exclusion criterion include uncontrolled cardiovascular disease , nonambulatory status , neurogenic weakness , knee extensor flexor manual muscle test &lt; 3 5 , low extremity amputation , current participation supervise exercise program . In addition , major surgical procedure within last six month , unstable joint , endocrine metabolic disorder result excessive fatigue muscle weakness , use medication may impair exercise tolerance would also preclude participation study .</criteria>
