	<brief_summary>Background Patients type hand injury often reach different functional level . Therefore , necessary investigate kind rehabilitation efficient individual patient . Research show person 's `` Sense Coherence '' ( SOC ) affect /she deal disease . Furthermore , SOC help predict final outcome orthopedic injury therefore ; take consideration plan rehabilitation . It conclude study patient weak SOC hand injury , may benefit extra support manage everyday activity order reach final outcome patient strong SOC . Purpose To investigate two type rehabilitation patient hand-related injury ( joint mobility exercise vs. activity-based training joint mobility exercise ) investigate whether SOC use indicator patient would benefit activity-based training . Hypotheses 1 . Patients hand-related injury benefit activity-based training rehabilitation program . 2 . Patients weak SOC achieve best functional level , activity-based training include rehabilitation program . 3 . Patients strong SOC achieve high functional level , activity-based training include rehabilitation program . Study design Randomised control trial . Methods Four-hundred-twenty- patient age 18 year old include refer specialized outpatient occupational therapy hand-related injury . To ensure sufficient balance patient variation relation pre-rehabilitation sense coherence , balance randomisation principle implement . Data collect questionnaire . The questionnaire measure SOC ( 13 item version ) , function ( DASH ) , quality life ( EQ5D ) satisfaction . All participant perform joint mobility exercise appropriate injury . In addition , participant perform activity-based training train specific meaningful activity perform prior hand-related injury . Clinical relevance The knowledge obtain incorporated plan occupational therapy rehabilitation service patient group , patient receive optimal condition achieve previous level function hand injury .</brief_summary>
