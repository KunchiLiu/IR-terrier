	<brief_summary>Chronic spinal pain ( CSP ) include chronic low back pain , fail back surgery , chronic whiplash associate disorder , chronic non-traumatic neck pain , etc . The current investigator others provide evidence impaired motor control spinal muscle patient CSP . In addition , increase evidence central mechanism , i.e . hyperexcitability central nervous system brain abnormality ( e.g . decrease brain matter density ) play role CSP . Hence , treatment CSP address spinal muscle joint , also brain . Therefore , modern neuroscience approach , comprise pain neuroscience education follow cognition-targeted motor control training , apply . The scientific objective entail examine effectiveness modern neuroscience approach vs. usual care evidence-based physiotherapy reduce pain improve function Flemish patient CSP . A secondary objective entail examine effectiveness modern neuroscience approach vs. usual care evidence-based physiotherapy alter brain 's structure function ( magnetic Resonance Imaging ) Flemish patient CSP . Therefore , multi-center triple-blind randomize control trial conduct . To comply scientific objective , 120 CSP patient recruit subjected baseline assessment . The baseline assessment include assessment pain ( include symptom central sensitization condition pain modulation ) , assessment restriction functioning , brain imaging , evaluation motor control muscle property , spinal mobility , psychosocial correlate . Baseline analysis provide descriptive statistic lead calculate correlation different outcome measure predictor pain dysfunctioning . In next step , include patient randomized experimental control group . Those experimental group receive neuroscience education combine cognition-targeted motor control training . Those control group subject control intervention , include back/neck school general exercise . After neuroscience education give , experimental subject fill neurophysiology pain test . Several follow-up assessment take place . Part assessment ( functionality ( PDI questionnaire ) psychosocial correlate ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale ( PCS ) , pain vigilance awareness questionnaire ( PVAQ ) , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK ) , Illness Perception Questionnaire revise ( IPQ-R ) ) re-evaluated first 3 session . The complete 'baseline ' assessment repeat month follow treatment complement , round short-term follow-up assessment . Six month baseline assessment , pain , function psychological correlate assess intermediate online assessment . One year baseline assessment complete assessment repeat last time , unless intermediate assessment indicate treatment effect longer present . Both short long term treatment effect study predictor therapy success unraveled . Also correlation change different outcome measure provide relevant innovative information . The proof principal suggest strong effect report large effect size pain disability compare usual care .</brief_summary>
