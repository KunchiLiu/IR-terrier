	<brief_summary>Malaria , disease cause parasite Plasmodium , one world 's major infectious disease . With approximately 627.000 death year , chief cause morbidity mortality well significant contribution ongoing poverty endemic country . Ultimately , key malaria control , hopefully eradication , would effective vaccine . Though number vaccine-candidates enter pipeline pre-clinical clinical development , yet achieve level efficacy necessary effective malaria prevention . It show previously healthy human volunteer take chloroquine chemoprophylaxis repeatedly expose Plasmodium parasites bite infect mosquito , fully protect later challenge infection 'homologous ' ( genetically similar ) Plasmodium parasite . This process know ChemoProphylaxis Sporozoites , CPS-immunization . One obstacles develop effective vaccine genetic heterogeneity malaria parasite . To consider development whole-parasite base vaccine malaria order well understand protective immunity induce CPS-immunization , essential investigate whether heterologous protection genetically diverse ( heterologous ) P. falciparum clone induce . This single center , randomize , double-blind study determine whether healthy volunteer immunize P. falciparum NF54 parasites chloroquine prophylaxis protect challenge infection genetically distinct NF135.C10 NF166.C8 P. falciparum clone .</brief_summary>
