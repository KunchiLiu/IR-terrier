	<brief_summary>Worldwide , liver related morbidity mortality continue rise . It 5th commonest cause death UK . Liver damage consist two main component - ) damage cell liver , call hepatocytes , mean liver function properly leading jaundice ( yellow appearance skin and/or eye ) liver failure b ) scarring liver , call Cirrhosis , lead impaired function inadequate blood flow liver potential develop cancer . Manifestations state include ascites ( fluid tummy ) varix ( swollen blood vessel food pipe ) . Liver transplant currently curative treatment end stage chronic liver disease . Unfortunately high demand match equivalent rise liver donation even transplant occur numerous lifestyle effect immunosuppression kidney impairment thus outcome remain poor many patient . Coffee show mortality benefit human drink two three cup day associate 40 % reduce risk develop cirrhosis , particularly alcohol relate ; high cup consume . Previous work demonstrate coffee reduces level fibrosis liver interrupt signal pathway , block effect special product , call cytokine , reduce accumulation iron . The investigator ' hypothesis give potential caffeine use treatment SSAO activity associate disease important see activity SSAO block healthy human . The Investigators ' aim examine effect caffeine circulate VAP-1 level large number healthy volunteer assess potential attractive therapeutic target view low toxicity widespread availability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhibition VAP-1 Caffeine Healthy Human Volunteers Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One enzyme know VAP-1 ( vascular adhesion protein-1 ) express high level liver endothelial cell study involve blockage VAP-1 activity demonstrate involved reaction break product hydrogen peroxide ammonia active signalling pathway assist movement cell blood vessel liver . VAP-1 level become elevated chronic inflammation blood vessel gut , tonsil , skin synovium albeit selectively liver . Recently , circulate VAP-1 demonstrate elevate certain liver disease particularly alcoholic liver disease . Initial animal study show activity enzyme SSAO ( Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase ) effectively block caffeine administration caffeine also block activity fat cell , know adipose cell , thus protective obesity . SSAO arise family enzymes VAP-1 thus importantly share transferable property . This information lead small , experimental study human liver corroborate finding show caffeine affect VAP-1 blood .</detailed_description>
