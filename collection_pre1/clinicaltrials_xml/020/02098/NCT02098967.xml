	<brief_summary>This open label , Phase I study RO6839921 dose-escalation study two arm . Prior investigation either arm , patient single cohort , Cohort 0 , receive non-escalating , intravenous ( IV ) dose RO6839921 daily Days 1-5 28-day cycle . Interim PK safety data cohort evaluate initiate dose-escalation . In arm A , RO6839921 give patient advance solid tumor malignancy . In Arm B , RO6839921 give patient relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The arm escalate independently . Escalation begin solid tumor patient ( Arm A ) single patient cohort , use new Continual Reassessment Method ( n-CRM ) . Escalation AML patient initiate dose level cause &gt; /= Grade 2 hematologic side effect Arm A . Escalation AML patient follow roll 6 design . In arm , RO6839921 administer IV infusion Days 1-5 28-day cycle . There intrapatient dose escalation . All patient may treat disease progression/relapse unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>
