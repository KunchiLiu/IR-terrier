	<brief_summary>Functional recovery follow SCI adult limit . Improvements quality life affect person associate recovery function allow independent living , example use arm hand . Rehabilitative train show aid upper limb recovery . However , likely vast difference amount time individual spend actively training ( rehabilitation session clinic ) non-training time ( daily life ) . The activity , lack , non-training period could interfere ( positively negatively ) , specific train rehabilitation session . However , little information available . Inertial measurement unit increasingly use human movement rehabilitation research . The use technology promise approach rapidly discreetly collect objective movement information . The investigator plan introduce novel , long-term , activity sensor clinical SCI rehabilitation . The investigator use sensor precisely measure movement upper limb extend period time . Upper limb activity recording sensor allow u detail amount duration activity specific period upper limb rehabilitation recovery . The investigator aim measure upper limb activity . The investigator aim track change activity upper limb recovery rehabilitation patient cervical SCI well collect reference value upper limb activity chronic sufferer . The recording activity sensor provide detail understanding everyday upper limb activity contribute functional recovery .</brief_summary>
