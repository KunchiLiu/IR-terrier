	<brief_summary>Infants gastroschisis typically poor intestinal motility first week month birth . Prokinetic agent often use infant improve intestinal motility attempt quicken attainment enteric feed . However , evidence support practice remain weak . Investigators hypothesize prokinetic agent give intravenously ( infused vein ) may effective improve gut motility child gastroschisis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metoclopramide Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research question address pilot randomize double-blind placebo control clinical trial evaluate efficacy metoclopramide.Investigators recruit 30 neonate ( 15 per arm ) diagnose gastroschisis . There two arm trial : experimental arm receive intravenous metoclopramide control arm receive placebo . Patients receive prokinetic agent therapy , dose accord weight , placebo . Each subject receive intervention 28 day achievement full enteral feeding , whichever come first . Primary outcome : Days achieve full enteral feed intake ( least 150 ml/kg/day 72 hour ) give breast milk formula gavage mouth . Secondary outcome : 1 . Duration ( day ) initiation enteral feed . 2 . Duration ( day ) parenteral nutrition . 3 . Weight gain , measure gram per day per week therapy . 4 . Occurrence adverse effect associate use metoclopramide . 5 . Rate catheter-related sepsis episode ( line positive blood culture necessitate antibiotic treatment catheter removal ) . 6 . Incidence necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) base clinical criterion presence pneumatosis intestinalis abdominal X-ray . 7 . Duration hospitalization ( number day admission final hospital discharge ) . Subjects withdraw study meet one follow criterion : - Subject develop extrapyramidal symptom - Subject establish full enteral feed end day 28 therapy - Withdrawal informed consent refusal study participation parent/legal guardian - Serious adverse event , opinion investigator , indicate continued participation study best interest subject - Any clinical adverse event , laboratory abnormality intercurrent illness , opinion investigator , indicate continued participation study best interest subject - Unpredictable discontinuation metoclopramide drug supply</detailed_description>
