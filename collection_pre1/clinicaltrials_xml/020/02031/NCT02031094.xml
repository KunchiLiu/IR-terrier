	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure Regeneration Following Liver Resection Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Penetrating liver injury occur commonly victim battlefield trauma . It associate high mortality morbidity rate . Management liver injury complex challenge often involve debridement anatomical resection liver tissue . Following liver resection , liver regenerate original volume . Liver regeneration involve complex metabolic process maximal regeneration occur first post operative week . This process highly energy dependent add burden post operative energy therefore nutritional requirement . Inadequate post-operative nutrition associate poor outcomes complication rate . Additionally , feed also associate adverse outcome . The actual additional energy expenditure involve liver regeneration currently know therefore accurate calorific balance remain challenge . The measurement energy expenditure patient therefore important . Traditionally energy expenditure measure indirect calorimetry doubly label water . These technique require skilled operator often impractical everyday clinical usage impossible deployed setting . A recent development lightweight armband measure total rest energy expenditure . It validate gold standard technique various setting include cancer cachexia , obesity healthy volunteer deem highly acceptable also . It validate unique set liver regeneration . Therefore study ass energy expenditure patient undergo liver regeneration attempt validate new minimally invasive device traditional measurement energy expenditure .</detailed_description>
