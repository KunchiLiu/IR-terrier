	<brief_summary>You ask consider participate study cancer prostate , treat external beam radiation . You choose felt good candidate watch cancer . As doctor inform , involve deliver small amount radiation daily several week . Normally , small field direct prostate gland give 7.5 - 8 week . In total , 39 day radiation deliver . There grow evidence prostate cancer cell may kill effectively high dos radiation deliver everyday ( know hypofractionation ) . However , downside strategy potential cause side effect normal organ ( rectum bladder ) also expose high dos . Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) high-precision technique ability deliver radiation focus manor , mean radiation dose `` sculpted '' prostate gland , minimize amount radiation bladder rectum . A certain amount movement prostate normally occur within body . To make sure prostate miss , margin tissue around prostate also need treat . Although wide margin ensure prostate include , also cause normal tissue receive high dos radiation . This , turn , would result side effect . To reduce margin need around prostate , side effect , tiny gold seed measure 3.0 x 1.2mm inserted prostate see use special type X-Ray camera call portal imager treatment . This allow target prostate gland precisely significantly small margin normal tissue need treat . By use gold seed conjunction SABR , potential safely deliver intensive dose radiation prostate gland without increase amount side effect . In study shorter intense course radiation give use similar high-precision technique , side effect treatment indeed bad usual technique . Over last 7 year , Sunnybrook researcher treat three hundred prostate cancer patient various research protocols SABR . In protocol , patient receive 5 SBRT treatment 29 day currently compare 5 SBRT treatment 11 day ongoing randomize study . In United States , several group investigate 5 SBRT approach 11 day less early finding suggest good tolerance . The study do determine side effect , quality life efficacy 2-fraction adaptive SBRT technique ( 2STAR ) treatment low intermediate risk prostate cancer . All participant receive dose fractionation scheme .</brief_summary>
