	<brief_summary>Immunosuppressed patient increase risk complication influenza infection , include secondary pneumonia recommend annual influenza vaccination . Thus , appearance novel subtype influenza A virus designated 2009 swine H1N1 virus add extra layer complexity immunization regimen population . In general , susceptibility swine H1N1 infection among young population higher young adult child completely lack protective titer . According Center Disease Control ( CDC ) , 70 percent people hospitalize H1N1 `` high risk '' case , include person 65 year age old , people compromise immune system observe HIV infection . This prompt CDC include HIV infect child one five group vaccinate new H1N1 vaccine ( National Center Immunization ) . Currently information exist nature immune response vaccine H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus ( S-OIV ) HIV infected child . It unknown whether HIV impair immunogenicity vaccine predispose population infection S-OIV . Thus , pilot proposal undertaken study mechanism H1N1 vaccine protection HIV infect child , investigate correlation infection status seroresponse , duration response development influenza-like illness follow vaccine . Additionally establish whether identify immune signature characteristic gene expression pattern correlate vaccine immunogenicity predictive efficacy `` good '' `` suboptimal '' vaccination regimen . Data generate used initiate comprehensive study immunogenicity influenza vaccine HIV-infected child youth , critically important address health care need vulnerable population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Inactivated Swine H1N1 Vaccine In HIV Infected Children - The Miami Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit HIV-1 outpatient clinic time novel H1N1 vaccine become available . Demographic data collect enrollment include HIV-1 viral load ( VL ) CD4 count last visit , antiretroviral therapy , gender age . Patients ask document adverse reaction observe study tenderness , pain , redness , swell injection site well systemic adverse reaction headache , malaise , muscle ache . A subject withdrawn study serious adverse reaction occur allergic reaction vaccine component development progressive neurological disorder without definitive diagnosis . Statistical analysis perform viral load CD4 count result day 30 . The microneutralization assay titer analyze post day 7 37 . If cohort seem generate adequate response , study discontinue sample collect . Vaccination : Since immunocompromised person may diminish immune response Influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine , high antigen load use study recommend National Center Immunization Respiratory Diseases Centers Disease Control Prevention . All patient give 0.5 ml intramuscular dos A/California/7/2009 H1N1 strain inactivate vaccine deltoid muscle ; patient receive second dose 4 week . Each vaccine dose contain 15 µg H1N1 monovalent antigen . Patients age 9 receive second vaccine standard care , patient 9 old receive second dose part study . Study Design : This pilot study design recruit 72 patient CD4 count ≥200 . Patients enrol first come first serve basis attempt reach equal number gender . A dose ( 15 µg ) vaccine administer day 0 30 . Blood sample collect Table 1 ( see Below ) . At visit , total maximum amount collect 17.5 ml divide three individual sample : The first sample 5 ml serum separation use detection Hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) titer micro-neutralization ( MN ) assay . The second sample 10 ml process viral load , CD4 count ELISPOT functional B cell assay . The third sample 2.5 ml collect Paxgene RNA tube future microarray test . Based HI titer MN response obtain , patient classify three distinct subgroup : ( ) high responder ≥ 4 fold titer increase compare baseline , ( b ) moderate responder ≥ 2 &lt; 4 fold increase ( c ) low responder &lt; 2 fold increase . From subgroup , 25 complete patient 's sample high low responder select microarray study . The microarray compare read visit . These preliminary data serve basis future humoral innate immunity gene activation . Hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) microneutralization ( MN ) assay perform blood sample collect describe Table 1 . Two individual sample collect visit , one use serum separation use detection HI titer second sample viral load , CD4 count , ELISPOT Microarray test . Based HI MN titer response obtain , patient classify three distinct subgroup : ( ) high responder ≥ 4 fold titer increase compare baseline , ( b ) moderate responder ≥ 2 &lt; 4 fold increase ( c ) low responder &lt; 2 fold increase . From subgroup , 25 complete sample high , moderate low responder select viral load microarray study .</detailed_description>
