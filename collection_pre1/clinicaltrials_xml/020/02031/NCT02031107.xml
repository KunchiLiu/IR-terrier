	<brief_summary>Background : Stroke lead cause adult disability . Non-invasive brain stimulation induce significant sustain improvement functional outcome . However effect inconsistent difficult predict , particular subacute phase stroke . Although several different stimulation technique available , unknown suitable patient . Objectives : This study three main objective : 1 . To compare effect two technique non-invasive brain stimulation ( cTBC , continuous theta-burst stimulation ; tDCS , direct current transcranial stimulation ) clinical recovery patient subacute stroke . 2 . To assess effect brain stimulation technique brain organization non-invasive imaging . 3 . To find clinical neural predictor responsiveness brain stimulation therapy . Method : 45 patient ischemic hemorrhagic stroke randomly assign one 3 group : cTBS , tDCS , sham stimulation . Each group receive correspond stimulation therapy 3 time per week 3 week , immediately intensive physical therapy . Before treatment period , standardized assessment sensorimotor function area obtain together electroencephalography functional magnetic resonance recording . These recording use analyze compare neural effect treatment modality . Clinical Implication : The result study might help optimize individualize stimulation treatment patient subacute stroke . It may hence facilitate transfer brain stimulation therapy routine clinical practice .</brief_summary>
