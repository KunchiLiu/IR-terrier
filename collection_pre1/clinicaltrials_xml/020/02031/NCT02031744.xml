	<brief_summary>This randomize , Phase III , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety efficacy MetMAb ( onartuzumab ) combination Tarceva ( erlotinib ) compare treatment Tarceva alone patient incurable Met-positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio receive either MetMAb + Tarceva placebo + Tarceva . Tarceva ( 150 mg ) give orally daily , MetMAb ( 15 mg/kg ) give intravenously every 3 week . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , decision discontinue , death occurs . Total study length expect around 36 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female , 18 year old . Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Histologically confirm incurable Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC tumor . Metpositive status result epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activate mutation test . Available tumor tissue sample agreement take sample . Radiographic evidence disease . Lesions must outside previous radiotherapy field sole site disease , unless disease progression occur site since radiation . Prior treatment least one platinumbased line treatment locally advance , unresectable/inoperable disease metastatic disease , one additional line chemotherapy treatment , define follow : Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiation count line therapy &lt; 12 month elapse last dose date recurrence . Combined treatment chemotherapy radiation constitute single regimen ; surgery consider regimen . Cytotoxic maintenance therapy differs firstline therapy consider additional line therapy . However , change treatment due intolerance excessive toxicity consider additional regimen . The last dose prior chemotherapy must give &gt; /= 21 day prior Day 1 ( &gt; /= 14 day vinorelbine vinca alkaloid gemcitabine ) . Anticancer agent use pleurodesis count line therapy . Prior radiation therapy allow provided patient recover toxic effect &gt; /= 7 day elapse last session randomization . Patients must use effective contraception throughout trial 3 month last dose . More 30 day expsoure EGFR inhibitor know EGFRtoxicity result dose modification . Prior exposure agent target either HGF MET pathway , include limited crizotinib , cabozantinib , ficlatuzumab , rilotumumab , tivantinib . Pleural effusion , pericardial fluid , ascites require drainage every week frequently . Brain metastases spinal cord compression definitively treat surgery and/or radiation previously diagnose treat without evidence clinically stable disease &gt; /= 14 day . Patients treated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases asymptomatic stable dose corticosteroid &gt; /= 14 day prior randomization eligible . History another cancer previous 5 year , except appropriately treat carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , stage I uterine cancer , cancer curable . Life expectancy &lt; 12 week . Radiographically visible interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) history . History radiation pneumonitis radiation field ( fibrosis ) permit . Inadequate hematologic , biological , organ function . Significant history cardiac disease . Serious active infection time randomization serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment , include positive HIV active hepatitis B C infection , significant gastrointestinal abnormality , uncontrolled diabetes . Any inflammatory change surface eye . Inability take oral medication , need intravenous alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Any major surgery within 2 week prior randomization . Inability understand language ( ) HRQOL questionnaires available .</criteria>
