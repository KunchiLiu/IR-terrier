	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether intratumoral/peritumoral injection HSV1716 ( oncolytic HSV-1716 ) safe child recurrent high-grade glioma amenable resection . II . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose intratumoral/peritumoral injection HSV1716 . III . To describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) intratumoral/peritumoral injection HSV1716 dose give child high-grade glioma . IV . To evaluate change tumor enhancement , quantitative magnetic resonance ( MR ) measure tumor perfusion ( relative cerebral blood volume [ rCBV ] , transfer coefficient [ k^trans ] , fractional blood-plasma volume [ Vp ] extravascular extracellular space per unit volume tissue [ Ve ] value apparent diffusion coefficient [ ADC ] ) response HSV1716 injection . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure antiviral immune response patient refractory high-grade glioma inject HSV1716 . II . To measure systemic viremia viral shed follow intratumoral/peritumoral administration HSV1716 . III . To preliminarily describe antitumor activity HSV1716 injection within confines Phase I study . IV . To evaluate anti-tumor immune cellular humoral immune response . V. To evaluate change fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) - positron emission tomography ( PET ) uptake response HSV1716 injection . VI . To evaluate change tumor choline value use magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy response HSV1716 injection delineate progressive disease versus pseudo-progression post therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oncolytic HSV-1716 intratumorally ( IT ) peritumorally undergoing surgical tumor resection . Patients also receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) prior 6 12 hour surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
