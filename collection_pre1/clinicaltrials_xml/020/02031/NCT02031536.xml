	<brief_title>Everolimus Patients With Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Metastatic Liver Previously Treated With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition adjuvant everolimus R0 R1 surgical resection pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis liver result improvement disease free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition adjuvant everolimus R0 R1 surgical resection pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis liver result improvement overall survival . II . To evaluate toxicity associate adjuvant everolimus follow resection patient metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor liver . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive placebo PO QD day day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
