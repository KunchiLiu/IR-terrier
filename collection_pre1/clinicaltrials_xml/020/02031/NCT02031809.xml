	<detailed_description>Vats lobectomy become standard care early stage lung cancer . Several study show feasibility safety dedicate centre . Compared thoracotomy procedure result least equal oncologic result survival , perhaps well . Most series publish early experience . They retrospective report lobectomy segmentectomies , exclude live-saving pneumonectomy . They potentially ignore intention-to-treat principle , exclude conversion . Based scarce exist literature conference worst-case presentation pattern common intraoperative major complication draw In Europe , large percentage high-volume-centres successfully implement vat lobectomy program . In era low-volume-centres switch vat anatomical resection , important focus potentially life-threatening complication . To aware potential hazard best way avoid .</detailed_description>
