	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause vision loss United States , impact life ~4 million people . Left untreated inadequately manage , cause blindness -- second ranking cause blindness world well leader among African Americans . Estimates project 79.6 million glaucoma diagnosis worldwide 2020 ; , 74 % open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) , occur virtually without symptom . The explanation strikingly high disease prevalence blindness rate partially due asymptomatic nature glaucoma . However , deficient adherence glaucoma ocular hypotensive drop significant escalate health care problem . Glaucoma eye drop often first therapeutic choice effective control intraocular pressure ( IOP ) prevent eye damage . However , glaucoma chronic condition daily dose regimen medication complex difficult manage impaired vision . Consequently , adherence persistence glaucoma eye drop regimen time become quite poor . Overwhelming research bring unwelcome conclusion long term persistence glaucoma medication 33-39 % one year positively contribute blindness . Currently , mechanism exist support monitor glaucoma eye drop compliance . The purpose study evaluate usability medication management support system glaucoma patient self-administering eye drop name iDropper . The iDropper system home-based ocular medication management system remind , instructs , dispenses , record eye drop medication usage . The iDropper system evaluate among cohort glaucoma subject self-administering eye drop 4-weeks . At study conclusion usability satisfaction assessment perform evaluate iDropper system performance .</detailed_description>
