The investigator test effect treatment alternate 28 day active treatment prucalopride 28 day treatment non active placebo add two week break treatment . The order treatment randomize neither patient investigator know whether receive active treatment placebo study completely finish . The investigator measure effect use questionnaire assess patient symptom nausea pain well quality life two gastric empty test throughout treatment period . The effectiveness active treatment evaluate comparing extent change symptoms treatment difference gastric empty time compare placebo treatment . The investigator also monitor track possible side effect patient experience study . Study Hypotheses In patient gastroparesis : 1 . Prucalopride 4 mg daily improve meal-related symptom compare placebo define change cumulative meal-related symptom . ( primary endpoint ) . 2 .
