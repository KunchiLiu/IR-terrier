	<detailed_description>The loss blood haemorrhage routine phlebotomy perform blood donation healthy volunteer , large effect systemic iron homeostasis . The relative shortage erythrocytes blood loss compensate increase production new red cell bone marrow . As iron need effective haemoglobin synthesis , transport iron bone marrow need increase . This accomplished suppression hepcidin production liver . Hepcidin central regulator iron homeostasis . It regulate serum iron level effectively downregulating iron channel ferroportin iron export cell . Hepcidin production increase response inflammation en high systemic iron content , suppress increase erythrocyte production , hypoxia , anemia , low systemic iron content . Therefore , blood loss lead hepcidin suppression , increase release iron circulation decrease iron store . Alterations iron metabolism immunomodulatory effect . The intra cellular iron content macropahges monocyte , show pro-inflammatory effect several investigation . Hepcidin report pro-inflammatory effect report , anti-inflammatory effect others . Although phlebotomy routinely perform blood donor , seemingly significant health risk , highly relevant know effect phlebotomy immunity . Alterations immunity due phlebotomy could beneficial effect , like suppression low grade inflammatory process contributes atherosclerosis , theory could also contribute suppressed innate immune response could increase risk infection . This relevant blood donor , also patient suffer blood loss daily clinical practice blood routinely drawn patient laboratory determination . Objective : To assess ex vivo cytokine production whole blood 28 day phlebotomy ( routine withdrawal 500 ml blood ) . Study design : Intervention study 10 healthy male volunteer . Study population : 10 healthy male volunteer age 18-35 year . Intervention ( applicable ) : Withdrawal 500 mL blood blood bank ( Sanquin , Nijmegen , The Netherlands ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : - Ex vivo cytokine production whole blood , draw day -1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 . - Hemoglobin , hematocrit , white blood cell count differential - Hepcidin - Iron parameter ( serum iron , transferrin saturation , ferritin ) Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : 10 healthy young male volunteer include study . The study consist 10 visit : 1 screen visit 9 follow-up visit . The screen visit consist medical history questionnaire . On day 0 , Phlebotomy 500 ml blood perform Sanquin blood bank , Nijmegen accord normal procedure . Risks associated phlebotomy , discomfort puncture , light-headedness , orthostatic hypotension , vasovagale response , hematoma puncture site . On day -1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 , volume 7 mL blood drawn venapuncture . Associated risk discomfort puncture , vasovagale response , hematoma puncture site .</detailed_description>
