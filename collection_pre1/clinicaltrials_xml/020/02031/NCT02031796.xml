	<brief_summary>The purpose work evaluate feasibility new Cardiac Vascular Reconstruction ( CAVAREC , Siemens Medical Systems , Germany ) image reconstruction algorithm use transcatheter aortic valve implant ( TAVI ) procedure . CAVAREC utilizes x-ray projection image currently acquire clinical DynaCT . X-ray image acquisition allow CAVAREC occur TAVI procedure TAVI device implant . If already surgically-implanted TAVI device cardiac catheterization , extra set image acquire clinical care complete , leave procedure room . The CAVAREC image processing algorithm implement off-line workstation TAVI procedure complete . After TAVI procedure , CAVAREC image quantitatively qualitatively compare Siemens DynaCT cardiac CT image Radiology . The result study used direct development CAVAREC toward end goal provide improved imaging capability guide TAVI procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Compare utility CAVAREC standard DynaCT cardiac CT clinical assessment aortic valve relevant , nearby anatomical structure . 2 . Investigate utility CAVAREC ass calcification within surround native aortic valve . 3 . Investigate utility CAVAREC assess procedural success , include prosthetic valve placement annular anatomic correlate paravalvular leak . 4 . Validate utility CAVAREC image acquire normal sinus rhythm .</detailed_description>
