	<brief_title>Exercise Adolescents Following Sport-Related Concussion : A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most adolescent recover within first month follow sport-related concussion . However , . Little known best facilitate recovery symptom resolve spontaneously swiftly . Although active rehabilitation recently suggest promising mean promote recovery , current literature provide adequate evidence safe adaptation clinical practice . Objective : The purpose project evaluate active rehabilitation protocol adolescent slow recover follow sport-related concussion . Primary aim : confirm tolerability safety active rehabilitation protocol compare treatment usual control . Secondary aim : 1 ) document impact active rehabilitation post-concussion symptom return activity ; 2 ) explore intervention effect quality life , mood , energy level , balance , cognitive functioning , return pre-injury activity . Study design : A parallel group open label randomize comparison trial 30 adolescent slow recover follow sport-related concussion . After initial screen assessment , group receive treatment usual . Participants experimental group also participate sub-symptom threshold exercise , sport-specific coordination practice , positive visualisation daily . Outcome measure : The investigator monitor adverse event assess post-concussion symptom throughout study primary marker recovery . The investigator also report secondary outcome quality life , mood , energy level , balance cognitive functioning . Finally investigators record rate return school ( full time , part time ) rate return sport ( regular pre-injury vs. modify level ) . As result , clinician able follow new rehabilitation protocol safe meaningful way . Lastly , research finding disseminate form publication , conference , via in-services . Hypotheses : 1a . The drop-out rate comparable group receive treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) versus TAU plus active rehabilitation . 1b . Adverse event occur outside clinic comparable group receive TAU versus TAU plus active rehabilitation . 1c . For group receive active rehabilitation , symptom exacerbation in-clinic exercise session resolve within 30 minute . 2 . Participants receive active rehabilitation report great improvement post-concussion symptom ( primary outcome ) follow-up . 3 . Participants receive active rehabilitation report high quality life , few depressive symptom , high energy level ; demonstrate good balance neuropsychological performance follow-up ; return pre-injury activity higher rate .</detailed_description>
