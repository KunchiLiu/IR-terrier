	<brief_summary>This follow-up study continue observe patient complete phase 1 trial AADvac1 , another 18 month . Long-term safety behavior immune response AADvac1 time main point interest . AADvac1 vaccine direct pathologically modify Alzheimer tau protein main constituent neurofibrillary tangle ( NFTs ) , intend disease-modifying treatment Alzheimer 's disease , i.e . halt progress . As study Phase I study focused tolerability safety , efficacy assess exploratory manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18-months Safety Follow-up Study AADvac1 , Active Tau Vaccine Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AADvac1 candidate therapeutic vaccine Alzheimer 's disease target misfolded tau protein , common denominator neurofibrillary pathology . Based preclinical result , intervention expect reduce number neurofibrillary tangle , remove hyperphosphorylated tau protein reduce amount oligomerized insoluble pathological tau brain , halt spread neurofibrillary pathology brain , thus prevent associate cognitive decline . The vaccine 's antigenic determinant synthetic peptide derive tau protein sequence , couple keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) use aluminum hydroxide ( Alhydrogel ) adjuvant . At present AADvac1 intend active immunotherapy patient diagnose Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . According need , patient receive additional immunization dose beyond administer precede pase 1 trial ; raise titer therapeutic antibody possible benefit treatment extend beyond duration study . Because central role pathological misfolded tau protein etiology AD , vaccine expect effective active passive immunotherapy aim eliminate amyloid Î² plaque clinically investigate far .</detailed_description>
