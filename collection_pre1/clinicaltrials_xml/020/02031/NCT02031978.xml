To eligible study , site must average minimum daily flow 1.5 new WIC ITFPS-eligible enrollee per day must expect remain operation enrol new WIC participant WIC ITFPS recruitment period . In second phase subsample eligible first-stage sample unit arrive final sample 80 first-stage sample unit ( 2 40 stratum ) . In first-stage sample unit local agency one eligible service site , second stage sample conduct select one service site . The final sample consist 80 eligible service site . Once second-stage sample complete , recruitment effort begin earnest . Although due diligence use recruit service site , anticipate site may unable unwilling cooperate . Such service site replace member match sample . This replacement service site match substitute similar imputation . - Sampling WIC participant within sample recruiting window . The WIC participant sample design total target number sample WIC enrollee spread uniformly across 80 sampled site ; , recruitment study participant design site expect yield 98 sample WIC enrollee . An important part sample plan concept recruit `` window . '' A recruiting window string consecutive workday recruit new WIC enrollee sample service site . These window vary length 7 66 workday .

The 80 window randomly assign spread start date across 20-week field period recruiting , pool possible start date give site determine base average daily enrollment enrollment schedule . Due variation actual WIC enrollment time , actual number sample enrollee enroll WIC specify recruit window vary site site .
