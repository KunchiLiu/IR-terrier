	<detailed_description>Consistent NIH priority , long-term objective reduce rate risk childhood obesity via school-based nutrition physical activity policy . We propose monitor evaluate Connecticut 's first-ranked School Wellness Policy , New Haven Public School district , implement determine impact child 's obesogenic behavior , weight outcome , school performance . We evaluate strategy implementation 12 targeted school use randomized design . Focusing targeted school enable rigorous evaluation School Wellness Policy implementation , barriers/facilitators , ultimately behavioral health impact school-based policy childhood obesity . We propose multi-level assessment factor may influence childhood obesity use Ecological Model guide framework . Thus propose multi-sectoral , multi-level approach , focus child , family , school , community . This ambitious project possible expertise strong collaborative partnership The New Haven Public Schools two Yale University research center : The Rudd Center Food Policy Obesity CARE : Community Alliance Research Engagement . Our partnership build Principles Guidelines Community-University Research Partnerships develop 12-member committee community university leader endorse Yale University community partner 2009 . This study design significantly advance empirical research school wellness policy : focus implementation measurable impact student health . No matter well write , school wellness policy must effectively implement achieve potential impact . Further , student within school represent two component large socio-ecological system influence eat behavior , physical activity , weight status . The federal mandate school wellness policy require district address many aspect school environment ( e.g. , nutrition education , nutrition standard food sell , opportunities physical activity ) . To maximize improvement , type multi-component policy need . However , complexity make difficult evaluate policy impact draw conclusion causal relationship specific policy student health . With team 's unique strength challenge mind , design research study follow Specific Aims : 1 . Track evaluate strategy target implementation School Wellness Policy . 2 . Identify factor facilitate impede implementation The School Wellness Policy , include neighborhood , school , student determinant ; 3 . Evaluate impact implementation The School Wellness Policy obesogenic behavior health outcomes well school performance . We collaborate District implement subset nutrition physical activity policy 12 school use randomize 2 x 2 research design . This permit comparison potential unique synergistic effect nutrition physical activity policy student behavior related health outcome . We follow cohort 5th grade student ( Nâ‰ˆ700 ) annually four year assess potential change student eat behavior , physical activity level , BMI . We use multi-method approach collect data examine predictor outcomes across level socio-ecological framework : student variable , family characteristic , school policy , neighborhood feature . This multidisciplinary proposal synchronous specific research objective articulate Program Announcement ( PA-10-052 ) School Nutrition Physical Activity Policies , Obesogenic Behaviors Weight Outcomes . As noted , study date examine policy implementation process . We directly target implementation impact health-related policy school , measure obesogenic behavior BMI primary outcome . We active track system monitor impact policy , focus minority population traditionally vulnerable underserved . As stated NIH program announcement , policy-based approach combat obesity school exist ; however , knowledge lack key area concern optimal policy , key implementation strategy policy , impact policy important health social outcome . The propose project advance scientific knowledge understand arena provide important evidence guide future intervention school community translate science improve health public .</detailed_description>
