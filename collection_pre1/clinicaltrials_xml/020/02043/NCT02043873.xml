	<brief_summary>Objectives : The aim prospective , randomize , triple-blind cohort study assess longevity repair localize clinical defect composite restoration initially schedule treated restoration replacement Methods : 28 patient age 18 80 year 50 composite restoration recruited.Restorations clinically diagnose secondary caries ( Charlie ) undercontoured anatomical form defect ( Bravo ) randomly assign Repair ( n = 25 ) Replacement ( n = 25 ) group , quality restoration score accord modify USPHS criterion . A Wilcoxon test perform comparison group ( CI=0.05 ) . A Friedman test utilized multiple comparison different year group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A cohort 28 patient age 18 80 year female ( 58 % ) male ( 42 % ) 50 composite restoration recruit Operative Dentistry Clinic Dental School University Chile . All participant present one clinical feature deviate ideal rat Bravo Charlie accord modify United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) criteria 6 . The protocol approve Institutional Research Ethics Committee Dental School University Chile ( Project PRI-ODO-0207 ) . All patient sign informed-consent form complete registration form . The selection criterion summarize . 2.2 Treatment Group Criteria Initially , 356 restoration ( 28 patient ) evaluate assigned accordance modify USPHS criterion , 50 select accordance inclusion criterion . Restorations clinically diagnose secondary caries ( Charlie ) undercontoured anatomical form defect ( Bravo ) randomly assign Repair ( n = 25 ) Replacement ( n = 25 ) group ( Figure 1 ) . The randomization perform Power Analysis Sample Size System ( PASS software v. 2008 , Keysville , UT , USA ) , diagnosis active secondary caries make base Ekstrand criterion . 2.3 Restoration Assessment The quality restoration score accord modify USPHS criterion . Two examiner underwent calibration exercise year ( JM EF ) . The Cohen 's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient 0.74 baseline 0.87 ten year . Immediately treatment ( baseline ) 10 year later , examiner assess restoration independently direct visual tactile examination mouth mirror number 5 explorer number 23 ( Hu Friedy Mfg . Co. Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) indirectly radiographic examination ( bite wing ) . The five parameter examine marginal adaptation , anatomic form , surface roughness , secondary caries , lustre . If difference record two examiner , could reach agreement , third clinician , also underwent calibration exercise ( GM ) , make final decision . 2.4 Treatment Groups 2.4.1 Repair The clinician ( PV - GM ) use carbide bur ( 330-010 Komet , Brasseler GmbH Co. , Lemgo , Germany ) explore defective margin restoration , begin removal part restorative material adjacent defect act exploratory cavity ; allow proper diagnosis evaluation extent defect . Provided defect limited localize , clinician remove defective tooth tissue . Once material remove , exploratory cavity preparation do include removal demineralize soft tooth tissue . A self-priming resin bonding system use ( Adper Prompt L-Pop ; 3M ESPE , St. Paul , MN , USA ) , follow restoration resin-based composite ( RBC ) restorative material ( Filtek Supreme ; 3M ESPE ) . A rubber dam isolation use procedure . 2.4.2 Replacement The clinician totally remove replaced defective restoration . After complete cavity preparation , restore new resin composite ( RC ; Filtek Supreme ; 3M ESPE ) . The elimination soft tooth tissue caries infection do use carbide burs high speed full water irrigation . During cavity preparation , preventive extension undercut area create , cavity angle round . In deep dentin , glass-ionomer liner use ( Vitrebond ; 3M ESPE ; USA ) . Adper Prompt L-Pop , ( 3M ESPE ) use per manufacturer instruction , RBC ( Filtek Supreme ; 3M ESPE ) apply incremental technique . The occlusion check , restoration finish polished follow manufacturer instruction .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients localize marginal deficiency composite restoration clinically judge suitable repair , seal , refurbish accord USPHS criterion ( Table 1 ) . Patients 20 teeth . Restorations functional occlusion oppose natural tooth . Asymptomatic restore tooth . At least one proximal contact area neighbour tooth . Patients older 18 year . Patients agree signed consent form participate study . Area restorationÂ´s failure good condition . Patients contraindication regular dental treatment base medical history . Patients special aesthetic requirement could solve repair treatment . Patients xerostomia take medication significantly decrease salivary flow . Patients high risk caries . Patients psychiatric physical disease , interfere oral hygiene .</criteria>
