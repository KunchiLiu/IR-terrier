	<brief_summary>Premature ovarian failure ( POF ) , also know premature ovarian insufficiency , primary ovarian insufficiency ( accurate term woman may still conceive ) , premature menopause , hypergonadotropic hypogonadism define failure ovary function adequately woman young 40 year , role either endocrine organ reproductive organ , condition characterize amenorrhea , hypoestrogenism , elevate serum gonadotropin level ( demonstrate ovary longer respond circulate FSH produce estrogen develop fertile egg ) woman young 40 year . This condition occur approximately 1 % woman important physical psychological consequences/impact patient . The purpose study investigate role transplantation bone marrow derive stem cell ovarian tissue treatment premature ovarian failure ass ability differentiate germ cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation Patients With Idiopathic Drug Induced Premature Ovarian Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label investigation efficacy injection autologous adult bone marrow derive stem cell ovarian stroma patient premature ovarian failure . Sixty woman premature ovarian failure recruit study write informed consent . Diagnosis base mainly history taking , physical examination investigation . Laboratory investigation include Serum follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , serum estrogen measurement serum AMH . The anterior pituitary secretes FSH LH high level due dysfunction ovary consequent low estrogen level . Typical FSH POF patient 40 mlU/ml ( post-menopausal range ) . Subjects enrol base specific inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate regular post transplant interval . Human adult bone marrow derive stem cell transplant gynecological surgeon standard surgical approach ( transvaginal U/S guide approach ) . Subjects monitor frequently total one year adult bone marrow stem cell cell injection . For safety participant , Bone Marrow Stem cell inject one ovary ovary spar .</detailed_description>
