	<brief_summary>Improving Adherence Oral Cancer Agents Self Care Symptoms Using IVR The goal study improve adherence oral chemotherapeutic medication self-management symptom among cancer patient . More 40 oral agent currently market projection three year 30 % cancer treatment agent deliver oral form . As result , patient must assume responsibility take medication self-management associated side effect . This longitudinal randomized trial test compare 'two strategy ' improve patient adherence oral cancer medication prescription standard care . Both strategy incorporate symptom management support use interactive voice response system ( IVR ) symptom assessment print evidence-based Medication Management Symptom Management Toolkit ( Toolkit ) helpful strategy information symptom management . We collaborate NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers recruit patient study . Recruiters identify patient prescribed oral cancer medication , present study patient , ask consent part study . Study Aims Following Aims study . 1 . Cancer patient assign intervention great adherence prescribe regimen : ) week 4 ( immediate effect ) , b ) week 8 12 ( sustained effect ) . 2 . When compare patient receive weekly assessment , patient receive weekly assessment plus daily adherence reminder print symptom management strategy 4 week report : low symptom severity week 2-4 sustained week 5-8 , 12 week . Two exploratory aim assess : 1 . To test patient characteristic ( age , sex , depression ) , dose variation , symptom severity , concurrent infusion therapy moderate impact novel intervention adherence 4 , 8 , 12 week . 2 . To test impact novel intervention dose alteration , emergency department visit hospital admission 12 week order support translation system oncology practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Methods A unique feature study assessment , reminder , symptom management strategy deliver Interactive Voice Response system ( IVR ) . This system test previous trial pilot study medication adherence ; receive high satisfaction rating patient . All patient complete intake ( baseline ) , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week interview symptom severity , depression , beliefs oral agent , self-efficacy , pill count . Following intake interview computerized procedure randomize patient one two group : experimental control . Patients arm receive 12 weekly assessment adherence oral cancer medication symptom severity deliver IVR . In addition , patient experimental group receive daily reminder call 4 week deliver IVR . At end week 4 patient offer option reduce call every day , continue daily reminder week 5-8 . Reminder call tailored cycle medication . Daily reminder call include question determine medication change occur . If occurs , reminder call stop and/or adjust revise prescription . Patients experimental group mail Toolkit . Patients report symptom designate threshold weekly assessment call refer Toolkit assist self-management . The control group receive IVR reminder call first 8 week . Control group patient , report difficulty take cancer medication prescribe , randomize follow 8 week interview either receive 4 week daily IVR reminder call week 9-12 , continue control group . Patients randomize receive daily IVR reminder call receive Toolkit follow randomization ( weekly assessment call report symptom designate threshold refer Toolkit assist self-management ) . Patients randomized continue control group receive Toolkit upon completion 12 week interview . Medical record audit oral cancer medication change study period well adverse toxic event note , script write . Implications &amp; Impact This research identify explore factor ( symptom severity , medication complexity , patient characteristic ) affect adherence oral cancer medication symptom management might improve level adherence . This allow patient engage care potentially transform safety quality cancer care patient oral cancer medication .</detailed_description>
