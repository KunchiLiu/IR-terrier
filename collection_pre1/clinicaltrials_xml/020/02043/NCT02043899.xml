	<brief_summary>This study aim show 3-dimensional PET/CT image new novel PET tracer ( call [ 124I ] mIBG ) detect many site neuroblastoma ( type childhood cancer ) compare recommend 1-dimensional routine scan ( call [ 123I ] mIBG planar scintigraphy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study 124ImIBG PET/CT Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma common tumour childhood brain tumour . Approximately half case high risk despite extensive treatment outcome poor . More 60 % high risk patient suffer relapse spread disease long-term survival 10 % . Existing image technique sensitive enough accurately assess level risk critical determine best choice treatment . This study compare new type image exist image technique . The new scan use new tracer call [ 124I ] mIBG take cancer tissue much normal tissue . This tracer use 3D imaging technique call PET/CT pinpoint disease spread quantify amount disease . Patients schedule [ 123I ] mIBG scan routine care plan break treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven Stage 4 neuroblastoma define International Neuroblastoma Staging System ( INSS ) . 2 . Aged ≥ 1 year time write informed consent give . 3 . Planned undergo conventional [ 123I ] mIBG planar scintigraphy routine clinical care neuroblastoma . 4 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 5 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 , 1 2 ( Appendix 2 ) patient age &gt; 12 year old Lansky play scale score ≥ 50 % ( Appendix 3 ) patient age ≤ 12 year old . 6 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent patient ≥ 16 year old and/or parent legal guardian patient &lt; 16 year old patient capable cooperate scanning requirement . ( N.B . Written verbal assent appropriate seek patient 16 year old ) . Additional Inclusion Criteria Biokinetic substudy 1 . Aged ≤ 16 year time write informed consent give . 2 . No requirement general anaesthesia undergo PET/CT scanning . 3 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent substudy patient age 16 year patient 's parent guardian patient age &lt; 16 year . Capable cooperate additional study PET/CT scan . ( N.B . Written verbal assent appropriate seek patient 16 year old . ) Additional Inclusion Criteria PET/MRI substudy 1 . No requirement general anaesthesia undergo hybrid PET/MRI scanning . 2 . No previous experience claustrophobia . 3 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent substudy patient age 16 year patient 's parent guardian patient age &lt; 16 year . Capable cooperate additional study PET/MRI scan . ( N.B . Written verbal assent appropriate seek patient 16 year old . ) 1 . Treatment medication contraindicate mIBG scanning list Appendix 4 . For example , decongestant contain pseudoephedrine , phenylpropalomine phenylephrine , sympathomimetics , cocaine , antihypertensive , tricyclic antidepressant . These drug stop administration indicated list ( usually four biological halflives allow almost complete washout refer list ) . 2 . Stage 4S neuroblastoma define INSS . 3 . Any anticancer treatment plan routine [ 123I ] mIBG image [ 124I ] mIBG PET/CT scan Day 2 . Anticancer treatment start OffStudy assessment Day 3 Day 7 , see schedule assessment Section 7 . N.B . Patients enrol study participation delay subsequent treatment neuroblastoma . 4 . Female patient pregnant lactate . 5 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 6 . Known serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . 7 . Patients know hypersensitivity mIBG . 8 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical study .</criteria>
