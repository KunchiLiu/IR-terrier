	<detailed_description>This study phase III multinational , multicenter , randomize , double blind , placebo control , study randomization allocation ratio 1:1 ( radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone : placebo plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone ) .The study period consist screening/randomization , treatment , active follow-up clinic visit , active follow-up without clinic visit , long-term follow-up phase . In study , subject receive study treatment ( radium-223 dichloride placebo addition abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone first 6 cycle follow abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone thereafter ) on-study symptomatic skeletal event ( SSE ) occur ( withdrawal criterion meet ) . Follow-up continue 7 year subject dy , lose followup , withdraws inform consent actively object collection data.This study conduct approximately 150 investigative study center approximately 800 subject enrol .</detailed_description>
