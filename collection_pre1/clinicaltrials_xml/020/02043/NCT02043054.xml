	<detailed_description>T2DM young T2DM traditionally associate old age , type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) dominant form young population . This traditional profile dramatically alter last couple decade ; sharp rise level obesity sedentary lifestyle witness young age group develop country result 10 fold increase prevalence T2DM young adult youth [ 7 ] . Whereas T2DM rarity 40 year , recently show T2DM represent 20 % register diabetes case across centre Leicester Sheffield age group [ 8 ] . More worryingly , sub-analysis Leicester arm international ADDITION study [ 9 ] , large population-based screening study include small cohort 40 year age ( n = 445 ) , on-going NPRI-MRC study young high risk adult , suggest prevalence undiagnosed T2DM 40 year 2 4 % depend diagnostic criterion use 5 % family history obesity ( unreported observation ) . The focus health care policy research lag behind substantive shift profile T2DM towards young population . For example , NHS health check programme target 40 year age previous self-management , lifestyle pharmaceutical intervention use inform NICE guidance conduct group age 50 70 year . Clinical Burden T2DM young The onset T2DM younger adult youth represent extreme phenotype magnifies disease profile observe old adult . For example , diagnose T2DM 40 year likely classify Class II Class III obesity ( ≥35 kg/m2 ) , multigenerational family history T2DM , lead sedentary lifestyle minority ethnic origin [ 7 ] . Of particular concern onset T2DM young adult associate dramatic elevation risk cardiovascular disease , particularly coronary heart disease . For example , risk macrovascular complication young adult T2DM compare control show twice high compare T2DM patient ( HR 7.9 vs. 3.8 , respectively ) [ 10 ] . Myocardial infarction ( MI ) find common macrovascular outcome ; hazard develop MI younger adult T2DM 14-fold high control subject [ 10 ] . In contrast , old adult T2DM less four time risk develop MI compare control subject . Others report mortality rate young people T2DM high 9 % 9 year period [ 11 ] . Younger people T2DM therefore high complication rate peer Type 1 diabetes , despite short duration diabetes , highlight aggressive nature disease . Our group recently complete Medical Research Council ( MRC ) fund study aim elucidate biochemical cardiac abnormality associate T2DM young adult ( 18 40 year ) . The study recruit 20 young adult ( 18 40 year ) diagnose T2DM 20 age-matched metabolically healthy obese lean control ( paper preparation ) . Cardiac structure function assess state-of-the-art tagged cardiac MRI imaging . The strike finding study evidence great diastolic dysfunction T2DM compare obese lean control . Specifically , peak end diastolic strain rate , highly sensitive measure leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function , average value 1.27 s-1 T2DM cohort ( low limit normal range define 1.3 s-1 ) 20 % low obese control 30 % low lean control . This finding consistent large study use echocardiography ass cardiac function structure 150 adolescent young adult T2DM compare obese lean control ; study report diastolic dysfunction reduce lean obese obese T2DM . These study therefore suggest pre-clinical diastolic dysfunction already manifest young adult T2DM , despite relatively young age short duration type 2 diabetes . This find highly clinically relevant suggest high risk cardiovascular disease observe T2DM predominantly characterise diastolic dysfunction predispose patient heart failure , advance overt systolic compromise [ 12,13 ] . For example , 50 % case chronic heart failure preserve ejection fraction [ 12,13 ] . Therefore therapeutic strategy target glycaemic control diastolic cardiac function would highly desirable young adult T2DM . GLP-1 THERAPY Traditional therapy management T2DM focus enhance secretion , action availability insulin . However , whilst approach successful manage blood glucose level , modest benefit reduce rate myocardial infarction associate number deleterious side effect , include hypoglycaemia , bone fracture , congestive heart failure , weight gain , , analyse , increased mortality [ 14 ] . Therefore development new therapy simultaneously target hyperglycaemia cardiovascular disease major priority . Two recently approve class incretin base therapy , glucagon like peptide -1 ( GLP-1 ) analogues dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor , show promise area . Both class exert action potentiation incretin receptor signalling , particularly GLP-1 . In vivo GLP-1 predominately secrete L-cells distal jejunum , ileum colon . Low basal level secrete fast state , however , level rapidly transiently increase response ingestion food ; secretagogues include major macronutrients , particularly glucose . Endogenous GLP-1 short half-life 1 - 2 minute follow rapid degradation enzyme DPP-4 [ 15 ] . GLP-1 receptor widespread throughout body include pancreas , stomach lining , intestine , brain heart . The widespread distribution GLP-1 receptor support diversity pleiotropic effect . Other direct effect appetite regulation , widely investigate action GLP-1 around homeostasis glucose level . GLP-1 known stimulate insulin secretion glucose dependant manor ( thus limit risk hypoglycaemia ) , well promote glucose stimulate insulin gene transcription biosynthesis [ 14 ] . It may also trophic effect pancreatic beta-cells . Given glucose dependant effect , GLP-1 therapy develop treatment strategy management T2DM . Due short half-life native GLP-1 , therapies revolve around inhibit action DPP-4 thus augment naturally occur level incretin hormone , intravenous administration GLP-1 analogue resistant action DPP-4 . In contrast DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 analogue administer supra-physiological level thus lead profound receptor activation biological effect . This particularly true relation weight-loss , GLP-1 analogues show directly induce substantial weight loss great effect see high level obesity . In contrast , DPP-4 inhibitor appear weight neutral . Both DPP-4 inhibitor , Sitagliptin Vildagliptin Linagliptin GLP-1 Liraglutide Exenatide license use management T2DM within United Kingdom . Liraglutide recently approve GLP-1 analogue therapy great promise term glycaemic efficacy weight loss . The Liraglutide Effect Action Diabetes ( LEAD ) study demonstrate used combination one OADs , dose 1.2 1.8 mg Liraglutide daily significantly reduce HbA1c ( mean HbA1c decrease : 1.0-1.5 % ) [ 16-22 ] . Clinically important decrease fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) level also well document follow Liraglutide treatment ( mean FPG decrease : −1.6 2.2 mmol/l 1.55 2.4 mmol/l 1.2 1.8 mg Liraglutide , respectively [ 16-23 ] ; mean PPG decrease : 2.3-2.6 1.81-2.7 mmol/l 1.2 1.8 mg Liraglutide , respectively [ 16-19 ] ) . Liraglutide also proven superior effect glycaemic control compare license GLP-1 analogue DPP-4 inhibitor [ 20,21 ] . In addition improve glycaemic control , Liraglutide also effective induce weight loss reduce blood pressure . Mean body weight reduction least 1 kg apparent dos Liraglutide ( −1.0 −2.9 kg 1.2 mg ; −1.8 −3.4 kg 1.8 mg ) [ 17-21 ] . Greater decrease body weight exhibit patient higher adiposity [ 23 ] . Furthermore , use daily dos 2.4 mg , Liraglutide show great effect body weight Orlistat [ 24 ] . Mean reduction systolic blood pressure 6 mmHg also report [ 22 ] GLP-1 ANALOGUE THERAPY BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE Observed systolic blood pressure reduction 6 mmHg Liraglutide would expect result 15 25 % reduction cardiovascular event rate independent glucose lower effect [ 25 ] . It hypothesize GLP-1 receptor independent nitric oxide mediate vasodilatory pathway responsible , potentially beneficial cardiovascular effect endothelial function , renal sodium excretion PAI-1 ( Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor ) . GLP-1 receptor activation may also induce sympathetic autonomic activity stimulate myocyte glucose uptake well provoke positive chronotropic inotropic response . Although recent review suggest pleiotropic action detrimental effect cardiovascular event , clinical significance modest elevation rest heart rate treatment currently unclear [ 26,27 ] . Liraglutide license use Europe , Canada , Japan , Mexico USA . GLP-1 ANALOGUE THERAPY AND CARDIAC FUNCTION Clearly , substantial clinical benefit accrue glucose weight lower property GLP-1 analogue therapy . However , emerge experimental evidence suggest GLP-1 therapy specific cardioprotective effect independent whole body glucose metabolism . In particular , along improvement endothelial function , GLP-1 treatment show direct effect cardiac function structure . For example , rat canine model heart failure/cardiomyopathy demonstrate GLP-1 administration associate improved cardiac output , decrease leave ventricular end-diastolic volume reduce myocyte apoptosis [ recent review see 28,29 ] . Furthermore , mouse lack GLP-1 receptor report LV diastolic dysfunction , great LV wall thickening impaired LV contractile function [ 30 ] . Although limited , human study confirm link GLP-1 treatment cardiac function structure . For example , 5 week GLP-1 therapy , 12 patient chronic heart failure improve LV function well exercise capacity [ 31 ] . Similarly , 72 hour GLP-1 infusion associate improved LV ejection fraction survivor acute myocardial infarction [ 32 ] Exenatide administer percutaneous coronary intervention reduce reperfusion injury infarct size [ 33 ] . Although promising , study limit small sample non-randomised methodology . However several randomised trial recently publish . In one study 20 patient randomise GLP-1 saline infusion percutaneous coronary intervention ; GLP-1 find ameliorate LV dysfunction [ 34 ] . Another randomise cross-over study demonstrate GLP-1 therapy improve LV function 14 patient coronary artery disease [ 35 ] . Whilst find highly promising , data lack around efficacy GLP-1 therapy improve cardiac function high risk population without overt cardiovascular disease . This limitation particularly relevant young individual T2DM likely extreme level obesity present sub-clinical diastolic dysfunction . Therefore research need investigate extent GLP-1 therapy ameliorate early stage cardiac dysfunction . The objective study determine Liraglutide , GLP-1 analogue , lead improved LV diastolic function young adult T2DM compare clinical relevant active comparator Sitagliptin , DPP-4 inhibitor .</detailed_description>
