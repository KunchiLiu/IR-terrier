	<brief_summary>Anastomosis intestine viscera currently require open laparoscopic surgery often difficult , time-consuming , expensive part many operation . We develop device ( `` Magnamosis '' ) may create compression anastomosis easily , quickly , less expensively suture staple . The Magnamosis device consist two 23-mm diameter , convex-concave , radially symmetric ring magnet encase polycarbonate . One magnet place lumen viscus join , magnet self-align , compression anastomosis achieve tissue remodel . We complete extensive pre-clinical study animal show Magnamosis use accomplish gastrojejunostomy , jejunojejunostomy , duodenal-colostomy , colo-colostomy safely effectively use available endoscopic minimally invasive surgery technique . We conduct small first-in-human study obtain clinical data support safety early feasibility Magnamosis device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnamosis First-in-human Study Feasibility Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , prospective , single-center pilot study evaluate feasibility safety create intestinal anastomosis use Magnamosis Magnetic Compression Anastomosis ( Magnamosis ) device FDA IDE G130046 . Ten , otherwise healthy , subject , age 18-60 year , disease process necessitate open laparoscopic surgical anastomosis re-establishment intestinal continuity would otherwise perform use suture staple device enrol . Participation study require time commitment three month . The total duration study 18 month ensure three-month follow-up subject , long-term follow-up subject one two year postoperation . The primary outcome measure incidence anastomotic leak relate use Magnamosis device . Anastomotic leakage define clinical symptom fever , sepsis peritonitis within 30 day postoperatively lead clinical and/or radiological interventional procedure reoperation confirm leakage related device . Secondary outcome measure include rate occurrence device-related complication hospitalization post-procedure , include rate bleeding , perforation , retention foreign body , anastomotic stricture document symptom image within three month procedure . The duration hospitalization , number day passage Magnamosis device ( found stool absent x-ray ) , number day first postoperative bowel movement also measure . Post-operative administration pain scale also yield study data . Subject follow-up conduct discharge 2 week ( person , clinic ) , 1 month , 3 month , 1 year 2 year either person , via email , telephone , Skype , non in-person method .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Between 18 â‰¤ 60 year age Requires nonemergent operation create intestinal anastomosis maintenance intestinal continuity Magnamosis device use instead suture staple . Able read , speak understand English Demonstrates understand study procedure risk , provide sign informed consent . Intestines anastomose appropriate size , thickness tissue health Magnamosis device . For example , Intestine small accommodate 23mm diameter device ; Intestine large 23mm diameter anastomotic lumen adequate ; Intestine thicken allow two half device come together sufficient force produce compression anastomosis ( e.g . inflame scar intestinal wall ; foreign body like staple anastomosis ) ; Inadequate blood supply Requires anastomosis stomach Bowel well perfuse Anastomosis tension Anatomic reconstruction require cross staple line ASA ( American Society Anesthesiology ) score 4 5 ; Requires one anastomosis operation ; Women possibly know pregnant ; Inability obtain preauthorization insurance company third party payor Does meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
