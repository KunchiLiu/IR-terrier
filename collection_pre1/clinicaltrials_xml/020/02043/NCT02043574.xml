	<detailed_description>In acute stroke setting , know energy imbalance associate poor rehabilitation functional outcome , importantly , increase risk institutionalization . However , nutrition eat habit chronic stroke rehabilitative care receive little consideration , especially survivor live free living environment . Studies show deficiency energy protein intake versus recommendation chronic stroke survivor . Perry et al . find ~7 % chronic stroke survivor moderate ~5 % high nutritional risk . Although little known regard total daily energy expenditure dietary intake chronic stroke , energy macronutrient imbalance may profound impact stroke recovery risk development chronic disease recurrent stroke alter substrate oxidation result systemic tissue level oxidative stress . Conversely , cardiovascular disease risk increase excess calorie fat intake two-thirds stroke survivor overweight obese . In obese , non-stroke population , energy dense , high fat meal associate increase plasma oxidative stress marker . Oxidative stress lead mitochondrial damage abnormal accumulation metabolite intermediate lipid accumulation non-adipose tissue , impair heart function , increase CVD stroke recurrence risk .</detailed_description>
