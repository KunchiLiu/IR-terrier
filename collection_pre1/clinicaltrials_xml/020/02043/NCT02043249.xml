	<brief_summary>In embry life passage IgG type , mother tha embryoyo age 3-5 month birth infant start develop . In preterm infant start point level IgG 's low level term infant . Delayed cord clamp /milking prooved many research benificial term : level hemoglobin ; hematocrit feritin neonats . Also benefit prove mean less need blood tranfusion , less intra ventricular hemorrhage ; necrotzing entero colitis iron deficiency anemia . The hypothesis delay clamp /milking increse level IgG 's preterm infant . The end point hypothesis delay cord clamp /milking cause less fever disease hospitalization neonats .</brief_summary>
