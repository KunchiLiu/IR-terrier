	<brief_summary>Background study : Multiple electroencephalographically derive index develop measure cerebral hypnotic drug effect anesthesia , use variety mathematical algorithms bispectral index , spectral entropy spectral edge frequency . The complexity raw EEG reduce -an easy interpret- number . It vary generally 100 ( fully awake patient ) 0 ( excessively sedate patient ) . The anesthesiologist adjusts dose scheme target number predefined range . ( e.g . 40 60 ) These monitor currently solidly integreted clinical practice although keep hamper several limitation . The important problem extract direct neuro-physiological phenomenon know closely related loss return consciousness , rather probabilistic nature , indicate whether probability responsivenessis high low . You never sure EEG phenomenon relate index . Also , number relates loss consciousness rarely number indicate return consciousness , decrease predictive value recovery anesthesia . Additionally , dose response relationship differs multiple parameter monitor . As performance one monitor extrapolate another . Finally , although detection capacity responses verbal command fairly good , EEG extract number perform bad correlation movement noxious stimulus . Most problem relate limited understanding relationship change EEG underlying ( insufficiently understand ) neurophysiological mechanism evokes ( un ) consciousness anesthesia . Secondly , time development monitor , method drug administration less reproducible allow rational drug titration population different demographic . The last two decade , major progress make issue . Therefore , new insight neuro-physiology good drug titration system open new perspective improve EEG derive data extraction . Recently , Mashuire et al find typical EEG characteristic correlate consistently loss return responsiveness , independent anesthetic use ( inhalation intravenous ) independent specie test ( rat human ) . These finding suggest new information extract raw EEG much close connection essential neurophysiological process involve evoke consciousness/unconsciousness responsiveness/unresponsiveness . In study want collect data allow u recognize pattern EEG well measurement consciousness/unconsciousness . Additionally , ability use ( clinically availlable ) target control infusion technique propofol ( plasma- and/or effect-site control ) end-tidal titrate sevoflurane ( Zeus Ventilator ( Draeger ) ) If titrate hypnotic advance pharmacologically rational titration method , may detect relevant correlation dose give EEG behavior . By add remifentanil , also explore alteration performance EEG derive information interaction opioids . The obtain data may result breakthrough methodology titrate anesthesia predictable reproducible way , extract information relate closer neuro-physiological process relate ( un ) responsiveness . Moreover , index may produce consistent result whether inhaled anesthetic intravenous drug give .</brief_summary>
