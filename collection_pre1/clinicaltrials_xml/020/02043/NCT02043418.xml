	<brief_title>Outcome 5 Years Early Treated HIV Infected Infants PEDIACAM Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The follow-up HIV infect child important part access antiretroviral drug . This therapeutic follow-up impact infant morbidity mortality remain challenge due complexity ( multi-drug therapy ) , use galenic form well adapted child , risk toxicity prolong administration , evolution syndrome patient ' parent . Currently , access ARV ameliorate child Sub-Saharan Africa , little information available medium long-term evolution early treat HIV infect infant ARV treatment . In Cameroon , PEDIACAM ANRS 12140 study assess period 2 year , impact feasibility early ARV treatment HIV infect child humoral response EPI vaccine . This first study ( PEDIACAM ANRS 12140 ) begin November 2007 consist two phase . During first phase child bear HIV+ mother maternity ward participate hospital invite participate . For every infant bear HIV+ mother , infant bear HIV- mother match . A total 2052 pair infant recruit follow age 14 week . All infant bear seropositive mother PCR HIV diagnostic test age 6 week . The second phase begin age 14 week . It consist four group infant : group HIV+ infants bear HIV+ mother follow birth ( n=69 ) ; group HIV- infant born HIV+ mother follow birth ( n=205 ) ; control group include subset HIV- child bear HIV- mother follow since birth ( n=196 ) ; final group add phase include HIV+ child follow since birth diagnose age 7 month trial site ( n=141 ) . During phase , child follow age 2 year . During two year ( phase I phase II ) follow criterion evaluate : feasibility early ARV treatment infant , treatment tolerance , efficacy adherence , clinical immuno-virological prognosis HIV infection infant , rate MTCT accord prevention strategy humoral response vaccine , . The prolongation 5 year follow-up child participate Phase II study constitutes present study , ANRS 12225 PEDIACAM II . This follow include HIV non-infected child unique opportunity describe medium long-term clinical immunovirological prognosis HIV infection child identify factor associate treatment failure . This second part PEDIACAM , prospective longitudinal , observational , national multi-centered study include two group infant : one group HIV infect infant treat early , one group HIV non-infected infant ( born either HIV infect HIV non-infected mother ) . Participation study propose infant include phase II PEDIACAM ANRS 12140 , possible age 2 year . Only child whose parent legal guardian consent continuation follow-up include . The child participate study see consultation every 6 month last child include reach age 5 year . In course visit , clinical examination carry well complete laboratory examination . Antiretroviral treatment line national recommendation guideline . Four hundred sixty ( 460 ) child include 148 HIV-infected 312 HIV-uninfected include ANRS 12225 - Pediacam II study . We hypothesize next three year follow period low rate miss HIV-infected child ( death loss follow ) 5 % 20 % HIV-uninfected child . With hypothesis , end study , information 140 HIV-infected 250 HIV-uninfected child analysis This cohort enable u answer question arise regard long-term outcome HIV infect child term clinical prognosis immunology , impact family environment lifestyle ARV treatment adherence . It also aid structure follow-up child treat ARVs Cameroon . Furthermore , study continue observe response vaccine . It enable identification possible failure vaccination program enable u propose , necessary , adjustment vaccine calendar .</detailed_description>
