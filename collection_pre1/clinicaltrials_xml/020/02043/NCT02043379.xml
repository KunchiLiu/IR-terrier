	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin Early Prevention Cardiopulmonary Bypass Induced Hypogammaglobulinemia Infants Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intense post-CPB systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) well describe neonates infant . Increased production release pro-inflammatory cytokine , include Tumor Necrosis Factor , Interleukin1-B , Interleukin-6 may suppress myocardial contractility , induce capillary leak , activate complement clot cascade - together lead potential organ injury death . SIRS also frequently accompany impairment humoral immune response . One potential reason acquire immunodeficiency cardiac surgery removal immunoglobulin ( Ig ) vascular space compartment either sequester lose body altogether . We recently demonstrate Ig depletion intravascular compartment occur neonate follow cardiac surgery . In retrospective study 53 child &lt; 3 month age , show plasma Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) concentration drop precipitously cardiac surgery return preoperative level 7 day ; 51 % patient hypogammaglobulinemia . An important question whether post-CPB low IgG clinical consequence . IgG play essential role humoral immune system , activate complement induce phagocytic system neutralize pathogen . IgG deficiency know risk factor infection pediatric population . We first demonstrate post-CPB hypogammaglobulinemia associate worse clinical outcome , include increase secondary infection ( 37 % vs.12 % without low IgG , p &lt; 0.05 ) . These novel finding paramount identify potential modifiable risk factor improve outcome pediatric cardiac surgery CPB . Additionally , low IgG accompany fluid overload prolong mechanical ventilation . Igs constitute important component plasma oncotic pressure , hypogammaglobulinemia may exacerbate anasarca , prolong postoperative convalescence increase morbidity associate increase ICU length stay.9 Igs increasingly recognize role modulate innate immune response . Present use IVIG exceed mere antibody replacement extend treatment autoimmune inflammatory condition . In fact , 75 % IVIG use U.S. today treatment inflammatory condition , propose mechanism include reduction pro-inflammatory cytokine adhesion molecule expression , superantigen neutralization , restoration glucocorticoid responsiveness , blockade complement fragment deposition . It plausible IVIG could benefit neonate cardiac surgery via restoration humoral opsonization capacity , also modulator innate immunity SIRS . According model , tissue injury , CPB , shock trigger SIRS , lead hypogammaglobulinemia resultant increase susceptibility inflammatory dysregulation might ameliorate via administration IVIG . In adult study , IVIG fail benefit postoperative cardiac patient severe SIRS . However , dose IVIG give relatively small compare typically give autoimmune inflammatory condition . Neonates infant may susceptible harmful effect acquire hypogammaglobulinemia adult may unable generate adequate quantity antibody response pathogen , rely mainly maternal Igs around 4th 6th month life . In addition , display exaggerate inflammatory response CPB compare old child adult , might stand benefit IVIG immunomodulator . Because increased vulnerability acquire infection morbidity set hypogammaglobulinemia result enhance SIRS immune dysfunction , feasible normalization IgG concentration neonatal infant population may improve clinical outcome via restoration humoral immune system , modulation innate immune system , restoration intravascular oncotic pressure . The appropriate IgG level threshold treatment optimal plasma IgG level target administration IVIG presently unknown .</detailed_description>
