	<detailed_description>Background Currently , DM foot admission account 2 % admission CGH , 50 % patient peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) . CGH Vascular service performs 100-150 peripheral angioplasty limb ischaemia per 6 month , majority limb salvage procedure . The angioplasty procedure perform knee ( BTK ) BTK vessel involve 80 % time . Restenosis common peripheral intervention . In recently publish DESTINY trial , superiority Everolimus DES ( XIENCE , Abbott Vascular ) proven BMS ( Bare Metal Stents ) . This landmark study suggest short lesion BTK segment , DES improve patency rate reduce need re-interventions restenosis . Re-interventions previously stented artery technically difficult . In coronary bed , Bioabsorbable stent develop provide function drug elute stent yet provide temporary scaffold allow vessel heal . The absence permanent metallic implant vascular tissue may facilitate require re-interventions target vessel / lesion side branch either percutaneous surgical mean , thus enable broad range treatment option bioresorption scaffold . In addition , unlike permanent metal implant , polymeric implant cause image artifact non-invasive CT MR evaluation provide additional benefit Rationate justification study The safety BVS already demonstrate man Coronary Bed . It currently CE mark indication . In ABSORB Cohort A Study , show excellent long term clinical outcome low MACE rate 4 year absence target lesion revascularization , Q-wave myocardial infarction , scaffold thrombosis . Cohort B confirm finding 1 year ; include patency comparable XIENCE V. Absorb BVS thus perform function drug-eluting stent offering future potential benefit result absence permanent metallic implant . An optimal post procedural follow-up imaging technique yet uncertain stent . Assessment conventional stent CT angiography limit streak susceptibility artefact MRA . Doppler Ultrasound known time intensive . Hence , MRA CTA proof accurate modality evaluation , would easier follow-up evaluation patient . The aim study : 1. study non-invasive imaging modality would appropriate follow-up Bioabsorbable Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System ( BVS , Abbott Vascular ) patency deploy subject critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) follow percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) tibial artery . The aim establish stent patency well image feature stent . 2. investigate effect percutaneous transluminal angioplasty use Bioabsorbable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) patient Critical Limb Ischaemia CLI ) Below Knee ( BTK ) lesion Asian Population . One side arm study establish image feature new stent system Doppler ultrasound , CT angiography MR angiography . The study aim establish stent patency , well image feature stent bio reabsorbs . Study design The study prospectively collect consecutive case treat BVS patient CLI BTK lesion recruit 2 year period follow 1 year . The result patient compare similar historical cohort consecutively treat XIENCE DES ( metallic Drug Eluting Stents , Abbott Vascular ) . This pilot study involve recruitment 12 patient x 1 year follow another year post implantation follow-up . If feasible , recruitment extend another year another 12 patient give total 24 patient . Patients chronic antiplatelets therapy receive loading dose Plavix 300 mg Aspirin 300 mg start 6 72 hour prior later 1 hour procedure . Pre procedure clinical assessment include pulse Transcutaneous O2 measurement around affect wound . In absence wound , perform dorsum foot . Demographic data include comorbidities , medication history , Rutherford class record . Symptomatic patient would screen duplex ultrasound prior intervention . After informed consent standard angiography/intervention , patient undergo plan intervention general local anaesthesia angiographic facility . Either antegrade retrograde approach allow . After common femoral artery sheath access , diagnostic angiogram perform per standard angioplasty procedure . 2 plane angiography target lesion perform . Of note lesion characteristic like length , location , degree stenosis calcification . Degree runoff also assess angiography . If 2 plane angiography confirm &gt; 50 % stenosis occlusion , patient eligible BVS . The target vessel choose preferably limited , wound relate artery accordance angiosome concept . There least one vessel runoff foot . After angiographic assessment suitability BVS , heparin 2500 5000 IU administer intra-arterially per standard angioplasty accord body weight . The stenosis occlusion cross ( true lumen subintimal cross allow ) guidewire choice pre-dilatation balloon catheter perform . Pre-dilatation accordance manufacturer guideline extend beyond propose treated segment Post intervention angiography subsequently perform assess success treatment repeat balloon inflation allow . Any residual stenosis degree stenosis end intervention also record . Post dilatation confine previously scaffold area exceed manufacturer recommendation respect size . Subsequent treatment runoff tibial vessel allow . Post procedure , standard post angioplasty regime follow . Patients start supplementary Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) 75 mg day together Aspirin 100mg day i.e . dual antiplatelets 6month post intervention follow Aspirin life unless contraindicate . Clinical follow-up perform immediately post procedure 1 month , 6 month 1 year post intervention . Assessment pulse , clinical patency perform visit . TCOMs perform 6 12 month . Duplex ultrasound assess re-stenosis perform 6 12 month , CT angiography MR angiography perform 12-month post-procedure .</detailed_description>

The patient take Phenprocoumon ( Marcumar ) . The patient currently breastfeed , pregnant intend become pregnant . Subject receive immunosuppression therapy , know serious immunosuppressive disease ( e.g. , human immunodeficiency virus ) , severe autoimmune disease require chronic immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus , etc . ) The patient also receive inhibitor CYP3A ( Itraconazole , Erythromycin ) , inducer CYP3A ( Rifampin ) within 90 day follow procedure .
