	<brief_title>Tocilizumab Treatment Refractory Polymyositis Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several study support efficacy tocilizumab ( TCZ ) Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis , 's use autoimmune disorder also propose . A consensus statement block effect IL-6 RA autoimmune condition recently publish . IL-6 involved growth differentiation many inflammatory cell . In addition initial role trigger B-cell stimulating factor , also induce T cell growth differentiation play critical role adaptive innate immune response . IL-6 , produce many cell include T cell , B cell , monocytes endothelial cell , bind receptor ( IL-6R ) subsequently trigger several intracellular pathway lead release inflammatory mediator stimulation immune system . Inhibition IL-6 study phase II III clinical trial RA . It lead decrease acute phase reactant indicator chronic inflammation . IL-6 also potential therapeutic target systemic sclerosis , since IL-6 induces differentiation B cell antibody form cell contribute T cell transform effector cell , use Systemic Lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) also suggest . The use TCZ myositis propose protocol support aforementioned rationale efficacy rheumatologic disorder . Patients refractory polymyositis ( PM ) treat tocilizumab respond favorably . In dermatomyositis , tissue inflammation implicate soluble cytokine network contribute disease pathogenesis . Work mouse model myositis note IL-6 mediator muscle inflammation . Other investigator study peripheral blood sample clinical data adult juvenile dermatomyositis ( DM ) note serum level IL-6 significantly correlate disease activity . In study , correlation serum IL-6 level type I interferon gene chemokine signature also identify DM . These author suggest coordinate dysregulation IL-6 production Type I interferon signal implicates pathway contribute disease pathogenesis DM . In mouse model PM , C protein-induced myositis ( CIM ) , pathology reportedly mimic see human PM . Mice treat anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody control antibodies muscle tissue histologically immunohistochemically analyze . CIM ameliorate mouse model implicate IL-6 development myositis . These result identify model useful understanding PM suggest IL-6 blockade consider new therapeutic approach treatment myositis . Thus , collective finding describe provide evidence involvement IL-6 pathogenesis adult PM DM well support role animal model human study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients include trial base follow criterion : 1 . Definite probable PM DM criterion Bohan Peter ( modify IMACS ) adult age 18 . We also allow enrollment JDM patient ( consider DM ) age 18 otherwise meet inclusion criterion stipulate . 2 . Subjects must either classic rash ( e ) DM ( heliotrope , Gottron sign Gottron papule ) , possess one myositisassociated autoantibody ( e.g . antisynthetase , antiSRP , antiMi2 , antiPMScl , anti TIF1γ etc . ) , diagnosis PM agree upon 3member Adjudication Committee consist rheumatologist , neurologist neuromuscular pathologist . 3 . Refractory myositis patient define ( see Section 3.1.1 ) fail ( consider intolerant ) adequate course glucocorticoid fail glucocorticoid least one immunosuppressive ( IS ) immunomodulatory agent ( e.g . methotrexate , azathioprine , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclophosphamide , IVIg , antiTNF agent , rituximab ) . 4 . Subjects MMT8 score ≤ 66 ( see Appendix B ) must also least 2 core set measure meet criterion list . 5 . Subjects MMT8 score &gt; 66 must least 3 core set measure meet criterion list global extramuscular VAS score MDAAT ≥ 5cm 10cm scale . 6 . Criteria core set measure study entry : 1 .

Global extramuscular disease activity score minimum value 1.0cm 10cm VAS scale Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool ( MDAAT ) . 7 . If prednisone , dose must stable 4 week prior screen visit . Tapering prednisone dose allow subject meet DOI safety/toxicity issue supervene . 1 . Prednisone Tapering : Prednisone hold constant without taper escalation ( unless serious adverse event disease flare ) subject achieve DOI . Then , taper prednisone may commence use schedule approximate 2025 % taper exist dose every 4 week base clinical judgment clinical site investigator . Prednisone taper use aforementioned guideline commence time : ( ) patient achieves DOI ( b ) complication circumstance , clinical site investigator 's opinion , necessitate tapering corticosteroid . 2 . Prednisone Entry : It also recommend patient less 1mg/kg/day prednisone study entry . 3 .
