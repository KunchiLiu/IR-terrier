	<brief_summary>Purpose : The propose research , successfully implement , result low-dose , low-cost , highly effective method screen lung cancer , lead reduction lung cancer mortality rate . Using s-DCT system image dose full tomosynthesis scan expect 10 % low-dose CT . The targeted imaging time 2 1/5 1/3 current commercial DCT system image dose . Beyond lung cancer screening , low-dose sensitive 3D lung image modality likely find application area monitor pediatric cystic fibrosis patient reduction image dose critical . Participants : One hundred ( 100 ) patient undergo clinical non-contrast CT lung nodule ask procedure ( scan ) within 2 week ( +/- 1 week ) clinical CT chest radiograph , intervene procedure therapy . Procedures ( method ) : The purpose endpoint study compare sensitivity s-DCT system conventional chest radiograph non-contrast chest CT reference standard . One hundred ( 100 ) patient undergo clinical non-contrast CT lung nodule ask procedure ( scan ) within 2 week ( +/- 1 week ) clinical CT chest radiograph , intervene procedure therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lung Nodule Sensitivity Stationary Chest Tomosynthesis Patients With Known Lung Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one arm study 100 patient one lung nodule base standard imaging ( chest CT ) UNC Hospitals consent undergo experimental s-DCT characterize number extent lung nodule . Most patient also undergo SOC CR . The sensitivity CR experimental s-DCT estimate separately , use CT gold-standard . The sensitivity CR s-DCT compare . In event CRs include SOC image unusable ( outside acceptable window ( i.e . accommodate s-DCT within 2 week ) poor quality ) , scout image acquire CT use place CR . The scout image preliminary radiograph take prior perform definitive CT . Working collaboration UNC Multi-Disciplinary Thoracic Oncology ( MTOP ) group , investigator plan inform patient may contact participate study evaluate sensitivity s-DCT system , use SOC CR chest CT comparison . CRs include provide basis compare system sensitivity , represent minimum standard . Once patient refer , investigator collaborate treat clinic regard eligibility subject , patient approach coordinator Radiology ass interest participation . The coordinator either go treat clinic , call patient home , he/she apprise study his/her treat physician/nurse . If patient interested participation , he/she consent either ( treatment clinic ) he/she arrive his/her s-DCT , prior study procedure . Review consent take place privacy exam room , possible , sample consent form send patient via email prior arrive scan allow ample review . Once patient consent , woman child bear potential ( WCBP ) give urine pregnancy test order ensure pregnant . If urine pregnancy test show result positive pregnancy , patient exclude study per exclusion criterion investigator , good conscience , expose fetus unnecessary radiation exposure . If urine pregnancy test show patient pregnant , may participate study . The study scan , s-DCT , perform within two week his/her clinical evaluation chest CT CR . There intervene therapy procedure ( i.e . biopsy excision lesion ) do SOC image s-DCT . In event CRs include SOC image unusable ( outside acceptable window poor quality ) , scout image acquire CT use place CR . Images acquire trained radiologist technologist . The technologist comfortably position patient supine position image table . Then , patient breath hold s-DCT scan anterior-posterior direction . Images reconstruct off-line transferred review conventional PACS workstation . Images review radiologist . A secondary objective study determine specificity s-DCT system determine malignancy . In order ass objective patient follow 1 year follow study image . If know nodule biopsied , malignancy determine indicated pathology report . If nodule follow biopsied within 1 year , nodule consider malignant purpose research study . However , instance may occur nodule biopsied consider malignant . In instance , subsequent CTs clinical report use determine malignancy 1 year follow-up period . A reader study perform patient accrue . Each 3 scan per patient de-identified . As reading test take place patient undergone clinical decision making ( treatment versus follow ) , result study affect patient care . A total 5 radiologist reader , least two year CT experience serve reader . Each reader separately interpret CR s-DCT study patient . For lesion , reader measure cranial caudal ( CC ) diameter , evaluate system 's ability reproduce CT size measurement . Lesion identification average measurement CC diameter Thoracic Radiology subspecialists measure conventional CT clinical interpretation serve reference standard study . Each reader separately interpret CR s-DCT image random order two different read session one month wash-out period read . The radiologist identify lesion , measure CC size lesion rate confidence decide lesion present base radiographic feature evaluation , specifically identification lesion .</detailed_description>
