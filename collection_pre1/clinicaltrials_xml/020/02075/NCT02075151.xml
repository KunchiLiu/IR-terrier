	<brief_summary>According World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate , 200 million people suffer asthma worldwide 2009 , disease claim 250,000 life globally . Autopsy report suggest 2 phenotype severe asthma : one characterize intense airway inflammation mucus plugging , severe bronchoconstriction cause respiratory failure absence significant airway inflammation . However , easy stratify patient accord phenotype without bronchoscopy . Although severe asthma comprise 10 % affected individual , account half total healthcare spending asthma . Inhaled corticosteroid effective suppress production multiple pro-inflammatory mediator , unfortunately efficacy plateau . Addition long act beta agonist anti-cholinergic agent inhale corticosteroid offer measure relief effective treatment severe asthma remain unmet goal , result intensive utilization healthcare resource . In 2010 , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve bronchial thermoplasty ( BT ) adjunctive therapy severe asthma . BT radiofrequency ablation airway smooth muscle via bronchoscopy patient undergo three procedure target different lobe lung 3 week apart . Studies demonstrate improved symptom control allow discontinuation oral steroid patient well reduction exacerbation , hospitalization use rescue medication . No development airway strictures bronchiectasis , regeneration normal epithelium BT observe . At present , remain unclear BT benefit asthma phenotype BT effect airway inflammation remodel . The hypothesis study bronchial thermoplasty likely benefit severe asthma phenotype , achieves exert effect airway inflammation remodelling . The specific aim study : 1 ) good define asthma phenotype benefit BT microarray gene expression profile ; 2 ) study effect BT airway inflammation ; 3 ) define role overall asthma management algorithm</brief_summary>
