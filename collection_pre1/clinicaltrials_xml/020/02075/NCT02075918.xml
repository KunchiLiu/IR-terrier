	<detailed_description>The development new targeted therapy alcoholic hepatitis ( AH ) one urgent need clinical hepatology . To reach goal , large multidisciplinary network require . The propose initiative `` Integrated Approaches Identifying Molecular Targets Alcoholic Hepatitis '' ( InTeam ) coordinate multidisciplinary group compose clinician , physician-scientists , basic scientist bioinformatics expert . The overarch hypothesis InTeam rational way provide useful framework future clinical trial ( AH ) consist ( ) determination key driver disease process , ( ii ) classification molecular profile subtypes AH , ( iii ) identification `` druggable '' target base key driver molecular classification . Moreover , mouse model AH lack make impossible evaluate promising target preclinical mouse study meaningful manner . For purpose , InTeam integrate data obtain molecular pathology study human AH functional study key pathway animal model . The propose InTeam consortium include three research project , ten clinical center , Human Biorepository Mouse Models Core . The Human Biorepository Core generate to-date large collection sample patient AH 10 academic liver center comprehensive database serve basis propose translational study valuable asset broader scientific community . The Mouse Models core conduct murine study establish evaluate mouse model AH base pathophysiology molecular driver human AH determine consortium .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients â‰¥18 &lt; 70 year age . Active alcohol abuse define accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders IV ( DSM IV ) excessive alcohol consumption prior admission ( &gt; 60 g per day men &gt; 40 g per day woman ) . Moderate elevation aminotransferase ( usually less 300 U / L ) characteristic pattern AST/ ALT ratio 2:1 . Elevated serum GGT bilirubin level . Absence prior autoimmune liver disease ( ANA &lt; 1/80 , SMA &lt; 1/80 , LKM1 neg , AMA neg ) . Absence hepatitis B C HIV infection ( antiHCV , surface HBV antigen antiHIV neg ) . Patients decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis suitable inclusion ( eg , acute gastrointestinal bleeding , acute renal failure , hepatic encephalopathy bacterial infection ) . Because nondiagnostic tool diagnose alcoholic hepatitis , histological confirmation require patient ( preferably transjugular biopsy ) : alcoholic hepatitis diagnose presence follow histologic feature : Steatosis ( either macro microvesicular ) . Hepatocellular damage ( eg , hepatocyte ballooning presence MalloryDenk body ) . Inflammatory infiltrate ( predominantly polymorphonuclear cell ) . Pericellular sinusoidal fibrosis . Hepatocellular carcinoma . Complete portal vein thrombosis . Advanced terminal extrahepatic disease ( eg heart failure , advance lung disease , advance oncologic disease ) . Lack consent participate study . Pregnancy .</criteria>
