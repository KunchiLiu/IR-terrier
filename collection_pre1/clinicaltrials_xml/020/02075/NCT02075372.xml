	<brief_summary>The successful re-opening block coronary artery beneficial effect clinical course ( e.g . improvement clinical symptom , improve quality life , increase heart function , etc. ) . However , type blockage difficult open mean percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , procedure commonly use kind problem . This procedure make use technique special wire , balloon , stent ( metal polymeric tube-like structure ) device utilized re-open revascularize blockage one blood vessel heart . This type blockages chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) . CTOs certain characteristic impede revascularization blood vessel . Nevertheless , remarkable progress achieve past year area CTO revascularization CTO PCI . A large range CTO dedicate material , guidewires , guide catheter , device , balloon stent , well different technique develop . However , present , reluctance open CTOs still exist , due indication outcomes percutaneous revascularization well technical difficulty commonly arise interventional procedure . The presence difficulty result suboptimal success rate worldwide ( ±70-80 % ) , despite many innovation . To increase success rate make sure interventional cardiologist treat CTOs , hybrid treatment algorithm develop material ( e.g . CrossBoss™ catheter ; Bridgepoint Medical , Inc. ) technique , currently already available . The main purpose study evaluate efficacy efficiency hybrid algorithm well validate efficacy one material ( CrossBoss™ catheter ) , use algorithm . To able , data concern patient ' demographic , CTO characteristic , procedure outcome collect form registry . This registry perform several European centrum ( Belgium , Netherlands , United Kingdom , France ) . Since study collect data intervention perform , observational study . At regular time point , data check error inconsistency . To , site visit perform pre-defined time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CrossBoss Hybrid Registry Coronary Chronic Total Occlusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subject show presence least one coronary chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) , either without presence one diseased coronary artery . This CTO must locate native coronary artery visually estimate stenosis 100 % , correspond Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) flow 0 . Following operator judgment , occlusion present 3 month . Subject be/is treat percutaneously one CTOs via hybrid technique . Subject ( legal guardian ) understand study requirement treatment procedure provide write informed consent studyspecific procedure perform . Subject willing comply protocolrequired followup evaluation ( patient follow 1 month PCI procedure ass complication clinical status ) . The occlusion consider less 3 month present . Subject treat via PCI without application hybrid algorithm and/or use CrossBoss™ Stingray™ technology ( Bridgepoint Medical , Inc. ) . Subject participate another investigational clinical trial may cause noncompliance protocol confound data interpretation . Subject intend participate another investigational clinical trial may cause noncompliance protocol confound data interpretation .</criteria>
