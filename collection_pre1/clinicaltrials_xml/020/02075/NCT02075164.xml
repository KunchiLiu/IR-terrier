	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) comprise spectrum range simple fatty liver steatohepatitis ( NASH ) liver cirrhosis cancer ( HCC ) major increase health problem affect nearly 40 % general population . Moreover , NAFLD important risk factor progression diabetes atherosclerosis . However , pathomechanisms determine disease progression poorly understood . The overall aim project test central hypothesis excessive fructose consumption provide multiple metabolic hit pathogenesis progression NAFLD/NASH impairment hepatic lipid homeostasis mitochondrial function result hepatic lipotoxicity inflammasome activation disturb interorgan cross-talk among insulin sensitive tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To achieve goal address follow specific hypothesis - Fructose-induced change lipid composition hepatocellular store determine lipotoxicity may associate abnormality mitochondrial function , energy homeostasis , inflammasome activation cellular injury progression NASH , effect compare glucose - Non-invasive characterization fructose ( compare glucose ) -induced lipotoxic hepatic extrahepatic metabolic risk profile ( lipid composition energy metabolism ) obtain magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) identify patient NASH - Severity fructose ( compare glucose ) -induced lipotoxic lipid adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) derangement ( identify MRS ) critically determine degree insulin resistance abnormality hepatic glucose lipid metabolism - Compensatory hyperinsulinemia , secondary skeletal muscle insulin resistance , may primary mechanism hepatic lipotoxicity progression NASH - Gender difference hepatic systemic metabolic response fructose mediate impact female sex hormone nuclear receptor hepatic lipid metabolism , mitochondrial function inflammasome activation . - Age difference hepatic systemic metabolic response fructose mediate impact age related alteration hepatic lipid metabolism mitochondrial function . These key hypothesis address translational research consortium include hepatologists , radiologist , physicist , endocrinologist specialist gender medicine allow integrate mechanistic approach NAFLD . The strength current proposal come directly bridging basic science clinical perspective different discipline involve management NAFLD , include cut edge non-invasive technology high field MRS metabolic profiling ( 'virtual metabolic liver biopsy ' ) mechanistic vitro experiment . This project provide novel mechanistic insight role fructose emerge hepatic 'toxin ' pathogenesis progression NASH , increase health problem Western society . Moreover , study clarify impact sex gender fructose-induced alteration hepatic systemic metabolism , provide rational scientific basis future dietary intervention regulatory action .</detailed_description>
