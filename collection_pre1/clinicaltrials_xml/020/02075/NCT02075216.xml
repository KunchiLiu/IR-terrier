	<brief_title>Transurethral Myoblast Injection Urinary Incontinence Children With Bladder Exstrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving urinary continence patient bladder extrophy epispadias complex remain challenge urological goal . Children bladder extrophy epispadias complex generally undergo many surgical procedure treatment sphincteric incompetence , include bladder neck reconstruction , sling bulk agent injection . The key point procedure enhance urethral resistance , lead degree bladder outlet obstruction . However , report 7 % 85 % continence rate patient may exactly represent child achieve volitional voiding urethra , may also include one bladder augmentation urinary diversion . Endoscopic injection bulk agent emerge therapeutic approach treatment urinary incontinence ( UI ) . procedure seem economical , short hospitalization few major complication . On hand , degradation , migration , reabsorption , overbulking , bladder outlet obstruction hypersensitivity frequently report complication bulk agent . The ideal substance periurethral injection durable , non immunogenic , nonmigratory efficacious . So , transurethral implantation autologous myoblasts may represent improved alternative synthetic bulking agent , unique ability compensate deficient muscle fiber urethral sphincter . Patients incontinence usually decrease rest tone contractility rhabdosphincter . In patient bladder extrophy epispadias complex perineal structure dislocate laterally , internal external urethral sphincter deficient . Muscle precursor cell constantly regenerate striate muscle , include quiescent satellite cell locate beneath basal lamina skeletal myofibers , responsible repair terminally differentiate striated muscle tissue . After injury response intensive physical exercise satellite cell proliferate differentiate myoblasts , ultimately fuse form new myofibers capable muscle contraction . Considering limited capacity rhabdosphincter regeneration , idea urethral sphincter repair patient bladder extrophy epispadias COMPLEX via transurethral injection autologous myoblasts suggest . The technical availability cell , well immunological acceptance survival , make appropriate purpose . Satellite cell commit cell lineage restrict plasticity multiply beyond require repair need . This property confers acceptable measure safety clinical application . The first clinical study cell therapy base treatment sphincter insufficiency , use muscle derive stem cell transplantation carry patient stress incontinence reveal confirmed ability cell therapy improve structure contractile function sphincter .</detailed_description>
