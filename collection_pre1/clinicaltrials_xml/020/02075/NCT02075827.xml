	<brief_summary>Previous study show subject play video game prone consume large quantity food subject simply rest . This believe due development stress response video game group , result increase fuel metabolism . However , show energy intake two group show correlation subject ' appetite/hunger , identical group . The investigator propose explore issue compare effect different type video game metabolism , use randomize controlled trial . In study , compare stress level , heart rate , blood pressure , appetite/mood , energy consumption , grip strength , memory saliva cortisol , leptin ghrelin level subject play ( ) competitive ( b ) problem-solving video game . Measurements take preceding , 1 hour intervention . Following intervention , participant offer savoury sweet foods/drinks , allow u assess appetite preference caloric intake . The investigator first aim determine whether significant difference stress level , eat habit energy metabolism two group . Our second aim determine whether difference glucose distribution muscle brain two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Response Playing Video Games : Two Arm Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator study design test experimentally whether different kind video game generate different type metabolic response . The exposure comprise one-hour video game playing , 36 young men randomize group ( ie 72 total ) . Prior exposure , collect baseline data heart rate , blood pressure , anthropometry ( weight , height , waist girth ) , grip strength cognitive function ( memory test ) , well appetite/mood visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The investigator also collect baseline saliva sample ass hormone associate stress ( cortisol ) satiety ( leptin , ghrelin ) . The subject arrive overnight fast give standardise breakfast . After baseline data collect , randomization envelope open subject assign group . Heart rate monitor continuously study . At 20 40 minute intervention , well cease 60 minute , investigator collect data blood pressure appetite/mood VAS . At 60 minute , investigator repeat measurement memory grip strength , collect second saliva sample . For 20 minute end intervention , subject allow rest , read magazine , able select range snack food ( savoury , sweet , fruit ) , drink ( sweeten beverage , water ) . Consumption calorie calculate . At end period , final measurement blood pressure VAS collect , subject depart .</detailed_description>
