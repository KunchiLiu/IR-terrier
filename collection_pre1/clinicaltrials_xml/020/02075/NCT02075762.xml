	<brief_summary>The objective study compare sample size , architectural preservation diagnostic yield bronchoscopic cryo-probe transbronchial lung biopsy ( C-TBBx ) comparison bronchoscopic standard transbronchial lung biopsy ( S-TBBx ) Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ( VATS ) lung biopsy diagnosis interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Transbronchial , Cryoprobe , VATS Biopsy Diagnosis Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study 20 subject suspect ILD undergo non-emergent surgical biopsy enrol . Patients refer thoracic surgery service VATS biopsy diagnose suspect ILD meet basic inclusion/exclusion criterion approach study investigator inform study . An informed consent obtain clinic visit thoracic surgeon . At begin surgical procedure , general anesthesia operating room , patient undergo flexible bronchoscopy endotracheal tube obtain 10 standard transbronchial biopsy ( S-TBBx ) 5 Cryoprobe biopsy ( C-TBBx ) fluoroscopic guidance . S-TBBx perform use standard biopsy forceps ( Boston Scientific , Natick , MA ) - 2.0mm diameter . C-TBBx perform use cryoprobe ( ERBE , Tubingen , Germany ) -1.9 mm diameter , 78cm length . This cryoprobe routinely use bronchoscopy suite application foreign body removal local treatment carcinoma ; therefore technique already employ interventional pulmonologists familiar use . Once biopsy obtain interventional pulmonologist , thoracic surgeon perform video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy ( VATS ) biopsy . Following procedure , subject monitor post-anesthesia care unit per standard care . As part ongoing follow-up care , subject monitor adverse event may result either surgical bronchoscopic procedure , specifically bleed pneumothorax . All biopsy sample analyze specialist pulmonary pathology . The number size biopsy , architectural preservation airways/alveoli , pathological diagnosis report pathologist . Diagnostic yield calculate biopsy technique compare</detailed_description>
