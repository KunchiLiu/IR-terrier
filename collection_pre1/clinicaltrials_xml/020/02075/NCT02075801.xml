	<brief_title>10-years Clinical Trial Sealed Margin Failures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Were examine 157 patient 586 amalgam restoration recruit Operative Dentistry Clinic , Dental School , University Chile indication amalgam replacement , , cohort thirty two patient ( 19 female 13 male , mean age = 27 year old ) , 73 Class I amalgam restoration , present one localized margin defect ( Bravo Charlie accord modify United State Public Health Service , USPHS criterion ) , include study . The protocol approve Institutional Research Ethics Committee Dental School University Chile , Investigation Project , School Dentistry ( 0205 ) patient sign informed consent form complete registration form . Only Faculty member accept provide treatment . Treatment Groups Criteria : 73 restoration defective margin evaluate accordance modify USPHS criterion assign either sealant ( n=26 ) , repair ( n=21 ) control group ( n=26 ) . Restorations Assessment : The quality restoration evaluate use modified U.S. Public Health System/Ryge criterion . Two examiner assess restoration independently visual tactile ( mouth mirror number 5 ) examination use explorer ( N° 23 ) indirectly radiographic , examination , interproximal observation ( Bite Wing ) . All restoration examine baseline year four ten year treatment . The restoration assessment carry five parameter : marginal adaptation ( MA ) , roughness ( R ) , secondary caries ( SC ) , marginal stain ( MS ) teeth sensitivity ( TS ) . If difference record 2 independent examiner , reach agreement , third clinician call assist process decision . If three clinician reach agreement , low score record . All three clinician participate calibration exercise begin last examination take place inter-examiner reliability result Kappa=0.74 baseline Kappa=0.87 ten year . A change Bravo Alpha consider improvement change Alpha Bravo consider downgrade . Caries risk assessment : A graphical compute program ( CARIOGRAM ) use individual´s patient caries risk assess , program weight interaction follow 10 caries related factor : Caries experience , relate general disease , diet content , diet frequency , plaque amount Silness Löe Index , semi quantitative detection mutans streptococci lactobacilli saliva Caries Risk Test ( CRT ) , fluoride program , amount saliva stimulate secretion CRT Buffer ( Vivadent ) , saliva buffer capacity clinical judgment . Patients classify high , intermediate low caries risk . Additionally result also indicate targeted action improve situation best effect . Patients recall ten year treatment , clinical assessment examiner , apply criterion use baseline . Failed restoration remove study treat accord diagnosed need . Statistical analysis The ordinal dependent variable change level modify USPHS criterion baseline value . The assigned score restoration reflect bad result parameter . The result group term degradation upgrade analyze Friedman range non-parametric test compare pre postoperative condition . Additionally , performance group contrast use Mann Whitney test determine difference upgrade downgrade restoration´s quality . The statistical significance set 95 % , α=0.05 β=0.80 statistical analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients amalgam restoration marginal deficiency judge suitable sealing . Older 18 year age ¨ More 20 teeth mouth The restoration functional occlusion oppose natural tooth With least one proximal contact area adjacent tooth Area restoration´s failure good condition Patients agree sign inform consent participate study . Patients contraindication regular dental treatment base medical history Special aesthetic requirement could solve alternative treatment Xerostomia take medication significantly decrease salivary flow High caries risk Psychiatric physical disease , interfere teeth hygiene .</criteria>
