	<brief_summary>The investigator learn knee replacement patient physically active surgery . This true even though pain le compare surgery . This low level physical activity healthy . It increase chance weight gain , create issue . It also lessen physical function . Some study look physical activity feedback system increase active people . Studies investigate face face patient group meeting , . These system meeting increase physical activity . The investigator study effect physical activity monitor group meeting knee replacement . The investigator hypothesize physical activity level physical function increase . The investigator goal help knee replacement patient lead healthy life maintain enhance physical function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collaborative-care Intervention Promote Physical Activity After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 650,000 total knee arthroplasty ( TKAs ) perform annually alleviate pain disability associate osteoarthritis ( OA ) ; chronic , degenerative condition compromise quality life 37 % adult age 60 . With age population , estimate 3.5 million TKAs perform annually 2030 . Despite improvement pain self-reported function , physical activity TKA remain pre-operative , sedentary level ( &lt; 5,000 steps/day ) . Physical activity TKA confers powerful protective effect common post-surgical sequelae include increased weight gain ( mean=6.4 kg , 2 year post TKA ) , decrease functional performance , increase risk/progression co-morbid condition ( e.g . type 2 diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease ) , progression knee hip osteoarthritis may necessitate additional joint replacement contralateral limb . An intervention aim improved self-management physical activity may aid patient overcome habitual lifestyle pattern low physical activity secondary knee pain prior TKA . Recent investigation effect real-time , user-friendly , electronic physical activity feedback ( PAF ) system face-to-face ( FTF ) patient group meeting aim promote self-management physical activity suggest intervention successfully increase physical activity . Therefore , investigator propose randomize , control trial ass efficacy feasibility physical activity intervention combine FTF group meeting ( PAF+FTF ) initiate within one month patient ' discharge outpatient rehabilitation TKA compare control group receive standard care ( CON ) . This type intervention surprisingly novel patient population common practice rehabilitation follow TKA .</detailed_description>
