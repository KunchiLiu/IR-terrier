	<brief_summary>In study , dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine ( DTG/ABC/3TC ) fix dose combination ( FDC ) tablet make available woman become pregnant participate study ING117172 . Continuation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) key mother unborn fetus order maintain virologic suppression mother ( thereby decrease risk maternal disease progression ) , also reduce risk maternal-fetal transmission human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) unborn child . This study also offer first opportunity investigate impact pregnancy DTG pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . This open-label , single arm interventional study . The number woman enrol study establish priori , unintended pregnancy determine advance . The maximum number woman would include woman randomize DTG/ABC/3TC FDC ( approximately 237 ) , though unintended pregnancy woman would anticipate .</brief_summary>
