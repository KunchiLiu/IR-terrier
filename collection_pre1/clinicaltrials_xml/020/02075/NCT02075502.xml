	<detailed_description>The investigator test hypothesis PAD patient randomized exercise program community set incorporate TMC+ improve walk ability compare patient receive standard care ( exercise advice ) . Secondary hypothesis include significant improvement patient-reported outcome , improvement functional ability significant increase volume physical activity patient complete community-based walking exercise compare patient receive standard care . Exploratory hypothesis include significant improvement PWT 1 ) patient receive combination low extremity endovascular therapy ( ET ) community-based walk exercise 2 ) open peripheral intervention community-based walking exercise compare patient receive endovascular therapy open intervention receive standard care .</detailed_description>
