	<brief_title>Three Dosing Schedules Oral Rigosertib MDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , randomize , 3-treatment arm , single-center study transfusion-dependent Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) patient classify Low- Intermediate-1 ( Int-1 ) Intermediate-2 ( Int-2 ) risk International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) . Initially , 18 patient ( 6 per treatment arm ) randomize 1:1:1 ratio 1 3 oral rigosertib dose regimen , cycle consist 14 consecutive day dose follow 7 day drug . Treatment erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESA ) prohibit first 15 week ( 5 cycle ) . After 15 week dose ( 5 cycle ) , ESA treatment initiate patient still need red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion pre-transfusion hemoglobin ( Hgb ) value ≤ 9 g/dL , unless clinical judgment Investigator determine ESA administration patient Hgb level &gt; 9 g/dL warrant . All study participant allow , medically justified , access RBC platelet ( PLT ) transfusion , filgrastim . Rigosertib dose adjustment policy describe . After 18 patient complete 3 cycle , risk/benefit analysis complete assess distribution adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) number transfusion among 3 treatment arm . This analysis select 1 3 dosing regimen best risk/benefit profile additional 12 18 patient enrol dose regimen . Eligibility criterion may modify protocol amendment enroll patient different characteristic . All patient treat 48 week 2006 International Working Group ( IWG ) progression criterion meet , unacceptable toxicity observe , intercurrent illness change patient 's condition prevents administration study drug treatment , death cause occur , whichever come first . Patients continue hematologic response 48 week may continue treat study beyond 48 week 2006 IWG progression criterion meet death cause , whichever come first .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis MDS accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion FrenchAmericanBritish ( FAB ) classification must confirm bone marrow ( BM ) aspirate and/or biopsy within 6 week prior Screening . MDS classify Lowrisk Int1 risk Int2 risk accord International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) classification ; addition , patient never classify Highrisk since MDS diagnose . Transfusion dependency define transfusion least 4 unit RBC ( red blood cell ) within 8 week Screening ; pretransfusion Hgb ( hemoglobin ) value must ≤ 9 g/dL take account . Refractory 8 12week course ESA ( erythropoiesis stimulate agent ) administer within past 2 year enrollment , erythropoietin ( EPO ) level ˃ 500 mU/mL ESA least 8 week Screening . Off treatment MDS least 2 week prior Screening . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . Willing adhere prohibition restriction specify protocol . The patient must sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . Ongoing clinically significant anemia due factor iron , vitamin B12 , folate deficiency , autoimmune hereditary hemolysis , gastrointestinal bleeding . Serum ferritin &lt; 50 ng/mL . Hypoplastic MDS ( cellularity &lt; 10 % ) . Any active malignancy within past year , except basal cell squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix breast . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . Active infection adequately respond appropriate therapy . Total bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dL relate hemolysis Gilbert 's disease . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≥ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL . Ascites require active medical management include paracentesis . Hyponatremia ( define serum sodium value &lt; 130 mEq/L ) . Female patient childbearing potential male patient partner childbearing potential unwilling follow strict contraception requirement entry throughout study , include 30day nontreatment followup period . Female patient reproductive potential negative blood urine pregnancy test Screening lactating . Major surgery without full recovery major surgery within 3 week Screening . Uncontrolled hypertension ( define systolic pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 110 mmHg ) . New onset seizure ( within 3 month prior first dose rigosertib ) poorly control seizure . Any concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy . Chronic use ( ˃ 2 week ) corticosteroid ( ˃ 10 mg/24 hour equivalent prednisone ) within 4 week Baseline/Cycle 1 Day 1 visit . Investigational therapy within 4 week Screening . Psychiatric illness social situation would limit patient 's ability tolerate and/or comply study requirement .</criteria>
