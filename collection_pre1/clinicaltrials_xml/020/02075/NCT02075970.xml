	<brief_summary>Neonatal anemia commonly encounter hematologic problem among neonate care neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . This project seek good understand pathophysiology treatment challenge important condition , especially affect premature , critically ill low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant require intensive laboratory blood monitoring lead need multiple red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion ( RBCTX ) . In research strategy propose Study 1 , Aims 1 , 2 3 , recombinant human erythropoietin ( Epoetin Alpha , PROCRIT , provide Janssen Scientific Affairs ) first administer 1.0 1.5 kg VLBW infant ; comprehensive pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) data systematically gather analyzed identify clinical laboratory covariate parameter differentiate infant base level Epoetin Alpha responsiveness . Finally Epoetin Alpha responsiveness predictor thus determine apply prospectively Aim 4 Study , 2 x 2 design VLBW infant identify good poor Epoetin Alpha responder , base predictor , randomly assign receive Epoetin Alpha treatment treatment . This test central hypothesis : RBCTX eliminate majority good Epoetin Alpha responder optimal administration Epoetin Alpha , marginal reduction RBCTx occur poor Epoetin Alpha responder . This project challenge prevail think efficacy Epoetin Alpha dose stimulate erythropoiesis insufficient eliminate need RBC transfusion VLBW infant . Based extensive preclinical clinical PK/PD study PPG team , contend previous Erythropoietin treatment study VLBW infant able realize full potential Erythropoietin eliminate RBCTX ( contrast successful use Erythropoietin adult renal failure patient ) previous VLBW study conduct 1 ) without Epoetin Alpha dose individualized complexity neonatal erythropoiesis PK/PD Epoetin Alpha 2 ) without consistent criterion RBC transfusion , Epoetin Alpha dosing , patient enrollment . Net Epoetin Alpha responsiveness reflect Hb level depend two component : Epoetin Alpha PD RBC lifespan ( Fig 15 ) . By determine RBC lifespan , explain inter-subject variability Epoetin Alpha responsiveness result one component . The fetal lifespan data examine correlation gestational age . If correlation statistically significant , gestational age include final selection covariates population PK/PD model develop end Infant Study 1 . To fully understand correlation RBC lifespan gestational age infant range 22-42 week gestational age study . The overall impact Project 1 significant potentially transformative : development personalize , mechanism-driven approach build sound principle improve understand neonatal anemia applicable care premature , anemic infant . RELEVANCE Project 1 result confirm hypothesis PK/PD optimize Epo treatment effective eliminate RBC transfusion administer select sub-group NICU infant provide fundamental knowledge neonatal anemia reduce burden illness disability cause condition . In addition , result stimulate researcher extend finding sub-groups neonatal anemia , ie , small sicker infant , stimulate novel treatment similar , new biotechnology-produced protein drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Erythropoietin ( Epo ) stimulate red blood cell ( RBC ) production . Erythropoietin treatment anemic , low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant effective originally anticipate eliminate multiple RBC transfusion ( RBCTX ) . This conclusion base Epoetin Alpha dose study employ inconsistent RBCTX criterion , study design fully consider Epoetin Alpha 's complex pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) . The hypothesis project challenge conclusion Epoetin Alpha therapy reduce RBCTX VLBW infant clinically important extent . This challenge base novel comprehensive determination PD endogenous Epo VLBW infant , recent computer Epo simulation model result predict RBCTX eliminate select group VLBW infant . Study Objective To develop pharmacodynamically-based , individualized medicine approach capable completely eliminate RBCTX identifiable group VLBW infants optimally administer Epoetin Alpha . Central Hypotheses Infants good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness identify mechanism-driven , individualized prediction model . Optimized Epoetin Alpha treatment predict good responder base sound , evidence base PK/PD principle eliminate need RBCTX . Epoetin Alpha responsiveness determine two key component : 1 ) RBC production , depend Epoetin Alpha PD . 2 ) RBC lifespan . Individualized covariate-based ( ie , patient specific characteristic ) prediction two component critical development individualize prediction model Epoetin Alpha responsiveness use test Central Hypothesis . These important predictor Epoetin Alpha responsiveness investigate follow Specific Aims ( SA ) Hypotheses ( HY ) : INFANT STUDY 1 ( Years 1-3 ) perform VLBW infant birth weight 1.0 1.5 kg SA 1 Determine clinical laboratory covariates ( ie , patient-specific characteristic ) control large inter-subject variability Epoetin Alpha 's PD use data Epoetin Alpha dose VLBW infant HY 1 The inter-subject variability Epoetin Alpha 's PD predictable several covariates identifiable PK/PD modeling approach . SA 2 Determine lifespan fetal RBC gestational age spectrum study infant . HY 2 There exist significant inter-subject variability lifespan fetal RBCs VLBW infant predictable base gestational age . SA 3 Derive individualize , optimal Epoetin Alpha dose algorithm individualize prediction model Epoetin Alpha responsiveness VLBW infant result Specific Aims 1 2 . HY 3 Crossvalidation-type computer simulation base individualized optimized Epoetin Alpha dose subgroup VLBW infant good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness , identify prediction model , indicate RBCTX avoid select group VLBW infant . INFANT STUDY 2 ( Years 3-4 , address modification completion study 1 ) also perform VLBW infant birth weight 1.0 1.5 kg SA 4 Apply optimal Epoetin Alpha dose algorithm Epoetin Alpha responsiveness prediction model develop Infant Study 1 Epoetin Alpha dose study test Central Hypothesis . HY 4 The subgroup VLBW infant good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness high proportion infant RBCTX compare poor Epoetin Alpha responsiveness . Expected Outcomes SA 1 Among covariates consider Specific Aims 1 ( e.g . clinical neonatal/maternal factor , blood cell parameter , cytokine link erythropoiesis , inflammation biomarkers , oxidative stress , iron status , genetic factor ) , identify several statistically significant correlation Epoetin Alpha 's PD . SA2 The lifespan fetal RBCs show similar relationship gestational age observe u ovine fetus . SA3 The model accurately predict individual Epoetin Alpha responsiveness optimize Epo dose provide strong support hypothesis RBCTX completely eliminate select group VLBW infant . SA4 Infant Study 2 show select group VLBW infant predict good Epoetin Alpha responder combine use individualized Epoetin Alpha responsiveness prediction model optimal , individualized Epo dose algorithm great proportion infant require RBCTX compare predict poor Epoetin Alpha responsiveness . A successful completion propose research potentially transformative likely apply care VLBW infant , result significant overall impact . Moreover , successful demonstration utility power principle lead improvement complex pharmacotherapy VLBW infant , among difficult study patient group .</detailed_description>
