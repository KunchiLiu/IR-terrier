Main objective : To assess impact preventive measure , include rapid hydration 500mL isotonic drink versus hydration 500mL water simple advice drink ; advice perform lower-body muscle tense exercise whole blood donation , prevention presyncopal syncopal reaction blood donation follow 48 hour .</detailed_description>
