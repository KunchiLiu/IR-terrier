	<brief_summary>Obesity usually bring disturbance body increase chance develop serious disease like diabetes cancer . These disturbance include one symptoms condition call `` metabolic syndrome '' often lead diabetes . High level damage DNA make chromosome also observe obese people . It possible two disturbance connect . The goal project test whether consumption blueberry improve abnormality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Blueberry Consumption Metabolic Syndrome &amp; DNA Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unbalanced diet rich refine carbohydrate calorie , saturate fat , trans fat , low vitamin , mineral , fiber , polyphenolics Ï‰-3 fatty acid common United States , particularly among obese . Insulin resistance high level DNA damage commonly accompany obesity . There also appear relationship oxidative DNA-damage biomarkers characterize metabolic syndrome . The bioactivity blueberries usually attribute high content polyphenolics reduce oxidative DNA damage . Since oxidative damage mitochondrial DNA suggest causal factor lead increased insulin resistance , test blueberry consumption ameliorative dietary factor insulin resistance well . If blueberry consumption shift metabolism away insulin resistance reduces DNA damage , may useful tool assist understand relationship two obesity-associated condition .</detailed_description>
