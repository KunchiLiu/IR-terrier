	<brief_summary>Currently know effective treatment recurrent/resistant neuroblastoma . Fenretinide anticancer agent may work differently standard chemotherapy medicine . It may cause buildup wax-like substance neuroblastoma cancer cell , call `` ceramides '' chemical , call 'reactive oxygen specie ' . In laboratory study find much ceramide reactive oxygen specie build neuroblastoma cell , may die . In addition , researcher test see drug call ketoconazole , commonly use treat fungus infection , increase fenretinide level body interfere body 's ability break fenretinide . This study do : 1 ) allow patient recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma patient would otherwise able access fenretinide/LXS oral powder treatment ; 2 ) describe side effect fenretinide ketoconazole give mouth seven day every three week ; 3 ) determine patient 's tumor get small treatment fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole fenretinide oral powder alone .</brief_summary>

Patients need negative Hep B Surface Antigen ( HBsAg ) , Hep B e Antigen ( HBeAg ) , AntiHep B core Antibody IgM ( AntiHBc IgM ) , AntiHAV IgM , AntiHCV IgM . Patients CNS parenchymal meningealbased lesion eligible . Patients prior history CNS irradiation study eligible . Patients seizure disorder eligible seizure control anticonvulsant specific anticonvulsant ( ) contraindicate . Normal lung function manifest dyspnea rest oxygen requirement . Due potential teratogenic effect retinoids , negative serum betaHCG female , use effective contraception male females childbearing potential , require . skin toxicity great grade 1 per CTCAE v4 Serum triglycerides &lt; 300mg/dL fast random plasma test . Serum calcium &lt; 11.6mg/dL No hematuria and/or proteinuria great 1+ urinalysis . Patients know genetic metabolic condition , ongoing serious medical issue , must approve Study Chair prior registration . Pregnancy breast feeding . Due potential teratogenic effect retinoids , pregnant woman NOT eligible . Breast milk feed study patient NOT allow . Patients history organ allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Patients known history allergy soy product . Patients known history severe allergy sensitivity wheat gluten . Patients require antiarrhythmia cardiac medication NOT eligible . Prior therapy fenretinide , fenretinide + ketoconazole , DLT 's experienced . A known history intolerance ketoconazole . Patients essential medication interaction ketoconazole expect dose reduction essential medication make manner adequate ensure patient safety . Patients , opinion investigator , may able comply safety monitoring requirement study . Active hepatitis . Baseline cardiac QTc interval &gt; 450 msec . Eligible enrollment national regional treatment protocol employ fenretinide/LXS oral power reasonably accessible patient . Patient must NOT receive anticancer agent Study . Ceftriaxone ( Rocephin® ) NOT permit 24 hour prior start oral fenretinide course , course , 24 hour completion seven day fenretinide course due concern possible adverse effect hepatic clearance fenretinide . Alternative antibiotic use . Other cephalosporin permit . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol® ) NOT permit 24 hour prior start oral fenretinide course , course , 48 hour follow completion seven day fenretinide course due concern possible hepatic interaction . Ibuprofen ( Motrin® ) use antipyretic control time period . Palliative radiation allow . Patients NOT receive supplemental Vitamin A , C , E except contain routine total parenteral nutrition vitamin supplement , single daily standard dose oral multivitamin supplement , possible interference antitumor 4HPRinduced , reactive oxygen specie and/or ceramide , due unknown effect drug retinol level Patients must NOT take drug suspect cause pseudotumor cerebri , include tetracycline , nalidixic acid , nitrofurantoin , phenytoin , sulfonamide ( Dapsone permit ) , lithium , amiodarone , vitamin A ( except part routine TPN supplement part single daily standard dose oral multivitamin supplement ) . Concomitant use herbal supplement alternative therapy medication IS CONTRAINDICATED due potential adverse metabolic interaction supplement fenretinide . Patients NOT concurrently take medication may potentially act modulators intracellular ceramide level ceramide cytotoxicity , sphingolipid transport , pglycoprotein ( MDR1 ) MRP1 drug/lipid transporter , : cyclosporine A analogue ; verapamil ; tamoxifen analogue ; chlorpromazine ; RU486 ; indomethacin ; sulfinpyrazone . Patients NOT concurrently take medication know P450 inhibitor . Contact Study Chair question regard suitability medication . As corticosteroid may impact sphingolipid metabolism , systemic corticosteroid NOT use emesis control course study . Systemic corticosteroid asthma control permissible minimize . Inhaled corticosteroid asthma control allow . Steroids routine metabolic deficiency state allow . Steroids CNS lesion allow . Because gastric acidity necessary maximal dissolution absorption ketoconazole , actively take ketoconazole , patient avoid/minimize concurrent medication decrease gastric acid output ( ranitidine ) increase gastric pH ( Tums ) . Concomitant medication may prolong cardiac QT interval , especially know interaction ketoconazole ( See Appendices IV , V VI ) . A LIST OF THESE MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY PLEASE SEE APPENDICES IV , V VI FOR A LIST OF MEDICATIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH CONCURRENT KETOCONAZOLE OR THAT SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION . Please SEE APPENDIX IV partial list medication potentially prolong QT interval . Patients may NOT receive therapy medication list PROHIBITED Appendix IV V. Medications Appendix VI may use caution note .
