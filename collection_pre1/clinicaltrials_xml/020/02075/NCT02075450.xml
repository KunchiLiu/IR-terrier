	<brief_summary>Our project aim improve delivery assessment cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) pediatric cardiac arrest introduce 2 novel approach : 1 . We evaluate effectiveness novel , credit card size , highly affordable `` nano-card '' CPR visual feedback device improve compliance HSFC CPR guideline use simulated pediatric cardiac arrest ; 2 . We also develop study novel , `` Just-in-Time '' ( JIT ) CPR train video , integrate proven educational method ( video-based lecture , expert modeling , practice-while-watching ) , use CPR visual feedback device provide real-time coaching . We hypothesize : H1 : The use CPR visual feedback device improve compliance current HSFC CPR resuscitation guideline simulate pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest scenario compare standard CPR visual feedback . H2 : A JIT CPR Training Video , view healthcare provider 2-4 week prior resuscitation event , improve compliance current HSFC CPR resuscitation guideline simulate pediatric cardiac arrest compare healthcare provider prior exposure JIT CPR Training Video . H3 : That poor correlation provider ' perception CPR quality actual measure CPR quality H4 : That task load varies depend provider role type clinical scenario</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 - To evaluate effectiveness CPR visual feedback device improve compliance current Heart Stork Foundation Canada ( HSFC ) CPR resuscitation guideline simulate pediatric cardiac arrest team healthcare provider . Aim 2 - To evaluate effectiveness `` Just Time '' CPR Training Video improve compliance current HSFC CPR resuscitation guideline simulate pediatric cardiac arrest team healthcare provider . Aim 3 - To determine synergistic effect add Just Time CPR Training Video use CPR visual feedback device improve compliance current HSFC CPR resuscitation guideline simulate pediatric cardiac arrest scenario . Aim 4 - To determine degree provider 's perception CPR quality match actual quality CPR Aim 5 - To describe task load healthcare provider sepsis cardiac arrest scenario Participants recruit ten pediatric tertiary care center Canada , United States , United Kingdom use methodology already pilot study exist EXPRESS investigator collaborative . Participants recruit participate study ask perform member pediatric resuscitation team . Each team healthcare provider randomize one four study arm . In study arm 1 , resuscitation team participate simulate pediatric cardiac arrest scenario , provide standard CPR without prior JIT training blind feedback CPR card scenario . Instead , CPR card place chest compression collect real-time data , feedback light card cover black tape thus , visible member resuscitation team . In study arm 2 , resuscitation team participate scenario without prior JIT training , provide chest compression CPR card place chest ( provide visual feedback ) compression . In study arm 3 , participant give CPR card ask view JIT training video . Following practice , ask participate simulate cardiac arrest scenario , provide standard CPR without feedback CPR card . As study arm 1 , CPR card still place chest , feedback light cover visible resuscitation team member . Finally , participant study arm 4 receive JIT train prior simulate scenario , CPR card place chest compression provide immediate visual feedback .</detailed_description>
