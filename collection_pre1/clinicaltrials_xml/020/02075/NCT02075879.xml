	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect nurse-led case management programme home exercise training haemodialysis patient . We hypothesise : . There significant difference physical functioning participant receive nurse-led home exercise training programme receive comparison care . b . There difference depression participant receive nurse-led home exercise training programme receive comparison care . c. There difference quality life health perception participant receive nurse-led home exercise training programme receive comparison care . d. There difference physical activity level participant receive nurse-led home exercise training programme receive comparison care . e. There difference perceive benefit barrier exercise participant receive nurse-led home exercise training programme receive comparison care . The study randomize control trial conduct two haemodialysis unit two tertiary hospital Nanjing , China . Participants randomly assign either study group comparison group . Participants group receive in-center exercise training ( 20 minute ) haemodialysis session weekly 6 week instruct perform exercise home . The in-center training focus flexibility strengthen exercise . Patients encourage cardiovascular exercise home improve cardiovascular condition endurance . The list cardiovascular exercise include brisk walking , bicycling , jogging . Participants study group instruct start walk brisk walk low duration gradually progress maximum 30 minute daily per week . To facilitate exercise progression , nurse case manager discuss exercise benefit , explore exercise barrier develop mutual goal patient . The nurse motivate checked exercise behavior ensure adherence recommend exercise regime . The nurse case manager interview study group patient weekly six week biweekly another six week . Participants comparison group participate in-center exercise training . The comparison group patient receive usual care nurse without interview mutual goal develop .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration intervention 12 week . In-center exercise training session available participant week 6 week . Each session last 20 minute . Participants instruct perform flexibility strength exercise centre prior haemodialysis session . The researcher perform exercise participant emphasise importance self-monitoring session . Symptoms ( chest pain , dyspnea , dizziness , leg cramp ) vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , pulse ) check exercise monitor entire exercise session . Participants instruct self-monitor exercise intensity . The exercise programme pause immediately patient feel short breath , chest pain pressure , irregular heartbeat , leg cramp , dizziness lightheadedness , blur vision , discomfort . Intervention group During study period , participant intervention group receive additional face-to-face interview conduct designated case manager every week six week biweekly another six week . During interview , patient instruct start aerobic exercise , walking , jogging , cycling , brisk walk home low duration gradually progress maximum 30 minute daily per week . Apart aerobic exercise , patient recommend perform strength exercise twice week flexibility exercise every day . The key element interview include : 1 ) assessment patient ' knowledge exercise behaviour ; examine patient ' attitude feeling physical activity ; 2 ) explore patient ' barrier exercise perceive benefit ; 3 ) patient education benefit exercise need ; 4 ) development mutual goal exercise plan ; 5 ) explain purpose record exercise log instruction correct way keep exercise diary ; 6 ) discus available support resource could motivate patient initiate maintain exercise , e.g. , centre-based exercise programme , support family member , health care provider , peer patient , forth . In follow-up interview , case manager review exercise log participant , discuss unpleasant experience relate exercise , exercise progress , provide encouragement . According progress participant make , exercise goal plan renew revised . Referrals make need . Comparison group Participants comparison group advise participate in-centre exercise training programme available haemodialysis session week different shift patient . The training session last 20 minute flexibility strength training provide . During training session , patient advise increase daily activity level .</detailed_description>
