	<brief_summary>Subjects enrol study biopsy obtain send Dr. Fitzgerald 's lab analysis validate biomarker panel . Subjects stratify either high low risk progression esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) base biomarker panel result . Biomarker panel result communicate site . Subjects low grade dysplasia offer option treatment ( radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) ) part routine care . Subjects low grade dysplasia want RFA subject dysplasia receive surveillance endoscopy 1 year per routine care . All subject administer questionnaire seek information hypothetical willingness randomize treatment surveillance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stratifying Risk Barrett 's Esophagus : A Pilot Study Biomarker-based Patient Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Investigators previously complete validation study identify panel biomarkers predict progression subject BE dysplasia low-grade dysplasia esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) . The biomarker panel , perform Fitzgerald lab , include ploidy ( image cytometry ) , AOL ( histochemistry ( IHC ) ) , p53 ( IHC ) , cyclin A ( IHC ) , dysplasia . These marker validate demonstrated highly predictive progression EAC , well presence occult malignancy elsewhere specimen ( field effect ) . The final panel validate biomarkers use study identify patient high risk develop EAC . The study recruit 100 patient across 4 site ( University North Carolina , Case Western Reserve University , University Cambridge , Academic Medical Center Amsterdam ) . The specific aim pilot study : 1 . Demonstrate international , multicenter team work together , 2 . Define logistics assay biomarkers real time future interventional trial , result could influence clinical decision-making , , 3 . Provide data inform power calculation full trial . Subjects enrol study complete questionnaire gather hypothetical willingness randomize receive endoscopic treatment intervention ( RFA ) surveillance endoscopy . Biopsy sample obtain subject test biomarkers panel . Results biomarker panel communicate site . Subjects low grade dysplasia offer option receive radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) part routine care . Subjects low grade dysplasia agree RFA receive RFA part routine care . Subjects dysplasia subject low grade dysplasia want receive RFA receive surveillance endoscopy 1 year part routine care . The goal pilot study ascertain proportion subject high risk arm , demonstrate plausibility perform biomarker analysis efficiently sizable group patient , demonstrate feasibility deliver endoscopic intervention ( RFA ) , obtain 1 year pilot data regard progression high risk arm use sample size calculation , document collaboration among center .</detailed_description>
