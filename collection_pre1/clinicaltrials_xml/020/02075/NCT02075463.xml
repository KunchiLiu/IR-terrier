	<criteria>Hemodialysis ( HD ) frequency : Stable HD regimen three four time weekly minimum 12 week . Note : The type frequency dialysis must stable study . Isolated ultrafiltration session purpose fluid removal permit . Dialysis Adequacy : Singlepool dialyzer clearance multiply dialyzer time divide volume distribution urea ( Kt/Vurea ) &gt; =1.2 base historical value obtain within prior month . rhEPO hyporesponsiveness : Historical current intravenous ( IV ) rhEPO Hgb value . Average epoetin alfa dose Hgb level three 4week period total 12 week prior Week 4 , 4 week runin period , must within follow range : average epoetin alfa dose &gt; 4000 &lt; =6000 unit per session Hgb &gt; =8.0 &lt; =9.5 g/dL ; average epoetin alfa dose &gt; 6000 &lt; =8000 unit per session Hgb &gt; =8.0 &lt; =10.0 g/dL ; average epoetin alfa dose &gt; 8000 &lt; =10000 unit per session Hgb &gt; =8.0 &lt; =10.5 g/dL ; average epoetin alfa dose &gt; 10000 unit per session Hgb &gt; =8.0 &lt; =11.0 g/dL . Absolute difference Hgb value Week 4 Week 0 ( Day 1 ) , must &lt; 1.3 g/dL . Note : Subjects meet criterion rescreened twice , enter GSK1278863 treatment period withdrawn study . Age : &gt; =18 year age . QT Interval Corrected Heart Rate ( QTc ) : Bazett 's Correction QT Interval ( QTcB ) &lt; 470 msec QTcB &lt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) subject bundle branch block . There correct QT interval ( QTc ) inclusion criterion subject predominantly pace rhythm . Gender : Female male subject . Females : If childbearing potential , must agree use one approve contraception method Screening completion Followup Visit OR , nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysterectomy oophorectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) 23.0116.3 milliinternational unit ( MIU ) /milliliter ( mL ) ( 23.0116.3 international unit ( IU ) /liter ( L ) ) estradiol &lt; =10 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; =37 picomole ( pmol ) /L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one approve contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Dialysis modality : Planned change dialysis modality within study time period . rhEPO : Use methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta darbepoetin within prior 8 week prior Week 4 . Renal transplant : Scheduled renal transplant . Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) : &lt; 20 % recent sample take last 12 week . Ferritin : &lt; 100 nanogram ( ng ) /mL ( &lt; 100 micrograms/L ) recent sample take last 12 week . Vitamin B12 : At low limit reference range ( may rescreen minimum 8 week ) . Folate : &lt; 2.0 ng/mL ( &lt; 4.5 nanomoles ( nmol ) /L ) ( may rescreen minimum 4 week ) . Myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome : Within 8 week prior Week 4 . Stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIAs ) : Within 8 week prior Week 4 . Heart failure : Class III/IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system diagnose prior Week 4 . Hypertension : Defined use predialysis vitals ( Week 4 ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg . Thrombotic disease : History thrombotic disease ( e.g. , venous thrombosis deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , arterial thrombosis new onset worsen limb ischemia require intervention ) within 8 week prior Week 4 , except vascular access thrombosis . Inflammatory disease : Active chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) diagnose prior Week 4 . Hematological disease : Any hematological disease include affect platelet , white red blood cell ( e.g. , antibodymediated pure red cell aplasia , sickle cell anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , hematological malignancy , myeloma , hemolytic anemia ) , coagulation disorder ( e.g. , antiphospholipid syndrome , Protein C S deficiency ) , cause anemia renal disease diagnose prior Week 4 . Liver disease : Current liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) evidence Screening abnormal liver function test [ alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ] ; hepatic abnormality opinion investigator would preclude subject participation study . NOTE : Those Hepatitis B Hepatitis C eligible provide exclusion meet . Major surgery : ( exclude vascular access surgery ) within 8 week prior Week 4 , plan study . Transfusion : Blood transfusion within 8 week prior Week 4 , anticipate need blood transfusion study . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Bleeding : Evidence actively bleed peptic , duodenal , esophageal ulcer disease clinically significant GI bleeding within 8 week prior Week 4 . Ophthalmology disease : History proliferative retinopathy require treatment within prior 12 month macular edema require treatment . Acute infection : Clinical evidence acute infection , evidence underlying infection history infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 8 week prior Week 4 , also Day 1 . Note : IV antibiotic prophylaxis allow . Malignancy : Subjects history malignancy within prior 5 year , receive treatment cancer , strong family history cancer ( e.g. , familial cancer disorder ) , exception squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin definitively treat prior Week 4 . Severe allergic reaction : History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity excipients investigational product . Drugs supplement : Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement prohibit Week 4 Followup Visit . Prior investigational product exposure : The subject participate clinical trial receive experimental investigational product within prior 30 day Week 4 . Life Expectancy : Life expectancy consider investigator le 6 month . Other condition : Any condition , clinical laboratory abnormality , examination find Investigator considers would put subject unacceptable risk , unwillingness inability follow procedure , lifestyle and/or dietary restriction outline protocol . Pregnancy lactation : Pregnant female determine positive serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test woman lactate Week 4 trial . Laboratory eligibility criterion assess accord central laboratory result screen sample Subjects fail screening may rescreened soon investigator feel may subsequently become eligible . However , individual subject may rescreened twice . There predetermined amount time require wait rescreen previously ineligible subject . Exceptions fail Hgb folate may rescreen 4 week fail Vitamin B12 rescreening may occur 8 week .</criteria>
