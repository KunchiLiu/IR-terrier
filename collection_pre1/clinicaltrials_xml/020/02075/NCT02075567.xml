	<brief_summary>Background : During exercise twofold stimulation glucose transporter type 4 type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) cause exogenous insulin injection muscle contraction . In case insulin reduction exercise and/or additional carbohydrate supplement patient T1DM would become hypoglycemic . There specific data dependent individual exercise intensity strategies bolus insulin reduction .

	<detailed_description>1.1 . Pathophysiology type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) metabolic disease insulin deficiency dysfunctional release counter regulatory hormone glucagon . In pathogenesis T1DM autoantibody insulin ( IAA ) , Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Antibody ( GADA ) , islet antigen-2 ( IA-2A ) zinc transporter 8 ( ZnT8A ) detect . In absence endogen produce insulin translocate glucose transporter ( GLUT ) activate ( excepted insulin insensitive GLUT-2 liver , β-cells pancreas , kidney small intestine GLUT-4 muscle contraction ) ( Jensen &amp; Richter 2012 ) . The GLUT translocate cell surface import glucose cell metabolism glycogen storage glucose-6-phosphatase ( G-6-P ) . For reason patient T1DM exogenous insulin must inject intensified insulin therapy insulin pump therapy . This exogenous insulin dock insulin receptor , insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) react G-proteins ( guanine nucleotide-binding protein ) phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase ( PI-3 kinase ) activate GLUT . Furthermore without insulin deficient carbohydrate metabolism glycogen synthesis , glycogenolysis , gluconeogenesis glycolysis . Dependent dysfunctional insulin release also failure counter regulatory glucagon reaction . In T1DM decrease insulin release hypoglycemia thus increase α-cell glucagon secretion . So T1DM less endogenous opportunity avoid hypoglycemia . 1.2 . Physiology type 1 diabetes mellitus sport It ` already know T1DM non type 1 diabetes mellitus ( nT1DM ) physical activity glucose utilization increase . During exercise glucose degradation rate blood plasma increase enhance translocate GLUT-4 skeletal muscle contraction cause increase calcium ( Ca2+ ) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) turnover , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , found member family proteins share 180- 200-amino acid ( TBC1D1/4 ) , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) sucrose nonfermenting AMPK-related kinase ( SNARK ) . In place endogenous insulin nT1DM exogenous insulin T1DM muscle contraction activate GLUT-4 exercise result glucose consumption increase . In contrast T1DM patient healthy subject endogenous insulin secretion decrease exercise accord mode , intensity duration . Therefore T1DM twofold GLUT-4 increase high risk hypoglycemia exercise . Furthermore risk hypoglycemia exists also post exercise . Several study show one bout exercise increase insulin sensitivity hour often cause difficulty insulin regimen . 1.3 . Adaptation carbohydrate intake insulin injection exercise type 1 diabetes mellitus Based physiological aspect guideline describe reduce risk hypoglycemia exercise . However , recommendation usually general unspecific . Several study show , regular insulin dose exercise lead hypoglycemia due mention mechanism . Therefore patient T1DM increase carbohydrate intake and/or reduce insulin injection dose perform exercise The mode exercise influence factor , impact blood glucose level especially exercise . Some study demonstrate , high intensity intermittent exercise lead low decrease blood glucose level constant load exercise However , lack guideline amount reduce insulin increase carbohydrate intake relate different exercise intensity mode . 2 . Pilot study Objective : To perform sport exercise patient type I diabetes need reduce insulin dose increase carbohydrate intake avoid hypoglycemia . There lack guideline reduce insulin increase carbohydrate intake relate different exercise intensity mode . The purpose present study investigate relationship blood glucose concentration intensity duration work load apply standardize pre exercise glucose insulin regimen . As hypothesis expect energy expenditure intensity dependent decrease blood glucose concentration offer opportunity calculate critical time . Research Design Methods : One train male subject type I diabetes ( age : 25 year ; weight : 72 kg ; high : 1.8 ; maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) : 55.4 ml.kg-1.min-1 ; insulin : NovoRapid/Levemir ; C-peptide positive , HbA1c 48 mmol.mol-1 ) perform 4 hour last insulin/carbohydrate supplement , reduction short time insulin 40 % , maximal incremental cycle ergometer exercise test ( 40 W start ; 20 W.min-1 increment ) determine first ( LTP1 ) second lactate turn point ( LTP2 ) mean computer base linear regression break point analysis . Three phase energy supply detect separated LTP1 LTP2 . The LTP1 characterize first increase blood lactate concentration baseline . The LTP2 detect second abrupt increase lactate LTP1 Pmax define high constant workload give still lactate steady state . Four constant load ergometer exercise test ( 30 min ) perform 5 % Pmax LTP1 LTP2 reduction short time insulin dose 25 % 5 % Pmax LTP1 50 % 5 % Pmax LTP2 75 % 5 % Pmax LTP2 accord literature . Heart rate gas exchange variable determine continuously , blood lactate concentration ( La ) blood glucose concentration determine rest , end every workload step , every 5 min constant load ergometer exercise well 3 6 min active passive recovery . Results : Linear decline blood glucose find test . At 5 % &lt; LTP1 glucose decrease 191 mg/dl 149 mg/dl , 5 % &gt; LTP1 131 md/dl 96 mg/dl , 5 % &lt; LTP2 169 mg/dl 91 mg/dl 5 % &gt; LTP2 187 mg/dl 144 mg/dl ( early stop work load acidosis LTP2 ) . The decline blood glucose concentration calculate linear interpolation 50 % rest baseline value without supply carbohydrate . time critical : 5 % &lt; LTP1 - 77 min ; 5 % &gt; LTP1 - 31 min ; 5 % &lt; LTP2 - 31 min ; 5 % &gt; LTP2 - 29 min . Conclusion : The result show linear reduction glucose concentration relation intensity duration work load . We suggest possibly calculate critical time certain glucose threshold type I diabetes patient avoid hypoglycemia sport exercise . 3 . Study goal hypothesis We know patient T1DM must adapt insulin carbohydrate intake exercise , ` know specific individual amount . Therefore show pilot study model adapt insulin injection dose ( constant basal insulin use ) respect standardize intensity calculate critical time glucose level T1DM patient insulin therapy would fall hypoglycemia sport exercise . Now verify data group subject additional hormonal marker use ultralong-acting basal insulin ( Novo Nordisk ) . The aim present study calculate critical time pre exercise standardize insulin regimen standardize cycle ergometer exercise dependent different mode , intensity , duration energy expenditure well counter regulatory hormone . As hypothesis expect hypoglycemia cycle ergometer exercise dependent standardize pre exercise standardize insulin regimen relation intensity , duration energy expenditure exercise post exercise hypoglycemia . If result confirm hypothesis , study could first recommendation T1DM patient , individually adapt insulin dose define exercise without hypoglycemia exercise . 4 . Methods 4.1 .
