	<brief_summary>Circulating tumour cell ( CTCs ) detectable blood around 50 % patient function NeuroEndocrine Tumours ( NET ) arise midgut area ( tumour secrete hormone locate area middle digestive system ) presence usually mean prognosis patient poor . CTCs also show valuable predictive marker follow treatment increase interest use CTCs 'liquid biopsy ' help inform treatment decision . CTC analysis benefit relatively non- invasive quick compare conventional CT scan therefore attractive method monitoring tumour throughout treatment period . The purpose study assess clinical value enumeration predict clinical symptomatic response progression free survival patient receive Somatuline Autogel function midgut NETs one year period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision write informed consent prior study related procedure . Patients ( either sex ) must 18 year old . Patients must suffer symptom diarrhoea and/or flush time study enrolment . Patients must document diagnosis function midgut NET . In order avoid patient rapidly progress tumour , patient well moderately differentiate tumour Ki67 proliferation index &lt; 20 % recruit . The clinically appropriate treatment patient must therapy somatostatin analogue . Patients must either positive somatostatin receptor scintigraphy result positive 68GalliumDOTATATE PET image result . If patient risk pregnancy breast feeding , unless treatment Somatuline Autogel clearly need ( determined clinician ) . The patient , opinion investigator , unable comply fully protocol study instruction , present concomitant condition could compromise objective study and/or preclude protocoldefined procedure ( e.g . severe medical condition , brain metastasis , psychiatric disorder , active uncontrolled infection , know pituitary disease ) . The patient treat unlicensed drug within last 30 day study entry require concurrent treatment experimental drug treatment . The patient treat somatostatin analogue prior study entry , unless washout period least 2 week subcutaneous octreotide , least 6 week single dose long act somatostatin analogue occur . The patient receive interferon , chemotherapy , chemoembolisation radionuclide therapy within 3 month prior study entry . The patient history hypersensitivity drug similar chemical structure . Females childbearing potential must use oral , double barrier injectable contraception . Non childbearing potential define postmenopause least 1 year , surgical sterilisation hysterectomy least three month start study . The patient abnormal baseline finding , medical condition ( ) laboratory finding , opinion Investigator , might jeopardise patient 's safety decrease chance obtain satisfactory data need achieve objective ( ) study .</criteria>
