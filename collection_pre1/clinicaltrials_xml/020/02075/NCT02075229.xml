	<detailed_description>Informed Consent obtain prior enrollment study , include interview discus study expectation , potential risk benefit study evaluation schedule . The Informed Consent Form may take home review candidate candidate give opportunity ask question and/or study prior sign form . The candidate give copy sign Informed Consent Form . The Informed Consent Forms include detailed list procedure include pre-operative evaluation process . The Informed Consent document review sign relevant party prior study-related evaluation take place . Testing complete part normal clinical practice , audiogram acceptable prior sign consent form . Information regard participant 's hearing history collect may obtain participant directly medical record . The Preoperative evaluation include : 1 . Assessment candidate 's suitability study 2 . Establishment baseline data candidate prove appropriate study inclusion . During preoperative testing , patient utilize hearing aid verify appropriate participant 's managing audiologist . Clinicians base appropriateness hearing aid fitting recommendation American Academy Audiology Task Force ( 2006 ) . This include real ear measure verify accuracy hearing aid setting . Candidacy Assessment include 1 . Air conduction threshold ear insert earphone 125 , 250 , 500 , 750 , 1000 , 1500 , 2000 , 3000,4000 , 6000 , 8000 Hertz ( Hz ) Bone conduction threshold ear 125 , 250 , 500 , 750 , 1000 , 1500 , 2000 , 4000Hz 2 . AzBio Sentences Test ( Quiet ) - One complete record list 60 dB ( A ) present sound field right ear aid , leave ear aid , bilateral aid use amplification verify appropriate participant 's managing audiologist . Baseline Measures Speech Perception Testing include 1 . Consonant Nucleus Consonant ( CNC ) Monosyllabic Word Test ( Quiet ) - One complete record list present 60 dB ( A ) condition right ear aid , leave ear aid , bilateral aid 2 . Telephone Testing perform use ear implant pre- implant . City New York ( CUNY ) Sentences administer via live voice participant couple ear implant his/her hear aid use setting typical phone use participant . If participant unable use phone , test still administer telephone place hearing aid microphone . No additional assistive listening device ( i.e . handset amplifier ) speaker phone setting use . Stimuli present single time feedback provide . The examiner use conversational level rate . The participant repeat much sentence possible , guess necessary . Sentences score number word repeat correctly percent total word correct calculate . 4 . Self-Assessment Questionnaires : Patients instruct complete three questionnaire pertain presently hear everyday listening situation . These questionnaire also administer 6 12 month post-activation . : - Health Utility Index ( HUI3 ) - Short Form-36 utility transforms - Abbreviated Profile Hearing Aid Benefit ( APHAB ) Form A Surgical Procedure : The recommended surgical procedure outline appropriate surgical manual device select implantation ( provided device manufacturer ) follow surgeon . Postoperative Procedures tailor needs patient , vary depend type cochlear implant patient receives . Activation take place 2-4 week follow surgery , soon surgeon determine patient able participate appointment include follow : - Check incision site sign irritation infection . Perform otoscopy . Refer patient cochlear implant surgeon concern . - Check adhesion speech processor magnet ensure appropriateness magnet strength . Increase decrease magnet strength need . - Perform listen check speech processor microphone . - Perform impedance test ( Telemetry ) - Recommended mapping parameter provide clinician default begin , may modify need base upon recipient 's response sound . The scheduled follow appointment recipient vary depend recipient 's response sound , clinic schedule , distance travel clinic recipient . In addition device activation , recommend audiologist try meet patient one , three , six , twelve month post-activation . Formal testing perform six twelve month post-activation per study protocol . Recommended procedure include map appointment provide audiologists include discussion experience use device , clarification question regard device use , listen check speech processor microphone , impedance telemetry , psychophysical measure , loudness balancing , creation new speech processor program level change , informal assessment speech recognition . Patients refer speech-language pathologist formal aural rehabilitation/training , three month interval he/she demonstrate open-set speech recognition number , color , sentence ; demonstrate difficulty adjust sound quality cochlear implant ; question regard presence coexist communication difficulty relate change cognitive status rather hear impairment ; recipient request additional rehabilitation training audiologist able provide . Post-operative assessment perform six twelve month test interval include : 1 . Audiometric Testing include aid cochlear implant sound field warble tone threshold 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 Hz ( hear aid use , hear aid remove contralateral ear plug foam plug ) 2 . Speech Perception Testing perform CI alone and/or use CI + HA ( patient report utilize hear aid ipsilateral contralateral ear least 4 hour day ) . Test include CNC Word Test ( Quiet ) - one complete list present 60 dB ( A ) , AzBio Sentences Quiet - one complete list present 60 dB ( A ) . Formal evaluation performance use hear aid alone include study . Testing include measure evaluate performance use implant alone patient utilize hear aid plus cochlear implant recipient report he/she utilize hear aid ( either ipsilateral contralateral ear ) minimum 4 hour day . These measure include administration CNC Words AZ Bio Sentences bimodal condition CI+HA 6 12 month post-activation interval . 3 . Self-Assessment Questionnaires describe re-administered six twelve month post-activation . Patients instruct complete questionnaire pertains presently hear everyday listening situation ( e.g . use CI alone use CI + HA use hearing aid CI least 4 hour day ) . 4 . Telephone test describe use CI alone . Clinicians provide participant traditional rehabilitation , orientation device , description strategy improve hearing , use assistive device accessory improve performance , listen communicate telephone , counsel regard speech recognition outcome expectation performance . Audiologists provide write material regard source independent rehabilitation training . RISKS AND BENEFITS The pre-specified success criterion protocol determine base sentence recognition performance best aided condition . Individual level margin effectiveness assess base post-operative score CNC Words AZ Bio Sentences . A statistically significant improvement pre- postoperative performance ( six twelve month postactivation ) score best aid condition base binomial distribution Thorton Raffin , 1978 binomial distribution model provide Spahr et al. , 2011 . Risks involve within study include , limited , risk associate cochlear implant surgery . It anticipate study participant may permanently lose residual hearing ear implant . The potential benefit cochlear implantation include improvement participant 's ability understand speech quiet noise , without lip-reading , good detect speech environmental sound . To monitor device safety ( reported adverse event ) , medical audiological observation procedure , adverse device effect unanticipated adverse device effect , report center 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) also study coordinate center . Information device malfunction adverse event obtain investigational site maintain event type . The surgeon audiologist complete postoperative Adverse Event Questionnaire postoperative test interval adverse event take place . The question adverse event form elicit information regard surgical , medical , device-related complication study participant . Adverse device effect refer undesirable clinical medical occurrence associate use device participation study . Adverse device effect report observed , even acknowledge risk factor Informed Consent Form . Unanticipated adverse device effect refer event identify represent serious adverse effect health safety life-threatening problem death cause , associate , device effect , problem death previously identify nature , severity , degree incidence investigational plan application , unanticipated serious problem associate device relate right , safety , welfare subject . Investigators inform respective Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) study coordinator immediately unanticipated adverse device effect suspect ( 10 work day investigator learn effect ) . If case determine unanticipated adverse device effect , investigator fill Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Form . The study coordinator report result evaluation unanticipated adverse device effect FDA review IRBs investigator within 10 work day first receive notice event .</detailed_description>
