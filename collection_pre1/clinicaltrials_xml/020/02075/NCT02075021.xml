	<brief_summary>The investigator perform phase I/II trial Revlimid daily 21 day Abraxane weekly 3 week . Accrual standard cohort 3 patient . Once maximum toxicity dose ( MTD ) reach , level expand 25 patient pilot phase II trial . All treatment perform progression . Assessments make least 2 , 4 6 month timepoints monthly thereafter progression . The purpose research study determine much combination Revlimid Abraxane give safely well work together cancer . Currently , trial phase 1 stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Combination Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) Nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Revlimid important imid base therapy myeloma . However patient still relapse drug limit option . Abraxane show efficacy number cancer , putatively intratumor concentration SPARC ( secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ) . ( Taxanes show modest activity myeloma . Interestingly , Revlimid upregulate level SPARC . Thus , investigator test toxicity efficacy combination Revlimid Abraxane relapsed/refractory myeloma . Investigators perform phase I/II trial Revlimid daily 21 day Abraxane weekly 3 week patient fail Revlimid adequate blood count renal function minimal neuropathy . For study purpose , 1 cycle consider 4 week ( 20 day ) . Subjects get Abraxane three week treatment 1 week . There 10 visit per cycle . Accrual standard 3 patient cohort . Once maximum tolerate dose reach , level expand 25 patient pilot phase II trial . All treatment perform progression . Assessments make least 2 , 4 , 6 month timepoints monthly thereafter progression . Since drug cause myelosuppression , investigator start dose standard dos single agent . Investigators use 100 mg/m2 Abraxane weekly 3 week 10 mg Revlimid daily 21 day , dose escalation Revlimid 15 mg 25 mg . Dose de-escalation also perform drug necessary . Investigators explore whether SPARC ( secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ) expression alter flow cytometry immunohistochemistry .</detailed_description>
