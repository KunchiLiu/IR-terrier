	<brief_title>A Randomized , Placebo Controlled , Partially Blinded Phase II Study Evaluate Safety , Immunogenicity , Prevention Infection With Mycobacterium Tuberculosis AERAS-404 BCG Revaccination Healthy Adolescents ( 040-404 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , randomize , 3-arm , placebo control , partially blind , clinical trial conduct 990 healthy , HIV-uninfected , QFT-GIT negative , previously BCG vaccinate adolescent . The trial conduct South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative ( SATVI ) site Western Cape region South Africa , epidemiological study involve thousand adolescent conduct last decade characterize rate Mtb infection active TB disease age group . Subjects enrol two sequential cohort within cohort subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive either AERAS-404 saline placebo Days 0 56 , BCG Vaccine SSI Day 0 . The first 90 subject ( 30 arm ) form Safety &amp; Immunogenicity Cohort subject intensive collection safety data , data review Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) , principal investigator local medical monitor . Selected immunogenicity assay , include whole blood intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) , also perform cohort . The remain 900 subject enrol Correlates Cohort . All 990 subject study evaluate safety biomarker outcome , prevention Mtb infection . The primary Mtb infection endpoint QFT-GIT conversion negative positive test , use manufacturer 's recommend threshold 0.35 IU/mL , time-point Day 84 end follow-up primary endpoint . The 84-day 'wash-out ' period stipulate order exclude subject may already Mtb infect , yet convert QFT-GIT test screening , thus subject convert QFT-GIT Day 84 include analysis prevention Mtb infection .</detailed_description>
