	<brief_title>Opioid Use Single Shot Nerve Block v Continuous Peripheral Nerve Infusion Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design prospective , randomize , open-label control , study . It possible blind treatment since catheter must leave place continuous infusion group . Subjects randomize either femoral shot/continuous peripheral neural infusion FS-CPNI group femoral shot/sciatic single shot FS-SS group . After induction general anesthesia , subject receive either single shot continuous nerve block . The protocol dictate conduct general anesthetic . In postoperative period , addition standard monitoring recovery room , numerical rating pain scale ( NRS ) score patient record . The timing first rescue pain medication total postoperative opioid analgesic medication administer hospital stay record . The patient follow hospital day surgery ( DOS ) postoperatively discharge home . After discharge patient contact phone and/or email postoperatively daily basis 72 hour collect information regard use pain medication ( time dose ) , quality analgesia base NRS pain scale , incidence side effect . If patient need admit hospital postoperatively , opioid use , pain score complication record hospital . All patient evaluate orthopedic clinic two week , six week six month assess long term functional outcome , pain score sign postoperative neurological deficit .</detailed_description>
