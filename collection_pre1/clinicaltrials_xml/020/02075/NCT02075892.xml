	<brief_title>Mushroom Blend Oxygen Kinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Twenty-eight , healthy , active , recreationally-trained adult age 18-35 . Procedures ( method ) : All subject report Applied Physiology Laboratory Fetzer Rm 025 phase I study total 7 visit . A randomly select subset 8 participant continue phase II , return lab additional 3 visit evaluate feasibility . Visit 1 consist physical , enrollment consenting . Visits , 2 , 3 , 4 separate minimum 24 hour . During visit 2 , participant perform maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) test cycle ergometer . During visit 3 participant ask complete 6-minute oxygen kinetics test cycle ergometer ; lactate threshold oxygen saturation measure baseline , minute 2 , 3 6 6 min ride . During visit 4 , participant perform 3-minute critical power ( CP ) test provide saliva sample , measure cortisol level , immediately prior CP test . Following visit 4 , participant randomly assign , double-blind fashion , either placebo mushroom blend treatment group . Participants placebo treatment group ask consume 2 serving , 3 time daily 7 day . Following supplementation , participant return laboratory visit 5-7 , separate minimum 24 hour . The protocol perform visit 2-4 repeated order visit 5-7 ; VO 2max test , 6 min oxygen kinetics test , CP test pre post saliva sample . The randomly select subset 8 participant continue phase II ( n=4 treatment ; n=4 placebo ) . During phase II , 8 participant placebo treatment group ask consume 2 serving , 3 time daily 14 additional day determine feasibility long supplementation phase . Following supplementation , protocol perform visit 2-4 repeated order visit 8-10 , separate minimum 24 hour .</detailed_description>
