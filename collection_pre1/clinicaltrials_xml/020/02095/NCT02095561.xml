	<detailed_description>Description problem study rationale High screening coverage woman high risk essential component within organize cervical cancer ( CC ) prevention program . Yet , reach high level coverage challenge , mainly program implement develop country , case , achieve high coverage level effectively impact incidence mortality disease1,2 . In Argentina , estimate 40 % poor woman never participate screen programs3 . It show among woman low screen frequency cervical cancer mainly diagnosed4 . In country , coverage map show inverse correspondence cervical cancer mortality map . Women live Northwest Northeast region , mortality rate high , likely screen underusers . The lack information CC prevention , lack support network , shame related sexuality body , fear cancer factor hinder inform decision-making process woman health care . In turn , autonomy woman often condition characteristic health system respond top-down medicalized system asymmetry knowledge power health care professional user . Since discovery causal association oncogenic HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus ) CC , new screen HPV detection-based tool develop . The hybrid capture HPV test ( HC2 ) detect presence DNA 13 high oncogenic risk type woman 's cervix . It 's proved HPV test highly effective detection pre-cancerous lesion reduction cervical cancer mortality5 . In province Jujuy CC HC2 available public health center since 2011 , aim improve effectiveness detection high-grade lesion cancer reduce mortality rate . One challenge program introduce HPV test continue improve screening coverage indicator . This new technology potential reduce screen access barrier , give fact HPV test allow self-testing , practice do home . With self-test woman collect vaginal sample brush use purpose . Studies carry different country world Latin America show HPV self-test acceptability high6 . The vaginal self-test allow overcome barrier associate screen geographical accessibility shame sample take health professional . That , self-test big potential increase screening coverage , allow woman enhance autonomy cervical cancer prevention care . The HC2 HPV test molecular biology technology detect presence 13 high oncogenic risk DNA type ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 68 ) cervix cell . It accurate technology , highly reproducible estimate sensitivity 90 % , much high cytology . Different study Latin America world account HPV Test high sensitivity cytology7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 . At time , HC2 HPV test one world whose effectiveness reduce cervical cancer incidence mortality scientifically prove . A study conduct India15 conclude rate incidence mortality significantly high within group screen cytology visual inspection acetic acid ( VIA ) compare group screen HC2 . HC2 test screen able reach reduction almost 50 % mortality rate . As far self-test , high sensitivity cytology detection cervix cancer precursor lesion ( CIN2+ ) also observe various studies11,16 . The CIN2+ detection rate ( histologically confirm diagnosis ) also show relative advantage HPV test cytology . Different study find detection CIN2+ high case self-test cytology 17,18 . On hand , study carry Mexico find CIN2+ lesion self-test detection rate 3.4 time high cytology ( relative sensitivity ) 19 . Setting study The province Jujuy select develop study due fact screen base HPV test primary test introduce 2011 . The province Jujuy high mortality rate ( 11.8 x 100.000 woman 2008-2011 period ) one provinces set priority National Program Prevention Cervical Cancer . The Primary Health Care System ( PHC ) integrate approximately 700 CHWs semester visit approximately 110.000 household . In visit , CHWs contact adult household perform health-related task include promotion cervical cancer screening . CHW 's performance evaluate annually classify good regular . Goals study A cluster randomize trial conduct ; include total number 150-200 community Health Workers ( CHWs ) 6.000 woman . The aim study : 1. ass self-test effectiveness increase participation woman screen program , 2. assess self-test acceptability woman . 3. assess HPV self-test effectiveness detection CIN2+ lesion cytology primary screening . Study randomize population cluster An overall number 150-200 CHWs Primary Health Care System ( PHCS ) Province Jujuy randomize two group : Self-test Group ( ST ) Conventional Sample Group ( CS ) 1 . ST Group : CHWs invite eligible woman area choose self-test conventional sample take health professional closest health care center . 2 . CS Group : CHWs invite eligible woman area conventional sample take health care professional near health care center . 1 ) Procedures carry group : 1.1 ) Active search • Self-test Group : During home visit CHWs carry health round , select CHWs visit every household charge invite eligible woman participate study , provide necessary information goal activity involve . Eligible woman willing participate study invite sign inform consent . Next , offer possibility self-test visit health care center sample take health care professional . Women agree self-test give option time test need CHWs come back later pick collect tube . CHWs explain procedure base communication material design purpose . Women decide screen health care center receive information available timetable . The CHWs bring self-taken sample health care center , collect tube stock sent provincial HPV laboratory , accord usual procedure delivery schedule . CHWs update F883 template , standard PHC form use CHWs collect socio-demographic health data household member . In addition , CHWs use specific questionnaire collect basic inclusion/exclusion criterion , self-testing acceptability reason doing/not self-testing . • Conventional Sample group : During home visit CHWs carry health round , select CHWs visit every household charge invite eligible woman participate study , provide necessary information goal activity involve . Eligible woman willing participate study invite sign inform consent . Next , give education talk promote cervical screening . They give information HPV test health care center well educational material prevention disease . CHWs update F883 template , standard PHC form use CHWs collect socio-demographic health data household member . In addition , CHWs use specific questionnaire collect basic inclusion/exclusion criterion , Women group , upon visit health care center conventional test , take HPV Pap test time , base provincial protocol regulation framework . Samples send read Cytology HPV Laboratory , accord standard provincial mechanism . 1.2 ) Delivery result , follow treatment : • Self-test group : Women test HPV positive receive visit CHW inform result . They invite undergo diagnosis study ( colposcopy/biopsy ) close health care center . The CHW brief availability timetable , professional health care center . Those woman suspicious colposcopic image target colposcopy-directed biopsy take , read provincial pathological anatomy laboratory . Women histologically confirm precancerous lesion wil follow treat base protocol establish Recommendations screening , follow treatment woman prevention cervical cancer framework HPV test incorporation , National Ministry Health20 . The data Pap test , colposcopy , biopsy treatment register SITAM ( screen information system ) , follow Provincial Program Cervical Cancer Prevention regulation . • Conventional sample group : Women test HPV positive , abnormal Pap test , visit CHW inform result invite undergo colposcopy close health care center . The CHW brief availability timetable , professional health care center . Women test HPV positive normal Pap test , receive result base usual procedure set forth Provincial Program Prevention Cervical Cancer . Those woman suspicious colposcopic image target colposcopy-directed biopsy take , read provincial pathological anatomy laboratory . Women histologically confirm precancerous lesion follow treat base protocol set forth Recommendations screening , follow prevention cervical cancer framework HPV test incorporation , National Ministry Health20 . The data Pap test , colposcopy , biopsy treatment register SITAM , base Provincial Program Prevention Cervical Cancer regulation . 2 . Training CHWs : All participate CHWs inform study special training provide . During training session , goal study , main activity carry specific task one perform explain . 3 . Production communication material : Informative material prepare CHWs participate study , main goal study explain guideline step follow home visit provide . Similarly , special leaflet prepare self-test instruction deliver woman option offer . Besides , contact woman give general leaflet cervical cancer prevention HPV Test woman self-test give leaflet mean HPV Test result . 4 . Sample selection size 1 . Proposed sample size coverage study With purpose select CHWs participate study , list CHWs province Jujuy make ( N = 678 ) . Then classify gender type health care center ( urban rural ) . The CHWs year 2011 rat regular performance PHC system exclude study . 150-200 CHWs randomly select , sample proportional size four stratum define gender health care center type . The CHWs select every stratum randomly allocate one study group ( half Self-test group half Conventional Sample group ) . Assuming CHW enroll average 40 woman ( minimum target 20 woman ) two visit round , overall number woman enrol every study group approximately least 75 x 40 = 3.000 ( number CHWs x number woman per CHW ) total number 6.000 woman study . We assume coefficient intra-class correlation ( CIC ) 0.05 , 0.075 0.10 power detect 10 % change ( 50 % 60 % ) first coverage indicator 5 % level significance test 0.999 , 0.97 0.93 respectively . 2 . Self-test acceptability estimate Acceptability define percentage woman accept self-test number woman offer self-test conventional sample option . Under scenario describe previous section expect half-length 95 % confidence interval acceptability within population 3.1 % , 3.5 % 4.0 % CIC 0.05 , 0.075 0.1 respectively . These value dawn consider bad situation regard length confidence interval , stem assume acceptability 50 % . 3 . Sample size CIN2+ detection rate comparison HPV Self-test versus cytology primary screen method We compare detection rate histologically confirm CIN2+ lesion diagnose 2011 within framework provincial program prevention cervical cancer , base cytology primary screening method , HPV Self-test detection rate ( relative sensitivity ) . This analysis include approximately 20.000 woman 30 year age older screen cytology year 2011 , framework provincial screening program , 3.000 woman expect screened mean HPV Self-test within framework present research project . The cytology detection rate year 2011 province Jujuy approximately 0.8 % . If assume HPV Self-test detection rate reach 1.4 % , 1.6 % , 1.8 % 2.0 % , power one-tailed test ( 5 % level significance ) compare CIN2+ detection rate turn 0.895 , 0.977 , 0.966 0.999 respectively . The power calculation do assume impact produce CHW CIN2+ detection rate . 5 . Database : A database build specifically study use ; include data randomization Group , agreement participate study , basic socio-demographic data , realization self-test ( correspond group ) , appropriate , reason doing/not self-test . Finally , HPV Test realization upload import data SITAM , link data base Unique Identification Number ( DNI ) . Data entry do specific software include range inter-item consistency check . Entries expect range allow . Data entry do 3 data enters , re-entry 20 % questionnaire quality control . Data store file ( TXT , DBF , SQL ) compatible analysis statistical package ( Stata ) . The data cleaning process actively search error plan way . Data screen include search four type oddity : outlier ( include inconsistency ) , strange pattern distribution , unexpected analysis result . Screening method include browse data table sort , printout variable pass consistency check , graphical exploration distribution , frequency distribution cross-tabulations summary statistic . Once error identify , go previous stage data flow see whether value consistently . If error find data entry phase , question interviewer may happen . If possible , contact interviewee repeat measurement . Accuracy previous HPV test report woman cross information laboratory database ( SITAM ) . Those woman report previous HPV test , test SITAM data base exclude study . The project database also match PHC database . For purpose , record woman 30 year age old reside area include study import PHCS database , include name , DNI basic socio-demographic data woman . Plan miss data Data exhaustive complete sample arrive HPV laboratory . Because define outcome number test effectively record laboratory database ( SITAM ) / number woman study arm , expect miss data main outcome . SITAM database less complete regard follow-up diagnosis procedure : colposcopy biopsy . In case HPV+ woman miss data colposcopy and/or biopsy result , project team contact Navigators Provincial Program Cervical Cancer Prevention . Usual navigators´ role provincial Program contact woman abnormal result problem complete diagnosis/treatment procedure provide support able finish process . They also contact health professional verify information report woman : example , case woman report treated data register SITAM . In case , contact health professional verify treatment provide result . Information gather navigator enter SITAM specific module also use complete data miss case . 6 . Data analysis : Data analysis do specific commercial software ( STATA 10.0 SAS ) . 6.1 Self-test acceptability : Acceptability define number woman accept self-test number woman offer option self-test conventional sample ( proportion woman accept self-test ) . Although CHWs receive instruction material , expect difference way self-test offer , convinced relative advantage , gender condition , etc . The acceptability population estimate average acceptability calculate CHW , control impact CHWs acceptability reach appropriate variance estimate . Besides , variability introduce CHWs acceptability study result obtain male female CHWs compare , well obtain CHWs rural urban area . 6.2 Self-test effectiveness enhance participation woman screen diagnosis : There comparison percentage woman HPV test Self-test group Conventional sample group . Three different coverage indicator consider every CHW . These define number woman screen within field work regard : 1 . The number woman reach CHW accept participate study . 2 . The number eligible woman CHW ( regardless whether CHW able contact ) . For every CHW measure adherence indication follow diagnosis well number woman colposcopy indication underwent colposcopy within follow-up period overall number woman colposcopy indication . The effect strategy ( offer self-test option promotion conventional sample ) estimate one coverage measure use mean difference test non-parametric test independent sample . 6.3 CIN 2+ detection rate : The effectiveness HPV Self-test screen cytology detect CIN2+ estimate detection rate difference detection rate ratio . Specific estimate provide well interval confidence measure effectiveness accurate asymptotic test perform appropriate base number CIN2+ detect . In addition , comparison CIN2+ detection rate group woman self-test total number woman province Jujuy test HPV ( conventional sample strategy + triage Pap test ) December 2012 . The power comparison difference observe informed upon report result .</detailed_description>
