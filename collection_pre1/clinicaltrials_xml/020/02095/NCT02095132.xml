	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose MK-1775 ( WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ) administer day 1 5 every 21 day , combination oral irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) , child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity MK-1775 combination oral irinotecan administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics MK-1775 child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity MK-1775 irinotecan within confines Phase 1 study . II . To obtain initial Phase 2 efficacy data anti-tumor activity MK-1775 combination irinotecan administer child relapse refractory neuroblastoma child relapse refractory medulloblastoma/CNS PNET ( central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor ) . III . To investigate checkpoint over-ride MK-1775 via mechanism-based pharmacodynamic ( PD ) biomarker decrease cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) phosphorylation correlative exploratory study . IV . To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers MK-1775 sensitivity , include v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( MYC ) , v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derive homolog ( MYCN ) , phosphorylated-WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase ( p-Wee1 ) , enhancer zeste homolog 2 ( Drosophila ) ( EZH2 ) gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) tumor tissue correlative exploratory study . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation follow phase II study . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride orally ( PO ) WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
