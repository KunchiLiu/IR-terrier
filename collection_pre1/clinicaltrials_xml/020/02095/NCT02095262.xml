	<brief_summary>Tinnitus refers perception ringing , hiss buzz sound despite sound external world . It prevalent many individual distress condition . Recent advance understanding change hear brain relation tinnitus perception lead focus form active auditory training might provide effective technique tinnitus management . Our recent trial auditory training provide evidence training use sound hearing loss benefit term reduce tinnitus intrusiveness , train level hearing loss . Our next challenge build find way might maximize benefit observe . The training software use previously develop use child . Past participant give mixed review software . While enjoyed training find soporific , others report found monotonous un-motivating . We therefore wish explore impact different game mechanic delivery auditory training design two different interactive game context training tinnitus benefit . These game deliver type auditory training software currently use , intrinsically motivate , i.e . game people motivate play irrespective potential benefit tinnitus . The game previously use reactive , i.e . sound play player selects think correct answer ( odd one ) . The two new game wish test describe interactive , i.e . player control sound delivery actively seek correct answer : may additional benefit tinnitus .</brief_summary>
