	<brief_title>Pomegranate-Extract Pill Preventing Tumor Growth Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect pomegranate fruit extract ( PFE ) 1000 mg , take daily 1 year , plasma level insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) baseline end study ( 52 week ) participant undergo active surveillance ( AS ) early stage prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess compliance daily oral administration PFE versus placebo 52-week period time . II . To assess toxicity PFE vs. placebo take daily 52 week ( +/- 1 week ) . III . To compare correlate modulation follow biomarkers response PFE versus placebo follow-up biopsy result perform week 52 +/- 1 week ( earlier clinically indicate ) , include presence absence tumor , extent tumor Gleason score ; plasma biomarkers : Insulin-like growth factor 1/IGF binding protein 3 ratio ( IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio ) ; normal abnormal prostate tissue biomarkers : prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , IGFBP-3 , apoptosis ( TUNEL ) , proliferate cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , IGF-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) , 8-hydroxy-2 ' -deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) androgen receptor . IV . Measure PFE constituents/metabolites plasma urine evidence accumulation ( trough level ) : ellagic acid , dimethyl ellagic acid , dimethyl ellagic acid glucuronide ( DMEAG ) , urolithin A , urolithin A-glucuronide , urolithin B urolithin B-glucuronide . V. Measure PSA double time ( PSA DT ) serum , use calculation provide Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website . VI . To assess feasibility cancer chemoprevention trial population men undergo active surveillance prostate cancer . VII . Measurement serum testosterone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 group . GROUP I : Patients receive pomegranate-extract pill orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 52 week ( ± 1 week ) . GROUP II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 52 week ( ± 1 week ) .</detailed_description>
