	<brief_summary>Adjuvant chemotherapy frequently propose patient present early breast cancer , case high risk recurrence ( large tumor , node involvement , high grade… ) . Due toxicity toward vein , chemotherapy must administer central venous device . Today , one use either implanted port PICC line ( Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ) . A PICC line easier implant explant , flush every week may impact daily life ( swim , clothes may fit ) . On hand , port subcutaneous let patient lead normal life , implant explant require cutaneous incision possible complication ( bleed , pain , infection ) . For venous device , complication thrombosis infection may happen . Published data compare two device heterogeneous often distinguish patient treat different disease various stage . Empirically daily practice , long term use ( &gt; 6 month ) port usually prefer , whereas short-term treatment ( &lt; 6 week ) PICC line use . In case Her2 negative early breast cancer , adjuvant chemotherapy usually last 4 5 month . There scientific evidence prefer one device patient . The aim study prospectively compare patient ' satisfaction tolerance two device .</brief_summary>
