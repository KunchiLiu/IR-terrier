	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose form cancer Canadian men . In 2006 , great 250,000 men diagnose prostate cancer United States Canada 32,000 men die disease . Using prognostic variable T-category , serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , pathologic Gleason score ( GS ) , men localize prostate cancer place low , intermediate high-risk grouping . Usually treat surgery , radiation therapy , hormone therapy and/or watchful waiting ( also know active surveillance ) . While treatment quite effective , tumours likely recur 40 % case . There need additional prostate cancer treatment . To address need , many experimental therapy develop tested mouse prostate tumor . This include study aggressive prostate cancer cell stem cell , Tumour Initiating Cells ( TICs ) , oxygen deprive cell , may one likely re-grow tumour spread throughout body . Researchers want try isolate special cell prostate surgery study feature , see re-grow solid tumour mouse . Researchers would like test whether prostate cancer stem cell resistant less resistant treatment . This allow researcher study test new treatment specifically target resistant aggressive prostate cancer cell . The investigator hypothesize marker-defined TIC cell hypoxic cancer cell unique genetics primary prostate cancer relatively chemo- radio-resistant .</brief_summary>
