	<detailed_description>With development conformal precise radiation technique Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Image-Guided Radiotherapy ( IGRT ) , patient hepatic tumor could treat high local dos spar normal liver tissue . However , frequently occur large HCC tumor still represent dosimetric challenge spite modern high sophisticated RT modality . This interventional clinical study set evaluate value different fiducial marker , use modern image method treatment optimization use physical informatics approaches.Radioopaque fiducial marker electro-magnetic transponder implant close proximity tumor .
