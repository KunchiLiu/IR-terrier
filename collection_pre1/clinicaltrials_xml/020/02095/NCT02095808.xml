	<brief_summary>The purpose research study develop method use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate solitary pulmonary nodule ( mass lung small 3 centimeter ) . A pulmonary nodule mass growth lung . An MRI scanning device use magnet make image ( picture ) body . This study do determine series reaction ( metabolic pathway ) pulmonary nodule use burn sugar fuel growth . The manner tumor burn ( metabolizes ) sugar fuel investigate use natural , slightly modify , sugar solution ( 13C-glucose ) study small sample tumor remove time surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Using Imaging Biomarkers Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent report finding National Lung Screening Trial indicate screen high-risk population use low dose CT result 20 % reduction lung cancer mortality . At institution , positive nodule 1 cm large would image use combined fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG PET ) /CT . Highly suspicious nodule would biopsied risk manageable . Otherwise , suspicious nodule eligible biopsy so-called `` indeterminate '' nodule follow use CT evaluate interval growth . The overall goal project assess several promise image biomarkers reflect either physiological metabolic status nodule order develop accurate image algorithms follow-up either less invasive use ionize radiation . Based experience cancer preliminary result lung cancer , identify four potential image study believe potential result validate `` imaging biomarkers '' either individually , combination , characterize malignancy . Since tumor tend exhibit angiogenesis alter vascular permeability , others , find analysis dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCEMRI ) employ `` image biomarkers '' malignancy . Tumors often exhibit high cellularity benign normal tissue suggest pixel-by-pixel ADC value derive diffusion weight MRI could useful image biomarkers . Finally , measure alteration metabolic flux use pathway specific C-13 label compound , technique pioneer Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ) UT Southwestern , show capability provide metabolic fingerprint malignant benign tissue . This approach , invasive , could identify validate marker detect non-invasively future study . We also employ advanced metabolomics method identify potential signature `` onco-metabolites '' lung cancer .</detailed_description>
