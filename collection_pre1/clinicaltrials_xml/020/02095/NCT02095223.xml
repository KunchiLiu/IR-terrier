	<brief_summary>Muscle inhibition prevents optimal contraction quadriceps muscle due change nervous system knee joint injury . Current treatment muscle inhibition time include knee joint cryotherapy electric stimulation prior exercise . These treatment , addition strengthening exercise , show improvement quality strength muscle contraction however , short window effectiveness . Electromyographic Biofeedback proven useful improve quadriceps strength mechanism action remain somewhat unclear . Therefore , purpose investigation compare effectiveness electromyographic biofeedback supplement exercise compare traditional exercise quadriceps muscle function individual history knee injury current evidence quadriceps inhibition . We hypothesize 14 day electromyographic biofeedback supplement exercise lead large gain quadriceps activation compare traditional exercise . Thirty 18-40 year old participant history knee injury current evidence quadriceps muscle inhibition enrol single blind randomized control trial . Participants provide write consent prior study procedure . Following enrollment , participant ask complete questionnaire relate knee related function , current level pain , current activity level follow completion baseline measurement . 1 . We use superimposed burst technique quadriceps muscle activation . 2 . We measure Hoffmann reflex response quadriceps surface electromyography . We measure signal surface electromyography electrodes record activity quadriceps muscle skin . Participants group instruct 14 day home exercise protocol day enrollment . The protocol comprise 4 exercise focus non-weight bearing weight bear quadriceps strengthen . Compliance monitor via daily exercise diary collect end study protocol . Quadriceps central activation ratio , active motor threshold Hoffmann reflex report descriptively . Pre-intervention post 14 day intervention quadriceps central activation ratio Hoffmann reflex compare traditional exercise Biofeedback supplement exercise</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Subjects ask complete brief questionnaire low extremity , use determine exhibit exclusionary criterion ( administer Study Coordinator ) . This include past medical history , headache/ migraine history , drugs/medications currently take ( might influence excitability threshold Hoffman reflex ( H-reflex ) measurement central activation ratio ) . Subjects also undergo quadriceps central activation ratio test determine level quadriceps inhibition . Upon review questionnaire quadriceps central activation ratio , study coordinator determine subject 's eligibility ( base inclusion exclusion criterion ) . We also collect age , height weight subject . Participants qualify provide write time document investigator . Quadriceps Central Activation Ratio We use superimposed burst technique measure quadriceps muscle strength estimate quadriceps activation calculate central activation ratio . Subjects secure chair ( Biodex multi-mode dynamometer ) knees hips bent approximately 90 degree . Subjects perform maximal , voluntary isometric knee extension contraction ( MVIC ) continuous verbal encouragement tester . Once MVIC reach plateau ( represent subject ' maximal effort ) electrical stimulus manually trigger deliver directly quadriceps 2 stimulate electrode secure subject ' anterior thigh . The stimulus cause quadriceps twitch result temporary increase force production measure . A ratio MVIC force high force achieve due electrical stimulation calculate - call central activation ratio . The electrical stimulus deliver manually square-wave stimulator conjunction stimulus isolation unit ) consist train 10 consecutive , square wave pulse 600 microsecond duration , intensity 125 volt carrier frequency 100 pulse per second . Subjects option experience `` practice '' pulse low intensity order become acclimate stimulus practice maintain maximum effort anticipation stimulation . Randomization Randomization take place enrollment screen take place . The assessor blind investigation . Therefore , clinician responsible educate patient regard exercise protocol also responsible randomization . Randomization take place 1:1 basis . Prior start study , binary random number generator use generate randomization scheme . These number place sealed envelope label individual subject number . The randomization envelop store locked drawer remove clinician responsible randomization . The randomization envelope store participant 's research folder . Quadriceps Hoffmann Reflex We record muscle reflex activity deliver short percutaneous ( skin ) electrical stimulation femoral nerve locate inguinal fold . We measure reflex response quadriceps surface electromyography . This measure help describe function muscle exercise protocol . Subjects position comfortably lying-down position treatment table . Stimuli deliver femoral nerve increase intensity small increment 10 second rest interval stimulus , maximum H-reflex amplitude record ( Hmax ) . Then increase stimulus voltage obtain maximum M-wave . The H-reflex represent proportion quadriceps motor neuron pool available voluntary contraction M-wave represent total volume quadriceps motor neuron pool use normalize H-reflex recording H : M ratio . This measurement perform bilaterally . Exercise Intervention Participants group instruct 14 day exercise ( 4 supervise session 10 home session ) protocol day enrollment . The protocol comprise 4 exercise focus non-weight bearing weight bear quadriceps strengthen . All participant ask complete 3 set 10 repetition isometric quadriceps contraction 15 second hold time , supine straight leg raise , body weight squat , body weight lunge daily . Participants require complete single limb exercise previously injure limb . A compliance log give participant reviewed supervise exercise session final study visit . Participants instruct discontinue exercise contact principle investigator experience knee pain due intervention . Participants electromyographic biofeedback supplement exercise also instruct correct setup use electromyographic biofeedback unit . These instruction focus correct placement electromyography record electrode quadriceps muscle well correct tune feedback threshold exercise maximize benefit intervention . Electromyographic biofeedback use exercise throughout course study group . Follow-up Testing After 14±1 day exercise intervention baseline measure re-tested manner explain . A supervised exercise session compliance check complete 3±1 , 7±1 , 10±1 day follow enrollment study . No follow-up measurement take point , however exercise compliance log collect participant .</detailed_description>
