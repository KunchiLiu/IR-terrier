	<brief_summary>More three quarter patient breast cancer treat hormone pill call tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) . AIs drug stop female hormone production . This hormone production mostly happen fat , muscle , breast tissue postmenopausal woman . The female hormone estrogen important hormone growth breast cancer cell . Anastrozole ( Arimidex® ) Letrozole ( Femara® ) AIs approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . They use since 2005 treat woman early stage breast cancer . When give surgery ( neoadjuvant ) , anastrozole letrozole show successfully shrink breast cancer tumor patient . In 50 % patient , anastrozole letrozole give 4 month also help improve surgery outcomes . On top , whether patient responds anastrozole letrozole surgery help doctor decide whether patient need additional chemotherapy . One thing may influence level hormone body weight . It previously show postmenopausal woman higher body fat high level female hormone well increase risk breast cancer . This likely due increase aromatase activity fatty tissue . However , current time AIs use dos woman breast cancer matter whether different body weight . Currently , know certain whether dos AIs work well patient higher body fat compare patient less body fat . The purpose study see woman higher body fat respond differently AI treatment compare woman low body fat .</brief_summary>
