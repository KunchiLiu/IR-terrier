	<brief_summary>The primary objective study develop validate simultaneous free-breathing 4D fat water quantification quantitative dynamic contrast enhance perfusion liver . Secondary aim include develop validate free breathe quantification relaxation parameter T1 T2 , develop validate minimal breath-hold ( &lt; 8 ) high quality diffusion exam use highly accelerate steady state diffusion image sequence . Investigators aim scan 100 subject receive liver biopsy part standard care another 70 subject know benign lesion . The study great minimal risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize quantitative near free-breathing MRI approach Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient lead improve tissue characterization , result few ambiguous reading thus few biopsy . As component propose methodology experimentally validate investigator preliminary work , next appropriate step would evaluate clinical feasibility exam . The investigator goal test ability quantitative MRI technique provide high quality image liver differentiate liver lesion one another time frame shorter current clinical exam .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>No contraindication get contrast enhance MRI examination . GFR â‰¥ 40 . Patients ferromagnetic otherwise nonMRI compatible aneurysm clip . The presence implant pacemaker implant defibrillator device Patients contraindication MRI due embed foreign metallic object . Bullets , shrapnel , metalwork fragment , metallic material add unnecessary risk patient . Pregnancy . Regular clinical practice already exclude pregnant patient gadolinium contrast due unknown effect fetus . The current clinical practice apply patient verbally screen ask think could pregnant . If answer yes , patient exclude study . If patient uncertain pregnancy status , give option undergo pregnancy test participate study altogether . Patients self report pregnant allow participate study . This procedure base current department policy guideline . Implanted medical device describe MRIcompatible ; Known history claustrophobia ; Known history allergic reaction Magnetic Resonance contrast material ; Late stage renal failure estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 base patient 's serum creatinine due significantly increase risk nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) . ( 'Past ' 3 month timeframe use calculate eGRF ) . Minors exclude . Prisoners member vulnerable population exclude study . The subject selection population regularly include prisoner vulnerable population member population provide additional unique information uniquely benefit study . Nonenglish speak population exclude study due lack sufficient resource pay translator interpreter service .</criteria>
