	<criteria>Diagnostic criterion : Female patient diagnosis cervical cancer epithelial origin confirm histologic and/or radiologic assessment . Said patient must relapse persistency receive first line chemoradiotherapy one line palliative chemotherapy . Karnofsky score 80 . A CT scan perform patient assess measurable target lesion . The clinical diagnosis must evaluate clinical investigator Patients give write consent participation study . Patients recurrent persistent cervicaluterine cancer , local and/or systemic disease measurable lesion , whether physical examination , CT Scan MRI detect least previous 6 week . If one lesion le 10 mm length , biopsy confirmation require . Patients currently receive second , third line palliative chemotherapy diagnose least 30 day last chemotherapy . Patients one follow Histopathological report : Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( epidermoid carcinoma ) , adenocarcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma glassy cell carcinoma . Patients must older 18 year old . ECOG score bad 3 . Patients life expectancy great 4 week . Patients leave ventricle ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 measure radioisotopic ventriculography . Patients meet previous criterion previously radiate metastatic disease central nervous system include . Patients normal function bone marrow organ define follow parameter : Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/L Leucocytes ≥ 4000/microL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/microL Platelet count ≥ 100000/microL Total serum Bilirubin : 1.5 time normal value Total Proteins : Within normal limit AST ALT =/ &lt; 2.5 time normal superior limit institutional laboratory Serum creatinine : within normal limit 2 mg GFR ≥ 60ml/min calculated CockcroftGault equation . Pregnant nursing mother . Patients cervicaluterine cancer histopathological report : small cell carcinoma and/or neuroendocrine tumor . Patients currently receive another investigational oncospecific drug . Patients history allergy chemical substance similar chemical composition monoclonal antibody chemotherapeutic agent use study . Patients noncontrolled comorbid state active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina , cardiac arrhythmia , uncompensated diabetes and/or psychiatric illness . Presence second tumor . With exception patient receive adequate treatment skin carcinoma ( basal squamous ) . Previous concomitant malignancy except nonmelanoma skin carcinoma . Social , familiar geographic condition suggest poor attachment study . Discontinuation treatment criterion : At patient´s request .
