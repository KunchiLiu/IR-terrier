	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Bendamustine , Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level carfilzomib base join study . Up 5 dose level carfilzomib combination bendamustine dexamethasone test . Up 3-6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level carfilzomib bendamustine . The second , third , , fourth group receive high dos carfilzomib . The fifth final group receive high dose bendamustine . The study continue move group group intolerable side effect see previous group . All participant receive dose level dexamethasone . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-12 , Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 Cycles 13 beyond . The infusion last 30 minute . You may remain Cycle 1-12 dosing schedule entire study doctor think best interest . You monitor study staff side effect least 30-45 minute receive carfilzomib dose receive Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 . You receive bendamustine vein right carfilzomib infusion Days 1 2 Cycles 1-3 Day 1 Cycle 4 cycle . The infusion last 1 hour . You take dexamethasone mouth vein ( 20 minute ) follow time : - On Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 , 23 Cycles 1-3 . - On Days 1 , 2 , 15 16 Cycles 4-12 . - On Days 1 2 Cycles 13 beyond . Dexamethasone take 30 minute 4 hour carfilzomib dose day receive carfilzomib . If take dexamethasone mouth , take food glass water . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1-12 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include neurologic exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . - You collect urine 24 hour measure protein level . You give container collect urine . - You MRI CT scan doctor think necessary . On Days 2 , 8 15 Cycles 1-12 , follow test procedure perform : ° Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 13 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . - You collect urine 24 hour measure protein level . You give container collect urine . On Day 15 Cycles 13 cycle , follow test procedure perform : ° Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day stop receive study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . - You collect urine 24 hour measure protein level . You give container collect urine . - If doctor think necessary , CT scan MRI scan look tumor cause MM . Follow-Up : If leave study disease get bad study , study staff call every 3 month 1 year every 6 month every year ask status disease . The phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type MM . Its use study investigational . Bendamustine FDA approve commercially available treatment rituximab-refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , slow-growing ( indolent ) lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Its use study investigational . Dexamethasone FDA approve commercially available combination lenalidomide treatment patient MM receive least 1 prior therapy . Its use combination carfilzomib bendamustine investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 49 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
