	<brief_title>Trends In Oxygen Saturation In Healthy Term Infants In The First Few Days Of Life : The `` TOST '' Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The newborn period time transition intrauterine extra-uterine environment . Arterial fetal oxygen saturation birth approximately 65 % . Within minute delivery , onset respiration , newborn 's oxygen saturation rise close normal postnatal value . In practice , oxygen saturation measure continuously use trans-cutaneous probe connect pulse oximeter . The probe illuminate local tissue true oxygen saturation estimate measuring wavelength light absorbed . This method trans-cutaneous oxygen saturation measurement ( SpO2 ) yield accurate estimate true oxygen saturation comparable measurement make via co-oximetry use whole blood ( 1,2 ) . Description problem : Healthy newborns undergo routine monitoring oxygen saturation . Hence , health care team know fluctuation oxygen saturation normal phenomenon . It important clear understanding postnatal oxygen saturation trend variability healthy baby help identify infant warrant investigation intervention , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) `` normal '' newborn nursery . Identifying `` At-Risk '' Newborns : Studies oxygen saturation apparently healthy baby describe postnatal oxygen saturation 95-98 % first day birth ( 3-5 ) . There small increase SpO2 2 3 % next 72 hour follow closure ductus arteriosus . In study , oxygen saturation threshold value prompt investigation and/or treatment change . One study blind healthcare team oxygen saturation value small subset recruit patient ( 6 ) . These study define `` normal '' oxygen saturation base whether significant pathology discover investigation . By set threshold SpO2 value determine need investigation intervention selectively target group , investigator potentially introduce bias . It often difficult clinically identify baby early stage potentially serious disease infection critical congenital heart disease . Such baby may appear well several day birth therefore , discharge home diagnosis make . In case , serious risk rapid deterioration hospital result baby return emergency department subsequent readmission hospital . Oxygen saturation screen discharge home follow birth may help identify well-looking baby serious underlying condition . For reason , many center adopt policy perform screen SpO2 measurement newborns . A recent systematic review pulse oximetry screen detection critical congenital heart disease 229421 newborn show sensitivity 76•5 % , specificity 99•9 % false-positive rate 0•14 % ( 7 ) . In review 748 false positive result , six time true positive test . More importantly , 33 baby critical congenital heart disease identify . Positive predictive value test low ( 13 % ) low prevalence disease high false positive rate . The high false positive rate support need high quality normative saturation data implement test community . There uncertainty interpret information current policy tend set single cutoff SpO2 value threshold investigation , echo-cardiogram . This may overly-simplistic approach consider normal fluctuation oxygen saturation investigator anticipate occur healthy newborn . Having high quality SpO2 value healthy term baby basis comparison may lead accurate identification `` at-risk '' newborn . Car Seat Testing : Many baby admit NICU undergo 90 minute continuous SpO2 recording position car seat prior discharge home . The procedure , refer car-seat testing , meant identify baby able tolerate flex body position result sit car seat . The 90-minute recording present frequency histogram SpO2 value clinician identify baby spend excessive proportion time oxygen saturation low . The interpretation car seat test result largely subjective . By compare test result SpO2 histograms healthy baby , clinician could objectively identify baby `` pas '' `` fail '' car-seat test . Oxygen Saturation Histogram Interpretation : Preterm infants 37 week correct gestation require ongoing mechanical ventilation , continuous positive airway pressure oxygen deliver via nasal prong routinely SpO2 frequency histogram create help decide ready extubation transition continuous positive airway pressure . Currently good-quality SpO2 normative data help define criterion assess SpO2 histogram determine baby ready transition respiratory support . METHODS STUDY DESIGN : Prospective , longitudinal , observational study . STUDY CENTER : This study conduct city Calgary , Alberta ( altitude 1054 meter ) postpartum ward 3 geographically separate hospital : Foothills Medical Center , Rocky View General Hospital Peter-Lougheed Hospital . Calgary approximately 18,000 birth per year . In oxygen saturation reference study conduct different altitude , postnatal oxygen saturation center 1500 meter significantly different measure sea level . Therefore , investigator expect result applicable center 1500 meter altitude . As part study , Investigators also conduct pilot study design Bogota , Columbia . Bogota altitude 2625 meter . The pilot study examine pattern oxygen saturation healthy baby high altitude Calgary ( altitude 1045 meter ) . SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION &amp; ENROLLMENT : Investigators review electronic health record baby admit labor delivery ward daily basis identify potential subject . The electronic health record display age every patient . Newborns identify age 0 day . After staff care mother confirm willingness speak u regard study , local co-investigator approach mother potential subject request consent study enrollment . For enrolled infant , notice birth label attach alert Public Health Nurse baby part study . For parent decline participate study , Investigators request permission follow infant 8 week identify ER visit hospital admission . Comparing data infant data infant study help u detect bias recruitment . DATA TO BE COLLECTED Gestational age , age ( Hours/ day life ) , gender , birth weight , multiple , mode delivery , Group-B streptococci status , duration rupture membrane , presence labor , chorioamnionitis , maternal medical history &amp; obstetrical history , maternal smoking , gestational diabetes , pregnancy induce hypertension , antenatal ultrasound result , amniocentesis/chorionic villous sample result , Apgar score , resuscitation detail , cord blood gas result collect patient 's electronic paper health record . Oxygen saturation data collect outline . OXYGEN SATURATION MEASUREMENTS : Once enrol , newborn infant oxygen saturation measure 90 minute use Masimo Radical 7 pulse oximeter . This pulse oximeter choose resistance movement artifact good performance state low perfusion ( 14,15 ) . The pulse oximeter set normal sensitivity 8 second average time save data point every 2 second . One pulse oximeter probe place right wrist ( pre-ductal ) probe place either foot ( post ductal ) take continuous measurement 10 minute , start point perfusion index , measure tissue perfusion signal quality , acceptable ( &gt; 1.0 ) . This initial phase record occur supervision co-investigator nursery examination room baby quiet state ensure acquisition accurate reading . Each infant 's state alertness classify accord March Dimes ' `` States Term Newborn '' description ( 16 ) . The baby return mother one pulse oximeter still attach right wrist completion 90-minute recording period . During 80 minute period , investigator record preductal saturation inconvenient mother two probe attach infant . Another 15 min simultaneous pre post-ductal SpO2 measurement perform Public Health Nurse ( PHN ) clinic 2-3 day discharge PHN train use pulse oximetry . NEONATAL STATE : Neonatal state group characteristic behavior physiological change recur regular pattern ( 17 ) . With neonatal state change heart rate , blood flow , electroencephalographic saturation change ( 18-20 ) . Identification neonatal state oxygen saturation recording may help interpretation saturation trend context neonatal state , therefore , control analysis . To categorize infant 's state , use `` March Dimes '' state term newborn ( Ref : March dime ) ( see appendix ) . Even though method validate comparison electro-physiological study , simple quick perform , non-invasive require sophisticated equipment . TIMING OF RECORDINGS : Oximetry recording perform every 12-24 hour prior discharge regular working hour , first record occur 6 24 hour birth ( 21 ) . Recordings perform prior 6 hour age allow normal transition extra-uterine environment complete . One SpO2 recording perform PHN 2 3 day discharge Public Health Clinic . Note , Calgary , baby routinely follow Public Health within day discharge . BLINDING : Pulse oximeter reading obscure fasten opaque cover oximeter 's display . The perfusion index , measure strength signal , leave visible investigator ensure good quality signal obtain . The beat beat tone function turn high/low SpO2 alarm silence indirect indicator oxygen saturation . In manner , investigator staff blind oxygen saturation reading . INTER OBSERVER AGREEMENT FOR ASSESSMENT OF NEONATAL STATE ( MARCH OF DIMES ) : With multiple investigator study , important define neonatal state uniformly . With simple method assessment , investigator expect inter-observer agreement high . To estimate inter-observer variability , first 10 infant site ( Total 30 infant 3 site ) recruit study observe simultaneously 2 investigator . Each observation happen first 10 minute recording ( normal newborn nursery ) record independently investigator preprinted form . Inter-observer variability determine use nominal kappa statistic bootstrapped bias correct 95 % confidence interval . Kappa value classify follow : zero=poor , zero 0.20=slight , 0.21 0.4=fair , 0.41 0.6=moderate , 0.61 0.8=substantial , 0.81 1=almost perfect . Since main purpose assessment validate neonatal state assessment , understand degree variability among observation , investigator choose convenience sample 30 infant . DATA MANAGEMENT : Data automatically record stored pulse oximeter real time . Prior measurement , co-investigator Public Health Nurse , record date time pulse oximeter onset SpO2 measurement . This facilitate linking patient oximetry data download record information pulse oximeter . The pulse oximeter store 3 distinct type data time point : oxygen saturation , heart rate hexadecimal code contain information regard quality recording . The data import pulse oximeter Microsoft Excel use research laptop computer run hyper terminal program . Each oximeter accommodate measurement without exceed storage capacity . However , oximeter downloads occur shortly collection ensure data safely store timely manner . Study data collect manage use REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) , online research database.1 REDCap secure , web-based application design support data capture research study , provide : 1 ) intuitive interface validate data entry ; 2 ) audit trail track data manipulation export procedure ; 3 ) automate export procedure seamless data downloads common statistical package ; 4 ) procedure import data external source ( 22 ) . Identifying information keep study binder enter REDCap database . FOLLOW-UP OF BABIES : Babies follow 8 week age , review electronic health record , identify die , require readmission hospital visit emergency room . For baby , investigator review hospital chart electronic health record identify important diagnosis make . Investigators also review echo-cardiograms perform follow period . Babies subsequently find diagnosis congenital heart disease , respiratory illness ( congenital respiratory disorders/ malformation ) , blood dyscrasia intrauterine/perinatally acquire infection ( base clinical feature microbiological evidence along individual chart review ) data include nomogram . Infants condition analyze separately determine oxygen saturation differ healthy baby . SAMPLE SIZE : Assuming mean oxygen saturation measurement within 0.25 % margin error base publish estimate standard deviation oxygen saturation measurement population , investigator consider standard deviation 3.35 . This also serve estimate average coefficient variation within margin error . The actual sample size calculation 14 . However , give primary objective create nomogram percentile oxygen saturation , necessary enroll large number baby . Assuming 10 15 % drop rate 1-2 % rate baby exclude discharge due diagnose heart disease , etc , investigator plan enroll 625 baby achieve final sample size 500 baby . ANALYSIS : Investigators analyze trend post-ductal SpO2 , SpO2 variability difference pre post-ductal oxygen saturation initial phase . The `` R project '' statistical computing package use analysis supervision one co-investigators ( A Nettel-Agguire , PhD statistician ) . Investigators present descriptive statistic population characteristic . Categorical variable present proportion 95 % CI , numerical variable present mean ( Standard Deviation ) median ( IQR ) appropriate . For baby , oxygen saturation mean calculate along SD ( Standard Deviation ) coefficient variation ( SD/mean ) time period ( day 0 , day 1 , day 2 , etc ) . Sample mean three parameter calculate correspond confidence interval . Investigators calculate oxygen saturation percentile use LMS method ( skewness-median-coefficient variation method ) base individual mean separately day SpO2 measurement make . Investigators expect SpO2 remain stable time . For assess , least graphically , Functional data analysis ( FDA ) full individual profile perform . FDA create curve profile ( via statistical penalized fitting spline ) SpO2 data respect time individual . Hence mean profile mean curve derive subject correspond 95 % confidence band . This do separately Day 0 day 1 , day 2 , etc . Logistic regression do ass covariates oxygen saturation , variability oxygen saturation , gestational age , birth weight gender 8-week outcome death , serious illness hospital readmission . NOVELTY OF STUDY : This study add field follow way : 1 . To knowledge , first study blind healthcare team , co-investigators parent pulse oximeter reading enrol infant . Blinding pulse oximeter reading remove potentially important source bias . 2 . Previous study provide either single oxygen saturation value single point time single oxygen saturation value multiple time point . Investigators measure continuous oxygen saturation multiple occasion . This 2 main potential advantage : 1 . Investigators able construct SpO2 histograms minimum , mean , standard deviation coefficient variation individual observe value 2 . Performing pulse oximetry one occasion allow u identify quantify change oxygen saturation time 3 . This study unique definition `` healthy '' decide infant 's well-being 8 week age . This approach allow investigator identify infant appear well birth subsequently identify `` healthy '' . 4 . Community oxygen saturation record PHN novel concept screen different time point time critical congenital heart disease likely detect pulse oximetry ductus arteriosus normally close within 72 hour birth ( 23 ) . A recent systematic review show false positive rate decrease 10 time SpO2 measurement make 24 hour age ( 7 ) . 5 . Measurement pre post ductal SpO2 may increase ability detect illness clinically apparent ( 24 ) . ETHICS : An ethic application submit Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board . Informed consent obtain prior enrol baby study . The use pulse oximetry newborn NICU routine . It safe procedure know harmful effect . As routine use pulse oximetry currently standard care postpartum labor delivery ward , blind staff pulse oximeter reading present ethical challenge . Furthermore , blind healthcare staff SpO2 reading may prevent potentially inappropriately change infant 's management base SpO2 reading .</detailed_description>
