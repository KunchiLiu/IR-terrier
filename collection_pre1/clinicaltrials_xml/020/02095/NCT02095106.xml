	<brief_summary>Distal radius fracture one commonly see fracture child . Traditionally , minimally angulate non-displaced distal radius fracture treat short long-arm cast immobilization 8 week . The traditional fiberglass cast use must keep dry prevent inflammation potential infection . If fiberglass cast get wet , must remove replace . In general , waterproof cast show improve patient comfort overall satisfaction . We intend explore efficacy new , waterproof cast make hybrid mesh treatment minimally angulate distal radius fracture child use randomize , control , cross-over study design . We include patient 4 14 year age minimally angulate distal radius fracture ( &lt; 15 degree angulation sagittal coronal plane ) present Orthopaedic Institute Children Urgent Care Facility within 7 day injury . As determined power analysis , total 26 patient enrol study . Patients eligible study randomize one two equally size ( n=13 ) group : patient Group 1 receive short arm cast make waterproof hybrid mesh material patient Group 2 receive regular fiberglass cast . Both group follow-up two week clinical radiological evaluation , transition regular fiberglass cast ( Group 1 ) hybrid mesh waterproof cast ( Group 2 ) additional two week . This crossover allow group experience type cast . After four week immobilization , patient group discontinue cast advise avoid contact sport strenuous activity week 8 . Patients group follow 8 week initial treatment clinical radiological evaluation evaluate range motion , pain , fracture alignment . Physical function evaluate week 1 , 2 , 4 use Activities Scale Kids - Performance , validate , highly reliable , self-reported measure assess physical function child 5 15 year . Pain evaluate use Faces Pain Scale , validate , highly reliable scale commonly use pediatric population . Patient satisfaction measure Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , radiograph Week 8 compare initial radiograph ass fracture displacement angulation . Skin change assess week 2 week 4 independent observer blind type cast remove digital photograph obtain analyzed use ImageJ Image Processing Analysis Software calculate surface area describe skin change percentage total skin area originally cover cast . Itching assessed week 1 , 2 , 4 use visual analogue scale horizontal line 100 mm present patient `` itching '' leave end scale `` strong itching '' right end . We hope determine whether new , waterproof cast result similar clinical outcome patient satisfaction distal radius fracture compare traditional fiberglass cast .</brief_summary>
