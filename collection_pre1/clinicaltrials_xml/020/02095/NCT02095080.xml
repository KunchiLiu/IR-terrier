	<brief_summary>Amino acid building block body 's protein . Some amino acid , include leucine , make body must obtain diet , call essential . With increase age body 's muscle mass decrease study suggest dietary supplementation leucine may potential health benefit elderly regard prevention age related loss lean muscle mass , thus may help improve quality life elderly . Currently , safe upper dietary intake level leucine establish healthy elderly . Prior explore whether leucine supplementation prevent decrease loss lean muscle mass elderly propose identify upper intake leucine healthy elderly . The purpose study determine tolerable upper intake level ( UL ) leucine healthy elderly men ( 70 - 75 yr ) The investigator hypothesize careful graded stepwise increase leucine intake elderly men , Estimated Average Requirement ( EAR - 50 mg/kg/d ) , body 's ability oxidize/dispose excess amino acid reach maximum . With increased leucine intake hypothesize increase plasma ammonia concentration increase plasma leucine urinary leucine excretion .</brief_summary>
