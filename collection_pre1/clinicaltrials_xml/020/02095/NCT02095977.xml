This prospective , single-center study . Patients consent participate enrol three year . This study offer potential direct benefit patient indirect benefit future user ICD system . This study may identify inside-out insulation break prevent impend lead failure . Additionally , analyse data collect part study may help develop `` electronic footprint '' pattern remotely identify inside-out insulation break ICD lead Potential risk include exposure radiation fluoroscopic exam lead receive synchronize ICD shock .</detailed_description>
