	<brief_title>Effectiveness Exoskeleton Gait Training Versus Manual Therapy Subacute Post Stroke Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause death serious long term disability adult , three mouth stroke , 20 % people remain wheelchair bound , 70 % walk reduce velocity capacity . People suffer stroke , regain ambulatory function , walk typically asymmetrical gait pattern , slow , metabolically inefficient . These characteristic associate difficulty advance bear weight though affected limb , leading instability increase risk fall . Manually-assisted body-weight support Treadmill training ( BWSTT ) contemporary approach gait rehabilitation stroke , whereas individual walk treadmill , therapists manually facilitate hemiparetic limb trunk control effort normalize upright reciprocal step dynamic postural control . Advantages approach little ambulatory function require initiate locomotion early post stroke training effect transfer improvement ground gait include : symmetry , speed , endurance well motor impairment balance score . An example electromechanical device Lokomat , robotic gait orthosis combine harness-supported body weight system use together treadmill . However main difference treadmill train patient 's leg guide robotic device accord preprogrammed gait pattern . A computer-controlled robotic gait orthosis guide patient , process gait training automate . Lokomat use give non ambulatory patient intensive practice term high repetition , complex gait cycle reduce effort therapist , long need set paretic limb assist trunk movement . The main objective present study compare effect exoskeleton device use electromechanical-assisted gait training stroke compare ground conventional physical therapy single blind research . The second objective research device use best chance success functional recovery gait people unable walk independently stroke .</detailed_description>
