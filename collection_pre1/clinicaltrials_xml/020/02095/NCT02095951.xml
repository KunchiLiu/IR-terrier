	<detailed_description>The study team compare hospital length stay ( LOS ) attributable length stay ( ALOS , LOS attributable CRI ) , randomize , un-blinded prospective trial utilize short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy ( ELT ) ( 4 hour 24 hour dwell time per day , repeat 72 hour ) place within 24 hour admission ( Group 1 , Preemptive ELT ) versus ELT place time first positive blood culture report ( Group 2 , Rescue ELT ( Standard Care ) .

ALOS define number hospital day first symptom CRI ( date admission admit symptom ) first negative blood culture . Aim 1 : Compare two different treatment regimen CRI use ELT ( preemptive ELT vs. standard care ) way prospective , randomize , two-arm study . Study Hypothesis : The main hypothesis short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy , define , place within 24 hour symptoms/admission ( Arm 1 ) versus ELT placement time first positive blood culture report ( Arm 2 ) , concomitant systemic antibiotic , treatment CRI ( suspect proven ) blood child central catheter H/O/BMT population shorter hospital length stay ( LOS ) attributable LOS ( ALOS ) therefore low hospital cost . Aim 2 : Compare sterilization rate infect intravascular device ethanol-lock therapy ( define negative blood culture obtain infected catheter 24 - 72 hour ELT ) central catheter salvage rate CRI use ELT two study arm . If central catheter salvage clinical use , recurrence infection ( re-infection ) central catheter 28 day date first ELT procedure also assess . Aim 3 : Assess tolerability adverse effect ELT ( safety ) . Aim 4 : Perform sub-group analysis BSI episodes meeting National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) criteria laboratory confirm central line associate BSI ( CLABSI ) three category Criteria 1 , 2 3 within pediatric</detailed_description>
