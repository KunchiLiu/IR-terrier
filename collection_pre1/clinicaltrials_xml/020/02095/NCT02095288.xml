	<detailed_description>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , selective inhibition cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 , alleviate pain inflammation suppress COX-2-derived prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 ( 1 ) . However , eight placebo-controlled clinical trial reveal NSAIDs , design inhibit specifically COX-2 , predispose patient increase cardiovascular risk include myocardial infarction , stroke , systemic pulmonary hypertension , congestive heart failure , sudden cardiac death ( 1-3 ) . The cardiovascular adverse effect attributable suppression COX-2-derived PGI2 , potent vasodilator inhibitor platelet activation ( 4 ; 5 ) . Our laboratory show global deletion , selective inhibition mutation COX-2 , deletion receptor PGI2 elevate blood pressure accelerate thrombogenesis mouse model ( 6 ) . We demonstrate vascular COX-2 deletion predisposes mice thrombosis hypertension ( 7 ) , selective deletion COX-2 cardiomyocytes lead cardiac dysfunction enhance susceptibility induce arrhythmogenesis ( 8 ) may contribute heart failure cardiac arrhythmia report patient take NSAIDs specific inhibition COX-2 . This cardiovascular hazard NSAIDs prompt interest microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 ( mPGES-1 ) alternative drug target . mPGES-1 inducible PG terminal synthase act downstream COX-2 catalyzes conversion intermediate COX endoperoxide product PGH2 PGE2 ( 9 ) . We previously report similar interference COX-2 expression function , global cell-specific deletion mPGES-1 suppresses PGE2 production ; unlike COX-2 , global mPGES-1 deficiency augments biosynthesis PGI2 predispose normo- hyperlipidemic mouse thrombogenic hypertensive event ( 9-11 ) . Both suppression PGE2 augmentation PGI2 mPGES-1-/- mouse result rediversion accumulate PGH2 substrate PGI2 synthase ( 10 ) . Furthermore , global deletion mPGES-1 limit vascular proliferative response wire injury ( 12 ) , retard atherogenesis suppresses angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm formation hyperlipidemic mouse ( 10 ; 13 ) . We also show mPGES-1-deficiency affect ozone-induced airway inflammation airway hyper-responsiveness suggest pharmacological inhibition mPGES-1 endoperoxide rediversion PGD2 may predispose patient risk airway dysfunction ( 14 ) . In addition , study others indicate global deletion mPGES-1 reduces post-ischemic brain infarction neurological dysfunction cerebral ischemia/reperfusion mouse ( 15 ) . mPGES-1 deficiency also render mice less susceptible excessive inflammation hypersensitivity rodent model analgesia ( 16 ; 17 ) . Taken together , finding suggest pharmacological inhibition mPGES-1 may retain anti-inflammatory effect PGE2 suppression , due PGI2 augmentation , target mPGES-1 might avoid cardiovascular risk associate selective COX-2 inhibitor . PGH2 substrate rediversion consequent mPGES-1 deletion ubiquitous event observe cellular level systemically ( urinary prostaglandin metabolite ) ; profile rediversion product , however , varies cell tissue type , disease model , extent system perturbation ( 6 ; 10-14 ; 18-21 ) . We show mice deficient mPGES-1 endothelial cell ( EC ) vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) , PGI2 predominant substrate rediversion product , whereas deletion mPGES-1 myeloid cell result shunt PGH2 mostly towards TxA2 ( 11 ) . Functionally , mice lack mPGES-1 myeloid cell , exhibit poor response vascular injury implicate myeloid mPGES-1 cardiovascular drug target . Therefore , cell-specific mPGES-1 deletion lead differential pattern substrate rediversion may affect biological function system , thus complicate drug development . What unknown whether genetic deletion pharmacological inhibition mPGES-1 directly ( substrate rediversion ) indirectly ( effect prostaglandin rediversion product enzyme expression metabolism transcellular product ( 22 ) ) influence lipidome beyond prostaglandin pathway functional consequence . For example , disruption AA-PGE2 metabolism might influence arachidonate product formation cytochrome P450 ( 23 ; 24 ) , leukotriene , anandamide , 2-arachidonylglycerol ( 2-AG ) cascade ( 25 ) . At cellular level , mPGES-1-/- macrophage , pretreated LPS stimulate arachidonic acid ( AA ) , exhibit 5-fold increase 12-HHT ( 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid ) , indicate substrate rediversion towards thromboxane A synthase ( 18 ) . Inhibition deletion COX-2 report augment metabolite 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) pathway 5-HETE ( 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ) leukotrienes LTB4 , LTC4 , LTD4 ( 26-28 ) , metabolites CYP450 cascade 14,15-DHET/EET ( dihydroxyeicosatrienoic/epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ) ( 26 ) . Therefore , substrate AA may shunt one pathway particular branch cascade pharmacologically inhibit genetically ablate . Here , conduct broad-spectrum lipidomics screen anti-inflammatory drug drug candidate antagonize receptor ( LTC4 , LTB4 , EP4 receptor ) inhibit specific component ( COX-1 , COX-2 , mPGES-1 , 5-KO , FLAP , LTA4A ) arachidonic acid pathway vitro human whole-blood assay ( hWBA ) . Healthy , non-smoking , male female volunteer ask donate blood . Human whole blood assay include ( ) determination baseline lipid level various time point stimulate whole blood , ( ii ) measurement lipid pre-stimulated whole blood treat single intervention compound , ( iii ) quantitation lipid pre-stimulated whole blood treat combination intervention compound . We expect compounds focus affect various inflammatory pathway result new pattern substrate rediversion measurement previously unknown lipid product .</detailed_description>
