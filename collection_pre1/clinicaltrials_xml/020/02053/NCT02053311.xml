	<brief_title>Orteronel Maintenance Therapy Patients With mCRPC Previously Treated With Novel Hormonal Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background One six men diagnose cancer prostate lifetime . Accordingly , prostate cancer common cancer amongst men western world . In Switzerland approx . 5'400 men diagnose disease 1'300 die prostate cancer every year . Prostate cancer represent 30 % cancer diagnose men . Despite early detection new treatment life time risk die prostate cancer remain stable 3 % since 1980 . In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( progression antihormonal therapy ) primary standard therapy long time consist chemotherapy docetaxel . It recently show treatment novel androgen synthesis blocker , abiraterone ( Zytiga ) chemotherapy prolong survival . Abiraterone belong group agent effectively inhibit androgen synthesis via blockade key enzyme cytochrome P-450c17 ( CYP17 ) .Similar result report new androgen antagonist enzalutamide ( Xtandi ) . Today , therefore , many patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) first receive therapy abiraterone enzalutamide . After , chemotherapy docetaxel ( Taxotere ) cabazitaxel ( Jevtana ) usually administer progression disease . After end chemotherapy , patient regularly check , event disease progression , treatment may give . These could consist renew hormonal therapy chemotherapy cabazitaxel . Besides abiraterone , medicine orteronel also act block testosterone production via key enzyme CYP17 . By selectively inhibit extragonadal synthesis androgens either adrenal cortex prostate tumor cell , orteronel , selective non-steroidal CYP17 inhibitor , may represent new therapeutic option patient CRPC . Initial result show orteronel effectively inhibit testosterone synthesis . Hypothesis aim study Since various new option available treatment castration-resistant prostate cancer present , raise question order treatment best give . Initial result show cross-resistance could develop new kind hormone therapy abiraterone enzalutamide . There evidence suggest resistance hormone treatment could reversible result prior treatment chemotherapy . This study design investigate approach . It also intend investigate whether early use well-tolerated testosterone synthesis blocker orteronel patient mCRPC lead increase time progression disease . Trials examine advanced malignant disease lung cancer show initiate effective treatment earlier disease course end first-line chemotherapy ( call switch maintenance therapy ) beneficial term progression free survival ( PFS ) also overall survival ( OS ) . This may also hold true early administration antihormonal agent patient mCRPC . Patients already receive novel hormonal therapy follow chemotherapy taxane experience stabilization disease regimen include study . It also intend test whether treatment positive influence quality life patient . The aim trial test hypothesis use orteronel treatment immediately cessation chemotherapy taxane prolong event-free survival ( EFS ) , consequently maintain good quality life ( QL ) could eventually also improve overall survival group patient pretreated novel hormonal agent .</detailed_description>
