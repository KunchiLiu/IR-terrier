	<brief_summary>To test whether ready-to-use therapeutic food ( RUTF ) enrich polyunsaturated fatty acid ( RUTF-P ) effective treatment severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) standard RUTF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study PUFA-optimized RUTF Severe Acute Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2007 , RUTF recommend treatment SAM . RUTF conducive growth bacteria low moisture content , require cooking , lead great recovery rate liquid milk formulation direct comparison . One expect benefit RUTF-P improve outcome due high level essential fatty acid . The essential fatty acid profile ( i.e. , level omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid ) RUTF-P may important implication cognitive development child , especially infant , SAM consume food sole dietary source several week . In particular , excess omega-6 fatty acid ( source peanut corn oil ) minimum omega-3 fatty acid ( source like flax ) may fail support optimal cognitive development neural function . In prospective , double-blinded , randomize control clinical effectiveness trial , compare two RUTF product treatment SAM test effect two different RUTF product essential fatty acid status .</detailed_description>
