	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate alternate approach , involve use 3D puncture path overlay , access portal vein Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt ( TIPS ) procedure . The study determine alternate approach provide benefit : improve safety procedure , reduce intervention time ( include reduction radiation exposure ) , benefit interventional radiologist patient . During TIPS procedure , shunt stent ( mesh tube ) pass jugular vein ( vein collarbone neck ) use fluoroscopy ( x-ray ) guidance . The shunt insert portal vein ( vein carry blood digestive organ liver ) hepatic vein ( vein carry blood away liver back heart ) . In standard approach , interventional radiologist use two-dimensional guidance ( 2D - dimension height width ) locate path portal vein hepatic vein . However , since two vein connect , method provide information three-dimensional ( 3D ) relationship two vein . In alternate approach , physician option use 3D guidance locate path . An on-table limited ( small field view ) CT scan , used combination FDA approve image software , provide 3D image demonstrate relationship portal vein hepatic vein . The 3D image overlaid standard live x-ray image assist needle guidance TIPS procedure . The CT scan perform place angiogram typically perform . However , portal vein adequately see CT image , angiogram do overlay . The procedure proceed use standard approach .</brief_summary>
