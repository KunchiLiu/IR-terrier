	<brief_summary>Narrowing coronary artery interfere blood flow cause chest pain . But patient may one narrow study show narrowing need treat . To identify narrowing need treat cardiologist sometimes quantify extent narrow measure fractional flow reserve ( FFR , ratio pressure aorta pressure downstream narrow ) .This technique require administration drug add cost time procedure country simply unavailable . As result despite clear health healthcare cost benefit FFR use limit less 5 % procedure . We develop new technique call instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR ) require administration drug accurate assessment . It approve use indication . This study aim compare clinical outcome patient whose treatment guide iFR whose treatment guide FFR . If iFR find provide clinical outcome FFR adoption permit clear benefit approach identify coronary narrowing really need treatment applicable much large patient population improve healthcare cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Patients one coronary stenosis , physiological severity coronary angiography question , randomise 1:1 use instantaneous wave free ratio ( iFR ) fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) guide treatment strategy percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Aims : To assess whether iFR non-inferior FFR use guide treatment coronary stenosis PCI . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint major adverse cardiac event rate iFR FFR group 30 day , 1 , 2 , 5 year . Population : This international multi-centre study 2500 patient . From population estimate , 35 % total study population present stable angina 65 % acute coronary syndrome . Eligibility : Patients eligible physiological severity stenosis within vessel question . In case stable angina confine target vessel , acute coronary syndrome assessment make non-culprit vessel . Duration : Anticipated recruitment 12 month . Follow-up perform 30 day , 1 , 2 5 year . Results : Primary outcome result report Spring 2017 .</detailed_description>
