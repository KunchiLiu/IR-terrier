	<brief_summary>The aim randomize double-blind placebo control study ass whether vitamin D supplementation improve control South African child persistent asthma academic hospital . The following hypothesis test : Vitamin D significantly directly correlate poor control persistent asthma ; Daily vitamin D supplementation six month result improve control persistent asthma compare placebo . It intend enroll 100 child age 6 12 year persistent asthma inhaled therapy . The sample size calculation base hypothesis vitamin D supplementation result 25 % improvement asthma symptom measure Asthma Treatment Assessment Questionnaire ( ATAQ ) peak flow reading . The child randomize one two group ; one group give 1200 IU vitamin placebo . The vitamin D placebo give morning daily child six month . The child assess monthly study physician , evaluate sign poor asthma control e.g . persistent cough recurrent wheezing . The height weight peak expiratory flow meter reading also obtain monthly six month . Blood sample take Vitamin D level , calcium , phosphorus level baseline , third month end study . All enrol child require produce tablet container pill count monthly basis ensure adherence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some study demonstrate link Vitamin D deficiency poor asthma control . Vitamin D show immune modulatory role play role improve response corticosteroid mainstay treatment persistent asthma . A randomized double-blind placebo control study perform ass whether vitamin D supplementation improve control South African child persistent asthma academic hospital . The researcher intend enroll 100 child age 6 12 year persistent asthma inhaled therapy . The child enrol pediatric outpatient department Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital , Pretoria , South Africa . After enrolment , child randomize one two group ; one group 50 child give 1200 IU vitamin group 50 receive placebo . The sample size calculation base hypothesis vitamin D supplementation result 25 % improvement asthma symptom measure Asthma Treatment Assessment Questionnaire ( ATAQ ) peak flow reading . The follow group child exclude : child intermittent asthma symptom ; child whose caregiver refuse give sign informed consent ; child able use peak expiratory flow meter concomitant chronic respiratory and/or cardiac condition . The vitamin D placebo give morning daily child six month . The date child first diagnose asthma note , well date asthma treatment initiation , current treatment enrolment record . The child ask come hospital follow monthly interval . At monthly visit , child evaluate sign symptom poor asthma control study physician . The height weight child measure peak expiratory flow meter reading also obtain monthly six month . Blood sample take Vitamin D level , calcium , phosphorus level baseline , third month end study . Treatment adherence assess count pill container study physician monthly visit . All enrol child require produce tablet container pill count . Data analyze use IBM SPSS Statistics program . Analysis variance perform order compare difference ATAQ score peak flow meter read baseline six month post intervention two group ( vitamin D placebo ) .</detailed_description>
