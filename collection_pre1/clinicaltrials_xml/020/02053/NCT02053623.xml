	<brief_summary>Approximately one billion people suffer hypertension worldwide . At least 10 % population , , 100 million people , also suffer associated chronic condition namely , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , obesity , arterial stiffness ( AS ) , heart failure ( HF ) . Personal interaction medical practitioner ( doctor ) review publish clinical research confirm current non-invasive automatic blood pressure ( BP ) monitor rely BP pulse analysis alone provide accurate measurement due unpredictable/weak nature BP pulse above-mentioned chronic condition . Lack accuracy BP estimation lead wrong diagnosis hence complication stoke heart attack . The Sponsor develop novel non-invasive BP monitor similar exist automatic monitor yet capable acquire analyze electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data conjunction BP pulse data provide good accurate measurement chronic condition . The objective clinical trial evaluate performance ECG-assisted BP monitor invasive BP measurement small group patient suffer condition .</brief_summary>
