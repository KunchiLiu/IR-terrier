	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop evaluate adaptive goal set feedback intervention ( Adaptive Interventions ) promote physical activity behavior compare static physical activity intervention ( Static Interventions ) use two level goal setting ( Adaptive Goals vs. Static Goals ) two level reinforcement procedure ( Praise/Rewards No Praise/Rewards ) 2 x 2 factorial randomize controlled trial . All four group receive intervention via semi-automated text message system develop investigator study team . The primary aim study : 1 . Evaluate whether adaptive intervention result great change physical activity ( pedometer-measured steps/day ) compare static Intervention group . HYPOTHESES : Participants adaptive intervention increase steps/day participant Static Intervention group . The Adaptive Goals Reinforcement Group outperform 3 group . The secondary aim study : 2 . Evaluate effectiveness adaptive static goal intervention improve anthropometric , cardiovascular fitness , cardiometabolic risk factor . HYPOTHESES : Participants adaptive intervention show great improvement fitness , lean fat body mass , serum biomarkers participant Static Intervention group . The Adaptive Goals Reinforcement Group outperform 3 group . 3. assess participant ' satisfaction overall program .</brief_summary>
