	<brief_summary>Evidence suggest vitamin D may directly indirectly co-factor efficacy Hepatitis C virus , ( HCV ) , antiviral therapy . The level vitamin D necessary optimum immune function ill define many HCV infection Scotland level . Vitamin D cheap safe medication , addition anti-viral therapy highly cost-effective even modest increase SVR achieve . Given Scottish HCV epidemic , world lead government response nationally low vitamin D level , Scotland perfectly place answer question . Therefore investigator hypothesize vitamin D supplementation improve SVR propose randomise control trial test hypothesis . The anticipated end study date study April 2015</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Vitamin D Supplementation Improve Hepatitis C Cure Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C major health problem Scotland great 1 % population infect ; Scottish Government recognise mount Hepatitis C action plan , recognise world lead public health response epidemic . The key aim expand treatment access number patient cure HCV infection prevent patient develop complication cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . The success treatment HCV depend genotype measure Sustained Viral Response ( SVR ) . The SVR absence virus 24 week end treatment show cure infection . The FDA recently suggest SVR assess 12 week , clinical trial . Scotland equal mix genotype 1 &amp; 3 HCV infection accounting great 95 % infected . Treatment involve Pegylated Interferon injection weekly Ribavirin twice daily 6 month HCV genotype 3 infection , SVR 70 % . For genotype 1 infection treatment dual therapy addition protease inhibitor , treatment duration 6-12 month lead SVR rate 65-70 % . There increase number new pharmacological product advance development available clinician use , well increase efficacy , increase cost . So require clinician make treatment effective possible . Vitamin D traditionally associate bone health , definite deficiency cause osteomalacia make contribution osteoporosis . The traditional , currently use normal range Vitamin D base prevention bone disease . Recently controversially suggest low normal level vitamin D associate multiple disease state , include cancer , infection cardiovascular disease Additionally suggest many normal population Scotland vitamin D deficient . Other study show drug user , high risk group HCV infection similarly deficient level vitamin D. Studies suggest 92 % chronic liver disease vitamin D level deem acceptable physiologically maintain health . Some data available support role vitamin D supplementation treatment hepatitis C improve SVR rate . Several observational study find association low vitamin D level reduce SVR rate , additionally one study show association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) vitamin D bind protein treatment response . A small Israeli trial vitamin D supplementation HCV treatment show increased SVRs supplement , study number flaw include failure randomisation ( 13 ) . Additionally abstract letter report improve outcome vitamin D intervention . Biological mechanisms interaction vitamin D immune system explore . It show Vitamin D play role regulation innate immunity , macrophage function , cell mediate immunity Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) also express many effector cell immune system ; activate T B cell , macrophage monocyte act increase enhance phagocytic action interferon activity , also suggest vitamin D direct effect HCV . These give biological basis effect vitamin D success antiviral therapy . A randomised control trial , successful , require recruitment retention subject trial . HCV infection associate chaotic lifestyle might impair rate recruitment retention , although Scottish HCV clinical database audit clearly show , comer , routine HCV care Scotland match result randomise clinical trial . This pilot study also help determine recruitment retention rate large trial population .</detailed_description>
