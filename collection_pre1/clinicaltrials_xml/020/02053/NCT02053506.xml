	<brief_summary>Physical psychological stress military personnel train operational mission suppress immune function . Creating superficial skin wound via suction blister use detect change immune function . The goal research : 1 ) identify change immune function ( blood measure heal time skin wound ) response sleep restriction ; , 2 ) test influence multi-nutrient beverage healthy bacteria ( i.e. , probiotic ) immune function ( blood measure heal time skin wound ) response sleep restriction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical psychological stress Warfighters train operational mission suppress immune responsiveness . Skin wound heal model use detect change immune function . The goal research : 1 ) quantify impact operational stressor ( i.e. , sleep restriction ) suction blister immune response skin barrier restoration ; , 2 ) test influence nutrition intervention ( ) immune response skin barrier restoration consequent operational stressor . Research conduct laboratory environment use male female Soldiers human research participant detachment ( NSRDEC ) , NSRDEC and/or USARIEM . Recently , investigator lab assess test-retest reliability suction blister model create eight suction blister participant ' leave right forearm , sample blister fluid skin barrier restoration ( 12-06H ) , serve one control group ( Group 1 , N = 15 ) study describe herein . Participants study describe herein ( Groups 2-4 , n = ~60 ) expose ~50 hour sleep restriction , time eight suction blister induce one forearm immune responsiveness skin barrier restoration time record . Participants receive nutrition intervention ( Group 2 ) , immune-enhancing beverage additional protein ( 1.2 g protein per kg body weight versus 0.8 g protein per kg body weight ) ( Group 3 ) probiotic ( Group 4 ) , sleep restriction determine nutritional approach attenuate loss immune responsiveness . The result study provide insight whether nutritional supplementation approach confer immune recovery . The investigator hypothesize suction blister immune response ( 24 hour follow blister induction ) time skin barrier restoration degrade impose stress includes~50 hour wakefulness constrain living ; , diet supplement either protein multi-nutrient nutritional supplement OR probiotic attenuate decrement suction blister immune responsiveness ( 24 hour follow blister induction ) time skin barrier restoration response ~50 hour sustain wakefulness constrain living .</detailed_description>
