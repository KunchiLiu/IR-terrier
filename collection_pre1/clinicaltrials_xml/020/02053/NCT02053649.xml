	<brief_summary>Perinatal depression common serious mood disorder increase morbidity mortality new mother result poor infant/child outcome . Current therapy often fail produce recovery poorly tolerate many pregnant woman seek non-pharmacologic therapy forgo treatment non-pharmacologic option available . Expectant new mother suffer circadian rhythm disruption risk perinatal depression . This R34 Pilot Effectiveness Studies Services Research Grant seek test whether Integrated Chronotherapy ( IC ) intervention implement outpatient psychiatry set improve treatment outcome patient perinatal depression . IC multicomponent treatment consist bright light therapy , sleep phase advance , sleep stabilization/restriction target Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) construct circadian rhythm , sleep-wake behavior , social rhythm , arousal . We assess feasibility , safety , acceptability IC intervention perinatal depressin test treatment expectant mother diagnose major depressive disorder 3rd trimester pregnancy . We randomize patient either : ( ) usual care ( UC , n = 20 ) ( b ) IC+UC ( n = 20 ) . IC+UC pregnancy postpartum component administer via individualized case formulation approach tailor patient . After baseline assessment , IC prescribe 5 dedicated clinical visit : three 3rd trimester pregnancy 2 postpartum period . UC consist medication administer perinatal psychiatrist and/or psychotherapy . UC quantify group evaluate difference IC+UC UC group . Mood measure group blind clinician interview patient self-report . We assess safety profile IC intervention evaluation side effects/adverse event . Importantly , study also examine putative mechanism IC hypothesize work `` dose '' IC receive patient IC+UC group . All participant wear wrist actigraphy/light monitor continuously week 28-40 pregnancy postpartum week 2-6 assess light exposure sleep duration timing . Circadian phase ( measure salivary dim light melatonin onset ) measure baseline pregnancy ( ~30 week gestation ) , 36 week gestation , postpartum week 6 . This pilot allow u refine IC intervention future integration various clinical setting establish infrastructue large ( R01-scale ) trial , include measure acceptability IC among UC clinician implement web-based data collection facilitate data share plan R01 . Perinatal IC could major public health impact due high prevalence perinatal depression negative effect mother child . This project represent first step toward achieve goal , provide pilot data necessary prepare large scale intervention study focus provide non-pharmacologic therapy improve outcome woman perinatal depression .</brief_summary>
