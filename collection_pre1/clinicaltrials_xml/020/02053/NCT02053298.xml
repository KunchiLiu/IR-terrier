	<brief_summary>Glaucoma optic neuropathy main risk factor intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . The search variables involve glaucoma pathogenesis progression identify systemic ocular sign vascular dysfunction glaucoma patient , migraine , peripheral vasospasm , systemic hypotension cerebral microvascular ischemia . Ocular blood flow study use Color Doppler Imaging ( CDI ) technology demonstrate blood velocity increase vascular resistance ( RI ) exist patient compare healthy control . However , CDI examination provide far additional information , arterial pulsatility ( PI ) mean blood velocity ( MFV ) . While use decade study cerebral artery vasoreactivity , little known variable change glaucoma patient . We recently demonstrate variable use identify change normal vascular activity increase resistance . In glaucoma patient , cutpoint RI retrobulbar artery could determine beyond PI increase significantly . This sharp increase PI use indirect signal vessel 's ability buffer decrease perfusion pressure surpass . The normal response decrease perfusion vascular territory autoregulation increase dilation downstream microcirculation , increase cross section area attempt keep steady MFV . As PI calculate use vessel 's MFV [ PI = ( PSV-EDV ) /MFV ] , highly sensitive change variable . As , cutpoints identify glaucoma patient therefore indirect assessment vessel 's autoregulation limit . While data could provide rational RI value associate progression , clinical question arise whether cutpoints modulate topical glaucoma therapy . As medication carbonic anhydrase inhibitor find positive effect disease progression appear non-IOP related effect , consider hypothesis drug could positive impact ocular 's microcirculation vasoactive response , potentially enable keep steady MFV high value vascular resistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients recruit glaucoma clinic department Ophthalmology Leuven University Hospital . General study setup : Two cohort subject include study : primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) patient . At screen visit , eligible patient topical therapy replace timolol 0.5 % bid . At week 4 , dorzolamide 2 % added exist treatment fix combination therapy ( timolol 0.5 % +dorzolamide 2 % bid ) . A final visit week 8 . At screen visit ( day 0 ) , patient undergo complete ophthalmic investigation visual acuity , slit lamp biomicroscopy , tonometry , 90 D fundoscopy , automate perimetry , Heidelberg retinal tomography color Doppler imaging . Blood pressure also measure . Topical monotherapy replace timolol 0.5 % bid . At visit 1 2 ( timolol - week 4 , timolol+dorzolamide week 8 , respectively ) , patient undergo ophthalmic investigation visual acuity , slit lamp biomicroscopy , tonometry , 90 D fundoscopy , blood pressure measurement color Doppler imaging . Only one eye select study ( eye worst glaucomatous damage ) . Mann-Whitney test use pairwise comparison . Restricted cubic sp-lines use verify evidence nonlinearity relation RI PI . Piecewise linear regression model use determine optimal cutpoint ( i.e . cutpoint yield high likelihood ) three visit ( baseline , timolol timolol/dorzolamide ) . Sensitivity analyse perform verify result due ( influential ) subject high RI value . All data express mean ± standard deviation . A two side p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Sample size calculation make address primary outcome ( i.e. , change RI cutpoints baseline last study visit ) overall glaucoma population ( POAG+NTG patient ) . Based previous results10 , set α error 5 % , power 80 % allowable difference 10 % would require recruitment 40 patient . Further post hoc analysis make identify difference two study cohort .</detailed_description>
