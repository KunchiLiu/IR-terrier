	<brief_title>Modulation Muscle Protein Synthesis With Diet Exercise Old Aged Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One factor play important role loss functional performance , , capacity maintain healthy , active lifestyle progressive loss skeletal muscle mass ageing ( i.e. , sarcopenia ) . Indeed , sarcopenia robust predictor functional status mortality elderly chronological age indeed , co-morbidity . Sarcopenia incipient process whereby lean muscle mass contribute ~50 % total body weight young adult decline ~25 % reach age 75-80 . Adequate nutritional intake , particular dietary protein , important offset age-related decline muscle mass . The aim project seek effective nutrition counteract sarcopenia , specifically woman .</detailed_description>
