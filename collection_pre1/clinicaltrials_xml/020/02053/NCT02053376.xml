	<brief_summary>As note , multiple pathway , include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , Ras , Raf , Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGFR ) appear involve cholangiocarcinoma tumor genesis . Overexpression proteins show associated tumor stage , prognosis , response therapy . However , therapy target single pathway show clear benefit . A number Phase 2 trial complete , underway , study agent target EGFR VEGF - monotherapy combination chemotherapy . These show varying increase response rate , find mark increase progression-free overall survival . This suggest inhibition multiple pathway simultaneously may need . Regorafenib , oral multikinase inhibitor target multiple tumor pathway , show effectiveness single agent multiple solid tumor . The primary objective clinical trial evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive regorafenib fail first-line chemotherapy . Patients advance metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma ( cholangiocarcinoma ) treat failed first-line chemotherapy treat regorafenib ( 160 mg ) orally daily 21 day ( 3 week ) 7 day ( 1 week ) 28-day ( 4-week ) cycle .</brief_summary>

Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg repeat measurement ) despite optimal medical management . Active clinically significant cardiac disease include : Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) &gt; Class II Active coronary artery disease . Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy beta blocker digoxin . Unstable angina ( angina symptom rest ) , newonset angina within 3 month randomization , myocardial infarction within 6 month randomization . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Any hemorrhage bleeding event ≥ Grade 3 within 4 week prior prior registration . Patients thrombotic , embolic , venous , arterial event , cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month study registration . Previous exposure Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor ( ) , Patients previously untreated concurrent cancer distinct primary site histology biliary tract cancer except cervical cancer insitu , treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor . Patients survive cancer curatively treat without evidence disease 3 year prior registration allow . All cancer treatment must complete least 3 year prior prior registration ) . Patients phaeochromocytoma . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection current chronic active hepatitis B C infection require treatment antiviral therapy .

Known suspected allergy hypersensitivity study drug class . Any malabsorption condition . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , make subject unsuitable trial participation . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition may interfere subject 's participation study evaluation study result . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) study treatment regorafenib . However , palliative external beam radiation therapy ( XRT ) nontargeted lesion allow . Prior use regorafenib .
