	<brief_title>Deep TMS Left Auditory Cortex Using HMCIPCC Coil , Treatment Patients With Tinnitus .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stages study : A . Patient recruitment stage : hearing test battery include : otoscopy , tympanometry , pure-tone audiometry - 0 20 dB HL ; 21 60 dB HL 60 dB HL , tinnitus matching , TQ VAS . B . Patients assign one two study group , Deep TMS leave auditory cortex Sham . . C. TMS Acute treatment phase : TMS treatment administer two week : 5 day week half hour . Before TMS treatment session , patient undergo train exercise design stimulate neural network associate attention process Monitoring evaluation treatment efficacy side effect perform daily basis . . The overall time session estimate 1 hour . D. TMS Maintenance phase : Four additional TMS treatment session administer weekly another 4 week . Long-term durability treatment effect assess 90 day last TMS session . E. TMS treatment program : 1 . The subject require use earplug minimize risk hearing impairment . 2 . Motor threshold stimulation intensity determine prior TMS session . . 3 . Subjects receive either active TMS sham treatment , depend experimental group assign . During first 2 week , five treatment session administer week . During follow 4 week , one treatment administer weekly . Overall , subject receive 16 TMS session 6 treatment week . F. Safety : Throughout trial subject constantly monitor physician . Any adverse effect subjective discomfort experience document addressed . Magnetic stimulation treatment administer operator train certified Brainsway . Subjects wish withdraw study free point . Drugs belong benzodiazepine class permit necessary daily dos equivalent 2 mg Lorazepam ( Lorivan ) .</detailed_description>
