	<brief_summary>Although majority child leukemia hematological malignancy ( Hodgkin 's Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) cure conventional chemotherapy , subset patient resistant/recurrent high-risk disease cure conventional treatment regimen . Investigators hypothesize HSCT partially match donor safe effective patient high risk hematologic malignancy combine post-transplant cyclophosphamide prevention graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haplo-identical SCT High Risk ( HR ) Hematologic Malignancies w/Post-Transplant In-Vivo T-cell Depletion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient whose disease bring remission prognosis worse primarily due high rate post-HSCT relapse . For patient poor donor option ( i.e. , lack adequately match allogeneic marrow donor ) , prognoses bad successful outcome due high rate treatment relate mortality ( TRM ) . Their option seek investigational treatment without HSCT alternative investigational HSCT protocol eligible . Patients relapse allogeneic HSCT high risk either relapse TRM subsequent HSCT , even additional state complete remission achieve prior subsequent HSCT . This current treatment protocol design assess alternative HSCT treatment patient refractory/very high risk disease feature and/or inadequate single source human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) - match -donor stem cell . The goal cure hematological malignancy combination chemotherapy potentially destruction cancerous cell new , donor immune cell . For patient whose potential cure allogeneic HSCT lack well match relative unrelated donor source , haplo-identical donor ( i.e. , `` half identical '' donor ) remain option . However , without form immune manipulation donor marrow ( e.g . pre-infusion vitro test tube/laboratory T-depletion , depletion donor T-cells ) , outcomes haplo-identical HSCT poor result unacceptable TRM , non-engraftment severe graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) 2 lead fatal complication . GVHD complication occur stem cell bone marrow transplant newly transplant donor cell attack healthy tissue transplant recipient 's body . Thus , good treat resistant leukemia , need either improved cytoreduction ( pre-transplant reduction number cancer/leukemia cell ) regimens refractory disease , and/or improved method eliminate cancer cell transplant occur . Using well match donor , investigator study use HSCT use mild chemotherapy exploit donor cell immune reaction post-stem cell infusion `` allow '' reaction leukemia lymphoma cancer cell . This generally proven ineffective patient disease remission time transplant . Thus new approach combat residual refractory disease still need . Also , patient lack well-matched donor , new method facilitate use haplo-identical donor need . Investigators hypothesize HSCT partially match ( haplo-identical ) relate ( usually sibling parent child ) donor safe effective patient high risk hematologic malignancy combine intensive , myeloablative ( marrow destroy ) cytoreduction treatment pre-HSCT follow post-transplant cyclophosphamide prevention Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) recipient . This approach employ center , primarily adult recipients.2-4 One center 's experience pediatric patient demonstrate non-relapse mortality low donor engraftment occur 12 12 patients.5 More experience approach need pediatric HSCT patient . In Pilot Study , investigator hope determine likelihood myeloablative cytoreduction regimen follow haplo-identical HSCT high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide lead adequate engraftment high-risk hematologic malignancy patient . The patient transplant study patient whose likelihood survival without transplant would low ( &lt; 10-15 % , whether due relapse prior HSCT , poor disease control , match donor available ) . This treatment protocol involve investigational drug combination chemotherapy drug new sequence/scheduling along use haplo-identical donor stem cell . In treatment protocol , patient treat three different stratum accord defines high-risk poor outcome . Each stratum comprise pre-transplant chemotherapy condition regimen follow infusion haplo-identical relate donor marrow stem cell , follow turn post-transplant cyclophosphamide immunosuppression prophylax GVHD . The chemotherapeutic agent study , include cyclophosphamide , routinely administer child adolescent treatment . Cyclophosphamide commonly administer component pre-transplant cytoreduction therapy . However , treatment protocol investigator plan assess ability utilizing combine approach chemotherapeutic agent , cyclophosphamide , effective prevention GVHD infuse receive transplant closely match ( identical ) family member . The common element research high-dose cytoreduction therapy prior HSCT , high-dose cyclophosphamide follow HSCT partially match , related donor bone marrow cell source stem cell infused transplantation . The research question outcome patient treat combination . The cytoreduction regimen tailor specific risk ( prior HSCT , poor disease control v match donor source stem cell ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must confirm diagnosis hematologic malignancy ( leukemia , lymphoma MDS ) following : Resistant/refractory hematologic malignancy ( disease exceed 5 % marrow cell morphology , description white blood cell type assess via light microscopy ; measurable extramedullary disease , detection leukemia sit blood marrow . This include disease infiltrates tissue spleen marrow . i.e . nodal disease , leukemia and/or lymphoma involve lymph node chloroma , collection leukemic cell form mass/tumor mass ) ( Stratum 1 ) . Or relapse follow initial allogeneic HSCT ( Stratum 1 ) . And/or lack adequately match unrelated donor ( URD ) unrelated cord blood ( URB ) hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) source ( see protocol section 2 ) ( Strata 1 , 2 &amp; 3 ) . Adequate cardiac , pulmonary , renal , hepatic function Central vascular access provide combine 3 access port patient . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior therapy . Pregnancy test do prior therapy . Sexually active patient inform risk use adequate contraception . Recipient legal guardian must inform study , sign consent form . Recipients must relate haploidentical donor . High risk hematologic malignancy remission ( prior allogeneic HSCT ) , allogeneic HSCT indicate appropriately match HSC source ( sibling , unrelated adult UCB ) available . Patients systemic infection and/or organ dysfunction mandating reduce intensity condition regimen also exclude .</criteria>
