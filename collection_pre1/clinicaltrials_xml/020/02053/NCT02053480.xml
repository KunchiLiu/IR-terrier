	<detailed_description>The purpose Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency ( PKD ) Natural History Study describe natural history PKD range incidence symptom , treatment , complication related PKD . The study collect retrospective medical history routine clinical care data baseline annually patient PKD . Patients without genetic diagnosis blood sample drawn genetic diagnostic confirmation research purpose . Understanding clinical variation among participant PKD , assess treatment specific PKD outcome accelerate improvement care patient PKD . Understanding natural history PKD may useful design future interventional study . Detailed genotypic phenotypic characterization cohort allow continue depth characterization PKD . Finally , PKD Natural History Study identify interested participant future PKD study . Primary Objectives : 1 . To estimate transfusion burden splenectomized non-splenectomized participant PKD . 2 . To establish patient registry potential source recruitment future research study PKD . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine patient-reported outcome , include quality life fatigue scale , associate age , genotype , hemoglobin nadir , and/or transfusion burden , overall within subgroup splenectomized vs. non-splenectomized participant ; 2 . To describe change time range hemoglobin value marker hemolysis within individual participant among participant PKD ; 3 . To estimate incidence past splenectomy annual splenectomy rate , treatment PKD ; 4 . To estimate prevalence severity describe treatment hepatic cardiac iron overload complication PKD ( liver , cardiac , growth defect , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , endocrine defect ) . To describe change complication may occur time age group ; 5 . To estimate prevalence co-morbidities associate chronic hemolysis PKD , identify co-morbidities common , determine prevalence and/or severity co-morbidities change time age time first appearance co-morbidity ; 6 . To determine pregnancy outcome among participant PKD ; 7 . To describe genotypic phenotypic variation among participant explore genotype-phenotype correlation PKD .</detailed_description>
