	<brief_summary>This study aim assess responsiveness change adventitious lung sound ( ALS ) patient low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) . Patients recruited central Hospital demographic anthropometric data , lung sound , lung function , breathlessness , oxygen saturation chest HRCT scan collect within 24h first appointment . Then , patient randomly allocate either conventional treatment conventional treatment plus respiratory physiotherapy . Conventional treatment consist daily medical treatment prescribe physician . Respiratory physiotherapy involve 9 session ( 3 time week 2 week ) breathe retrain chest clearance technique , exercise thoracic mobility , expansion flexibility , cardiorespiratory exercise training education disease . It expect ALS responsive change patient ' lung function treatment . It also expect , include respiratory physiotherapy component treatment patient LRTI , express improvement short period time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Respiratory problem significant burden patient age suffer different pathology respective family , enormous economic cost . Thus , respiratory therapy , physical ( airway clearance therapy ) chemical ( medication inhalation therapy ) increase importance . However , little known effectiveness respiratory therapy due lack accuracy , reliability sensitivity current outcome measure use . Adventitious lung sound ( i.e. , wheeze crackle ) show objective , reliable measure sensitive indicator minor alteration airway geometry . Using wheeze ' crackle ' analysis , detection characterization severity lung disease may perform measure . However , study assess responsiveness change ALS never conduct deemed necessary ass ALS appropriate outcome measure overcome problem recognize clinical measure . Therefore main aim project ass interpret response lung sound respiratory intervention . To achieve aim , high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) , gold standard ass lung disease , perform . The specific aim study : 1. explore ALS indicator severity recovery lung disease compare acoustic data lung lung HRCT image measure i.e . breathlessness , oxygen saturation lung function data ) pre/post respiratory treatment ) ; 2. explore ALS data indicator sputum movement compare acoustic imaging analysis ; 3. explore respiratory physiotherapy effectiveness patient LTRI . The plan recruit approximately 100 voluntary patient LRTI attend casualty central hospital . This study enroll adult patient diagnose LRTI accord international guideline . The age pathology participant choose ) adult patient easy collaborate ; ii ) characterization base ALS adult patient allow future comparison ; iii ) pathology normally benefit medical respiratory physiotherapy treatment soon diagnose make , Portugal often receive respiratory physiotherapy . Furthermore , patient able cooperate data collection , namely image technique , fundamental ass responsiveness change measure . Patients recruit via physician , provide brief explanation study . Then , researcher contact interested participant provide detailed information obtain consent form . Patients ' agree participate randomly assign conventional treatment group conventional treatment plus respiratory physiotherapy group ( approximately 50 patient group ) . Baseline data collect within first 24 hour patient ' visit hospital . The researcher collect clinical information , socio-demographic , anthropometric , breathlessness peripheral oxygen saturation participant . A multi-channel system 7 microphone ( attached patient ' chest ) connect laptop use record lung sound data . Patients lie supine machine plinth HRCT scan chest acquire . Lung function exercise tolerance data record . Patients experimental group receive daily medical treatment respiratory physiotherapy 3 time week , 2 week ( average time treat LRTI ) . Respiratory physiotherapy consist breathe retrain chest clearance technique , exercise thoracic mobility , expansion flexibility , cardiorespiratory exercise training education disease . This program adjust individual need . After period measurement repeat . Furthermore , measure exception chest image also perform before/after respiratory physiotherapy session monitor intervention . Each session conduct property equipped room last approximately 60 minute . To identify change lung sound , statistical technique ( e.g . ALS , intra-class correlation coefficient , Bland Altmand 95 % limit agreement small real difference ) use . The relationship image sound explore define analytically quantitatively . To analyse change outcome measure , data two group compare baseline 3 week intervention . The data analysis undertaken use proprietary software package ( e.g.Matlab , SPSS ) include generation descriptive statistic , use exist custom routine hypothesis test signal processing analysis .</detailed_description>
