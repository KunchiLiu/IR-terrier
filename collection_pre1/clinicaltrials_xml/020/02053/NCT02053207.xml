	<detailed_description>Cognitive outcome remain poor cardiac surgery . Data field cognitive neuroscience suggest cognitive training , harness brain 's adaptive plasticity improve , maintain , restore function target area , use strengthen brain resilience improve cognitive outcome follow challenge . While effectiveness demonstrate old adult well ( nonsurgical ) patient population , train intervention like ever use surgical patient preoperative period . The purpose study evaluate feasibility administer 20-day cognitive training intervention ( Cog-Train ) widely inclusive sample cardiac surgical patient surgery . Data obtain used design full-scale randomise control trial ( RCT ) Cog-Train 's effectiveness improve postoperative cognitive outcome .</detailed_description>
