	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Main study inclusion criterion : For previously treat subject , either : Completed CSLsponsored rIXFP ( CSL654 ) study , include study CSL654_3001 [ NCT01496274 ] study CSL654_3002 [ NCT01662531 ] . Or : Scheduled major nonemergency surgery within approximately 8 week anticipate date receive first rIXFP injection . Not previously complete CSLsponsored rIXFP leadin study . Male , 12 70 year age . Documented severe hemophilia B ( FIX activity ≤ 2 % ) , confirm screening central laboratory . Subjects receive FIX product ( plasmaderived / recombinant FIX ) &gt; 150 exposure day ( EDs ) , confirm treat physician . No confirmed history FIX inhibitor formation screen central laboratory For previously untreated subject : Male , 18 year age . Documented severe hemophilia B ( FIX activity ≤ 2 % ) , confirm screening central laboratory . Never previously treat FIX clot factor product ( except previous exposure blood component ) . No confirmed history FIX inhibitor formation Surgery substudy inclusion criterion : Must require nonemergency surgery Exclusion criterion : Main study exclusion criterion : Currently receive therapy permit study . Any issue , opinion investigator , would render subject unsuitable participation study . For subject previously complete CSLsponsored rIXFP study : Unwilling participate study total 100 exposure day . For subject require major nonemergency surgery previously complete CSLsponsored rIXFP leadin study : Known hypersensitivity ( ie , allergic reaction anaphylaxis ) FIX product hamster protein . Known congenital acquire coagulation disorder congenital FIX deficiency . Currently receive IV immunomodulating agent immunoglobulin chronic systemic corticosteroid treatment . Low platelet count , kidney liver disease . Human immunodeficiency virus positive CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 . For previously untreated subject : Known congenital acquire coagulation disorder congenital FIX deficiency ( except vitamin K deficiency newborn ) . Known kidney liver dysfunction condition , investigator 's opinion , place patient unjustifiable risk . The surgical substudy additional exclusion criterion , although subject ( ) France eligible surgery substudy .</criteria>
