	<brief_summary>An Early Supported Discharge ( ESD ) service stroke evidence base intervention aim enable particular group patient mild moderate stroke discharge hospital early receive intensity rehabilitation home . Analysis almost 1600 patient demonstrate ESD reduce long term dependency , decrease admission institutionalize care well shorten hospital stay . This model also show reduce death institutionalize care five year ( Fjaetoft et al , 2011 ) show cost effective ( Saka , 2005 . ) A study National Heath Service ( NHS ) London show patient outcomes affected treat home increase readmission due set ESD service . However , moderate severe stroke often eligible ESD rehabilitation . This study aim offer twenty Camden resident Enhanced Early Supported Discharge service stroke survivor moderate severe impairment eligible . Participants recruit University College London Hospital ( UCLH ) l Hyper Acute Stroke Unit acute stroke unit UCLH Royal Free Hospital . This study compare health economic outcome early Multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation community compare traditional inpatient community Multidisciplinary rehabilitation people moderate severe post stroke impairment . We also collect view participant carers regard treat home . The objective discover : 1 . What impact implementation Enhanced ESD service stroke survivor moderate severe impairment clinical cost outcome compare unchanged care pathway neighbour borough ? 2 . What staff , participant carer view experience Enhanced ESD service ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Control Group The control group comprise eligible register GP London borough Islington . Islington resident choose control group currently ESD service patient refer . Rehabilitation therefore take place inpatient community follow . The borough Camden Islington comparable term ethnic diversity , size , stroke prevalence age ( SEPHO , 2013 . ) The control group match demographic age gender due fact unable predict information . We gather information regard type stroke , stroke severity demographic compare much possible analysis . Consent obtain collect outcome measure data control group carer 's . Local agreement place share anonymised data purpose research . The data collect staff Acute Stroke Units link individual within Islington Community Services . The outcome measure collect currently collect along stroke pathway London . The Caregiver Strain Index EQ5D routinely collect . A similar number patient identify timescale research group subject battery outcome due standardisation across stroke pathway London hospital . Local agreement meet regard six month review outcome . Data collect within five day post stroke , approximately nine week post stroke six month post stroke . Cost save The management acute stroke ACS revolutionise Camden last 5 year . Patients , identify transferred London Ambulance service UCLH Royal Free acute trust . Since centralisation Hyper Acute service , mortality morbidity condition drop ( Hunter et al , 2013 . ) The study include comprehensive assessment cost effectiveness include direct indirect health care cost social care cost . Locally Enhanced ESD service could release acute stroke resource free monies associate , improve access specialist stroke rehab people 's home ( thus improve patient choice ) thus compliance national guideline ( include RCP stroke guideline , 2012 . ) Bed day save HASU 's SU calculate term financial save . Actual therapy care cost calculate comparison . The rehabilitation care cost project £15,924 per patient £318,472 cohort 20 patient . The project set use predicted cost complex need stroke survivor spending four week acute stroke unit ( tariff £4,646 ) transfer inpatient rehabilitation 56 day cost £280 per day . This equate £20,326 per patient direct in-patient care cost . Although overall project cost study exceed figure , service cost would recurrent model deem clinically economically viable less .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only capacity consent admit study . • Patient must register Camden GP offer Enhanced ESD . Must register Camden Islington GP collection analysis routine data . Patient must eighteen year old Patient confirm diagnosis stroke Stroke Consultant Patient consent provide ( assistance give speech language therapist stroke survivor significant language communication impairment ) ; Patient medically stable fit manage home assess Acute Stroke Consultant part MDT . This include utilisation measure NHISS score GCS determine medical status patient . The criterion make decision define Community Care ( Delayed Discharges ) Act , 2003 : A clinical decision make patient ready transfer AND multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) decision make patient ready transfer AND patient safe discharge/transfer . Patient intend return home support accommodation follow hospital stay ( line current ESD guidance ; ) Patient safe transfer home provision equipment ( e.g . Hospital bed , chair , telecare device etc . ) care package require . This mean least follow conduct prior discharge appropriate home visit risk assessment , manual handling risk assessment , cognitive assessment ( e.g . mental capacity assessment form ( provided referral ) safety awareness ) ; Patient active nursing / therapy goal potential participate respond rehabilitation / disability management programme ; Toileting need manage within available care , support and/or equipment ( commode , pad bottle ) either point discharge home within ≤ 2 week return home ; Patient able transfer assistance 2 people and/or equipment ; Patient 's dysphagia , nutrition hydration safely manage community , assess stroke consultant and/or medical team responsible individual 's hospital care , ward nurse staff , Enhanced ESD nurse , refer receive SLTs dietitian . Risk malnutrition assess MDT use standardised nutritional screening tool ( eg MUST ) . Patient fail Mental Capacity Act Assessment ( 2005 ) deem capacity consent participation study . Patient medically fit manage home ( medical exclusion criterion see Appendix 2 ) ; Patient able engage respond rehabilitation programme , example , significant cognitive impairment / behavioural problem limit ability effectively engage rehabilitation ; Patient safe transfer home despite provision equipment care package Patient require help 2 person transfer , and/or sufficient space within home safely accommodate equipment ( hoist ) require safe discharge Clients require constant supervision 24 hour anticipate resolve within seven day . The need supervision may secondary impaired concentration/attention/safety awareness/impulsivity/visual impairment/reduced insight/severe aphasia/need prompt hand assistance maintain safety standing , transfer wash etc . Clients whose prognosis functional improvement poor functional goal achieve within 8 week . Not able manage medication carers dispense blister pack prompt client take medication . Patients whose normal place residence Nursing Residential home . This cohort patient likely ongoing long term issue whose need best met via community pathway long term rehabilitation need . Patients NasoGastric tube situ therefore establish nutrition . Those long term PEGs exclude nutritional need meet nonorally .</criteria>
