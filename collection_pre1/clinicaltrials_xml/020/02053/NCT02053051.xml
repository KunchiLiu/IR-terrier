	<brief_summary>This study aim assess safety efficacy novel advance bolus calculator subject Type 1 diabetes . Insulin bolus calculator develop aid insulin dose adjustment exist standard insulin bolus calculator consist simple algorithm require five subject-specific parameter input generate recommend bolus insulin dose : - current blood glucose ( mmol/L ) - target blood glucose ( mmol/L ) - insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio ( grams carbohydrate per 1 unit insulin ) - total grams carbohydrate meal - insulin sensitivity factor ( reduction glucose per 1 unit insulin ) The Diabetes Technology team Imperial College develop novel advanced bolus calculator . The complete integrated system consist commercially available smartphone hold novel advanced algorithm . The system require regular update case derive retrospective blind continuous glucose monitoring data commercially available glucose sensor use . Each new case include information problem ( e.g . capillary blood glucose , meal information physical exercise ) , solution ( recommended insulin dose ) outcome ( blood glucose follow meal ) . The novel decision support algorithm base case-based reasoning ( CBR ) . CBR artificial intelligence technique try solve newly encounter problem apply solution learn solve problem encounter past . The end-product therefore subject specific insulin bolus calculator continue improve time . The project utilise commercially available glucose sensor smartphones ( iPhone ) , integrate novel algorithm insulin bolus calculation . The aim ABC4D minimise high low glucose excursion associate complication diabetes include blindness , kidney failure , nerve damage cardiovascular disease . The clinical study design incrementally assess device 's ability manage meal time insulin requirement breakfast lunch control supervise clinical environment 8 hour ( phase 1 ) , follow use home environment 6 week period ( phase 2 ) finally 6 month period ( phase 3 ) .</brief_summary>
