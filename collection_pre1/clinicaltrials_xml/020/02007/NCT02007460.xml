	<brief_summary>Osteoporotic fracture extremely common serious public health issue contribute substantially pain , impaired mobility morbidity elderly . Declines bone strength combine increase risk fall ( associated decline muscular function age ) main determinant fracture risk . Exercise novel involves impact load potential improve bone strength neuromuscular function ( strength , power balance ) . It thus imperative evaluate potential benefit exercise old people . The musculoskeletal response exercise may also influence vitamin D status . It purpose study consider influence one year unilateral ( one limb ) high impact exercise programme musculoskeletal health , specifically bone structure , muscle strength power older caucasian men . It also purpose study determine whether differs accord vitamin D status . The finding reveal whether exercise improve bone health and/or neuromuscular function , whether improvement dependent upon vitamin D status .</brief_summary>
