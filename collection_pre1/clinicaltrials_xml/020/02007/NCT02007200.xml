	<brief_title>Soy Isoflavones Preventing Head Neck Cancer Recurrence Patients With Stage I-IV Head Neck Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine short term , preoperative ( 300 mg/day x 14 treatment day ) soy isoflavone supplementation modulates p16 methylation ( % CpG sit methylated ) expression p16 , cyclooxygenase 2 [ COX-2 ] , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ VEGF ] , epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] , interleukin-6 [ IL6 ] , p53 B-cell lymphoma-extra large [ Bcl-xL ] tumor non-tumor adjacent mucosa patient head neck squamous carcinoma undergo curative tumor resection . II . To estimate correlation tumor p16 methylation ( % CpG sit methylated ) expression p16 level , IL6 , VEGF , 15-F2t-isoprostane serum saliva . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe toxicity short-term , preoperative treatment soy isoflavone . II . To determine overall relapse-free survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive soy isoflavones orally ( PO ) approximately 14 day undergo surgery . After completion treatment , patient follow , within routine cancer management schedule , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
