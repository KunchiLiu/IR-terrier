	<brief_summary>Patients sickle cell disease many number systemic complication , include liver problem . Some liver problem lead liver fibrosis/cirrhosis , secondary chronic blood transfusion . The purpose study investigate FibroScan reading patient sickle cell disease iron overload secondary blood transfusion , correlate FibroScan result Ferriscan . A comparison result FibroScan patient Sickle cell without know liver disease , never chronic transfusion normal liver function profile also made.The primary hypothesis result FibroScan correlate result Ferriscan liver biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver biopsy gold standard examine liver iron deposit histology . However , liver biopsy invasive involves risk bleed pain . Biopsy may also miss significant pathology small biopsy specimen take uninvolved part liver . Non-invasive technique MRI use evaluate liver iron content . MRI visualize whole liver measure liver iron content . MRI , however , detect liver scar . Liver transient elastography ( FibroScan ) non-invasive ultrasound tool assess liver fibrosis scar measure liver stiffness ( LSM ) . Compared liver biopsy , FibroScan provide immediate result painless , short ( 3 min ) , simple procedure perform . In study FibroScan report correlate well liver biopsy result fibrosis cirrhosis , Ferriscan , ferritin liver function test . This purpose study investigate role FibroScan individual sickle cell anemia iron overload diagnosis liver disease , compare FibroScan reading magnetic resonance imaging . We also compare result Fibroscan liver biopsy . This study also compare result FibroScan patient Sickle cell without know liver disease , never chronic transfusion ( define 4 transfusion lifetime ) normal liver function profile .</detailed_description>
