	<brief_summary>The aim propose controlled clinical trial evaluate effect photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) formation volatile sulfur compound ( VSCs ) coat tongue action severity halitosis adolescent use different treatment protocol . HYPOTHESIS 1 . - Null hypothesis : There change halitosis follow use photodynamic therapy . 2 . - Experimental hypothesis : There reduction halitosis follow use photodynamic therapy alone combination tongue scraper .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Halitosis ( bad breath ) term use describe unpleasant odor emanate mouth could originate oral cavity result systemic factor . Halitosis common problem affect population worldwide cause mainly volatile sulfur compound produce anaerobic Gram-negative microorganism oral cavity sulfur-containing substrates oral cavity . On dorsum tongue , volatile sulfur compound produce metabolism hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , methyl mercaptan ( CH3SH3 ) dimethyl sulfide ( CH3-S-CH3 ) . The concentration gas use indicator severity halitosis . Recently , Gram positive anaerobic bacterium Solobacterium moorei ( formerly know Bulleidia moorei ) also associate oral malodor volatile sulfur compound production , particularly hydrogen sulfide presence different supplement amino acid specifically cysteine , wich agree study show cysteine challenge vivo vitro model analyze production hydrogen sulfide . The measure volatile sulfur compound perform organoleptic evaluation air emanate oral cavity gas chromatography use sulfide monitor , Halimeter ( Interscan Corporation ) , determine amount volatile sulfur compound part per billion ( ppb ) exhale air . Gas chromatography appropriate mean detect halitosis different origin . In 2004 , Oral ChromaTM ( Abilit Corporation ) develop Japan individual measurement three main gas ( hydrogen sulfide , methyl mercaptan dimethyl sulfide ) , allow evaluation intensity origin halitosis . Light , either alone combination chemical compound , use therapeutic antimicrobial effect . Photodynamic therapy encompass simultaneous action light source photosensitizing agent presence oxygen tissue . Individually , substance innocuous , interaction capable give rise cytotoxic specie lead cell death.The advantage approach avoidance development resistance part target bacteria damage adjacent tissue , since antimicrobial effect confine area cover dye irradiated light , act quickly target organism . The efficacy photodynamic therapy depend energy dose output power employ . Evaluation degree halitosis : The portable Oral ChromaTM device ( Abilit , Japan ) employ . This device use highly sensitive gas semiconductor sensor.It connect computer specific software program allow creation graph correspond peak concentration gas , measure VSC threshold ( 0 1000 ppb ) , considerable precision eight minute . Analysis volatile sulfur compound : - Hydrogen sulfide : value great 112 ppb indicate halitosis ( SH2 ≥ 112 ppb ) ; - Methyl mercaptan : value great 26 ppb indicate halitosis ( CH3SH ≥ 26 ppb ) ; A quantitative , control , cross-sectional , clinical trial carry involve 130 teenager . All individual submit evaluation Oral ChromaTM diagnosis halitosis ( score SH2 ≥ 112 ppb CH3SH ≥ 26 ppb ) beginning study . Three post-treatment evaluation carry : one hour , 24 hour one week treatment . The subject select randomly allocate five group : 1 . Group 1 receive treatment tongue scraper ; 2 . Group 2 3will receive photodynamic therapy apply posterior two third dorsum tongue ; 3 . Groups 4 5 receive combine treatment ( tongue scraper photodynamic therapy ) . The statistical analysis include chi-square test Fisher 's Exact Test . The Student 's t-test analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use comparison mean . Pearson 's correlation coefficient calculate determine strength correlation continuous variable . A 95 % significance level consider statistical test ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
