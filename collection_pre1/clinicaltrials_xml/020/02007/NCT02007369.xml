About 33.2 % daily smoker Hong Kong try quit could maintain abstinence . Relapse prevention aim provide intervention prevent relapse start abstinence status . This pilot single-blind randomize control trial ( proof concept study ) test effectiveness social networking service relapse prevention . The study first recruit 6 quitter 6 relapsers qualitative interview design intervention . Then , pilot-RCT trial recruit 120 participant recently quit smoking , randomly allocate 2 intervention group one control group . The 2 intervention group arrange join WhatsApp Facebook group receive quit advice group moderator share quit experience participant .

	<detailed_description>This research project consist two part : ( 1 ) Formative study use social networking service relapse prevention ; ( 2 ) A RCT test effectiveness social networking service relapse prevention 7.1 Phase 1 - Formative study 7.1.1 Study design objective Literature review exploratory data analysis exist dataset ICSCs conduct good define smoking relapse estimate relapse rate natural setting . In addition , extensive review effectiveness similar relevant intervention study , include previous study preliminary result use short messaging service HKU conduct . A consultation group form ICSCs smoke cessation research team HKU responsible develop intervention package social networking service , include content deliver message , channel , format , time send , intensity , moderator 's protocol , manpower logistic arrangement . This intervention package test cognitive interview ass relevance , appropriateness , potential effectiveness acceptance level SMS . 7.1.2 Selection subject We invite 6 quitter ( without relapse least one month ) 6 relapsers ( smoke 5 cigarette 3 day quit ) ICSCs ( ) gender ( M , F ) ( ii ) age group ( 18-39 , 40-59 , 60+ ) comment relevance , appropriateness , potential effectiveness acceptance level intervention package . 7.1.3 Procedures cognitive interview The site conduct cognitive interview intervention package content eight ICSCs . A face-to-face semi-qualitative interview conduct . 7.1.4 Instruments A semi-structured interview guide instrument use collect opinion . 7.1.5 Sample size 12 participant ( 6 quitter 6 relapsers ) recruit . Phase 2 - Randomized control trial 1 . Study design objective : This randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare relapse rate end first third month participant join social network ( group A ) ( group B ) . Research hypothesis : The relapse rate 1-month 3-month intervention arm ( Group A ) low control arm ( Group B ) 2 . Target subject Inclusion criterion : - Clients receive community-based smoking cessation counseling provide ICSC - Reported tobacco abstinence past 7 day 8-week follow-up first enrollment - Aged 18 - Able communicate Cantonese read Chinese - Have local network mobile phone mobile internet access Exclusion criterion : - Those unstable physical psychological condition advise doctor counselor charge - Smokers diagnose alcohol dependence score Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) 8 high - Smokers difficulty ( either physical cognitive condition ) communicate - Currently participate smoke cessation program 3 . Procedures : Smokers finish 8-week treatment TWGHs follow staff TWGHs telephone face-to-face visit . Those meet inclusion criterion introduce RCT invite consent participation RCT oral write consent . The social networking service intervention group available within 3 4 day randomization . Group A : Intervention arm relapse prevention intervention social group via social networking service ( Potential channel : Whatsapp Facebook ) . In order sustain abstinence among participant social group , intervention content prevent smoking lapse relapse , deal high-risk situation facilitate mutual support among participant . Moderators social group send message brief advice , give feedback participant ' enquiry facilitate conversation platform . We propose moderator spend 1 2 hour day social group conversation flexible time schedule , duration least one month . More detail intervention confirm preparation stage . Group B : Control arm without intervention Counselors , ICSCs HKU , experience smoking cessation familiar operation social networking service , recruit moderator social medium group deliver social networking service . 1- 3-month follow ( random allocation ) conduct trained interviewer ( blind group assignment ) via telephone interview . Subjects report abstinence smoking follow-up undergo non-biochemical validation validate quitting status . They enquire question quit experience impression , family member invite report smoker ' smoke quit status thru telephone interview . Also , invite interviewer biochemical validation test ( saliva cotinine test exhale CO test ) . 4 Randomization Blinding : Simple randomization method sequentially number , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) conduct ensure TWGHs counselor participant mask allocation . The counselor responsible subject recruitment mask randomization . For participant eligible study check counselor , counselor call site randomizer allocate group identity participant open one seal envelope accord serial number sequentially inform counselor intervention . Assessors follow-ups involved randomization process totally blind group assignment ( single blindness ) . 5 Instruments : The required baseline information relate demographic background information confirm preparation stage . ICSCs collect information smoker enrollment first visit . A structured questionnaire 1- 3- month enrollment ICSCs develop adopt modify international and/or locally validate instrument . The questionnaire gather information include smoke quit history , satisfaction perceived-usefulness social networking service , risk perception smoking , intention quit smoking ( stage readiness quit ) , antecedent factor Theory Planned Behavior model ( behavioural belief , outcome evaluation , normative belief , motivation comply ) , pros con smoke ( decisional balance ) , self-efficacy resist smoking , lifestyle risk factor ( drink physical activity ) , demographic information age , gender , marital status , education level employment status . 6 Sample size determination : Since pilot study test feasibility generate preliminary estimate effectiveness interactive messaging service smoke cessation , sample size would 50 arm ( i.e . total sample size = 100 ) . Taking reference relapse rate ( base 7-day point prevalence ) ICSCs TWGH 2009-2010 , 251 763 quitter 8 week report smoked 6 month . In word , relapse rate ( number continue smoke 6 month among self-reported quitter 8-week follow-up ) 33 % , assume new quitter . We assume similar result would occur control group RCT relapse prevention ( Group B ) . The effect size set conservatively 1:1.5 contrast group A B . In word , estimate relapse rate A B 22 % 33 % , respectively . As 100 subject total , power detect difference use Fisher 's exact test 26 % , give alpha 0.05 . That mean study low probability reject alternative hypothesis false . The power would reach 51.4 % estimate effect size set 1:2 . Alternatively , total sample size increase 500 , power reach 85 % 1.5 effect size . 7 Methods statistical analysis Data enter SPSS Windows ( version 20 ) . Descriptive statistic frequency , percentage , mean use summarize outcome variable . Chi-square test t-tests use compare outcome variable subgroup . Fisher 's exact test use compare quit rate group A group B . The intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis use lose contact refuse case follow-ups treated failure achieve cessation outcome . 8 Process evaluation To understand perception effectiveness social networking service , participant intervention group also invite give feedback social networking platform . Furthermore , six participant intervention group select ( 3 relapsers 3 non-relapsers ) participate in-depth interview 3-month follow-up . Questions satisfaction , perception advantage disadvantage intervention , suggestion improvement explore discuss .</detailed_description>
