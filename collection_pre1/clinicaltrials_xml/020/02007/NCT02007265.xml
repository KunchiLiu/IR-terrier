	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether simple , evidence-based clinical screen quickly feasibly implement ( &gt; 85 % patient average &lt; 6 minute ) large-volume urgent transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) /stroke clinic identify individual high risk three common devastate post-stroke co-morbidities ( depression , obstructive sleep apnea cognitive disorder ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-stroke Triage `` DOC '' : Simple Screening Depression , Obstructive Sleep Apnea Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We create simple screen tool ( `` DOC '' Screen ) routinely applied patient high-volume Regional Stroke Prevention Clinic . Consenting patient also undergo `` gold standard '' research assessment order determine diagnostic characteristic screen compare gold standard research assessments.The proportion eligible patient complete DOC screening time completion ( mean , range , standard deviation ) calculate aggregate data new consults stroke prevention clinic . For patient consent undergo gold standard testing , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value likelihood ratio DOC screen calculate . Screening cut-points optimize use Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) area curve analysis , logistic regression apply ROC Curve analysis control variables age , sex , BMI education . We hope develop pragmatic approach screen large , high-risk stroke prevention clinic population , allow broad screen important health condition . This could change routine standard care across stroke prevention clinic facilitate early identification appropriate assessment patient .</detailed_description>
