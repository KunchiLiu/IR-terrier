	<brief_summary>The age population inevitably lead grow number old people live alone need care . Given high cost geriatric care , critical research issue explore way improve maintain cognitive functional status old age . Unfortunately , show training specific cognitive process sensitive ageing ( speed process work memory ) , produce limited beneficial effect . However , research also suggest factor cognitive engagement , physical activity social context may act general modulators cognitive decline . This project longitudinal study experimental control group . It inspire engagement model cognitive optimization suggest lifestyle mark social intellectual engagement may mitigate age-related decline cognitive functioning . It use new cutting-edge information compute technology ( ICT ) solution improve simply maintain cognitive function elderly . This research investigate treatment reduces effect cognitive age-related decline executive control process episodic ( explicit ) memory use behavioral imaging measure . The result provide significant knowledge potential new ICT technology delay , compensate , even prevent common chronic problem experience elderly population . The hypothesis cognitive training video-games ICT solution promote brain mental health independence . Ultimately , objective contribute understand factor help avoid ( personal economic ) consequences long-term care geriatric institution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim present project investigate whether old adult could benefit brain training video game series cognitive task . Two group healthy old adult participate study . The experimental group receive 20 1-hr video game training session use commercially available brain-training package ( Lumosity ) involve problem solving , mental calculation , work memory attention task . The control group practice package , instead , attend meeting member study several time along course study . Both group evaluate training ( experimental group ) similar period time ( control group ) use different cognitive task 2 ( Group : Experimental , control ) x 2 ( Time o assessment : Pre , post ) mix factorial design .</detailed_description>
