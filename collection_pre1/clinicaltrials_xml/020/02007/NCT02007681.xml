	<brief_summary>The main purpose randomize cross-over trial test 3h/day reduction time spend sedentary behaviour ( SB ) break hourly shift stand walking behaviour would substantially increase total ( TEE ) PA energy expenditure ( PAEE ) compare week habitual prolong SB , male female overweight/obese inactive ( attain MVPA recommendation ) sedentary desk worker . Specifically use experiment design main aim : ) determine impact reduce SB TEE PAEE ; b ) analyse independent effect interrupt SB break overall reduction SB TEE PAEE ; c ) To analyse determinant overall reduction SB ; ) If change occur TEE PAEE dependent specific covariates .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>What Fact Contribution Reducing Time Spent Sedentary Behaviors Daily Energy Expenditure ? A Doubly Labeled Water Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There enough information exercise physiology support well-documented public health guideline promote least 150 minute moderate-to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) ( 1 ) . However emergence inactivity physiology study . If divide day period MVPA , light intensity PA ( LIPA ) , sedentary behavior sleep observe large proportion time take time spent sitting , TV viewing , car driving computer use . In fact , evidence exists excessive time spend sedentary behavior ( SB ) health risk mitigate perform half hour MVPA per day ( 2 , 3 ) . Life expectancy birth may increase ~2y SB reduce &lt; 3h/day ( 4 ) whereas prospective association exist SB mortality morbidity ( 2 , 3 ) . Short term experimental study indicate physical inactivity affect energy balance consider conducive weight gain ( 5 , 6 ) . A decrease PA considerable ability decrease total energy expenditure ( TEE ) without compensatory change energy intake , generate positive energy balance . The extent reduce break SB sustain period time considerably increase TEE never investigate free-living condition . Our hypothesis , daily 3h reduction SB 1-week , either increase number break shift SB low intensity physical activity ( LIPA ) , mainly stand walk activity , would substantially increase physical activity energy expenditure ( PAEE ) male female overweight/obese inactive computer desk worker compare 1-week usual prolong SB . Prior intervention , number steps/day PA assess use pedometer accelerometer respectively identify habitual daily step assure participant inactive ( &lt; 30 min/day MVPA ~ 5000 steps/day ) . Eligible participant enrol crossover experiment two condition perform random order : intervention ( 3h-reduction SB ) control ( habitual SB ) , free-living condition . Each condition last 1 week participant instruct keep eating pattern wear accelerometer , pedometer , combine accelerometer heart rate device , inclinometer ( activpal ) . Doubly label water ( DLW ) administer condition assess TEE , indirect calorimetry employ measure rest energy expenditure ( REE ) , PAEE subtract sum REE thermogenic effect food ( assume 10 % TEE ) . Body composition assess baseline last day intervention week DXA participant wear device 24 hour day two week food record three day week . In practice , workplace , intervention reduce SB include software hourly alert participant break SB approximately 7 minute adopt walk behavior ( ~30-60 minutes/day ) transportation , home/domestic , leisure time context , individual goal number steps/day set base expected step cadence ambulatory activity ( ~90-120 minutes/day ) . Also number strategy break SB transmit participant several context accomplish goal . At workplace , daily break automatically generate registered software . Daily adherence break SB supervise use phone call day well compliance individual steps/day goal , self-registered diary end day . During control week , supervision perform assure participant remain inactive similar SB number steps/day , observed baseline . During trial , 3-day food intake record collect analyzed condition . We anticipate use objective measure transition sit stand stepping , provide important methodological information , sedentary time comprise large proportion waking hour small change may go undetected use self-report SB . A unique aspect present study utilization state of-the-art technology investigate difference daily EE activity pattern overweight/obese individual . The result project may remarkable public health relevance . Most population weight gain past could avoid negative energy balance 100 Kcal/day achieve . We expect finding reveal meaningful difference energy expenditure break SB . We anticipate public health message emphasize `` stand walk '' simple approach prevent weight gain rise obesity develop country . This project may also contribute disclose innovative energy balance -based methodology design long-term intervention study examine effect break sedentary time health-related parameter .</detailed_description>
