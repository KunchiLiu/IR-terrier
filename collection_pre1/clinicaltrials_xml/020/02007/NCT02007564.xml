	<brief_summary>The research activity fund PAR `` Dissemination Implementation Research Health '' grant R21NR011112 `` Legacy Intervention Family Enactment ( LIFE ) '' vary highly successful . The LIFE project design three primary objective . Aim 1 ass efficacy LIFE deliver Retired Senior Volunteers ( RSVs ) palliative care patient ' : ( ) mood emotional experience ; ( b ) physical symptom burden ; ( c ) experience meaning . Aim 2 ass efficacy LIFE deliver RSVs one primary family caregiver 's : ( ) caregiving stress ; ( b ) mood emotional experience ; ( c ) experience positive aspect caregiving . Aim 3 assess ability RSVs deliver LIFE effectively . Although hospice palliative care social worker frequently use reminiscence creative activity patient 16 , intervention need accessible patient family transition community , hospital , palliative care setting . If hospice palliative care choose treatment option , mean deliver therapeutic reminiscence-based intervention exist . This represent significant gap practice psychosocial palliative care intervention literature . Kazdin Blase ( 2011 ) argue cogently community need mental health service far outstrip number provider available assist distress . They call strongly new intervention delivery mode target prevention treatment alleviate suffering . Hence , purpose present study evaluate effectiveness retire senior volunteer ( RSVs ) , available nationally National Senior Corp Program , deliver three-session reminiscence creative activity intervention previously find effective improve palliative care patient caregiver outcome ( Allen , 2009 ; Allen , Hilgeman , Ege , Shuster , &amp; Burgio , 2008 ) . We hypothesize palliative care patient caregiver RSV-delivered intervention group would demonstrate improved emotional spiritual functioning relative supportive contact control group . If successful , mode treatment delivery ( e.g. , RSV intervention ) would represent significant step toward translation great access earlier disease stag therapeutic psychosocial intervention individual near end life family member .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data collect June 2009 December 2011 approval The University Alabama University Alabama Birmingham Institutional Review Boards . A variety method use palliative care patient/caregiver dyad recruitment via physicians/clinical champion two university medical center , one home health agency , five assist living facility , four congregate apartment sit old adult low income , one continue care retirement community , one rehabilitation unit local skilled nursing facility . Sixty-six percent dyads physician-referred . A community recruiter advertisement community university print news medium also use . Patient/Caregiver Screening Group Assignment After clinical champion recruitment site explain main component project , patient provide verbal consent contact information forward research staff . Next , research staff contact patient express interest phone , describe project detail , , get verbal consent , administer screening measure ( basic demographic , Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 ( VES ) , Telephone Interview Cognitive Status-modified [ TICS-m ] ) telephone . Eligible patient directly nominate `` family '' caregiver ( related blood marriage fictive kin ) study participation . Palliative care patient eligible : ( 1 ) age 55 older ; ( 2 ) living community assist living ; ( 3 ) advance illness combination chronic illness ; ( 4 ) receive score three great VES ; ( 5 ) mild cognitive impairment measure score 17 great TICS-m ; ( 6 ) receive average four hour per week care caregiver ; ( 7 ) read speak English . Caregivers eligible : ( 1 ) identify eligible palliative care patient ; ( 2 ) age 19 ( Alabama 's age majority ) ; ( 3 ) provide average four hour per week care patient ; ( 4 ) cognitively intact measure score 28 great TICS-m ; ( 5 ) live nearby ; ( 6 ) read speak English . Dyads exclude patient receiving hospice care either individual schizophrenia bipolar disorder nursing home admission plan within three month . Retired Senior Volunteers RSVs . RSVs participant national Senior Corp program , part Corporation National Community Service . They recruit ( blind review ) ( blind review ) . The RSV program open U.S. citizen , national , lawful permanent resident alien age 55 older ( http : //www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps/rsvp ) . Within program , volunteer receive standard pre-service orientation training , supplemental insurance duty , , potentially , reimbursement cost travel incurred service . RSVs receive pay service perform . In study , RSVs include : ( 1 ) high school education ; ( 2 ) read spoke English ; ( 3 ) car drive independently . Procedures This RCT compare RSV-delivered intervention supportive telephone contact control deliver research staff . Prior experience deal terminal illness eligibility criterion RSVs research staff . However , RSVs indicate type advance chronic illness would prefer avoid assign patient-caregiver dyad . Whereas RSVs age 55 least high school education , research staff member 40 complete least bachelor 's degree social/behavioral science nursing . Our objective RCT determine whether RSVs could train effectively deliver reminiscence creative activity intervention . Thus , RSVs research staff need similar . In translation community , dyads receive intervention RSVs . Patient caregiver write informed consent obtain baseline . After baseline , dyad stratify race site randomly assign intervention control condition . RSVs ask audio record final intervention session evaluation treatment acceptability palliative care patient caregiver . Baseline post-intervention assessment complete separate , concurrent interview research staff involve provide control call . Post-intervention assessment occur approximately one week completion intervention control contact , 15 20 week post-baseline . Qualitative content analysis use examine treatment acceptability . Follow-up assessment group complete 13 14 week post-intervention assessment . RSV-delivered LIFE Intervention Group.Prior deliver manualized intervention , RSVs receive intensive training ( approximately four six hour two session ) , include reading material , structure role-play , practice opportunity observe licensed clinical psychologist ( blind review ) . Research staff call consultation RSVs . The LIFE Volunteer Interventionist Manual LIFE Participant Notebook Flesch-Kincaid Grade Levels = 7.0 Flesch Reading Ease rating 68.7 % available 14-point font . The manual accompanying workbook consist : ( 1 ) instruction use step problem solving ( D'Zurilla &amp; Nezu , 2007 ) decide period life creative activity project ; ( 2 ) constructing project ; ( 3 ) evaluation activity ; ( 4 ) appendix life review question dyads find generation story difficult . With help RSV , patient-caregiver dyad session one narrow focus time period patient ' life could adequately represent one tangible project ( e.g. , scrapbook , cookbook , audiotape ) represent patient 's value achievement life . The RSV dyad actively brainstorm way portray life story ; RSV help dyad narrow focus one meaningful project , direct dyad LIFE Participant Notebook tip project construction . The dyad ask gather necessary material ( picture , recipe , story family member ) actively work complete portion project session RSV . During second session , RSVs help dyad work activity use problem solve skill . During third visit , patient caregiver share activity RSV , discuss dyad 's feeling process , include qualitative evaluation LIFE project family learn create . RSVs carefully train monitor dyad ' reaction . If either member dyad react persistently negative manner intervention , activity discontinue . RSVs teach look depression follow way : look sadden face , cry , shaky voice , statement caregiver care recipient seem depress ( e.g. , downtrodden , sad , blue ) . The LIFE Volunteer Interventionist Manual include `` Feelings Checks '' RSVs ask , `` How talk memory make feel ? '' The average treatment fidelity score achieve RSVs train 89.8 % . Patient-caregiver dyad receive $ 25 offset cost purchase material ( e.g. , photo album , scrapbook , photograph print paper , etc . ) desire project . Research team member purchase delivered material mobility restrict dyad . Supportive Telephone Contact Control Group . Patients caregiver receive three separate , structured emotional support telephone call research staff ( M duration = 13 minute ; SD = 6.5 minute ) minimize differential drop-out RSV intervention group . Control callers ask question participant engage supportive conversation use empathic listen reflection . Topics discuss include family , intergenerational tie , important aspect patient 's life , structure reminiscence creative therapeutic nature legacy activity discuss .</detailed_description>
