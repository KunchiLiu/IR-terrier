	<detailed_description>Introduction . Wintertime associate increased morbidity mortality majority relate cardiovascular cause , myocardial infarction , heart failure , stroke . It also know , acute long-term cold exposure increase blood pressure cardiac workload , may contribute observed excess morbidity mortality cold season . Although effect cold blood pressure establish among healthy people , effect among risk group , hypertensive people , know . In addition blood pressure , information cardiac electrical activity autonomic regulation need . Cardiovascular response cold could different among hypertensive people disturbance autonomic nervous system circulatory regulation function , aortic stiffening increase vasomotor tone peripheral artery due endothelial dysfunction associate disease . To assess , control experiment employ cold exposure similar everyday winter circumstance subarctic climate perform climatic chamber . Aims research . The objective research ass short-term cold exposure affect cardiovascular function middle-aged untreated hypertensive normotensive men . The hypothesis study : ) cold exposure induce adverse change cardiovascular function , high blood pressure cardiac workload b ) hypertensive men demonstrate aggravate response cold exposure recovery cardiovascular system baseline delay compare normotensive subject . Material Methods . Study participant . The study participant choose population-based recruitment random sample 1000 men ( 55-65 year old ) living Oulu , Finland draw Finnish Population Register . The subject screen telephone interview eligibility study . Eligible attendee measure blood pressure home week accord recommendation European Society Hypertension . Based measurement classify either hypertensive ( systolic blood pressure ≥135 and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg ) normotensive ( blood pressure &lt; 135/85mmHg ) . ( 16 ) The exclusion criterion presence coronary heart respiratory disease , use antihypertensive drug indication , average home BP ≥175/105 mm Hg , fail home BP measurement . We aim recruit 2:1 ratio hypertensive normotensive subject . The final study group consist 56 hypertensive 35 normotensive middle-aged men . Measurement protocol . Before measurement participant fill questionnaire health cold habituation relate question . The laboratory experiment begin short familiarization measurement protocol climatic chamber . Height , body composition , physical fitness subject measure . The participant expose 15 min temperature -10°C wind 3m/s protect cold proper winter clothing , i.e . condition similar common habitual winter time cold exposure subarctic country . Participants follow 15 min ( control measurement ) 20 min ( recovery ) exposure climatic chamber temperature adjust +18°C wind set &lt; 0.2m/s ) . The participant stand arm support measurements.Cardiovascular function assess measure brachial , central aortic , continuous `` beat beat '' blood pressure , well ECG measurement . The intensity cold exposure evaluate skin temperature measurement ( middle finger , back hand , shoulder blade , cheek ) assess thermal perception whole body face use subjective judgement scale . The collect data analyze assess cold relate change blood pressure ( brachial central aortic ) heart rate . ECG morphology vector cardiographic parameter compute derived 12-lead ECG recording Institute Clinical Medicine University Oulu . Arrhythmias detect automatically confirm visual inspection train health care professional . To assess regulation circulation , continuous blood pressure signal simultaneously record three lead ECG apply compute baroreflex sensitivity heart rate variability Verve research center . In data analysis response cold exposure evaluate compare hypertensive normotensive subject . In addition mention topic combine risk factor adverse change cardiovascular function cold exposure evaluate , high arterial stiffness , alter ECG , low heart rate variability . Based , profile high risk patient define share physician treat hypertensive patient reduce adverse cold-related cardiac event . Site research availability equipment service require research . The laboratory measurement implement climatic chamber Kastelli Research Center , Oulu , Finland . The data analysis reporting perform facility Center Environmental Respiratory Health Research ( University Oulu ) . In addition , data analysis perform Oulu University Hospital Verve department Exercise Cardiac rehabilitation . Co-operation . The Center Environmental Respiratory Health Research - Adjunct professor Tiina M Ikäheimo , Professor Jouni JK Jaakkola , Professor J Hassi , PhD A Rantala , MHSc H Hyrkäs ; Department Exercise Medical Physiology , Verve , Oulu - Adjunct professor M Tulppo , Adjunct professor A Kiviniemi , Adjunct professor Arto Hautala ; Institute Occupational Health , Oulu - Professor H Rintamäki ; Institute Clinical Medicine , University Oulu - Professor H Huikuri , PhD T Kenttä ; Institute Biomedicine , Department Physiology Biocenter Oulu , University Oulu - Professor KH Herzig ; Institute Health Sciences , University Oulu - Professor S Keinänen-Kiukaanniemi , Professor R Antikainen , Professor M Mäntysaari ; Department Biology - Professor E Hohtola ; Oulu University Applied Sciences - Principal lecturer Medical Engineering J Jauhiainen . Ethical issue . The study approve ethic committee Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District ( statement number 240/2010 ) participant inform study request informed consent . They also possibility terminate study point . The data collect study maintain unavailable project personnel protect password . Data-analyses perform without personal identification ( name , address etc. ) . The research apply short cold exposure well protected subject , therefore , cause pain harm participant . Implications . WHO define high blood pressure lead global risk mortality world . Approximately half middle-aged men one third woman hypertension Finland . On hand , proper blood pressure control risk adverse cardiovascular event among hypertensive patient considerably reduce . Wintertime cold weather remarkably increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . There excess ca . 2000-3000 death occur Finland winter even half cardiovascular reason . Both acute repeat exposure cold increase blood pressure may contribute high wintertime cardiovascular morbidity mortality . It suggest , cold-related cardiovascular death could prevent proper protection cold temperature . The study produce novel information cardiovascular response short-term cold exposure among untreated hypertensive men . This knowledge help health care personnel advice hypertensive patient protect habitual cold exposure , could reduce adverse cardiac event related cold weather . This knowledge useful medical doctor consider medication patient . In addition , hypertensive people may need advice proper protection reduce cold-related change cardiovascular function , blood pressure increase , related adverse cardiovascular event cold climate .</detailed_description>
