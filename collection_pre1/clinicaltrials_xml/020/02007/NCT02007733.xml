	<detailed_description>Background : Children five experience 1.7 billion episode diarrhea year , result 36 million case severe disease 700,000 death , 10 % child death worldwide . As severity diarrheal disease vary quite widely child , accurately assess dehydration status remain crucial step prevent morbidity mortality . While child severe dehydration require immediate treatment intravenous fluid prevent hemodynamic compromise , organ ischemia , death , child mild moderate dehydration significant reduction hospital length stay few adverse event treat relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , European Society Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology Nutrition ( ESPGHAN ) recommend separate child acute diarrhea three group determine management base presence absence various clinical sign : dehydration ( &lt; 3 % ) , dehydration ( 3-9 % ) , severe dehydration ( &gt; 9 % ) . These authority recommend treat child dehydration ORS limit IV hydration child severe dehydration , order prevent inappropriate utilization scarce hospital resource adverse event associate liberal use IV hydration child . However , clinical prediction model severe dehydration ever empirically derive validate develop world setting , vast majority diarrheal death occur child year . Study Objectives : As part study , investigator derive new clinical prediction rule severe dehydration child diarrhea develop world . In addition , investigator validate assess reliability ultrasound inferior vena cava ( IVC ) predict severe dehydration child diarrhea . Finally , investigator compare accuracy new diagnostic tool WHO scale , current standard assess dehydration low-income country . Study Design : The investigator enroll prospective cohort child five admit diarrhea dehydration Dhaka Hospital International Center Diarrheal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) . Research staff identify eligible child arrival obtain informed consent guardian . Children weigh arrival assess clinically presence absence sign dehydration . A brief ultrasound IVC also perform . Children rehydrated accord standard hospital protocol , weight check regularly achieve stable , post-hydration weight . Greater 9 % difference admission weight stable weight ( post-illness weight ) consider gold standard severe dehydration , investigator determine accuracy new clinical ultrasound-based assessment tool . Ethical Protection Human Subjects : Children enrol unlikely expose additional risk discomfort , either mental physical , result participate study . Study procedure include physical exam ultrasound , neither expose child increase harm , study procedure delay immediately necessary care , IV fluid . All data collect keep strictly confidential password-protected database . In addition obtain ethical approval Lifespan Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , investigator also already obtain approval ICDDR , B Ethical Review Committee .</detailed_description>
