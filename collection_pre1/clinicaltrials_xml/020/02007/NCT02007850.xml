	<brief_title>Effect Mode Femoral Nerve Analgesia Quadriceps Muscle Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous femoral nerve analgesia technique relatively safe , easily train , reduce significantly intravenous opioid consumption . These favorable feature make standard treatment option postoperative knee pain . However , direct perineural local anesthetic effect confine pain fiber , , sensory motor nerve fiber . Therefore , unwanted motor weakness accompany . Quadriceps muscle strength , important determinant physical function knee arthroplasty , influence continuous femoral nerve block . Various local anesthetic infusion technique suggest minimize change quadriceps muscle strength . Decreasing local anesthetic concentration affect degree muscle weakness , also reduce quality pain control . Different anatomic location catheter tip , consider motor fiber posterior part femoral nerve , could reduce motor weakness . In study continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block hallux valgus repair , repeat bolus administration seem effective method pain control without concurrent motor impairment . However , another study continuous femoral nerve block healthy volunteer , hourly repeat bolus dose 5 ml 0.1 % ropivacaine fail spare motor block . Previously , institution standard technique fix continuous infusion 0.2 % ropivacaine concomitant intravenous patient control fentanyl . Because physical therapy institution , usually start 2nd day operation , , assume continuous fix infusion may result drug accumulation near nerve fiber . So , patient control mode femoral analgesia could better choice initiation physical therapy . At time , comparison patient control analgesia continuous infusion fully elucidate recently . Therefore , study , try compare quadriceps muscle strength change continuous infusion patient control femoral analgesia patient undergoing total knee replacement arthroplasty . Secondary outcome include sensory effect femoral nerve distribution , pain score , iv fentanyl consumption , adverse effect .</detailed_description>
