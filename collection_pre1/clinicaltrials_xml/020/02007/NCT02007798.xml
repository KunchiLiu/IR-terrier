Information description Count data describe use percentage , measurement data express mean ± standard deviation . Not normally distribute data express median percentile ( 25th-75th percentile ) . Comparison baseline data Intergroup count data compare use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . If measurement data normally distribute exhibit homogeneity variance , single-factor multi-factor analysis variance apply . If heterogeneity variance show , non-parametric test approximate test ( e.g. , Tamhnnes T2 test ) employed . For measurement data normally distribute , non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test use . Baseline balance comparability group examine . Comparison Efficacy : Analgesic sedative effect group compare use Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test . For markedly effective , pairwise comparison data difference analyze use Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test . Considering center factor , CMH X2 test employ comparison two-classification index level indicator . Data Processing : All statistical data analyze use SAS software data processing . Two-sided test employ statistical analysis , correspond P value give . For Fisher 's exact test , P value calculate directly .
