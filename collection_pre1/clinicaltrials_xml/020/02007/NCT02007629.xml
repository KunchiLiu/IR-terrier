	<brief_summary>BAY63-2521 Riociguat lead relaxation smooth muscle cell pulmonary arteria may also inhibit abnormal remodel lung blood vessel . In patient pulmonary arterial hypertension Riociguat show reduce pulmonary blood pressure improve right heart function without unacceptable side effect . Here dose Riociguat adjust 8 week Maintenance Phase 16 week follow . Patients Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension treat stable dos Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitors ( Eg Sildenafil , Tadalafil ) appropriately respond therapy include . Based previous evidence different mode action improvement exercise capacity , heart function quality life may expect PDE5i treatment transition riociguat . Where Riociguat pending market approval reimbursement treatment phase complete drug make available another 18 month ( Extended Drug Supply Phase - EDSP ) study condition . Patients may also transition end maintenance period time EDSP program intend provide riociguat drug approval/reimbursement , e.g . long-term extension study , compassionate use name patient program . Study termination also possible time .</brief_summary>
