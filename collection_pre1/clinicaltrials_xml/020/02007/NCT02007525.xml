	<brief_summary>The investigator propose pilot test six-week yoga program among adults peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . Participants ( n=50 ) randomize six-week yoga intervention ( n=25 ) wait-list control ( n=25 ) . The yoga intervention include weekly yoga class currently use among cardiac rehab patient University Michigan Health System , together home-based practice session . Participants perform treadmill test baseline 6 week assess walk capacity . The primary outcome interest include 1 ) acceptability program participant , 2 ) feasibility recruitment , 3 ) change maximal walking distance , 4 ) change claudication symptom , 5 ) change health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . The investigator expect inform u acceptability feasibility large proposal examine yoga PAD patient . These data also inform effect size maximal walking , HRQOL , use estimate sample size need large R01 level proposal . Study hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : Participants find yoga program acceptable low drop-out rate ( &lt; 15 % ) , excellent attendance ( &gt; 80 % class attend ) , good completion home-based practice session ( self-report &gt; 80 % complete ) . Hypothesis 2 : The yoga intervention feasible large study base number potential participant approach , consent participate vs. . Hypothesis 3 : Increases maximal walk distance pain-free walking distance ( baseline 6 week ) great participant randomize yoga intervention compare control group . Hypothesis 4 : Self-reported claudication symptom reduce great degree ( 6 week ) among participant randomize yoga intervention compare control group . Hypothesis 5 : Increases HRQOL ( baseline 6 week ) great participant randomize yoga intervention compare control group .</brief_summary>
