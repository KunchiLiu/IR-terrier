	<brief_title>Tocilizumab Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) often life-threatening complication time diagnosis result excessive inflammation . This excessive inflammation drive abnormally high level cytokine -- proteins involved inflammation . Standard therapy HLH directly target cytokine . Tocilizumab medicine block one cytokine elevate patient HLH . This open-label single-arm uncontrolled trial biologic endpoint . This study use tocilizumab subject HLH high cytokine level attempt decrease damage cause protein . All subject receive standard therapy , addition tocilizumab . We hypothesize tocilizumab decrease level certain important cytokine . This may make easy treat subject HLH overall . TCZ administer single dose ( 8mg/kg ) intravenously . Eligible subject inpatients Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) main campus . 10 subject HLH enrol . All subject initiate standard HLH-directed treatment . Cytokine level [ include serum interferon ( IFN-γ ) interleukin ( IL-6 ) ] monitor , addition laboratory clinical marker HLH disease activity .</detailed_description>
