	<brief_summary>Although conventional risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) identify routinely use determine risk CHD general population , systematic approach determine population-specific risk CHD perform prospectively SCI . CHD lead cause death spinal cord injury , occur young age able-bodied population . Conventional risk factor CHD high serum concentration low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , low serum concentration high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , positive smoking history , positive family history premature CHD . Coronary Artery calcification ( CAC ) commonly occur phenomenon necessarily indicate significant obstructive disease . Studies show strong association exist coronary calcification coronary heart disease . The purpose study compare CAC score person SCI historical control group able-bodied person national data base match conventional risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) determine relationship CAC score conventional emerge risk factor CAD . Additionally , postprandial lipemic ( elevated level lipid follow ingestion food ) responses among individual SCI control subject compare , well response inflammatory marker follow high fat meal . Participants test parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The early identification individual high risk development CVD challenge highly relevant pursuit clinician epidemiologist . The clinical significance early identification CAD become apparent several cardiac risk factor modifiable . Numerous study perform identify risk factor CVD . These study result clinical guideline identification risk reduction CVD , currently summarize Third Report Expert Panel Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Cholesterol Adults : Adult Treatment Panel ( ATP III ) . ATP III identify five major risk factor CVD : hyperlipidemia , hypertension , current smoking , abdominal obesity , diabetes ; individual two risk factor consider increase risk , although recommendation may change one risk factor upcoming ATP IV . From clinical perspective however , shortcoming prognostic value current conventional risk factor become increasingly apparent . Retrospective review large cohort study clinical trial conduct general population find ≥1 major conventional risk factor present 90 % patient diagnosed CAD . However , approximately 70 % subject establish risk develop event relate CAD 21-30 year follow-up period . These finding suggest major predictor CAD risk , although 90 % sensitive , may 30 % specific . In person chronic SCI ( &gt; 1 year ) , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality , general population . Compared general population , CVD-related morbidity person SCI , specifically CAD , occur early life prevalent . Based knowledge , need appropriate risk stratification SCI population become apparent . Existing tool take account specific consequence SCI , possibly underestimate actual risk CVD . For example , risk factor algorithms incorporate HDL cholesterol equation determine CAD risk , cutoff level HDL cholesterol general population heighten risk disease . Such approach factor severity depression HDL cholesterol . It appreciate morbidity risk ratio CAD men rise unity HDL cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dL , risk continue rise linear fashion value lipid moiety decrease . In individual SCI , HDL cholesterol level may markedly depress , high , complete lesion low value . Thus , individual SCI additional risk CAD base extremely depressed value HDL cholesterol capture conventional categorization . In addition , high cord lesion ( thoracic level six ) frequently hypotensive , activate renin-angiotensin axis attempt maintain normotension . Elevated level angiotension appreciate atherogenic . Once , pathophysiologic condition—that , hypotension elevate angiotensin levels— capture conventional risk factor paradigm . Because consideration , well extreme immobilization SCI may independently confer additional CAD risk , use conventional risk assessment tool population fraught obvious difficulty potential error . For year , need development new non-conventional assessment tool recognize able-bodied population , need reliable vehicle identify individual heighten risk even case individual SCI . The predictive value emerge risk factor study attempt increase sensitivity specificity identification individual heighten risk CAD , thus improve early diagnosis result appropriate institution efficacious risk modification approach . Abdominal fat , inflammatory biomarkers , CAC , arterial stiffness , increase C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , vitamins antioxidant deficiency , endothelial dysfunction , increase arterial intima medium thickness ( IMT ) , triglyceride response fat load , genetic factor extensively study potential predictor increase risk CAD general population . Among non-conventional approach , measurement CAC score promise . CAC highly specific atherosclerosis think develop late pathophysiology , reflect chronic plaque burden . CAC use global CVD risk stratification asymptomatic patient identify additional risk among seemingly low-risk ; additional predictive value CAC CAD risk great provide conventional risk factor , regardless racial ethnic consideration . The high CAC score , great prevalence myocardial perfusion abnormality associate obstructive CAD risk death myocardial infarction within 3 5 year . Approximately two-thirds person SCI intermediate risk CAD ; evidence suggest many silent CAD . Of note , somewhat troubling , report symptomatic individual without CAC , 16-24 % obstructive CAD , observation corroborate find approximately 20 % occluded vessel may detectable calcification .</detailed_description>
