	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Versus Ibrutinib + Rituximab ( v iR ) Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . There equal chance either group . - Group 1 receive ibrutinib alone . - Group 2 receive ibrutinib plus rituximab . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . If Group 1 , take 3 capsule ibrutinib mouth 1 time every day 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . If Group 2 , take 3 capsule ibrutinib mouth 1 time every day 1 cup water . Your doctor tell start take ibrutinib Day 1 Day 2 Cycle 1 . You receive rituximab vein 3 8 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , Day 1 Cycles 2-6 . If miss dose ibrutinib , take soon possible day return normal schedule follow day . You take extra capsule make miss dose . Study Visits : On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . After Cycles 1-6 , Cycles 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . After Cycle 3 6 , CT scan , MRI , PET scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . After Cycles 12 24 , every 12 cycle doctor think need : - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . - You CT scan , MRI , PET scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Once every 6 month Cycle 24 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue take ibrutinib long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : At 60 day last dose study drug ( ) , every 4 month 5 year ( disease get bad new treatment start ) , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma patient CLL receive least 1 prior treatment . Its use study investigational . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . The combination rituximab ibrutinib investigational . Up 208 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Free prior malignancy 3 year exception patient diagnose basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' cervix breast , eligible even currently treat treat and/or diagnose past 3 year prior study enrolment . If patient another malignancy treat within last 3 year , patient enrol , consultation Principal Investigator , likelihood require systemic therapy malignancy within 2 year less 10 % , determine expert particular malignancy MD Anderson Cancer Center . 8 . A Urine Pregnancy Test ( within 7 day enrollment date ) require woman childbearing potential . 1 . Pregnant breastfeeding female . 2 . Prior therapy ibrutinib kinase inhibitor target Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . Patients previously receive therapy PI3K delta inhibitor idelalisib ( Zydelig ) allow enrol . 3 . Treatment include chemotherapy , chemoimmunotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , radiotherapy , highdose corticosteroid therapy ( 60 mg Prednisone daily equivalent ) , immunotherapy within 21 day prior enrollment concurrent trial . 4 . Investigational agent receive within 30 day prior first dose study drug . 5 .

Patients uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia ( AIHA ) autoimmune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) . 7 . Patients severe hematopoietic insufficiency , define absolute neutrophil count less 500/MuL , unless diseaserelated , and/or platelet count le 30,000/MuL time screen protocol . 8 . Any severe concurrent disease , history serious organ dysfunction disease involve heart , kidney , liver organ system may place patient undue risk undergo therapy ibrutinib rituximab . 9 . Significant cardiovascular disease uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month screen , Class 3 4 cardiac disease define New York Heart Association Functional Classification . 10 . History stroke cerebral hemorrhage within 6 month . 11 . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy within 3 month . 12 .
