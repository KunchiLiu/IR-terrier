	<detailed_description>Despite decline incidence many developed country , gastric cancer remain second common cause cancer death , responsible 12 % cancer-related death worldwide . More two-thirds patient diagnose gastric cancer unresectable disease despite fact surgical pathological resection curative many patient , develop recurrent disease . Evidence support use palliative chemotherapy aim improve symptom , quality life , possibly prolong survival . Combination chemotherapy regimens developed hope improve response rate overall survival ( OS ) . Unfortunately , benefit combination chemotherapy modest . In general , regimens contain fluoropyrimidine platinum agent widely accept potential standard therapy . Although large proportion patient metastatic recurrent gastric cancer may initially respond chemotherapy , ultimately progress . In addition , many patient primary refractory disease . The median survival progression first-line chemotherapy metastatic gastric cancer 2.5 month . Docetaxel one active single agent treatment gastric cancer . In first line setting , dose 60-100 mg/m2 repeat every 3 week , response rate range 17 % 20 % . Docetaxel taxane evaluate context phase III study . Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy represent new strategy treat solid tumor exhibit strong anti-angiogenic activity less side effect , especially combination anti-angiogenic agent . Capecitabine fluoropyrimidine carbamate , broad spectrum antitumor activity fluoropyrimidines . In gastric cancer xenograft . metronomic capecitabine inhibit angiogenesis , growth gastric cancer improve survival less toxicity . In combination drug , treatment metronomic capecitabine prove efficacy minimal toxicity breast cancer , metastatic renal-cell carcinoma , advance adrenocortical carcinoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , prostate cancer . The `` metronomic '' strategy also consider pretreated elderly patient advance gastric cancer . Eligible patient advance gastric cancer treat capecitabine disease progression significant toxicity . Metronomic chemotherapy achieve disease control rate 8 week 51.1 % , objective response rate 20.9 % . The median time-to-progression median overall survival 3.6 month 7.6 month , respectively . Grade II neutropenia thrombocytopenia observe 13.3 2.2 % patient , respectively . Grade II/III nonhematological toxicity include diarrhea ( 4.4 % ) , stomatitis ( 13.4 % ) , hand-foot syndrome ( 15.5 % ) . No grade 4 toxicity , neutropenic fever treatment-related death occur . Based premise fact role metronomic chemotherapy remain controversial , optimal therapeutic use yet define , design phase II study tha aim ass efficacy tolerability metronomic capecitabine combination conventional use docetaxel patient advance gastric cancer previously treat fluoropyrimidine-based platinum-based chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
