	<brief_title>Mobility Activity Training ( MAT ) Optimize Outcomes Older Adult Abdominal Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older sicker patient increase risk poor surgical outcome , complication , long lengths stay , utilization skilled nursing facility , increase mortality , high cost compare young healthy patient undergo similar procedure . In addition , high-risk patient surgery , overall surgical volume predict increase 47 % ( 2000 2020 ) . Within context , effort improve surgical quality among high-risk patient become paramount importance new proven strategy improve surgical outcome need . Work PI Englesbe suggest trunk muscle lean mass strongly associate poor surgical outcome , suggest independent link muscle loss ( sarcopenia ) surgical outcome , even control comorbidity functional impairment . Furthermore , work note trunk muscle mass decline rapidly peri-operative period . Whether exercise intervention remediate risk unknown . Few randomized control trial exist address whether pre-operative exercise intervention alter eventual post-operative outcome , none focus train trunk musculature abdominal surgery patient . Further , trunk musculature critical mobilization several publish trial ( intensive care unit ) suggest early mobilization associate improved outcome . Thus , link reduction muscle loss via exercise improve mobility post-surgical patient remain proven seem promising . Co-PI Alexander extensive experience study mobility task assessment enhancement able disabled adult . Of particular relevance present proposal study rise bed ( supine sit ) chair ( sit stand ) improvement note , use task-specific approach old adult risk mobility impairment . His recent funded investigation focus home-based mobility physical activity enhancement . We propose pilot study group old adult undergo midline laparotomy gastrointestinal malignancy participate mobility activity training ( MAT ) program . MAT design advance functional mobility physical activity span pre-operative , inpatient , post-operative period . Patients undergo abdominal surgery randomize MAT versus control usual care evaluate first appointment 4 week preoperatively ( baseline ) , immediately prior surgery , hospital discharge , 6 week post operatively . We hope prove abdominal surgery patient undergo MAT show less decline earlier recovery functional activity , trunk thigh muscle strength mass . This study uniquely innovative link functional activity assessment training analysis trunk morphomics ( muscle mass ) explore mechanisms post-operative recovery . Results pilot use determine effect size recruitment large cohort study key surgical outcome , include surgical complication , operative symptom , hospital length stay , cost care . Primary Aim 1 : To determine change extent decline recovery functional activity , strength , muscle mass result activity training ( MAT ) Primary hypothesis : Abdominal surgery patient randomize MAT , oppose usual care control ( UC ) compare baseline evaluation 4 week pre-operatively , reduced loss functional activity reduce loss muscle strength mass trunk thigh 6 week post-operatively . Secondary Aim 1 : To determine effect individual MAT program segment provide pre-operatively , in-hospital , post-hospital discharge Secondary hypothesis : Abdominal surgery patient randomize MAT , oppose UC , reduce loss functional activity reduce loss muscle strength mass trunk thigh compare 1 ) baseline versus surgical admission ; 2 ) surgical admission versus hospital discharge ; 3 ) hospital discharge versus post-operative follow-up 6 week . Exploratory Aim : To determine effect MAT surgical complication , operative symptom , hospital length stay peri-operative cost . Exploratory hypothesis : Abdominal surgery patient randomize peri-operative MAT , oppose UC , reduce surgical complication , few operative symptom , short hospital length stay , low cost care .</detailed_description>
