	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis advance stage chronic liver disease , often associate various complication , namely esophageal and/or gastric varix , ascites , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . It well know risk complication varies even among cirrhotic patient , advanced disease would complications poor survival rate . Liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) transient elastography find useful identify cirrhotic patient high risk portal hypertension presence varix . Recently , spleen stiffness measurement ( SSM ) machine find accurate predict portal hypertension esophageal varix . Investigators hypothesize new screen strategy guide LSM SSM ( LSSM ) value ( LSSM-guided ) non-inferior conventional strategy term detection rate clinically significant esophageal and/or gastric varix patient liver cirrhosis open-labeled randomize controlled trial . Consecutive patient compensate liver cirrhosis invite study . Patients fulfil study criterion randomize LSSM arm ( upper endoscopy perform patient high LSM SSM value ) , control arm ( upper endoscopy perform patient ) . Patients randomize LSSM arm undergo transient elastography examination ; high LSM SSM result refer upper endoscopy examination screen varix . Patients randomize control arm directly refer upper endoscopy examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver cirrhosis advance stage chronic liver disease , often associate various complication , namely esophageal and/or gastric varix , ascites , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . It well know risk complication varies even among cirrhotic patient , advanced disease would complications poor survival rate . Liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) transient elastography find useful identify cirrhotic patient high risk portal hypertension presence varix cross-sectional basis . LSM cutoff value 17.6 kPa 21.0 kPa would sensitivity ≥ 90 % order detect patient hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) 10-12mmHg , presence varix could confidently exclude liver stiffness 12.5-19.8 kPa . However , suggest cutoff value overlap detect histologic cirrhosis chronic liver disease . Hence seem significant additional information provide LSM regard screen endoscopy varix among cirrhotic patient . Recently , spleen stiffness measurement ( SSM ) machine find accurate predict portal hypertension esophageal varix . An SSM cutoff value &lt; 41.3 kPa sensitive seem able accurately rule presence varix . This support possible screen strategy , reserve upper endoscopy patient SSM ≥41.3kPa .</detailed_description>
