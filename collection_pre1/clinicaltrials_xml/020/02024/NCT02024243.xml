	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Elevated miR210 epidermis ( out layer skin ) ischemic human wound edge tissue ( tissue lack blood flow ) associate poor heal outcome set standard clinical care . Aim study : To determine whether elevated miR-210 epidermis ischemic human wound edge tissue associate poor heal outcome set standard clinical care . This study last 14 week . Adult patient , non-diabetic tightly control diabetic , , chronic venous leg ulcer , infect open/not heal least 12 week , enrol study . Patients recruit OSU Wexner Medical Center Comprehensive Wound Center ( CWC ) . On day 0 , 14 28 , patient follow perform : measurement photograph take wound ; TCOM ( transcutaneous oxygen measurement ) ABI measure amount oxygen wound tissue ; two 3-mm punch biopsy wound/ulcer . Biopsies take wound close day 14 day 28 . Additionally , patient ' medical record review throughout study obtain information patient ( age , sex , race/ethnicity , current medication , TCOM , would location type , illness/diagnoses , wound care treatment instruction , nutritional status base albumin level ) , 14 week enrollment determine final status wound ( heal heal ) . There total 5 visit study ( 6 total visit patient open wound day 28 study ) . Visits occur day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design 28-day prospective longitudinal observational study include 98 day ( 14 week ) follow-up photography wound test whether wound open day 28 close week 14 , remain chronically open . On day 0 , 14 28 enrollment , wound image obtain . Wound photograph part standard care patient come Comprehensive Wound Center ( CWC ) . Images include part body could lead identification participant . In addition , follow standard care , two biopsy take - one biopsy use laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) immunohistochemistry study , use determination infection status use quantitative bacterial culture Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) image biofilm phenotyping . The following complete day 0 , 14 28 : 1 . Wound measurement - Photographs digital planimetry measure wound area . 2 . Two Wound-edge biopsy ( 3mm ) - follow wound bed preparation 1 % lidocaine local anesthetic , require , two punch biopsy ( 3 mm ) obtain wound-edge ( lead 3mm edge skin perimeter ) wound/ulcer . 3 . Data Collection - follow information collect enrollment visit update visit ( weekly - day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 98 ( week 14 ) ) , necessary , enter onto data collection form : Age ; Sex ; Race/Ethnicity ; Current medication ; Transcutaneous oxygen measurement ( TCOM ) &lt; 30 mmHg ABI &lt; 0.8 ; Wound location &amp; Etiology ; Other associated illness ; Wound care modality/treatment ; Nutritional status record document albumin level chart record . Healing outcome : Wound photography perform every 7 day ( every week ) part current standard care . Based wound measurement day 0 28 , patient classify either heal non-healing , per criterion describe study proposal/protocol . There total 5 visit study ( 6 total visit patient open wound day 28 study ) . Visits occur day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 .</detailed_description>
