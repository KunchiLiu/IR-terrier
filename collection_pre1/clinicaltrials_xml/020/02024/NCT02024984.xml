	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) one common female endocrine disorder ( Fauser et al. , 2011 ) . It complex , heterogeneous disorder uncertain aetiology , strong evidence , large degree , classify genetic disease ( Fauser et al. , 2011 ) . Genetic environmental contributor hormonal disturbance combine factor , include obesity ( Diamanti-Kandarakis et al. , 2006 ) . Ovarian dysfunction hypothalamic pituitary abnormality contribute etiology PCOS ( Doi et al. , 2005 ) . It produce symptom approximately 5 % 10 % woman reproductive age ( 12-45 year old ) . It think one leading cause female subfertility ( Goldenberg Glueck , 2008 ) . Its prevalence increase use different diagnostic criterion recently show 18 % ( 17.8 ± 2.8 % ) first community-based prevalence study base current Rotterdam diagnostic criterion ( March et al. , 2010 ) . AIM OF THE WORK The study compare luteal phase ( early ) administration clomiphene citrate conventional ( late ) administration drug follicular phase regard ovarian response PCOS . Research Question What difference administration clomiphene citrate luteal phase follicular phase ovulation induction woman PCOS ? Research Hypothesis Luteal phase administration clomiphene citrate protocol give good result conventional administration clomiphene citrate follicular phase regard ovarian response PCOS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIM OF THE WORK The study compare luteal phase ( early ) administration clomiphene citrate conventional ( late ) administration drug follicular phase regard ovarian response PCOS . Research Question What difference administration clomiphene citrate luteal phase follicular phase ovulation induction woman PCOS ? Research Hypothesis Luteal phase administration clomiphene citrate protocol give good result conventional administration clomiphene citrate follicular phase regard ovarian response PCOS . Subjects method Study design : This prospective crossover randomize controlled clinical trial conduct infertility outpatient clinic Ain Shams Maternity Hospital . Sample size calculation : The required sample size estimate use G*Power© software ( Institut für Experimentelle Psychologie , Heinrich Heine Universität , Düsseldorf , Germany ) version 3.1.7 . The primary outcome measure total number follicle , number follicle &gt; 14 mm diameter , number follicle &gt; 18 mm diameter . The secondary outcome measure endometrial thickness . A previous study report mean ( ±SD ) total number follicle 5.1 ( ±0.41 ) follicles early CC protocol compare 2.8 ( ±3.1 ) follicles late CC protocol ( Badawy et al. , 2009 ) . The study Badawy et al ( 2009 ) report mean ( ±SD ) number follicle &gt; 14 mm diameter 3.0 ( ±0.28 ) follicles 1.5 ( ±0.18 ) follicles early CC late CC protocol , respectively . The mean ( ±SD ) number follicle &gt; 18 mm diameter report 2.1 ( ±0.15 ) follicles 1.3 ( ±0.32 ) follicles early CC late CC protocol , respectively . As regard endometrial thickness hCG administration , mean ( ±SD ) thickness 9.1 ( ±0.23 ) mm versus 8.2 ( ±0.6 ) mm early CC late CC protocol , respectively . According Badawy et al . ( 2009 ) , report difference two protocol regard total number follicle , number follicle &gt; 14 mm diameter , number follicle &gt; 18 mm diameter , endometrial thickness translate huge effect size ( Cohen 's ) = 6.3 , = 6.4 , = 3.2 , = 1.98 , respectively . The effect size ( ) calculate follow : d= ( ( x1-x2 ) ) /sp , ( x1 - x2 ) difference mean two protocol sp pool standard deviation . Consequently , estimate sample 45 patient per group would achieve power 80 % ( type II error = 0.2 ) detect medium-to-large effect size = 0.6 regard primary outcome measure . This effect size select may consider clinically relevant difference seek . The test statistic use two-sided test significance target 95 % confidence level ( type I error = 0.05 ) . Randomization method Sample randomization do use ( Random Allocation Software , Version 1.0 ) ( Table 1 . ) Statistical method Statistical analysis do personal computer use IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 21 ( IBM© Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Data collect , tabulate analyzed use appropriate statistical test . The D'Agostino-Pearson test use test normality numerical data distribution . Numerical data present mean standard deviation ( normally distribute ) median interquartile range ( skew ) . Categorical data present number percentage ratio . The Student test use compare normally distributed numerical data . For skewed data , Mann-Whitney U test use . The chi square test ( Fisher 's exact test , appropriate ) use compare categorical data P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Inclusion Criteria Women age 20-40 year old . Patients diagnosis PCOS base 2003 ESHRE/ASRM ( Rotterdam ) criterion : include two follow , addition exclusion relate disorder : Oligo / anovulation Hyperandrogenism and/or Hyperandrogenemia Polycystic ovary U/S i.e . least one ovary show either 1 - 12 follicle ( 2-9 mm diameter ) ovarian volume &gt; 10 mm . Exclusion Criteria Age &lt; 20 &gt; 40 . Major pelvic pathology . Ovarian mass . Infertility due cause ovarian factor e.g . Bilateral tubal block Congenital anomaly uterus Male factor infertility Liver disease Other endocrinopathies e.g . hyperprolactinemia , Lipoid Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia ( LCAH ) , hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism Cushing 's disease . Data Collection Schedule Enrollment ( recruitment ) Data : Following admission study , case record form ( CRF 1 ) fill , include demographic information , entail patient 's age , parity , medical surgical history , indication surgery . Consent take every patient detail explanation study . Pregnancy test do measure serum human chorionic gonadotropin exclude pregnancy . Basic investigation do , , start trial include , serum Follicle stimulate hormone , serum Luteinizing hormone , serum Prolactin , serum Estradiol . Subjects ask contact investigator present assign one CC administration two protocol accord computer-generated randomization plan . Each patient Case Record Form ( CRF II ) data record . Subjects divide two group : Group 1 ( study group ) : include 45 patient 100 mg CC administrate daily five day start next day finish MPA ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) 10 mg tablet five day , one menstrual cycle , wash period another menstrual cycle , group treatment plan shift administration 100 mg CC daily five day start day 2 cycle induce MPA another menstrual cycle . Group 2 ( control group ) : include 45 patient 100 mg CC administrate daily five day start day 2 cycle induce MPA , one menstrual cycle , wash period another menstrual cycle , group treatment plan shift administration 100 mg CC daily five day start next day finish MPA ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) 10 mg tablet five day another menstrual cycle . Fig . 2 : Crossover study design On day 14 cycle , patient study group monitor transvaginal ultrasound mean follicular volume ( folliculometry ) endometrial thickness . Results : Results tabulate statistically analyze accord Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) guideline .
