	<brief_summary>This study evaluate role increase radiotherapy dose addition nelfinavir chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) patient inoperable pancreatic cancer spread beyond pancreas . Currently United Kingdom ( UK ) , either chemotherapy alone chemotherapy follow CRT use management inoperable pancreatic cancer spread . CRT consist 25-30 radiotherapy treatment combination chemotherapy . Although treatment effective control local symptom slow pace cancer , case unable shrink enough make operable . Some reason could lack oxygen lack blood flow within tumour make resistant effect CRT . This study investigate whether increase dose radiotherapy , increase oxygen blood supply tumour give nelfinavir , combination , improve outcome . We also want know additional toxicity intensive approach . All participant initially receive 12 week chemotherapy , stable respond disease receive study treatment . The treatment allocation 1 5 option outline do random computer neither doctor patient choose treatment option . The process randomisation ensure treatment arm equally balance term patient tumour characteristic , reduce possibility bias . The study consist 2 stage . In 1st stage aim find right dose nelfinavir combine CRT , require around 27 participant 18 receive nelfinavir together CRT . In 2nd stage , want find benefit approach standard treatment therefore recruit order 262 participant allocate 170 1 5 follow treatment arm : Arm A : Nelfinavir together CRT Arm B : CRT ( without nelfinavir ) Arm C : Nelfinavir together CRT ( use high conventional dose radiotherapy ) Arm D : CRT without nelfinavir ( use high conventional dose radiotherapy ) Arm E : Chemotherapy alone ( without radiotherapy ) Participants ineligible refuse randomisation treat per local standard remain study follow 26 , 39 52 week . Their data contribute Overall Survival ( OS ) analysis .</brief_summary>
