	<brief_summary>Lung cancer common cancer men fourth common cancer woman worldwide . Until today effective method permit early detection lung cancer . Consequently , lung cancer often diagnose owe symptom advanced disease . To address problem , detection method improve sensitivity specificity urgently need . Over past decade , accumulate evidence show metabolism cancer cell differs normal cell . More specifically , entire metabolism cancer cell reorganize reprogrammed increase anabolic reaction induce cell growth survival . Metabolic reprogramming development cancer drive aberrant signaling pathway due activation oncogene loss tumor suppressor gene . Furthermore , microenvironment tumor play role metabolic reprogramming . The altered cancer metabolism characterize increased glycolysis , production lactate biosynthesis macromolecule , protein , lipid nucleotide . Cancer cell high glycolytic rate eliminate glucose-derived carbon lactate rather oxidize completely via oxidative phosphorylation , phenomenon know Warburg effect . The breakdown glucose nutrient lead high energy production provide Krebs cycle intermediate , consequently allocate metabolic pathway support biosynthesis . Metabolites end product cellular metabolism therefore closely related observe phenotype . Disturbances biochemical pathway occur development cancer consequently provoke change metabolic phenotype . As result , low-molecular weight metabolite attractive biomarkers different cancer type . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy enable identification quantitative analysis complex mixture metabolite , plasma serum , without extend sample preparation . The present study aim determine metabolic phenotype lung cancer mean proton ( 1H ) -NMR spectroscopy . Once phenotype determine ( train cohort ) , validate independent cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LC-NMR Study Biomarkers Detect Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Subjects lung cancer detect compute tomography ( CT ) -scan refer positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT-scan include . The diagnosis lung cancer confirm mean pathological biopsy medical doctor specialize oncology respect radiological clinical data . The control group consist subject refer department Nuclear Medicine examination heart . This control group represent average population , consist healthy subject patient non-cancer disease undergo PET/CT-scan . Exclusion criterion follow : ( 1 ) fast least 6 hour , ( 2 ) poorly control diabetes ( fast plasma glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl ) cancer patient , ( 3 ) medication intake day blood sampling ( 4 ) treatment history cancer precede 5 year . The training cohort consist 80 subject lung cancer 80 control . The validation cohort consist 250 subject lung cancer 250 control . Blood sample process Fasting venous blood sample ( BD Vacutainer® LH 17 I.U . 10 ml tube ) collect stored 4°C within 5 10 minute . Around 8 hour blood collection , blood sample transport crushed ice central laboratory centrifuge room temperature ( swing bucket centrifuge , 1600 g , 15 minute ) . Subsequently , 4 plasma aliquot 500 µl transfer sterile cryovials store -80°C examination within 6 month . When subject give permission store biological material , 3 aliquot store University Biobank Limburg ( UBiLim ) biomedical research purpose . Prior NMR analysis , plasma aliquot thaw homogenize use vortex mixer . After centrifugation 13000 g 4 minute 4°C ( fix rotor Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 R , Hamburg , Germany ) , plasma aliquot dilute deuterium oxide ( D2O , 99.9 % , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc , Andover , USA ) contain 180 µg/µl trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid ( TSP , 98 % , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc , Andover , USA ) chemical shift reference . Finally , prepare plasma sample transfer 5 mm NMR tube analyze . 1H-NMR analysis assignment present resonance The 1H-NMR spectrum record 400 Megahertz ( MHz ) NMR spectrometer ( Varian/Agilent , Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments , Palo Alto , California , USA ) magnetic field strength 9.4 Tesla 294 K. Slightly T2- weight spectra acquire use Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill ( CPMG ) pulse sequence attenuate signal macromolecule , protein polysaccharide . Additionally , water suppression perform order allow optimal detection quantification low-molecular weight metabolite . The 1H-NMR spectrum phase manually , baseline correct referenced TSP resonance 0.015 part per million ( ppm ) . The assignment present 1H-NMR resonance occurs mean spike experiment . A reference plasma sample alternately spike 34 know metabolite concentration 1 mg compound per 100 µl plasma . The obtained chemical shift double check Chenomx NMR suite software ( Version 7.5 , Chenomx Inc. , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) . Finally , 1H-NMR spectrum divide 112 spectral region , integrate normalized relative total integrated area spectral region , irrespective remain water , TSP , fructose glucose resonance . The end result correspond 110 normalized integration region ( integration region except water TSP ) . Statistical analysis At first , integration value 110 spectral region analyze mean student t-test correction multiple test Benjamini-Hochberg identify differ significantly lung cancer patient control ( IBM SPSS Version 20.0 , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . Secondly , multivariate statistical analysis perform use SIMCA-P+ ( Version 12.0 , Umetrics , Umea , Sweden ) investigate whether metabolic composition blood plasma allow discriminate lung cancer patient control . An unsupervised principal component analysis ( PCA ) perform identify intrinsic cluster outlier within dataset . After removal outlier ( detect Hotelling 's T2 range plot ) , orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA ) , extension partial least square discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA ) integrate orthogonal signal correction filter , perform remove variability relevant class separation . The predicted classification express specificity ( percentage control actually classify control ) sensitivity ( percentage lung cancer patient actually classified lung cancer patient ) . The outcome use integration value significantly different spectral region , obtain student t-test correction multiple test Benjamini-Hochberg , compare outcome integration value 110 spectral region use .</detailed_description>
