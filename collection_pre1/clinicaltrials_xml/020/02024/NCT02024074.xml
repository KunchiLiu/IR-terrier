	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate usefulness Tc-99m Sestamibi Molecular Breast Imaging image modality breast cancer screen . Tc-MBI show significantly high sensitivity equivalent specificity detection breast cancer among high risk woman compare mammography . However , little publish data compare Tc-MBI MRI evaluate extent disease woman know breast cancer . The study target twenty ( 20 ) woman newly diagnose breast cancer schedule undergo biopsy additional suspicious lesion identify standard care contrast- enhance breast MRI . Prior biopsy , subject receive Tc-MBI scan breast . The result image method compare histological finding . These result may use design large comprehensive study overarch goal determine role Tc-MBI pre-operative evaluation patient know breast cancer .</brief_summary>
