Serious infection ( e.g . meningitis , sepsis , pyelonephritis , pneumonia ) rare , impact quite large ( increased morbidity , mortality , induce fear parent defensive behaviour clinician ) . Early recognition adequate referral serious infection essential avoid complication ( e.g . hearing loss bacterial meningitis ) accompany mortality . Secondly , aim reduce number investigation , referral , treatment hospitalisation child diagnose non-serious infection . Apart cost-effectiveness , could lead less traumatic experience child less fear induction concern parent . Finally , aim support clinician rationalise antibiotic prescribing behaviour , result reduction antibiotic resistance long run .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimising Diagnosis Antibiotic Prescribing Acutely Ill Children Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study combination diagnostic intervention study . In previous study , research team construct decision tree , base sign symptom , identify serious infection acutely ill child primary care . This decision tree excellent sensitivity 97 % detection serious infection , would lead 12 % acutely ill child refer , unacceptably high . Our main research question : 1 . In addition measure clinical sign symptom , new exist technology help identify serious infection acutely ill child ambulatory care ? Translated study design : `` After apply decision tree , reduce number false positive ( thus increase specificity ) maintain level sensitivity C-reactive Protein Point-of-Care test pulse oximetry ? 2 . After exclude child serious illness apply decision tree , Point-of-Care CRP test , brief intervention together parent leaflet , , effect : A . Primary outcome measure : 1 . Serious infection 2 . Immediate antibiotic prescribing rate B . Secondary outcome measure : 3 . Parental satisfaction 4 . Parental concern 5 . Use diagnostic test medical service ( include re-consultation ) 6 . Cost-effectiveness 7 . Impact communicator style effect intervention ( interaction ) Serious infection define : A hospital admission 24 hour diagnosis : 1 . Sepsis ( include bacteraemia ) pathogenic bacteria isolated haemoculture reference standard 2 . Meningitis ( viral bacterial ) positive lumbar puncture ( pleocytosis cerebrospinal fluid identification bacteria virus ) reference standard 3 . Abscess ( positive culture ) 4 . Pneumonia ( viral bacterial ) infiltrate see chest x-ray reference standard 5 . Osteomyelitis ( pathogens bone aspirate reference standard , unavailable MRI bone scan suggestive osteomyelitis ) 6 . Cellulitis ( acute suppurative inflammation subcutaneous tissue ) 7 . Gastro-enteritis dehydration 8 . Complicated urinary tract infection ( positive urine culture ( &gt; 105/ml pathogen single specie ) systemic effect fever ) 9 . Viral respiratory tract infection complicate hypoxia ( e.g . bronchiolitis ) This combination ( I ) diagnostic study ambulatory care ( consist general practitioner ambulatory paediatrician ) identify diagnostic value sign , symptom technological test use hospital admission 24 hour serious infection main outcome ( II ) open , randomise , control trial randomisation practice level . Clinicians allocate 1 4 intervention group ( table 1 ) : These intervention perform child test negative decision tree : 1 . Use C-reactive protein ( CRP ) point care test brief intervention parent leaflet 2 . Use C-reactive protein point care test 3 . Brief intervention parent leaflet 4 . Usual care All clinician train properly perform point-of-care CRP test . When child test positive 5-stage decision tree , point-of-care CRP test perform 4 intervention group . Only clinicians group 1 3 trained brief intervention handle parent information leaflet . All clinician ask measure oxygen saturation mean paediatric finger pulse oximeter , provide physician . 2.1 Randomisation To avoid contamination , cluster randomise study design choose . Each cluster make one practice . A minimum condition participate practice able recruit 36 child 1 year . A first randomisation procedure create 2 group : CRP point care test testing . A second randomisation procedure create 2 group : brief intervention parent information leaflet communication-intervention . To ensure good balance different practice structure ( solo versus duo/group/community health centre ) practice type ( general versus paediatric practice ) recruitment arm , randomisation process stratify . 2.2 Sample size calculation A . Diagnostic part Based binomial distribution , expect sensitivity 97 % minimal acceptable low confidence limit 85 % , minimal number case 59 , take account non-monotonic nature power function sample size due discreteness binomial distribution . [ 17 ] The number control , derive formula Ncontrols =Ncases [ ( 1-Prev ) /Prev ] , [ 18 ] 7316 prevalence 0.8 % 6497 prevalence 0.9 % . A recent developed nomogram calculate sample size diagnostic study useful , prevalences 0.01 computed nomogram . [ 19 ] B . Therapeutic part In order detect absolute reduction antibiotic prescribe 15 % ( 40 % 25 % ) , 80 % power 5 % significance level , individually randomise study need 656 patient ( 164 patient per group , 4 group ) . If randomise 72 practice intracluster correlation coefficient ( icc ) 0.06 , number increase total 1368 patient ( 19 patient per cluster ) . In order allow 90 % follow-up rate primary outcome measure antibiotic prescribing , least 70 % well recruiting practice , need recruit 2184 patient ( 104 practice , 21 per practice 546 patient cell ) . 2.3 Practices We intend recruit 92 general practice 12 paediatric practice . In every group practice , least 2 practitioner recruit . The recruited practice situate throughout Flanders , urban rural area . Physicians exclude assumption consecutive inclusion violate ( inclusion less two child 1 month time ) . Physicians ask complete survey communication skill stratify intervention group , accord communicator style . After formal approval , physician ask provide u late report antibiotic prescribe profile , provide Belgian National Health Disability Insurance ( RIZIV ) . 2.4 Patients Patients age 1 month 16 year acute illness maximum 5 day include consecutively . Children exclude acute episode cause merely traumatic neurological illness , intoxication , psychiatric behavioural problem without somatic cause , exacerbation know chronic condition . If physician include child twice study within 5 day , second registration consider repeated measurement subject subsequently exclude analysis . 2.5 CRP point care test A pilot study perform determine user-friendliness , technical accuracy , inter-device inter-observer variability select point-of-care CRP device . Based recent horizon scan report Monitoring Diagnosis Group Oxford ( Department Primary Health Care ) thorough review exist technology point-of-care CRP device industry contact , assemble up-to-date list available device . For use child sample size le 5 µl test duration le 5 minute . Two point-of-care CRP device ( Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer Axis-Shield LifeAssays™ Reader LifeAssays ) meet criterion include pilot study . We evaluate device base criterion : device start-up , test duration , sample size , test characteristic , calibration , measure range , handle test tube , fill capillary , place test cartridge , test record additional material usage . CRP value measure two different point-of-care CRP device 100 child compare laboratory CRP result hospitalise child child consult outpatient paediatric clinic university hospital . To verify whether device user-friendly reliable , CRP measurement perform child adult attend 5 General Practice surgeries 2 different Point-of-Care CRP device . The inter-device ( 1 physician ) inter-observer ( two physician ) variability test 10 patient one GP surgery two different POC device brand . During pilot study , one device fail meet standard user-friendliness test accuracy deem unsuitable use study . ( LifeAssays™ Reader ) A perfect correlation find result point-of-care CRP device ( Afinion™ Analyzer ) laboratory result . No significant inter-observer inter-device variability find . The device well receive user score high user-friendliness . All clinician CRP test device ( Afinion™ , Axis-Shield ) disposal . CRP analysis perform consultation accordance manufacturer 's instruction . The Afinion™ CRP Test Cartridge consist 1.5 µL glass capillary fill blood finger prick reagent container . First , sample automatically dilute liquid also lyses blood cell . If sample whole blood , haematocrit value estimate transmission measurement haemoglobin . In case , measure CRP value automatically correct accord sample 's haematocrit ( Hct ) level , result display serum-CRP concentration . Then , sample mixture aspirate membrane coat anti-CRP antibody , CRP sample concentrate onto membrane . The conjugate solution contain anti-CRP antibody label ultra-small gold particle suck membrane . The gold-antibody conjugate bind immobilized CRP membrane , turn red-brown . Excess gold-antibody conjugate remove washing solution . The analyser measure colour intensity membrane , proportional amount CRP sample . The CRP concentration display screen . The result available within 4 minute . The CRP measuring range 8-200 mg/L . The result display interval 1 mg/L . If CRP concentration whole blood sample exceed range 8-200 mg/L , CRP &gt; 200 mg/L display screen . The haematocrit measure range 20-60 % . If Hct value outside range , information code display screen . For internal quality control positive measure confirm efficacy correct performance test begin middle study period . The CRP point care test perform case positive decision tree ( irrespective intervention group ) also case negative decision tree clinician intervention group 1 2 . Because reliable cut-off point CRP know currently ( aim study ) acute infection child primary care ( referral , prescription antibiotic ) , clinicians give guidance interpretation CRP result . We impose restriction clinician treatment , technical investigation referral . The device distributor provide technical assistance . All clinician train use CRP device prior start study . 2.6 Finger Pulse Oximeter All physicians ask perform measurement oxygen saturation child enter result case report form . The selected device clip-on system suitable use child , measure oxygen saturation capillary blood well pulse rate . 2.7 Brief intervention parent information leaflet Brief intervention commonly use give opportunistic advice , discussion , negotiation encouragement . Mostly take 5 10 minute . The effect brief intervention study extensively area smoking cessation , alcohol misuse increase physical activity . We use brief intervention technique serve another purpose , namely change patient 's , rather clinician 's behaviour . Our goal reduce number antibiotic prescription . As described , parent lot concern illness child mostly succeed communicate concern clearly physician . Our hypothesis clinician sometimes feel , although try reassure parent child get well symptomatic treatment , convince enough prescribe antibiotic reach adequate reassurance whenever slight doubt exist child benefit medication . To meet gap , develop brief intervention : 'll ask clinician ask 3 specific question , namely `` Are concern ? `` , `` What exactly concern ? '' `` Why concern ? '' . This intervention easy implement daily practice additional training require . Secondly , aim reduce improper demand antibiotic parent . As described , parent contact clinician feel lose control illness , e.g . child high fever get , child n't stop cry , n't want eat sleep anymore . Mostly already try method reduce fever symptom , fail take control situation . They still believe antibiotic strong medication get hope get clinician visit . We develop parent information leaflet give information child ill , sign important follow really get advice clinician . This could make easy cope ill child . The clinician could use leaflet give advice make clear re-consult physician re-evaluate child . Our hypothesis create safety net , improper demand antibiotic could reduce . 2.8 Data collection Acutely ill child ( 0 16 year old ) present ambulatory care ( general practitioner paediatrician ) ask participate trial . Eligible child ( applicable ) parent receive information leaflet . The clinician ask sign inform consent form . Every participate child allocate individual research number . Only number , name child , mention registration form ensure anonymity . Only clinician research assistant know child correlate number . This needed ensure follow child . The name child mention database scientific publication . During history taking , clinician participate group 1 group 3 ask brief intervention question . After thorough clinical examination , include measurement oxygen saturation , clinician run decision tree . If child score positive , execute POC-CRP-test . If child score negative , intervention depend intervention arm : clinician participate group 1 2 execute POC-CRP-test anyway , clinician participate group 1 3 hand parent information leaflet clinician participate group 4 pursue usual care . The clinician record gather data , work diagnosis plan action ( e.g . investigation , treatment ) registration form . After consultation , parent complete survey parental concern satisfaction consultation process clinician 's communication , post seal box clinician 's office . This survey include 26 question `` Parental Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale '' ( 7 point Likert scale ) [ 20 ] , 4 question communication `` Parent 's perception Primary Care item '' ( 5 point Likert scale ) . [ 21 ] Both instrument translate Dutch , ensure forward-back-translation process . After translation , validate pilot study . The parental concern survey develop research team consist 2 Visual Analog Scales concern consultation short questionnaire content concern . This survey also validate pilot study . At end consultation , parent get follow diary , fill daily , namely 4 item scale degree illness ( evaluated parent ) parental concern , fever eating , drinking , cry , play sleep behaviour . Additionally , ask parent complete question educational level , social background whether consult another physician illness episode . If parent score item scale `` problem '' , child consider `` cured '' . At time , 'll ask parent send u short text message . Parents , participate monthly lottery ( motivational gift ) . Parents able forward diary clinical research associate bring GP prepay envelope . Participating clinician complete questionnaire defensive attitude study period . 2.9 Patient follow Our research team register child `` cure '' receive short text message diary . If need , reminder complete study document send post 14 day . If response , research team contact parent telephone ( least 3 attempt ) . In last case , clinician , initially record case , contact verify child completely heal referred hospital . In case referral and/or hospitalisation , primary care hospital clinician contact reconstruct illness episode ( reason referral/hospitalisation , diagnosis , time cure ) . 3.0 Analysis Primary outcome measure : 1 . Immediate antibiotic prescribing rate This registered clinician CRF Chi square Fisher 's exact test determine significance difference result intervention group . The result adjust relevant patient- clinician-based characteristic use multiple logistic regression . 2 . Diagnostic Accuracy 5-stage decision tree add value technology ( point-of-care CRP test oxygen saturation ) The diagnostic accuracy 5-stage decision tree test reported sensitivity , specificity , positive negative likelihood ratio , positive negative predictive value . Whenever possible , Receiver Operation Characteristic ( ROC ) curve plot . The value point-of-care CRP test oxygen saturation add 5-stage decision tree compare result 5-stage decision tree alone , determine add value add technology term sensitivity , specificity , positive negative likelihood ratio , positive negative predictive value . Secondary outcome measure : 3 . Parental satisfaction This register parent questionnaire ( see ) . The result compare intervention group , evaluate significance Chi square Fisher 's exact test . 4 . Parental concern This register parent parental concern satisfaction survey ( see ) . The result compare intervention group , evaluate significance Chi square Fisher 's exact test . 5 . Use diagnostic test medical service ( include re-consultation ) This registered clinician CRF check research team . ( include number re-consultations ) The time complete cure evaluate registration parent fever diary check research team . The result compare intervention group , evaluate significance Chi square Fisher 's exact test . 6 . Cost-effectiveness A preliminary cost-effectiveness study perform evaluate cost relate use diagnostic test medical service hospital cost compare cost apply request intervention possible effect antibiotic prescribing rate . 7 . Influence communicator style effect intervention ( interaction ) This registered clinician communication survey . The result stratify accord communicator style compare intervention group , evaluate significance Chi square Fisher 's exact test .</detailed_description>
