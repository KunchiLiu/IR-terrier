	<brief_summary>The purpose research investigate effectiveness community health worker-based program adjunct clinical service regard childhood obesity management . This family-centered program deliver community home enrolled family . The primary outcome compare change age-gender specific body-mass-index ( BMI ) z-score ( zBMI ) time . All Denver Health child family enrol study inception receive intervention 1 5 define 6-month stepped wedge engagement . The intervention last 6 month time prior engagement intervention serve control period . Intervention construct validity evaluate use data diet , activity , fitness . The primary goal examine effect intervention reduce zBMI index patient secondarily participate family member . We test effectiveness among demographic group under-represented prior study , include young child Latinos . Results study inform future intervention modification permit effect size estimation power calculation future randomize trial include community health worker-based obesity prevention treatment program . During course study , obesity registry design implement within integrated safety-net healthcare system measure primary obesity outcomes low-income population conduct analysis . The community health worker use several new technology ( e.g. , text message patient relationship manager [ PRM ] ) adjunct work obese child his/her family . Targeted training client , provider CHW part prevention strategy implement grant period , include motivational interviewing . All ( i.e. , obesity registry , technology train ) evaluative component .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : Design , conduct evaluate pilot community health worker ( CHW ) feasibility study family least one overweight/obese child , target change primary obesity outcome ( i.e. , zBMI health behavior use `` 5-2-1-0 '' target ) . 1 . To determine effect community health worker mediate childhood obesity prevention program family BMI overweight obese ( O/O ) child age 2-6 year The study sample size select power evaluate specific aim 1.a . 1 . Hypothesis : Compared child receive delayed-intervention , high proportion O/O child intervention group experience &gt; 0.1 zBMI decrease zBMI -age/gender 12 month period . 2 . Hypothesis : Within individual subject , compare zBMI measurement 12-24 month prior , O/O child average experience decrease slope BMI trajectory &gt; 0.1 zBMI per year start intervention . 2 . To determine effect intervention physical activity eat behavior index patient family member summarize `` 5-2-1-0 '' daily target ( i.e. , 5 fruit vegetable , le 2 hour screen time , 1 hour exercise 0 sweeten drink ) . a. Hypothesis : Compared baseline measure child receive delayed-intervention , high proportion O/O child intervention group experience improvement `` 5-2-1-0 '' measure 12 month period . 3 . To determine effect intervention change parent skill evaluate effect intervention weight-related quality life measure parent O/O child 2-6 year . 1 . Hypothesis : Compared baseline measurement , score validate parent style questionnaire high end 6 month intervention . Secondary Aims : 1 . Design implement obesity registry functionality within integrated safety-net healthcare system measure primary obesity outcomes low-income population . . What experience clinicians administrator use registry program ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ? 2 . Design , deploy evaluate technology ( e.g. , text message patient relationship manager [ PRM ] ) aid CHW work obese child his/her family . 1 . What experience family patient use text messaging patient relationship manager program ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ? 2 . What experience CHW use text messaging patient relationship manager program ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ? 3 . What experience provider clinician receive used summary text message patient relationship manager program ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ? 4 . What experience CHW use hand-held device record information field ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ? 3 . Design , deliver evaluate target training client , provider CHW enhance obesity clinical prevention strategy , include motivational interviewing . 1 . What experience client , provider CHW train obesity clinical prevention strategy ? Was feasible acceptable implementation operation ? What area improvement barrier effective use ?</detailed_description>
