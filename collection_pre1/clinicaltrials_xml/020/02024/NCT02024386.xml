Riociguat novel agent Bayer Pharmaceuticals already demonstrate effectiveness treatment pulmonary hypertension , may prove beneficial case altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension HAPE . This research study , compose 20 healthy volunteer age 18-40 year , attempt mimic decrease oxygen supply elevate pulmonary artery pressure find condition high altitude , allow observation effect riociguat exercise pulmonary arterial pressure , arterial oxygenation , exercise performance . Prior enter hypobaric chamber , subject radial arterial line pulmonary artery catheter place obtain arterial pulmonary artery pressure measurement . Subjects enter hypobaric chamber perform exercise tolerance test simulate altitude 15,000 foot electrically brake ergometer ( exercise bike ) administration riociguat . If , administration riociguat exposure simulate altitude 15,000 foot , exercise performance improve observed pulmonary artery pressure low measurement see prior administration riociguat , could lead development prophylactic and/or treatment strategy HAPE high-altitude pulmonary hypertension .

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Impairment exercise performance hypoxemia due altitude exposure lung disease cause primarily reduce oxygen delivery exercise muscle , due reduction arterial oxygen content . This reduction arterial oxygen content due reduce alveolar PO2 ventilation/perfusion ( VA/Q ) mismatch , extent alveolar end-capillary diffusion impairment . Ultimately , hypoxemia result secondary diffuse pulmonary vasoconstriction ( hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction , HPV ) , turn cause pulmonary hypertension . This secondary pulmonary hypertension believe worsen VA/Q mismatch , reduce PO2 , suggest pharmacologic blockade HPV could increase PO2 ( e.g . altitude exposure ) thus improve exercise performance . Reduction pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) individual susceptible high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) could also facilitate prevention treatment HAPE . Sildenafil commonly use treat pulmonary hypertension , include pulmonary hypertension occurs due altitude exposure , variable success treat case altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension HAPE . Sildenafil work via blockade block phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE-5 ) pulmonary arteriole , cause increase cGMP . When cGMP activate nitric oxide ( NO ) induce vasodilatation , indeed , sildenafil administration altitude exposure increase arterial oxygenation slightly . However , attempt block HPV sildenafil use pathway require NO realize sufficient NO available produce cGMP . During hypoxia endogenous level NO deplete due impaired endothelial NO synthesis . This may explain inconsistent effect sildenafil use improve oxygenation performance altitude . Endogenous concentration unbound NO actually quite low , biological effect NO mediated formation S-nitrosothiols ( SNOs ) S-nitrosohemoglobin ( SNO-Hb ) . NO binds hemoglobin PO2-dependent manner , form SNO-Hb PO2 low , NO-Hb binding less avid SNO-Hb deplete . Depletion SNO-Hb hypoxia propose mechanism augments HPV , indeed hypoxia show induce low level SNO-Hb . It quite possible reduction available endogenous NO depletion SNO-Hb hypoxia limit effect cGMP mechanism sildenafil work . Thus , agent activate cGMP period hypoxia NO SNO-Hb deplete effective treat altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension . Riociguat stimulator soluble guanylate cyclase bypass NO pathway currently approve FDA treatment pulmonary hypertension . Riociguat exhibit dual mode action . ) stabilize reduced form nitrosyl-heme complex , enhance NO-cGMP signal pathway absence endogenous NO ii . ) act synergy endogenous NO increase sGC sensitivity NO . Essentially , riociguat stimulates sGC produce cGMP absence NO , mechanism pulmonary vascular resistance could attenuate altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension . It recently show augment exercise performance decrease pulmonary artery pressure primary pulmonary hypertension pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) due chronic thromboembolic disease . Lowering pulmonary artery pressure could improve pulmonary gas exchange performance altitude , significant implication live altitude , conduct military operation , altitude trekker high-altitude rescue team . Direct stimulation sGC also represent promise alternative therapeutic strategy susceptible high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) current treatment modality nifedipine sildenafil ineffective oxygen unavailable . By combination sildenafil , riociguat could produce significant advance exercise performance altitude exposure provide substantial improvement current therapeutic option prevention treatment HAPE . Design Procedures : This investigation consist 20 normal subject . Medical screen exclude cardiac pulmonary disease , pregnancy sickle cell disease/trait African Americans . Subjects instrumented radial arterial line pulmonary artery catheter perform VO2 max test bicycle ergometer hypobaric chamber simulate altitude 15,000 foot . Following VO2 max test , subject return ground level 3-hour rest period . At 90 minute subject administer riociguat 0.5 mg 1.0 mg orally . Once study subject therapeutic level riociguat ( 30 90 minute oral administration ) , repeat VO2 max test 15,000 foot . The dose riociguat start low recommend individual dose ( 0.5 mg ) first three subject . If side effect clinically important difference either PAP ( 5 mmHg decrease mean PAP ) PaO2 ( 5 mmHg increase ) exercise , remain subject dose increase 1.0 mg. During incremental exercise test arterial mixed blood sample analyze PO2 , PCO2 , pH , O2 saturation hemoglobin . Exhaled gas collect continuously analyze O2 CO2 concentration exhale volume . Cardiac output calculate use Fick . Pulmonary systemic vascular resistance calculate cardiac output intravascular pressure . Outcome measure VO2max , maximum mechanical work rate , pulmonary systemic arterial pressure , cardiac output , oxygen delivery arterial blood gas . Benefits : Further understand mechanism hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction aid prognosis treatment condition increase pulmonary vascular resistance congenital heart disease , pulmonary arterial hypertension , COPD , addition high-altitude pulmonary hypertension high-altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) . Furthermore , current treatment modality HAPE demonstrate variable and/or limit effectiveness , riociguat could potentially use prevent treat HAPE susceptible individual . Additionally , riociguat could substantially improve exercise performance must operate condition high-altitude , conduct military operation work high-altitude rescue team .</detailed_description>
