	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) lead still increase cause disease death worldwide , affect develop develop country . This impart massive burden ill health , turn impose huge healthcare cost society . For effective treatment COPD ( oppose provide short term relief ) early disease must target . The small airway lung ( le 2mm ) first affect COPD , current method assess function relatively insensitive . There therefore need new , accurate method detection small airway dysfunction sensitivity shortterm change regional discrimination . In previous study hyperpolarised ( HP ) 3He MRI smoker normal pirometry patient early stage COPD , show sensitivity early change lung ventilation structure . The hyperpolarised gas MRI technique safe . In particular , lack ionize radiation permit patient imaged multiple occasion . This inherent sensitivity regional lung ventilation function make ideal image tool assessment novel lung therapy diseases small airway . The purpose pilot study determine short long term reproducibility comprehensive set functional imaging data; use hyperpolarised gas MRI , conventional MRI lung physiology measurement patient moderate severe COPD . In addition , sensitive image technique change lung function treatment standard ( bronchodilator ) inhaler also assess . This pilot study serve platform future large scale study , aim well understand intervention early COPD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female adult age ≥40 year , sign Informed Consent Form prior initiation study related procedure . Current exsmokers smoke history least 10 pack year . ( Ten pack year define 20 cigarette day 10 year , 10 cigarette day 20 year etc . ) Clinical diagnosis COPD post bronchodilator FEV1 3080 % personal predict , accord GOLD ( Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ) guideline . Patients contraindication MRI scanning : i.e . patient non MRI compatible ( ferromagnetic metallic implant , pacemaker ) per MRI questionnaire use clinical practice Unit Academic Radiology , Royal Hallamshire Hospital , unable tolerate MRI . Patients renal condition ( describe GdDTPA ( Gadovist ) Summary Product Characteristics ) administration GdDTPA MR vascular contrast agent would pose risk . Patients contraindicate treatment , history reactions/ hypersensitivity follow inhaled drug , drug similar class component thereof : long short act beta2 agonist sympathomimetic amine lactose excipients Resting oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % air determine pulse oximetry . Women child bear potential , use effective method contraception . Pregnant woman nurse mother ( pregnancy confirm positive urine pregnancy test ) . Inability understand comply study procedure ; include patient unable use dry powder inhaler ( e.g . single dose dry powder inhaler Aerolyzer® ) device . Significant pulmonary pathology COPD . Previous lung surgery . Patients take oral theophylline , PDE4 inhibitor leukotriene antagonist , maintenance treatment oral steroid . Patients participate active phase supervise pulmonary rehabilitation program . Patients history long QT syndrome whose QTc measure ( Fridericia method ) prolong ( &gt; 450 m male female ) history dysrhythmia establish chronic atrial fibrillation . Subjects unstable cardiac disease opinion investigator expose significant additional risk . . Heart failure either unstable predominant cause subject 's dyspnea . Patients , judgment investigator , clinically relevant laboratory abnormality clinically significant condition ( limited ) : Any condition might compromise patient safety compliance , interfere evaluation , preclude completion study . Use investigational drug time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives study enrollment ( whichever longer ) . Patients unable use dry powder inhaler ( e.g . single dose dry powder inhaler Aerolyzer® ) device .</criteria>
