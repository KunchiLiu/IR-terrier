	<brief_title>Efficacy Chewing Sugarless Gum Reduction Orthodontic Appliance Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To characterize intensity dynamic pain experienced patient follow orthodontic appliance placement activation use set Visual Analogue pain scale diaries 2 . To determine whether chew sugarless gum 3 time per day ( use non-analgesic mouthwash ) reduce orthodontic pain compare use mouthwash ( placebo ) Importance : Pain orthodontic treatment affect orthodontic patient . Learning nature timing pain help clinician give patient scientific , evidence-based informed consent . If chew gum find reduce pain , would validate common clinical advice scientific evidence . We also establish non-pharmacological option pain reduction orthodontic treatment . If chew gum find reduce pain ( found increase ) , advise patient use advise clinician recommend . Research Methodology Inclusion criterion : - Comprehensive fix upper lower orthodontic treatment schedule - Age patient 10-35 Exclusion Criteria : - Partial engagement teeth - The use functional extra-oral appliance - Patients regular pain medication - Patient experience chronic pain - Patients unable consume sugarless gum health reason e.g . phenyl ketone urea Patients mental cognitive impairment Group Assignment : For sample size estimation use standard deviation 20 ( take consideration several previous study investigator ) , effect size 15 , significance level 0.05 , power 0.8 . It indicate need 58 subject total . Based , goal include 80 subject anticipation possible drop-outs . Patients randomly assign one two group : chew gum group control mouthwash group . Study kit number accord random number table . Forty kit contain instruction supply chew gum group forty contain instruction supply control group . Assignment do immediately orthodontic appliance place . Operators blind group assignment do separate investigator . This investigator administer patient consent form give instruction accord group assignment . The investigator give participant pre- randomized study kit contain VAS booklet either enough serving chew gum container mouthwash container mouthwash correspond verbal write instruction . Materials use : We provide chew gum group subject enough serving Wrigley 's extra sugar-free chewing gum ( extra piece backup ) . The chew gum use Mentos 3D contains sorbitol xylitol ( non-hard coat type use ) . The mouth wash use group Plax SensitiveTM fluoride contain mouthwash alcohol free cause significantly less burning sensation regular mint mouthwash . The mouthwash supply subject unlabeled container work placebo . The subject tell regular mouthwash pain reduce effect . Each two group ' subject ignorant group receive whether control group . The VAS pain scale : The VAS pain scale use study comprise 100mm horizontal line one end indicate `` pain '' end indicate `` bad possible pain '' . The patient mark pain scale fitting teeth together . During first day , patient mark scale every 3 hour bedtime start immediately appliance placement . For follow 9 day , patient mark 2 pain scale per day , one scale wake one bedtime . The patient place mark scale accord judgment amount pain experience . The response measure near 0.5mm used pseudo-numerical data . The VAS booklet : Booklets uniquely identify serial number patient phone number . Each booklet pre-randomized assignment either gum group control group . The group assignment serial number indicated booklet cover . After instruction give , booklet cover remove kept close container . The group assignment initially know investigator administers instruction . The remain page booklet identify serial number participant mention group assignment . This way group assignment keep secret operator place appliance , measurement investigator late measure patient ' response . The booklet contain space participant indicate take non-study related medication ( e.g . analgesic ) . A copy booklet include document . Blinding : The design study double blind . Operators place appliance know group patient belong assignment do appliance placement . The investigator measure patient response know group assignment indicate VAS booklet . The patient consider blinded aware group receive use standard mouthwash affect pain . After measurement do booklet cover reunite respective booklet statistical data analysis . Patient Compensation : Patients receive electric toothbrush incentive completing study .</detailed_description>
