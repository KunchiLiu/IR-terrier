	<brief_summary>Paclitaxel chemotherapeutic agent use many common anti-cancer regimen . Its use frequently associate moderate severe muscle joint pain may persist several day treatment . This side effect , know `` Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome , significant impact quality life functional ability receive treatment , alleviate many intervention attempt purpose . Sporadic report suggest drug call gabapentin may effective management adverse effect . Observations practice indicate pregabalin , possess similar biological activity gabapentin , may also useful prevent treat paclitaxel associate myalgia - arthralgia . The current study represent initial evaluation hypothesis pregabalin may beneficial management symptom due `` Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome '' . The investigation carry format small scale , randomize , placebo control trial patient receive paclitaxel course standard treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Use Pregabalin Treatment Taxol Related Arthralgia-Myalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taxane Related Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome : Paclitaxel docetaxel major representative drug class taxanes , agent commonly use treatment variety solid tumor . They interfere mitotic process divide cell stabilize microtubule mainstay treatment lung , breast , ovarian cancer , among others . The adverse side effect associate taxane treatment frequently impair quality life cancer patient occasionally impose discontinuation oncological treatment choice ( Forsyth , Balmaceda et al . 1997 ; Saibil , Fitzgerald et al . 2010 ) . The phenomenon diffuse pain involve joint muscle wake treatment taxanes commonly refer Taxane relate Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome ( noted TAMS ) well know document ( Rowinsky , Chaudhry et al . 1993 ) . It common , apparent recent retrospective study patient treat regimen use breast cancer reveal 80 % incidence taxane relate pain ( Saibil , Fitzgerald et al . 2010 ) . The pain may localize , regional diffuse , commonly back , hip , shoulder , thigh , legs foot ( Loprinzi , Maddocks-Christianson et al . 2007 ) . It usually depict arthralgia-myalgia due difficulty associate clearly either joint muscle ( Loprinzi , Maddocks-Christianson et al . 2007 ) . The nature sensation describe ache , deep pain , often associate radiating , shoot , stab , pulsate element ( Loprinzi , Maddocks-Christianson et al . 2007 ) . The sensation unique quality previously unencountered experiencing , description compatible establish report neuropathic pain . The syndrome may incapacitate intensity , capable imposing day bed restriction suffering . This burden often extend significant others remain care daily need handicap pain . Attempts treatment steroid , non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug opioid analgesic frequently fail produce satisfactory result ( Garrison , McCune et al . 2003 ) . Pregabalin - Basic Pharmacology Potential Treatment TAMS : Pregabalin small molecule establish efficacy treatment neuropathic pain ( Gajraj 2007 ) . It known interact α2-δ subunit voltage gate calcium channel present multiple tissue , prominently brain muscle ( Taylor , Angelotti et al . 2007 ) . Pregabalin rapidly absorb via specialize transport system , reach peak concentration serum circa one hour oral ingestion ( Gajraj 2005 ) . Bioavailability exceed 90 % pharmacokinetic profile linear throughout clinically relevant concentration ( Gajraj 2005 ) . It bind significantly proteins blood stream , undergo modification passage organism , eliminate unchanged urine ( Gajraj 2005 ) . No significant pharmacokinetic interaction report date ( Gajraj 2007 ) . Currently pregabalin use treatment neuropathic pain anti-epileptic agent ( Gajraj 2007 ) . Accumulated evidence supportive high degree safety use , common side effect constitute mild moderate degree dizziness , somnolence , feel drunk , fatigue increase weight ( Harmark , van Puijenbroek et al . 2011 ) . Sporadic report suggest gabapentin may effective alleviate Taxol related arthralgia-myalgia symptom ( Nguyen Lawrence 2004 ) . On ground similar pharmacodynamics ( Bryans Wustrow 1999 ) may hypothesize pregabalin also potential alleviate paclitaxel relate arthralgia-myalgia . Furthermore , observation clinical oncology service supportive hypothesis . Evaluation Taxane Related Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome : Pain constitutes major component Taxane relate Arthralgia-Myalgia Syndrome ( referred TAMS ) ( Garrison , McCune et al . 2003 ) . We propose pregabalin may significantly beneficial effect pain secondary syndrome . Consequently , evaluation pain treatment study drug mean well establish pain score method require . Modern pain research acknowledge subjective complex nature pain complicates assessment . Furthermore , ethical imperative place constraint comparative control serve evaluation novel analgesic intervention ( Silverman , O'Connor et al . 1993 ) . One solution issue , use normalized ordinal evaluation pain analgesic drug consumption around central value manner also account change analgesic drug requirement ( Silverman , O'Connor et al . 1993 ) serve direct assessment study hypothesis . The Integrated Assessment Pain Score Rescue Analgesic Treatment evaluation accord Silverman et al augmented raw pain assessment mean well establish pain score method ( Farrar , Portenoy et al . 2000 ) . Bed restriction direct result TAMS often describe suffer . It hereby propose monitor bed restriction record number hour spend horizontal position time get night 's sleep hour go bed end day . The proposed measure compare number hour spend horizontal position day precede taxane treatment , number hour spent position day high score pain week follow treatment . The sample size calculate serve validation novel measure , effort ass association establish quality-of-life score make . The current proposal focus evaluate intervention potential positive impact quality life individual receive chemotherapy taxanes . The FACT-Taxane scale psychometric tool specifically develop assess impact taxane base treatment ( Cella , Peterman et al . 2003 ) . However , quality life composite measure , require large sample size determine efficacy , therefore serve secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
