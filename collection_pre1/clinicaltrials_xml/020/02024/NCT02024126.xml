There increase evidence exercise therapy effective patient knee OA . However , little knowledge long-term effect type exercise dosage effective . In present clinical trial , Nordic collaborative project researcher different research group Sweden Norway , intend investigate short long-term effect compare high dosage exercise therapy ( treatment last 80 90 min ) vs. relatively low dosage exercise program ( 25 30 min ) patient diagnose knee OA . Patients intervention group receive three treatment week 12 week make total 36 treatment . Primary outcome pain-ratings function ( The Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) ) . Secondary outcome concern various health-ratings objective functional test . Regarding predictor outcome , plan also investigate different psychosocial variable well patient 's belief regard exercise . Patients assess blind assessor inclusion , end intervention ( 3 mo ) , six 12 mo end treatment . We plan include total 200 subject primary health care setting , two Norway two Sweden , radiographic-verified knee OA knee pain decreased function . The patient within 45 85 age group . Patients exclude schedule knee surgery form illness/disease limit exercise tolerance ( e.g . heart disease systemic/metabolic diseases chronic obstructive airway disease ) . A major goal grade exercise perform pain-free close pain-free intervention group . The principle deloading use meet goal use high number repetition set pain modulation .

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis one common form chronic disease adult population , approximately 800 000 people Sweden ( population approximately 9 million people ) suffer disease , cause joint pain , stiffness , swell , loss function sick leave . Studies Sweden , United Kingdom ( UK ) USA show cost osteoarthritis 1-2.5 % GDP . With increase life expectancy general decrease physical activity western industrialize country , expect people suffer disease . In recent international literature review clinical study effectiveness exercise therapy , author conclude evidence therapeutic exercise effective reduce knee pain improve activity daily live . In compilation scientific study Swedish Council Technology Assessment Health Care ( SBU ) , conclude strength flexibility exercise result positive short-term effect compare information . However , currently scientific study evaluate dose-response effect exercise therapy . To improve life quality individual osteoarthritis use exercise therapy primary secondary health care setting , research dose response effect patient osteoarthritis important . This view support various systematic review include report Swedish Council Health Technology Assessment ( SBU ) late compilation . Exercise dosage factor exercise frequency , intensity duration . Recent clinical trial show positive effect short term- ( end intervention ) long term follow ups ( 6- 12 month ) , favor high repetitive high dosage exercise therapy compare relatively low exercise dosage patient long-term subacromial pain patient long term patello femoral pain syndrome . Compared treatment usual , exercise therapy also show effective postsurgical rehabilitation arthroscopic surgery patient knee pain verify ruptured mensicus . In present clinical trial , Nordic collaborative project researcher different research group Sweden Norway , intend investigate short long-term effect compare high dosage exercise therapy versus low repetitive low dosage exercise program patient diagnose knee osteoarthritis . Primary outcome pain ( VAS ) knee function ( The Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) ) . Since unknown patient respond different exercise dosage , also look different prognostic factor related patient ` belief regard exercise therapy well different psychosocial variable anxiety , depression , fear movement , catastrophizing , life satisfaction level self-efficacy . We hope study increase knowledge regard positive negative predictor outcome . Thus , main aim study evaluate two mode exercise therapy focusing exercise dosage ; 1 ) exercise therapy exercise dosage last 80 - 90 minute duration treatment compare ; 2 ) low dosage exercise therapy ( conventional exercise treatment ) last 20-30 minute treatment ) patient long-term knee osteoarthritis . All patient intervention group receive three treatment week 12 week make total 36 treatment . Physiotherapists four different intervention center treat patient exercise intervention . Assessments perform inclusion , end treatment , six 12 month follow . Objective test ( 20 meter walk test , sit stand 30 second maximum number single knee flexion/extension 30 second ) test inclusion end treatment . The tester blind regard intervention group . Questionnaires filled patient inclusion , end treatment , six 12 month follow . To assess possible clinical interesting change start occur three month treatment period , patient fill KOOS ( function ) VAS ( pain ) every 6th treatment make total six measurement intervention period . Patients recruit primary care health care setting Västervik Luleå Sweden Trondheim Mosjöen Norway . Patients inform project verbally also write information . Based information , patient would like participate project , contact local investigation center assess possible inclusion . We plan include total 200 patient radiographic-verified knee osteoarthritis knee pain decreased function . The patient within 45 85 age group , come three treatment week , total 36 treatment 12 week , must treatments organize form exercise therapy knee pain last three month . Patients also exclude schedule knee surgery form illnesses/disease limit exercise tolerance ( e.g . heart disease systemic/metabolic diseases chronic obstructive airway disease ) . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion randomize either high dosage medical exercise therapy low dosage exercise therapy . Each treatment high dosage group ( also call `` Medical Exercise Therapy , MET ) consist 20 minute global exercise ( e.g . stationary cycling ) , four local knee exercise either open close chain perform three set 30 repetition five minute continuous repetition , another five minute cycle follow another four local knee exercise three set 30 repetition five minute continuous repetition finish 10 minute cycle . Each treatment last 80 90 minute . The patient group shall also perform one home exercise every day perform three set five minute deloaded knee extension therabands . In low dosage exercise group patient perform total five exercise ; 10 minute warm use stationary bicycle , four different knee exercise perform two set 10 repetition . Each treatment last 20 30 minute . For patient intervention group method apply test exercise start treatment , grade exercise treatment period . A major goal grade exercise perform pain-free close pain-free intervention group . The exercise standardize exercise program , however individualize grade continuously relation patient 's clinical status . All treatment carry supervision experience skilled physiotherapist . The treat physiotherapist instruct neutral regard beliefs treatment believe effective informing patient ; study compare two different form exercise therapy know one exercise mode well equal effect . The theoretical basis MET exercise progression describe scientific article book chapter . Self-assessed pain , function quality life monitor treatment treatment , six 12 month follow-up . Prognostic marker evaluate follow analyze background information early test result relate long-term treatment outcome . Analysis cost-effectiveness do use incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , order provide single measure weigh cost effect exercise dosage intervention . An assessment also make cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) . Our project team extensive experience practical implementation clinical control study analytical methodology link registry health economic cost estimate . From study expect increase knowledge whether clinical outcome exercise therapy may relate exercise dosage exercise therapy need individualize accord patient 's history , clinical picture cop strategy obtain . In recent report Swedish Council Health Technology Assessment ( SBU ) request data evaluate effect exercise treatment analyzes support personalize rehabilitation . The result study give new information effectiveness exercise therapy patient knee osteoarthritis , new knowledge outcome related dosage exercise perform .</detailed_description>
