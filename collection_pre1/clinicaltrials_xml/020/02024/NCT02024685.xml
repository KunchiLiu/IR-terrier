	<brief_summary>This psychosocial/behavioral study involve administration treatment diagnostic procedure . We use randomized trial test hypothesis decision analysis model provide individualized estimate quality-adjusted disease-free survival treatment option clinically localized prostate cancer lead high quality treatment decision congruent patient 's value lead improved decisional regret treatment satisfaction . In trial , patient would evaluate baseline utility various clinically important health state . The control arm receive counsel regard treatment option use standard patient-physician interaction nomogram-predicted probability treatment outcome various treatment option unaware decision analysis recommendation . The treatment arm would counsel use standard patient-physician interaction would also provide personalized treatment recommendation base decision analysis model prior treatment selection . The primary endpoint study regret-free survival 2 year treatment . There 1:1 randomization . A random permute design use assure approximate balance number patient two group time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Decision Analysis Model Prostate Cancer : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following institutional review board approval study inform consent patient obtain , men refer institution treatment clinically localized prostate cancer interview baseline follow diagnosis prior make treatment decision , research study coordinator train utility assessment . At initial interview , patient 's utility assess , private consultation room , important post-treatment health state potentially may enter . The state would assess include live untreated prostate cancer , impotence , urinary dysfunction , bowel dysfunction , rise PSA follow definitive local therapy , metastatic prostate cancer . We also record characteristic patient 's disease ( pretreatment serum PSA , clinical stage , biopsy Gleason grade ) , demographic ( age , race , level education , employment , marital status ) comorbidity . Patient-reported urinary , bowel , sexual function/bother assess baseline use short form version 48-item validated HRQOL instrument localize prostate cancer . All patient information enter secure , HIPAA-compliant database accessible principal investigator , research study coordinator ( ) , data manager , biostatistician . All patient identify information remove prior data analysis include publication presentation result study . For patient , quality-adjusted disease-free survival treatment modality calculate use decision analysis model . For decision analysis arm trial , information convey patient physician prior treatment decision . These patient also receive standard treatment counseling . For control arm , patient physician unaware decision analysis recommendation patient receive standard treatment counsel alone . After patient make treatment decision give short questionnaire assess decisional conflict . If one month treatment decision information available , letter form request treatment information along decisional conflict questionnaire send patient . At 6 , 12 , 24 month follow treatment decision , patient sent brief validate questionnaire measure regret treatment choice , treatment satisfaction , decisional conflict current health state utility use validated instrument . A short form version 48-item validated questionnaire also assess HRQOL urinary , bowel sexual function/bother domain time interval . Approximately two week receive follow-up questionnaire and/or letter , member study group contact patient telephone receive complete questionnaire . S/he inquire difficulty questionnaire remind patient send back . The primary endpoint study ( decisional regret ) secondary endpoint ( treatment satisfaction , decisional conflict , current health state utility ) assess mean patient-reported questionnaire use validated instrument assess 6 , 12 24 month randomization . A decision analysis model develop use Markov model approach . Using Treeage DataÂ® pro suite , model incorporate cancer outcome , treatment-related morbidity probability derive nomogram , patient-specific utility estimate quality-adjusted disease-free survival treatment option . In model , patient begin localized prostate cancer evidence metastasis . A 6-month transition cycle use Markov model . Bootstrap simulation replacement utilized derive mean utility 95 % confidence interval . Sensitivity analyse perform vary disease progression rate utility within 95 % confidence interval . To investigate decision analytic model , compare standard interaction alone , influence treatment choice lead high quality treatment decision congruent patient 's value , intent-to-treat analysis conduct patient receive decision analysis recommendation decisional regret primary endpoint . In planned secondary analysis , analyze arm trial test hypothesis patient choose treatment strategy appear maximize quality-adjusted disease-free survival ( i.e . one decision analysis would yield ) increase risk regret . This conducted identifying patient arm choose treatment also recommend decision model . The probability select decision analytic treatment strategy ( also probability select high quality treatment decision congruent patient 's value ) investigate use logistic regression model covariates include treatment arm , indicator variable define patient whose baseline treatment choice match decision analysis model , interaction treatment arm indicator variable , well clinically relevant baseline covariates two way interaction . Testing interaction treatment arm indicator variable allow u test effect knowledge decision analytic model probability select high quality treatment decision different patient whose baseline treatment choice match decision analysis model compare patient whose baseline treatment choice match decision analysis model . Each patient also follow outcomes measure 6 month , 12 month , 24 month follow treatment : decisional regret , decisional conflict , treatment satisfaction , health state utility score , HRQOL urinary , bowel , sexual function domain score . All score standardize patient 's score 0 100 . Baseline decisional regret score , inform decision score , treatment satisfaction score set 100 , indicate decisional regret , high degree feel though informed decision make , high treatment satisfaction . Scores health state utility HRQOL domains also obtain baseline . Based patient 's final treatment choice , also calculate difference number quality adjust life year base decision analysis model final treatment choice . For response , separate linear mixed model include fix random effect apply . To meet distributional assumption model , response may transform prior model fitting . Fixed effect include model clinically relevant baseline time dependent covariates two way interaction well linear quadratic time trend . In particular , covariate treatment arm , indicator variable define patient chose decision analytic model base treatment choice , interaction two variable include . In case , interaction allow u test effect knowledge decision analytic model various response different patient chose decision analytic model treatment choice compare patient chose decision analytic model treatment choice . A covariate difference number quality adjust life year base decision analysis model final treatment choice interaction variable treatment arm indicator variable also include model examine effect knowledge decision analytic model various response effect theoretical degree mistake . To fully account variation subject specific trajectory time , random intercept include model although linear quadratic random effect also consider appropriate . In addition , residual covariance structure model also investigate avoid misspecification invalid inference . In particular , correct specification covariance structure investigate use different way model measurement error ( due variation measurement response ) serial correlation ( due decrease correlation measurement time ) . For instance , structure serial correlation investigate use semi-variogram . Although problem misspecified covariance structure avoid use robust variance estimator make inference fix effect interest base marginal model , misspecification also lead inability properly account effect miss data , common occurrence longitudinal study . Note appropriate model fit response interest , inference regard fix treatment covariate effect response base marginal model use robust variance estimator protect model misspecification covariance structure . Statistical significance fix effect base 0.05 significance level . As study exploratory , attempt make account multiple comparison . As discussed previously , miss data common problem longitudinal study . Typically , patient drop study comparable patient remain study time . Consequently , likelihood dropout correlated underlie unobserved data . To account problem , pattern mixture model also fit addition previous model ignore effect miss data result estimate . Pattern mixture model base fit separate linear mixed model seven dropout pattern occur data separate time trend estimate pattern . The marginal treatment effect calculate weighted average pattern-specific treatment effect , weight give probability occurrence various pattern . Because estimate marginal treatment effect rely extrapolation fit average profile time point data observe , sensitivity analysis also perform examine robustness result alternative assumption . For instance , rather estimate separate time trend pattern , model could simplify drop-out pattern use covariate model . In case , time trend within pattern unstructured parallel across pattern . If estimate marginal treatment effect agree among different model investigate , suggest result artifact particular model use account dropout .</detailed_description>
