	<brief_summary>Antiplatelet therapy indispensable prevention stent thrombosis patient underwent coronary artery stenting . Similarly , anticoagulant therapy essential prevention cardiogenic embolism include cerebral infarction AF patient . However , combine antithrombotic therapy report increase risk major bleed AF patient coronary stenting , New anticoagulant drug hardly interact drug need frequent blood test become commonly use . The purpose study assess hypothesis Rivaroxaban non-inferior Warfarin efficacy safety AF patient coronary stenting .</brief_summary>
