	<brief_title>Treatment Pediatric Obesity ( TOP ) - A Multidisciplinary Approach Involving Adolescents Their Peers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One every 3 Portuguese adolescent overweight ( 14 % obese ) ( ONOCOP , 2009 ) . Several institution state prevention upmost importance deal epidemic ( Council Sports Medicine Fitness ; Council School Health , 2006 , August et al , 2008 , Kohn et al , 2006 ) , public health stakeholder also increase effort treat already excessive weight ( Oude Luttikhuis et al , 2009 ) . Several fact support need , namely obesity adolescence : ) significant impact physical psychosocial health ( Lobstein et al , 2004 ) ; b ) independent risk factor adult obesity ( Singh et al , 2008 ) ; c ) independent risk factor cause mortality adulthood - powerful predictor overweight adult ( Must et al , 1992 ) ; ) major threat steady rise life expectancy occur past two century ( Olshansky et al , 2005 ) . Albeit cumulative knowledge , treatment option remain elusive . A Cochrane review ( Oude Luttikhuis et al , 2009 ) conclude combined behavioral lifestyle intervention , compare standard care self-help , provide significant clinically meaningful reduction weight adolescent ; intervention consider psychosocial determinant behavior change strategy improve clinician-family interaction , order improve desire outcomes . The team TOP project work subject since 2004 : consult obese adolescent Hospital de Santa Maria ( HSM ) , result collaboration two proponent Institutions . This allowed inclusion exercise specialist obese adolescent ' consult HSM , lead unusual ( Fonseca et al , 2008 ) , surely necessary ( Barlow et al , 2007 ) , multidisciplinary program , Unit , adolescent evaluate receive medical , dietary physical activity counselling . In compliance late recommendation ( Oude Luttikhuis et al , 2009 ) , use behavior change technique direct adolescent also parent , use self-determination theory ( SDT ) rationale motivational interviewing technique ( Teixeira et al , 2012 ) , treatment protocol recognize Society Adolescent Medicine ( Fonseca et al , 2010 ) . Based previous experience recent literature claim inclusion peer co-adjuvant weight management task , hypothesize : ) large frequent contact treatment staff ; b ) inclusion peer co-adjuvant weight management task TOP necessary . Indeed , literature show adolescent ' health related behavior associate peer behavior , Dishion name Social Contagion ( Dishion &amp; Dodge , 2005 ) . Additionally , think regular physical activity ( PA ) interactive educative session provide background promote two factor ( Fonseca et al , 2012 ) . Therefore , primary objective project develop , implement , evaluate treatment adolescent obesity , use PA interactive session promote weight management skill , increase contact time adolescent , parent , peer treatment staff . The primary outcome body composition related variable , PA sedentary behavior . We also look putative moderator mediator , derive behavior change rationale follow project , help understand predict program influence outcomes . This project hold unique characteristic comply late recommendation treatment adolescent obesity , others able find literature : ) inclusion peer explicitly treatment protocol ; b ) clinical setting treatment , `` real-life '' subject ; c ) objective measurement outcomes ; ) long-term treatment ; e ) well establish rational ( SDT experiential learn ) behavior change analyze causal relation predictor outcomes . This research expect contribute increase knowledge treatment option adolescent obesity , specifically potential role inclusion peer increase time contact PA interactive session . We also expect contribute significant clinically meaningful way weight management intervene adolescent . And , HSM central hospital part medical university , accumulate knowledge project certainly efficiently widespread several hospital obesity center .</detailed_description>
