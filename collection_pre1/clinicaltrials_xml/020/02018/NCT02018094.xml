	<brief_summary>- Lower limb amputation perform usually last resort patient acute chronic limb ischaemia ( CLI ) cause vascular disease , poorly control diabetes , infection . - In period 2003-2008 approximately 5,000 amputation per year UK . - The Centre Disease Control define Surgical Site Infection ( SSI ) infection within 30 day operation one year implant leave place infection relate operative procedure . - Figures Surgical Site Infection Surveillance report high rate surgical site infection report association lower limb amputation 13.1 % . - There clear under-representation infection rate within institution approximately 25 % reflect infection rate report recent trial Sadat et al ( 22.5 % ) - Prevention surgical site infection paramount importance patient , healthcare provider policy-makers , impact morbidity mortality significant time cost implication . - Currently NO CONSENSUS best practice towards antibiotic administration patient . From questionnaire-based audit perform include vascular department across entire country , practice varies course duration ( single dose → 5 day antibiotic course ) well choice antibiotic . - The guideline institution suggest 5-day course antibiotic prophylaxis . The course duration varies depend clinical picture well microbiology result recommendation . - There randomise control trial investigate aspect patient care . We set one trial , look establish standard practice hopefully beneficial possible patient also cost-effective NHS .</brief_summary>
