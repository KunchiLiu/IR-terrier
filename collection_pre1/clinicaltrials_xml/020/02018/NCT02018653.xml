	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn calcium alumina-silicate ( CASAD ) help stop diarrhea . Researchers also want know drug help decrease duration diarrhea . In study , CASAD compare placebo . A placebo drug . It look like study drug design treat disease illness . It design study compare study drug learn study drug real effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CASAD Severe Diarrhea Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If agree take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) receive either CASAD orally placebo . You equal chance assign either group . Neither study staff know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Study Treatment : You take either CASAD placebo mouth every 6 hour 1 cup ( 8 oz . ) water . You also give supportive care treatment diarrhea ( imodium lomotil ) . You ask keep journal , include record time take study drug day history bowel movement every day take CASAD placebo . Study Visits : Before dose : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) record . - You ask diarrhea start . - You ask drug take cancer diarrhea . - A stool sample collect test toxin . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure cytokine ( protein may affect immune system inflammation ) . - You ask diarrhea symptom . It take 5 minute answer question . At visit dose : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask diarrhea . - You ask side effect . On Day 1 ( day visit Emergency Center ) : -Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check electrolytes measure cytokine inflammation ( optional ) . On Days 2-6 ( phone staff visit hospital ) : - You ask diarrhea . - You ask side effect . Length Treatment : You take study drug placebo 6 day diarrhea stop , whichever happens first . You longer able take study drug placebo diarrhea get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-Up : After study , study nurse call ask side effect since finish study treatment . The phone call last 5 minute . If still inpatient hospital , study nurse may visit ask question person . At next scheduled appointment MD Anderson , nurse meet get final journal unused study drug . If return MD Anderson , receive self-addressed stamp envelope return information . This investigational study . CASAD FDA approve food additive , approve treat disease . Its use treat diarrhea investigational . Up 24 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
