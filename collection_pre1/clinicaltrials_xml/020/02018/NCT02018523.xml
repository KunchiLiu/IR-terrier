	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety efficacy maintenance therapy daily low dose lenalidomide patient stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) first line chemotherapy . Investigators expect treatment approach delay disease progression boost patient 's anti-tumor immune response . Investigators hypothesize 10 mg/day lenalidomide administer safely maintenance therapy improve progression free survival time .</brief_summary>

REVLIMID REMS registration need complete determine study eligibility . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) * must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 day registration . Treating investigator must affirm intention perform another serum urine UPT 24 hour initiate lenalidomide treatment . *FCBP : A female childbearing potential ( FCBP ) sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal ( amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . All patient must counsel pregnancy precaution , risk fetal exposure risk . The counseling must do initiation study every 28 day study drug dispense subject . FCBP must either commit continue abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . See Appendix D : Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods .
