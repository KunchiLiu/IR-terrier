	<brief_summary>Studies attempt control pain increase patient ' recovery satisfaction follow many kind operation use small opioid analgesic dose possible add nonopioid analgesic reduce side effect narcotic analgesic . Among nonopioid analgesic , lidocaine magnesium draw attention , show helpful control postoperative pain lower pain hypersensitivity surgical stimulus . Lidocaine act antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . An intraoperative intravenous injection lidocaine report improve postoperative pain control reduce postoperative pain opioid consumption . Another report show intraoperative intravenous injection lidocaine improve quality postoperative functional recovery general anesthesia laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient . In addition , review article effect intraoperative intravenous injection magnesium find effective analgesic may add conventional opioid-based therapy generally reduce opioid consumption , decrease pain assessment 24 hour surgery , lack severe side effect relation magnesium administration . However , insufficient research compare intraoperative intravenous injection lidocaine magnesium term helpful general functional recovery decrease postoperative pain . Recently , scope research anesthesia come embrace postanesthetic recovery ; help patient return daily life , research trend shift improvement resolution specific symptom measurement general recovery . Postoperative recovery complicate process relate catamnestic factor physiological end-points , incidence adverse event , change psychological status . A widely use method measure postoperative recovery Quality Recovery 40 ( QoR-40 ) survey . The QoR-40 include total 40 question may divide five sub-categories : emotional state , physical comfort , psychological support , physical independence , pain . The respondent answer question 5-point scale , one bad five best . The QoR-40 take 6.3 minute average complete know good test-retest reliability , internal consistency , split-half reliability . With respect anesthetic recovery , QoR-40 use various study investigate surgery type , anesthesia method , administration additional drug , gender affect anesthesia surgery . The validity QoR-40 research purpose already establish . Therefore , study , investigate intraoperative intravenous injection lidocaine intravenous injection magnesium compare drug ' helpfulness functional recovery thyroidectomy patient general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
