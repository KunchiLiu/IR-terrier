	<brief_summary>Background Appendicitis common condition represent significant resource burden Scottish National Health Service ( NHS ) . It unknown whether significant difference Scottish appendicectomy ( appendectomy ) outcomes may explain hospital volume . In many study , hospital procedural volume show predictive surgical outcome . Aims The aim study compare appendicectomy outcome Scotland vary hospital procedural volume . Methods This research study retrospective observational enquiry utilise administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . Patient episodes identified procedure code appendicectomy . A 10 year period study , January 2001 December 2010 . Primary outcome measure risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality , 30 day readmission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , length stay negative appendicectomy rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Hospital Volume Relationship Appendicectomy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study explore possibility hospital volume-outcome relationship Scottish appendicectomy outcomes . This retrospective study appendicectomy perform Scotland period 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010 . It use routinely collect administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . The registry supply data study Scottish Morbidity Record 01 ( SMR01 ) , full title `` General / Acute Inpatient Day Case dataset '' ( see http : //www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/ ? detail ) . SMR01 collate administered ISD , data submission mandatory Scottish NHS provider in-patient day-case care . Approximately 1.4 million record added year . Diagnoses cod accord International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) -10 standard procedure cod accord United Kingdom 's Office Population Census Statistics ( OPCS ) standard , recent version 4.5 . The data quality SMR01 high assure regular internal audit . In 2010 audit accuracy , Main Condition record accuracy 88 % Main Procedure record accuracy 94 % . Where data inconsistency identify extract supply study , clarification obtain possible ISD 's data retrieval support team . Data completeness high SMR01 . However , significant volume data miss unusable , need data imputation explore . The study period decide pragmatically desire provide assessment current practice , fully within era widely practise laparoscopic surgery . A power calculation also suggest would provide adequate sample size demonstrate difference . Our power calculation- specific length stay- base Faiz O , Clark J , Brown T , Bottle A , Antoniou A , Farrands P , et al . Traditional Laparoscopic Appendectomy Adults . Ann Surg . 2008 Nov ; 248 ( 5 ) :800-6 . In cohort 259,735 appendicectomy perform 1996-2006 , geometric mean length stay 3.52 , SD 1.8 . We decide difference 0.5 day would 'clinically significant ' . We specify alpha 0.05 Power 0.9 , allocation ratio 2 ( allow comparison one tertile two others ) . A two-sided t-test difference two independent mean perform G*Power 3.1.7 . This demonstrated total N 616 require demonstrate difference . According ISD figure , 3,712 appendicectomy procedure perform 2010/11 , able detect clinically significant difference length stay . Hospitals place tertiles high , medium low volume , accord number procedure perform study period . In absence literature standard appendicectomy outcome measure , follow assessed primary outcome measure : 30 day/in-patient mortality , 30 day re-admission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , post-operative length stay negative appendicectomy rate 3 group . Potentially significant confounding variable age , gender , co-morbidity study predictive value univariate model include multivariate model remain significant .</detailed_description>
