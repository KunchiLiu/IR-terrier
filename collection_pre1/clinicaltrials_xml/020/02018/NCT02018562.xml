Communication empowers patient allows healthcare staff obtain accurate assessment patient ' condition tailor care accordingly . Identifying predictor speech intelligibility impact BLUSA quality life promote communication patient healthcare provider . Study Hypothesis : Determine impact talk tracheostomy tube quality life patient require prolonged mechanical ventilation hospital .</brief_summary>
