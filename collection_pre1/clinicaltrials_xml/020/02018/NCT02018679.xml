	<brief_title>Er : YAG Ablative Fractional Laser Assisted-Photodynamic Therapy Versus Photodynamic Therapy Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common cancer Caucasian population , incidence rise worldwide . increase trend incidence rate BCC asian great percentage pigment BCCs find characteristic clinical feature BCC Asian compare BCC Caucasians . Topical photodynamic therapy methyl-aminolaevulinate ( MAL-PDT ) introduce alternatively attractive procedure BCC . PDT facilitate light activation photosensitizer presence oxygen . The oxygen generate reactive oxygen specie lead selective highly localize destruction abnormal cell . MAL efficient photosensitizer result improve lesion penetration attribute enhanced lipophilicity , decrease charge also great specificity neoplastic cell , compare 5-aminolevulinic acid . Because histologic feature nBCC include down-growth epithelial bud dermis , palisade basal cell separation epidermis underlie dermis , generally treat twice within interval 1 week.But , MAL-PDT show low efficacy treatment pigment BCC melanin disturbs absorption MAL . Also , significantly high proportion BCC Asian population pigment BCC compare pigment BCC Caucasian . Consequently , additional technique need enhance penetration accumulation MAL order improve PDT efficacy decrease treatment duration darker-skinned patient . Er : YAG ablative fractional laser therapy ( AFL ) ablate epidermis dermis without significant thermal injury . This approach create microscopic ablation zone ( MAZ ) laser-applied portion skin . The tissue MAZ surround thin layer coagulate tissue . Since Er : YAG AFL resurface 5-20 % skin one time injure entire thickness epidermis , heal time minimize . Recent study demonstrate Er : YAG AFL facilitate delivery uptake topical MAL deep skin , enhance porphyrin synthesis photodynamic activation . We compare efficacy , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcome safety Er : YAG AFL-PDT standard MAL-PDT treatment nBCC among Korean population .</detailed_description>
