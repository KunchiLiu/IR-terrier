	<brief_summary>In First-in-Human , JWAA trial , LY2780301 display favourable safety profile , high pharmacokinetic exposure ability decrease pS6 . LY2780301 show synergistic activity combination target agent chemotherapy include gemcitabine . We propose herein combine LY2780301 gemcitabine treat different tumor type molecular alteration . This may validate anti-tumor activity LY2780301 increase knowledge regard molecular predictor efficacy .</brief_summary>
