	<brief_title>The Effect Oral Administration 9-cis Rich Powder Alga Dunaliella Bardawil Visual Functions Adolescent Patients With Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinitis pigmentosa genetically disease consist progressive retinal degeneration start rod . Its prevalence 1:4000 people fourth common blind disease Israel 2004 [ 7 % blindness ] . The investigator treat non-progressive form disease [ Fundus Albipunctatus ] oral therapy food supplement make alga Dunaliella Bardawil compose approximately 50 % 9-cis β-carotene . The 9-cis β -carotene show precursor 9-cis retinoic acid in-vitro human intestinal mucosa in-vivo ferret , perfuse 9-cis b-carotene . The night vision , measure objectively electroretinography ( ERG ) double six patient test follow treatment . The visual field also improve significantly . In recent study investigator treat 29 retinitis pigmentosa patient 9-cis b Carotene algae Dunaliella Bardawil double mask placebo control cross trial . Significant improvement retinal function record 34 % patient . As natural extension study perform double-masked , randomize , crossover , placebo-controlled study adolescent patient . Longer treatment duration test : 24 week treatment either 9-cis β-carotene-rich capsule placebo follow additional 24 week treatment capsule wash-out period 24 week two type treatment . We predict study design maximal/increased therapeutic effect well efficient washout achieve .</detailed_description>
