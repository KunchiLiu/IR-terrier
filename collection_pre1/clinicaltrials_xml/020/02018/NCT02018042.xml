	<brief_summary>Alopecia areata ( AA ) common disease immune system , know `` autoimmune '' disease . In disease , immune system mistakenly destroy hair follicle , cause hair fall . Despite many people disease , research cause new , good way treat Alopecia Areata lag far behind similar disease immune system . Currently , Federal Drug Administration approve drug Alopecia Areata . Abatacept ( make Bristol-Myers Squibb ) safe intervention know effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis , another `` autoimmune '' disease , fight inflammation . There genetic chemical similarity active rheumatoid arthritis Alopecia Areata , suggest treatment drug likely effective . In mouse specially design test drug treatment human alopecia , medication work prevent disease Alopecia Areata start . To test Abatacept , go treat 15 patient moderate severe Alopecia Areata 6 month . Each person enrol study receive active study drug . The effectiveness medication measure change hair re-growth determined physical exam photography , well patient physician scoring . Patients follow another 6 month drug see effect treatment last delayed response . We recently change study allow test abatacept patient alopecia totalis universalis . Small scalp biopsy peripheral blood take begin study treatment 4,12 24 week . The chemical analysis skin sample blood help u understand disease happen , treatment work , perhaps even guide u good treatment future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Single-Arm Clinical Trial Evaluate The Efficacy Abatacept Moderate Severe Patch Type Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among patient alopecia areata , patient higher disease burden unlikely satisfactory outcome current therapy . Our hypothesis CTLA4-Ig effective therapy moderate-severe alopecia areata block re-activation CD8+ memory T cell , thereby abort cytotoxic T cell inflammatory response underlie alopecia areata . Alopecia areata ( AA ) common autoimmune disease result immune destruction hair follicle subsequent hair loss . Despite high prevalence , research pathogenesis development innovative therapy Alopecia Areata lag far behind autoimmune disease . Currently , FDA approve drug Alopecia Areata . Abatacept safe intervention know block costimulation inflammatory response rheumatoid arthritis , share several susceptibility gene common Alopecia Areata . Both disease share involvement CTLA4 , rationale select Abatacept evaluation clinical trial . CTLA4-Ig show prevent onset Alopecia Areata C3H-HeJ animal model Alopecia Areata , demonstrate preclinical proof concept data Alopecia Areata . We conduct open label pilot study 15 patient moderate severe Alopecia Areata treat SC abatacept 125mg per week 6 month . A subject alopecia totalis universalis also include . Subjects follow another 6 month evaluate durability response follow treatment phase . The primary efficacy outcome proportion responder 6 month treatment compare historically know rate response untreated/placebo-treated subject 8 10 % . Punch biopsy peripheral blood obtain baseline prior treatment 4 , 12 24 week immunomonitoring molecular study . The safety incidence adverse event relate abatacept population patient also analyze secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
