	<brief_summary>Detecting abnormality leave ventricular mechanical hemodynamic response stress exercise may offer early diagnostic indicator patient suffer valvular disease mitral regurgitation . Ultrasound-based imaging method gain importance provide prognosis among patient . However , decrease signal noise ratio image increase motion-related artifact exercise stress echocardiography report , lack reproducibility result limitation availability reference center . In laboratory , able perform supine bicycle exercise MRI ( 1.5 T ) use Lode ergometer mount far end patient table , previously describe healthy volunteer . The first aim study demonstrate safety feasibility MRI protocol select patient asymptomatic severe organic mitral regurgitation , ass leave ventricular volume function , regurgitant volume comparison exercise cardiac echography . Besides , recent study sustain relevance novel marker central aortic function ( compliance , distensibility pulse wave velocity ) assess noninvasive MRI explore vascular age . In monogenic connective tissue disease , alter arterial stiffness premature signature disease asymptomatic patient . Noninvasive evaluation aortic stiffness would useful risk assessment preventive follow-up strategy young asymptomatic relative subject aortic inherited disease , syndromic non-syndromic familial form thoracic aortic aneurysm /or dissection . Furthermore , technique able evaluate effect drug aortic stiffness change trial , drug therapy , relevant classic change aortic diameter measurement . The second aim study 1 ) provide sensibility MRI protocol estimate local regional heterogeneity aortic functional parameter ( distensibility , compliance PWV ) 2 ) evaluate predictive value regional aortic parameter assess MRI diagnose stratify aortopathy relate presymptomatic Marfan patient bicuspid aortic valve young adult , comparison carotids-femoral pulse wave velocity estimation applanation tonometry .</brief_summary>
