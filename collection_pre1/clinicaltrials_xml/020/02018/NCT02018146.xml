	<brief_summary>Failed mask ventilation pose increase risk de-oxygenation patient undergo general anesthesia . Nasopharyngeal ventilation may valid alternative mask ventilation allow good oxygenation induction phase general anesthesia . Oxygenation may maintain good case difficult mask ventilation . This study evaluate alternative method comparison standard method mask ventilation . General Design This randomize , control , cross study . Patients randomize mask ventilation follow nasopharyngeal airway placement ventilation vice versa . Primary Study Endpoints We test hypothesis ventilation via nasally place ETT superior efficacy ( measure tidal volume ) routine facemask ventilation patient undergo general anesthesia endotracheal intubation surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General Design This randomize , control , cross study . Patients randomize mask ventilation follow nasopharyngeal airway placement ventilation vice versa . Primary Study Endpoints In cohort 2 test hypothesis ventilation via nasally place ETT superior efficacy ( measure tidal volume ) routine facemask ventilation patient undergoing endotracheal intubation general anesthesia . In cohort 1 patient population restrict patient undergo oto-laryngologic oral maxillofacial surgery require nasal intubation . Subject Selection Withdrawal General Characteristics Proposed Subject Population Subjects enrol University Pre-Op clinic University Pre-Op hold area . There data indicate ethnicity affect airway management . We accordingly accept patient minority group . Based population great Louisville , expect 85 % subject Caucasian . We include male female patient study . Anticipated Number Research Subjects In cohort two planning enroll 20 patient schedule endotracheal intubation general anesthesia surgery . Patients qualify enrollment study meet inclusion criterion define . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Subjects undergo general anesthesia require endotracheal intubation . 2 . Adults patient 18 year great 3 . Subjects capable understand signing Informed Consent Form acceptable representative capable give legally authorize consent behalf . 4 . Meet three predictive difficult mask criterion list : 1 . Age = &gt; 55 2 . BMI = &gt; 30 3 . Edentulism 4 . History snore and/or diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea 5 . STOP/BANG score three great 6 . Presesnce beard mustach cover part face conntact facemask edge 7 . Male gender 8 . History neck radiation 9 . Mallampati score III IV Exclusion Criteria I . Subjects exclude study case attempt mask ventilation . This include patient require awake fiberoptic intubation well need rapid sequence intubation . II . Subjects full stomach , know hiatal hernia , severe gastroesophageal reflux exclude . III . Subjects know suspected basilar skull fracture exclude . Subject Recruitment Screening Subjects recruit review case list draft daily operating room schedule schedule pre-operative clinic University Louisville hospital . The study confine short period induction anesthesia . Visit 1 Screening Visit - screen visit subject undergo airway exam . Visit 2 Visit - Based screening result subject enrol study randomize one study group . Immediately randomization subject 's naris prepped two spray nasal decongestant bilaterally . NeoSynephrine nasal 0.5 % spray use . Subject transfer OR . Safety Assessments Routine anesthesia parameter ( tidal volume , train four , heart rate , oxygen saturation , end-tidal carbon dioxide , chest rise BIS monitor ) use evaluate safety propose ventilation method . Effectiveness Assessments Tidal volume , train four , heart rate , oxygen saturation , end-tidal carbon dioxide chest rise use evaluate effectiveness study treatment Assessment difficult facemask ventilation actually use method describe Warters ( 7 ) . The Warters scale assigns point base escalating level intervention necessary ventilate lung . Additionally , Warters scale account situation poor quality mask seal inhibits mask ventilation . Sample Size Determination Preliminary data show nasopharyngeal ventilation may improve apply tidal volume compare mask ventilation . Sample size analysis : within-group difference 50 ml tidal volume consider clinically significant study , difference equivalent 10 % increase tidal volume naso-pharyngeal ventilation . Accordingly , per priori assessment , order detect increase 10 % tidal volume 16 patient require 90 % power significance level 0.05 . We propose enroll 20 patient cross-over trial . Statistical Methods Tidal volumes airway pressure compare paired T-tests . Data express mean Â± SD . Descriptive parameter categorical variable compare use Chi-square test .</detailed_description>
