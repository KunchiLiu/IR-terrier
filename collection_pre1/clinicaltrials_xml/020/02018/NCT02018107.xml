	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator evaluate whether ammonia PET scan FDG PET perfusion scan useful help radiologist determine whether liver tumor successfully destroy heat freezing procedure ( ablation ) scan currently available radiologist , CT scan MRI scan . The currently available scan ( usually CT scan contrast dye ) always effective show completely tumor destroyed . The ammonia PET scan different way look much tumor destroy . This study compare standard scan ( CT scan ) ammonia PET scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan study involve non-therapeutic administration radiopharmaceutical , N-13 ammonia F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose , one two dos , tumor ablation procedure . The perfusion PET scan diagnostic image test . The tumor ablation procedure perform accord standard clinical practice research activity . The use N-13 ammonia F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose image liver perfusion PET scanner research portion procedure . The patient receive one two dose N-13 ammonia ( 10 mCi ( millicurie ) /dose ) intraprocedural assessment ablation result . Not two dos administer one dos administer day tumor ablation procedure . The ammonia perfusion scan use change modify ablation procedure . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : - Ammonia Perfusion PET : The participant schedule tumor ablation procedure part participant 's routine care . If participant decide take part research study , participant one two ammonia perfusion PET scan ablation procedure see ablation successful compare standard CT scanning . The ammonia perfusion PET scan research part participant 's procedure . The rest participant 's procedure research . The participant receive one two dos radioactive tracer call N-13 ammonia . This tracer administer IV ( thin tube place vein ) use Anesthesiologist give participant routine medication relax participant , prevent pain , allow participant sleep procedure . This tracer treat participant 's tumor way . Instead , tracer may allow radiologist well see much participant 's tumor destroy . - Photographs : Photographs may take procedure . Care take ensure reveal participant 's identity . - Clinic visit : The investigator routinely see patient tumor ablation procedure within one two week procedure every three month procedure one two year , need future . Accordingly , clinic visit routine add research commitment .</detailed_description>
