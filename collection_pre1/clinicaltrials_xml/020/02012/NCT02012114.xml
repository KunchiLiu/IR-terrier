	<brief_summary>Preventing late onset Cystinosis neurological complication improve compliance cysteamine treatment remain major challenge management subject cystinosis . This study design describe relationship compliance patient cystinosis treat cysteamine treatment efficacy understand pathophysiologic mechanism neurological disorder . Is cysteamine cross blood brain barrier ? What impact cystine accumulation Cerebro Spinal Fluid Central Nervous System ? Our Primary objective study relationship compliance patient treat cysteamine WBC cystine level . Secondary , study ass relationship compliance cysteamine neurological consequence . The expected duration study 48 month . The enrolment period 24 month study participation subject 24 month . Eligible participant male female ( age &gt; 4 year ) confirm diagnosis cystinosis receive oral cysteamine treatment : Cystagon RP103 . The compliance cysteamine measure use electronic device , accountability study treatment , information patient ' diary . Specific memory visuoperceptual test perform begin end patients'participation . Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy use detect possible site cystine accumulation CNS relationship compliance cysteamine treatment . NMRS also use establish relationship neuropsychological status subject . To describe absorption , distribution elimination cysteamine , metabolic pathway , determine concentration effect dose effect relationship , blood sample perform study visit . A lumbar puncture also propose participant verify cysteamine cross blood brain barrier . New tool use compare metabonomic network patient cystinosis control .</brief_summary>
