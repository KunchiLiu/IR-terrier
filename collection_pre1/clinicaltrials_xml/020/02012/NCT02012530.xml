	<brief_summary>Study Title : A cohort comparison study Comparing Platelet Rich Plasma v Hyaluronic Acid Intra-articular Knee Injections Early Cartilage Defects knee . Study hypothesis : We start hypothesis treatment equally effective . Trial Design : The participate patient divide two group , group receive either one treatment modality . This study randomise . Both procedure do Spire Alexandra Hospital Professor A . A Shetty . The post-operative rehabilitation process group . Trial Participants : All participant patient attend Professor Shetty 's clinic Spire Alexandra Hospital . Planned Sample Size : 50 patient group Follow-up duration : The participate patient follow 2 week , 6 week , 3 month follow surgery visit clinic assess clinically . The surgical outcome measure IKDC , KOOS Lysholm score . Planned Trial Period : Two three year Primary Objective : To establish superiority , , either procedure study pain relief , improvement function . Primary Endpoint : At end 2 year follow participating patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PRP v HA Intra-articular Knee Injections Cartilage Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis early degenerative cartilage lesion significant impact society . People live active long demand great . This direct effect economy day miss work great dependency state resource . The limited regenerative capacity cartilage part problem . Existing degenerative lesion lead accelerate deterioration articular ( joint ) surface lead end-stage arthritis . Any solution delay reverse process therefore desirable . A number non-invasive solution exist treat painful knee improve functionality vary rate success . Two promising agent hyaluronic acid ( HA ) platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) . HA widely apply clinical practice good result many study . HA form part inflammatory process lead regeneration cartilage defective area knee . PRP use reparative growth factor take patient 's blood create environment knee conducive wound heal fill cartilage defect . It 's autologous origin , easy preparation safety profile make potentially ground break treatment option knee cartilage defect osteoarthritis . These solution work improve localised environment morbidity reason best administer intra-articularly . As PRP still earlier stage development , exact dosage still determine . HA also recently prepare high concentration solution test benefit . Trials compare two product . No randomised control trial exist make propose research important . Our null hypothesis difference HA PRP treat patient articular lesion . We attempt answer research question mean randomise trial trial date propose clarify clinical question . The reason choose randomise trial take quality research find high level already exist literature . PRP compare HA two product similar objective . HA use long proven clinically successful track record . Selected participant randomise receive either HA PRP intra-articular injection . Patients source GP referral knee unit clinic Alexandra Spire Hospital . Post-arthroscopy patient exist follow patient satisfy inclusion criterion also offer place trial . Selected patient give participant information sheet read explain trial . They meet investigator ( doctor ) answer query sign consent form wish . Upon inclusion fill score questionnaire , randomise receive corresponding injection . PRP recipients sample blood take requirement procedure . They follow clinic 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month fill score questionnaire time . The trial therefore last inclusion first patient last patient follow one year .</detailed_description>
