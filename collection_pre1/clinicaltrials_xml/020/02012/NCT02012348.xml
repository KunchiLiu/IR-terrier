	<brief_summary>This study recruit 10 healthy volunteer . An avirulent strain S. pyogenes apply forearm wash forearm different type soap , one antimicrobial compound , without antimicrobial compound . After several hour incubation , subject 's forearm swab bacteria . The forearm cleanse antibacterial soap water follow 70 % ethanol . The bacterial swab analyze compare different soap use cleanse digit prior application S. pyogenes . The investigator expect number bacteria survive skin forearm wash antimicrobial soap few control soap .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study timeline follow : Day -7 -1 - After obtain informed consent , potential participant screen . A brief history physical exam do meet enrollment criterion . They assign start date coincide Day 0 . Day 0 - Participants instructed shower day . They may shower even Day 0 , however start midnight Day 0 , participant advise shower . They also ask wear shirt long sleeve . Significant exercise , sunbathing , use cream lotion forearm also avoid start Day 0 , restriction remain place Day 1 study-related procedure complete . In late afternoon day , subject six ( 6 ) 2 cm x 2 cm square draw forearm use skin marker . The volar forearm wash soap , take care remove skin marking . One forearm wash soap contain antibacterial compound . The forearm wash use control soap contain antibacterial compound . Each wash consist application 1.5 mL test product volar forearm . A lather generate 20 second use gloved hand . The forearm rinse run tap water 30 second allow air-dry . Each forearm wrap gauze dry . The gauze keep dry place remove study staff follow day . Day 1 - On morning Day 1 , gauze remove participant ' forearm , 10 µL PBS contain 104 CFU avirulent Streptococcus pyogenes ( strain NZ131 M49 ) apply center square previously draw participant ' forearm . The bacteria spread within square evenly coat surface skin within square . The bacteria allow air dry . Once dry , skin swab rub two square forearm collect sample bacteria forearm location . After swab , area immediately disinfect 70 % alcohol . The forearm wrap gauze . One hour later , gauze remove , two square forearm swab bacteria . These square disinfect 70 % alcohol , gauze reapplied forearm . One hour later ( two hour post-washing ) , gauze remove , remain two square forearm swab bacteria . Both forearm wash 70 % ethanol rinse water remove remain bacteria . This conclude study-related procedure Day 1 . Participants free shower , sunbathe , exercise apply creams lotion forearm follow week . These study procedure repeat Days 7 8 , however antibacterial soap use wash one forearm replace different antibacterial soap . The exact detail describe paragraphs . Day 7 - Participants instructed shower day . They may shower even Day 7 , however start midnight Day 7 , participant advise shower . They also ask wear shirt long sleeve . Significant exercise , sunbathing , use cream lotion forearm also avoid start Day 7 , restriction continue Day 8 study-related procedure complete . In late afternoon day , subject six ( 6 ) 2 cm x 2 cm square draw forearm use skin marker . The volar forearm wash soap , take care remove skin marking . One forearm wash soap contain antibacterial compound . The forearm wash use control soap contain antibacterial compound . Each wash consist application 1.5 mL test product volar forearm . A lather generate 20 second use gloved hand . The forearm rinse run tap water 30 second allow air-dry . Each forearm wrap gauze dry . The gauze keep dry place remove study staff follow day . Day 8 - On morning Day 8 , gauze remove participant ' forearm , 10 µL PBS contain 104 CFU avirulent Streptococcus pyogenes ( strain NZ131 M49 ) apply center square previously draw participant ' forearm . The bacteria spread within square evenly coat surface skin within square . The bacteria allow air dry . Once dry , skin swab rub two square forearm collect sample bacteria forearm location . After swab , area immediately disinfect 70 % alcohol . The forearm wrap gauze . One hour later , gauze remove , two square forearm swab bacteria . These square disinfect 70 alcohol , gauze reapplied forearm . One hour later ( two hour post-washing ) , gauze remove , remain two square forearm swab bacteria . Both forearm wash 70 % ethanol rinse water remove remain bacteria . This conclude study-related procedure . Participants free shower , sunbathe , exercise apply creams lotion forearm .</detailed_description>
