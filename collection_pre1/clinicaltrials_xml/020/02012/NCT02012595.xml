	<brief_summary>AIM : Investigate wether difference parasympathetic nervous system Parkinsons patient compare control . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We use tracer [ 11C ] donepezil image parasympathetic nervous system . The Investigators include 20 Parkinsons patient 20 healthy control age 40-80 study . The participant receive careful medical examination , include neurological examination , part inclusion process . The subject also MRI scan brain . Then PET/CT scan [ 11C ] donepezil conduct - upper abdominal region head region . For evaluate function parasympathetic nervous system gastric emptying time , heart rate variability salivary flow measure . These measureless correlate PET finding . PERSPECTIVES : The study potentially result development PET ligand image parasympathetic nervous system . This application research Parkinson 's disease , diabetes , heart disease disorder , autonomic nervous system involve</brief_summary>
