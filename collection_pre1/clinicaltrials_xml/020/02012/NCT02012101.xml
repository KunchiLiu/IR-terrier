	<brief_title>Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation Rescue Therapy Relieve Dyspnea Patients With Stable Severe COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) preventable treatable illness , clinically characterize persistent airflow limitation usually progressive . It 's well know airflow limitation lead air trap particularly exercise , result increase dyspnea limitation exercise capacity . Thus , COPD patient often unconsciously adopt sedentary lifestyle , probably due distress exertional dyspnea . The sedentarism result physical deconditioning alteration peripheral muscle , latter one cause exertional dyspnea fatigue , turn lead much sedentarism , form vicious cycle sedentarism , dyspnea/fatigue sedentarism . Thereby , measure take interrupt vicious cycle . Some previous study suggest niv act add-on therapy could help unload inspiratory muscle , reduce dynamic compression airway , diminish dynamic hyperinflation , extent , relieve dyspnea exercise COPD patient . However , measure take exercise , act add-on therapy . Whether NIV play role rescue therapy relieve exertional dyspnea patient already undergo optimal treatment bronchodilator anti-inflammatory medication still quite clear . Therefore , hypothesize niv rescue-therapy effect relieve dyspnea stable severe COPD patient like add-on therapy .</detailed_description>
