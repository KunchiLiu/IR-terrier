	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center Phase I/IIa two-part study sequential dose escalation part , follow three parallel Extension cohort ( BRAF-mutated melanoma , BRAF-mutated non-melanoma solid tumor , BRAF-mutated classical hairy cell leukemia ) . Up approximately 42 patient may enrol dose escalation phase study , depend number cohort require , number patient per cohort need , need replacement patient . Approximately 130 patient plan enrol BRAF-mutated tumor Extension cohort , goal enrol approximately 50 patient BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor-naïve melanoma , approximately 10-15 patient BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor-pretreated melanoma , approximately 50 patient non-melanoma solid tumor , approximately 10-15 patient hairy cell leukemia .</detailed_description>

Patients untreated brain metastasis ≤ 1 cm consider eligible deem asymptomatic investigator upon consultation medical monitor require immediate radiation steroid . Patients brain metastasis treat stable 1 month may consider eligible asymptomatic stable dose steroid require steroid follow successful local therapy . Investigational drug use within 28 day ( &lt; 5 halflives , whichever short ) first dose PLX8394 Major surgical procedure , open biopsy ( exclude skin cancer resection ) , significant traumatic injury within 14 day initiate study drug ( unless wound heal ) anticipation need major surgery study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness Active secondary malignancy unless malignancy expect interfere evaluation safety approve Medical Monitor . Examples latter include basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , insitu carcinoma cervix , isolated elevation prostatespecific antigen .
