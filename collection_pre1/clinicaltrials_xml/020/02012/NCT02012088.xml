	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate R-COMP Versus R-CHOP Newly Diagnosed Patients With Non-localised Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) /Follicular Lymphoma Grade IIIb</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) common histological subtype non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . This aggressive lymphoma , incidence Western country estimate 5-6 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year increase age . Treatment patient DLBCL currently base immunochemotherapy , R-CHOP regimen , include cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine prednisone ( CHOP ) combination anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab administer every 21 day total 6-8 cycle , commonly use . Cardiotoxicity one undesirable effect limit use anthracyclines , doxorubicin , part CHOP regimen , cause formation complex ferric ion anthracycline within myocyte . Because oxidative property , complex toxic produce highly reactive free radical damage lipid membrane lead cell death myocytes . Several study link onset cardiotoxicity old age , high cumulative dos doxorubicin , cardiovascular risk factor previous heart disease , among others . Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity cumulative irreversible . Moreover , leave ventricular dysfunction important late effect patient aggressive NHL survive long term , accord study , receive doxorubicin dos higher 200 mg/m² . Cardiotoxicity may silent subclinical , usually detect decrease leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , clinical , vary degree congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Depending symptom , cardiotoxicity also differ acute , subacute , late chronic . The first manifest early stage , usually arrhythmia , transient ECG change pericarditis , among others , usually reversible , detrimental continuation treatment associate subacute late toxicity . Chronic cardiotoxicity could early late . Early-onset cardiotoxicity occur within 1 year anthracycline treatment late-onset cardiotoxicity occur 1 year completion anthracycline treatment . In latter two , cardiotoxicity associate lesion cardiomyocytes therefore consider irreversible . The incidence cardiotoxicity vary among different study , depend patient follow-up definition cardiotoxicity use ( acute , subacute late ) . In addition clinical finding , determination LVEF , recently , use biomarkers , commonly use method diagnose assess cardiotoxicity . Regarding identification biomarkers , troponin I N-terminal fragment pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) commonly use investigate context clinical study . The advantage use biomarkers include minimally invasive identification , less expensive echocardiography , , unlike radionuclide ventriculography , avoid irradiation patient . Furthermore , interpretation result depend observer 's experience , thus avoid interobserver variability . Several study show role troponins indicator early anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity chemotherapeutic agent , able predict impair ventricular function high incidence cardiac event patient elevate value marker compare patient normal troponin value . Regarding use brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP , several study show correlation persistently high value biomarker impaired heart function parameter , particular LVEF . Myocet® ( non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ) one several strategy develop reduce cardiotoxicity maintain therapeutic efficacy R-CHOP regimen . Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin show similar efficacy less cardiotoxicity conventional doxorubicin treatment woman metastatic breast cancer . In addition , several study patient NHL show similar response rate regimens contain non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin obtain historical control conventional doxorubicin , low incidence clinical subclinical cardiovascular event . The treatment relatively well tolerate , myelosuppression important toxicity . Most phase I II study ( without rituximab ) , assess Myocet® combination cyclophosphamide ; vincristine prednisone , show active treatment newly diagnose patient aggressive NHL . 100 % data register CRFs source data verify . eCRDs use order register data . Nine monitor visit per site perform . First monitoring vistit perform first patient include Second monitoring visit willb perform third patient include Third monitor visit perforemd fifth patient include Fourth monitor visit perform last patient finish study treatment One monitoring visit per year perform follow-up phase . CRO ( Dynamic ) Standard Operating Procedures use manage clinical trial . Sample size study base hypothesis LEVF decrease &lt; 55 % 15 % patient assign R-CHOP treatment group 5 % patient assign R-COMP treatment group . Categorical variable show absolute relative frequency , include confidence interval 95 % . For description continuous variable use mean , standard deviation , median , mode , minimum maximum , include total number valid value . In case compare subgroup patient , use quantitative variable parametric test nonparametric characteristic variable study . For qualitative variable use Chi-square test . Statistical analysis plan SAS statistical package version 9.1 later . Two interim analysis perform last patient peforms end treatment visit last patient performd 24 month follow-up visit . Final analysis perform end study .</detailed_description>
