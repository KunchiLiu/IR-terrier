	<brief_summary>The increase fat ( i.e . triglyceride ) blood meal well-established risk factor heart disease ( Nordestgaard et al . 2007 ) . Endurance exercise beneficial improving blood lipid response subsequent meal ; , appearance fat ( triglyceride ) blood less meal endurance exercise perform shortly ( i.e . within half day ) meal ( Petit et al . 2003 ) . This benefit exercise unfortunately negate after-exercise food choice replace calorie expend exercise one contain high glycemic index carbohydrate . For example , high glycemic index carbohydrate consume evening exercise session , exercise longer effect lower triglyceride blood meal consume next morning ( Harrison et al . 2009 ; Burton et al . 2008 ) . Very rarely people perform exercise session fast next meal hour later . The common practice consume food immediately exercise enhance recovery hunger stimulate exercise . Consuming carbohydrate low glycemic index show reduce level fat blood follow subsequent meal ( Gruendel et al . 2007 ) . To date , study examine effect consume low-glycemic index meal exercise blood fat response subsequent meal . The specific objective research determine effect consume low glycemic index lentil endurance exercise session blood fat ( triglyceride ) response subsequent meal . Twenty-five overweight obese men blood triglyceride measure four time six hour high-fat morning meal follow four different condition , randomize , counterbalance , cross-over design ( i.e . 25 subject participate four condition , order condition person randomize ) : 1 ) After exercise ( 90 minute moderate intensity walk ) perform evening , follow caloric replacement high-glycemic index meal ( i.e . white bread instant mash potato ) ; 2 ) After exercise perform evening , follow caloric replacement lentil-based meal ; 3 ) After exercise perform evening , follow fasting ; 4 ) After exercise/ meal condition ( i.e . control condition ) . In addition measure blood triglyceride measure blood insulin , free fatty acid , high density lipoprotein , low density lipoprotein , glucose level also relate cardiovascular disease risk may alter exercise lentil consumption . We also measure muscle 's ability burn fat ( i.e . fat oxidation ) assess respiratory gas ( oxygen consumption carbon dioxide output ) high-fat meal expect exercise lentils increase fat oxidation . Our expected result consume lentils endurance exercise lower blood triglyceride response subsequent meal compare exercise alone high-glycemic index carbohydrate consume exercise .</brief_summary>
