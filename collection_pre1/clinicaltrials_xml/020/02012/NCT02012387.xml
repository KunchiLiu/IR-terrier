	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Omalizumab Cholinergic Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical urticaria , delayed pressure , cholinergic , dermatographism cold urticaria , highly disable condition [ 1 ] . Cholinergic urticaria occurs due active ( e.g . exercise ) passive ( e.g . hot bath ) increase core body temperature , cause itch small hive flare reaction trunk limp fade away upon cool body [ 2 ] . As case chronic urticaria , physical urticarias great impact patient ' quality life [ 3 , 4 ] . However , type urticarias cause even alteration quality life limitation cause daily life activity , sport practice [ 5 ] work performance . In spite high morbidity disease impact quality life , available treatment . Antihistamines usually control type urticaria could partially alleviate cholinergic urticaria . There one paper [ 6 ] show efficacy double dose cetirizine recommend dosage Summary Product Characteristics ( off-label dosage ) . The poor response antihistamine justify minimal role histamine physiopathology employ high dos [ 7 ] . The etiology pathogenesis hive formation remain unknown , though recognize mast cell clearly involve [ 8 ] . On hand , seem desensitization tolerance could induce cholinergic urticaria [ 9 ] . Thus case drug desensitization , Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) receptor must also play role development physical urticaria [ 10 ] . In past year , monoclonal humanize anti-IgE antibody ( Omalizumab ) show effective control cholinergic urticaria [ 11 ] respondent conventional therapy maximum off-label dos . A negative response also report cholinergic urticaria [ 12 ] . Our rationale approach type urticaria Omalizumab exert inhibitory action mast cell activation , case desensitization . For purpose , perform multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial . We include 24 patient include female male patient ( age 14 year old ) , non-respondent antihistamine . Efficacy evaluate negativization European Academy Allergy Clinical Immunology ( EAACI ) , European Dermatology Forum ( EDF ) urticaria network e.V ( UNEV ) standardize exercise challenge test , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Chronic Urticaria Quality Life validate questionnaire [ 13 ] , patient ' card symptom use rescue medication . Additional measure efficacy also : number dropout treatment group ; leave day due urticaria Emergency Department visit . Finally , safety assess mean record evaluation adverse reaction treatment . As previously state , Omalizumab indicate physical type urticaria . The indication treatment moderate-to-severe allergic asthma . The hypothesis work monoclonal anti-IgE antibody Omalizumab could well effective control physical urticaria symptom patient non-respondent conventional therapy . We hypothesize Omalizumab able revert basophil mast cell activation present urticaria type .</detailed_description>
