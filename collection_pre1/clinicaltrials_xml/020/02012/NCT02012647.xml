	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine brain change people Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) get deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery , compare people Parkinson 's Disease . Treatment Parkinson 's disease often difficult challenge . Deep brain stimulation establish surgical treatment effective treatment PD , detail help know . In order achieve maximum benefit treatment , important understand change brain . Specifically , investigator study electrophysiology , study brain conduct electrical message rest body . To , investigator use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , painless non-invasive procedure . They also conduct motor physiology experiment upper low limb collect data skeletal muscle movement . The data study help explain whether electrical change brain relation physical benefit patient Parkinson 's Disease sometimes receive DBS surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening evaluation : The Investigators ask question see participant qualifies study . The screen visit occur 4 month first study visit , schedule occur day first study visit . This evaluation include review medical history clinical finding relate Parkinson 's Disease ( applicable ) . There may neurological exam ( physical exam ) . Women child bear potential take urine pregnancy test . If applicable , medication currently use treat Parkinson 's Disease symptom review subject ask discontinue hour day study visit . The investigator expect concern unwanted consequence arise either discontinue Parkinson 's Disease medication turn DBS stimulator duration time propose study . Participants study 4 condition , span two day long two month . The four Conditions : 1 ) The DBS stimulator turn OFF side . 2 ) The DBS stimulator turn ON right side . 3 ) The DBS stimulator turn ON leave side . 4 ) The DBS stimulator turn ON side . The order condition pick randomly . Participants ask take PD medication approximately 12 hour prior schedule visit time , physiological testing . Healthy control study one occasion , DBS . Tests perform study condition : 1 . Parkinson 's Participants Only : A neurological examination perform administer several clinical scale . These clinical scale include Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , self-report Parkinson 's Disease Quality life scale ( PDQ-39 ) , MMSE instrument cognitive ( memory ) testing , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI II ) evaluation mood depressive symptom . The PDQ-39 , MMSE , BDI administer therefore repeat every study visit . 2 . The investigator determine individual motor evoke potential ( MEP ) thresholds begin study treatment . MEP record muscle locate right thumb index finger , leave thumb index finger . MEP threshold refers amount stimulation brain required activate muscle cell enough appear electromyography ( EMG ) , record electrical potential muscle electrode place skin . 3 . The investigator use TMS test motor cortex function . For test , participant sit chair look like one dentist 's office . A magnetic coil place scalp one side head , overlie brain 's motor cortex stimulate brain 's output muscle opposite hand . A second magnetic coil place scalp opposite side . Recordings hand make use magnetic coil place scalp . 4 . The investigator collect data muscle upper low limb wireless EMG procedure . To , small wireless sensor place skin arm leg muscle . Participants ask sit chair perform movement upper low limb EMG record measurement movement activity . This procedure conduct separately upper low limb . 5 . Participants provide consent videotape visit . 6 . Side effect adverse event pertain study record visit .</detailed_description>
