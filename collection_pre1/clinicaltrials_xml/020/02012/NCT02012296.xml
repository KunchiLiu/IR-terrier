	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose enzalutamide mifepristone give together see well work treat patient metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , enzalutamide mifepristone , may lessen amount androgen make body . It yet know whether enzalutamide effective without mifepristone treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Mifepristone Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safe pharmacologically active dos mifepristone enzalutamide use combination . ( Phase I ) II . To determine mifepristone combination enzalutamide prolongs time prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression compare enzalutamide alone patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect mifepristone endocrine biomarkers serum cortisol thyrotropin . II . To determine effect mifepristone enzalutamide clearance steady state enzalutamide exposure . III . To determine mifepristone affect PSA response rate add enzalutamide . IV . To determine mifepristone add mifepristone prolongs radiographic clinical progression free survival accord standard work group criterion . V. To explore role glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) androgen receptor ( AR ) protein expression within circulate tumor cell pharmacodynamic biomarker mifepristone enzalutamide castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . VI . To explore expression GR down-stream AR/GR target metastatic tumor specimen prior combination drug administration clinical progression . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) day 1-57 mifepristone PO day 29-57 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive enzalutamide PO 12 week per standard care . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive enzalutamide PO per standard care . ARM II : Patients receive enzalutamide PO mifepristone PO . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
