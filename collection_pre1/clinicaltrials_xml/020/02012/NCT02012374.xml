	<brief_summary>In study investigator examine effectiveness intensive speech therapy chronic moderate-to-severe stroke-induced aphasia two condition - responses `` constrain '' unconstrained speech . Both treatment involve mass practice communicating , use intensive language action therapy 3 hours/day , 5 days/week two week , follow six month home practice program . One treatment stress spoken response prefer expressive modality intensive therapy . Before treatment , follow home practice program period practice , investigator administer several test discourse sample examine change associate treatment . Participants also undergo structural functional MRI testing time point . The investigator also attempt quantify degree improvement follow intensive language therapy home practice correlate change Quality Life measure perceived participant aphasia significant others . It hypothesize , whereas treatment lead improvement name practiced word communicate , outcomes enhance group randomly assign `` constraint '' condition . Moreover , performance enhance word practice home practice program , include practiced intensive therapy . Improved naming correlate modulation 'signature ' language attentional network , whose variability depend remain viable brain structure . Initial severity site/extent lesion predict patient ' ability transfer gain name improvement discourse .</brief_summary>
