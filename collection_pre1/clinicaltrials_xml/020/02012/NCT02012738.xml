	<brief_summary>Escalating violence omnipresent South African township trace back two core mechanism : trauma-related hyper-arousal positive rewarding perception violence . In past , therapeutic intervention available addressing , trauma so-called appetitive aggression . The University Konstanz develop culturally sensitive scientifically base short-term intervention treatment traumatized patient , Narrative Exposure Therapy ( NET ) , proven effectiveness various randomized clinical study different war-affected population . Recently , NET adapt forensic offender rehabilitation ( FORNET ) also address perpetration violence relate self-rewarding perception exposure violence . It show effective reduce number commit offense perpetrator sample Burundi reduce PTSD symptom perpetrator sample Democratic Republic Congo . In study , investigate therapeutic efficiency FORNET randomize clinical control trial sample former offender township Cape Town . In addition previous study , specifically address context ongoing stress link finding epigenetic marker stress violence . Participants follow period 25-months post-treatment . The FORNET also disseminate local staff collaboration partner South African Universities organization work township warrant sustainability therapeutic intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A group 290 former young male offender young male risk perpetrate become victim crime ( age 10-40 ) Cape Town , recruit via community base skill-training program interview first step . Participants neurological psychiatric disorder result exposure traumatic stress , like chronic psychosis , exclude participation study receive referral professional health care system , necessary . We apply standardised clinical questionnaire semi-structured interview assessment exposure traumatic stress ( Children Exposed Community Violence ( CEVC ) ) , trauma symptomatology ( PSS-I diagnosis post-traumatic stress disorder ) , aggression ( Appetitive Aggression Scale ( AAS ) ; Buss &amp; Perry Aggression Questionnaire ) , offense type checklist ( AAS ) relate drug abuse , psychosocial functioning ( Work Social Adjustment Scale , WSAS ) suicidality ( M.I.N.I . 6.0.0. , shorten version ) . Additionally , use questionnaire social acknowledgement ( Social Acknowledgement Questionnaire ) substance dependence ( M.I.N.I . version 6.0.0 ) . We set randomised clinical intervention trial treatment former offender cover violence perpetration one hand traumatization . 90 participant choose high aggression scale score certain threshold trauma symptom . 17 participant receive FORNET , 14 match participant receive CBT another 7 match participant treatment usual ( Waiting List camp ) camp . Matching take place accord severity trauma symptomatology , aggressive behavior suicidality . 36 participant n't receive intervention n't part camp ( Waiting List camp ) include follow-ups . In order compare treatment effect two control group follow long-term effect , post-treatment assessment initial survey perform 8 , 18 25 month post-treatment . After follow-ups , 17 FORNET participant 11 CBT participant include analysis . Two CBT client exclude since come follow-up , one CBT client die relatively sudden death due severe disease . The camp wait list reduce six person since one participant wait list stab death gang fight . Therefore combine wait list emerge two wait list ( `` camp '' `` camp '' ) . 13 men `` camp '' -waiting list exclude since follow ups . From residual 21 client wait list , 11 match ( together six participant `` camp '' -waiting list ) participant FORNET CBT group term post traumatic stress symptom severity , level appetitive aggression suicidality . In end 17 FORNET- , 11CBT- 17 wait list-attendees include analysis , hence total sample size 45 participant . The 2 subject control group , still fulfil criterion therapy study interested , received FORNET train ZA staff ethical reason examine whether possible effectively disseminate FORNET . In addition subjective data , corroborate result assessment epigenetic consequence appetitive aggression trauma investigate significance persistence long-term course study . We propose specific DNA methylation pattern important marker environmentally drive mental health pathology , chronic aggression/violence traumatic stress sample perpetrator young male risk perpetration . Further , test stability DNA methylation potential modification period 25 month behavioural intervention ( FORNET ) . Saliva sample ( 2ml ) collect non-invasive method use Oragene-Discover ( OGR- 500 ) Collection Kit ( DNA genotek , Ontario , Canada ) . We collect two DNA saliva sample one RNA saliva sample . Methylation pattern assess University Stellenbosch ( Prof. Soraya Seedat ) , focus marker trauma violence .</detailed_description>
