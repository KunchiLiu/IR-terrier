	<detailed_description>The integrated Cancer Repository Cancer Research ( iCaRe2 http : //icare2project.org ) unique sociotechnical resource collection management cancer health-related data Fred &amp; Pamela Buffett Cancer Center University Nebraska Medical Center ( UNMC ) . The iCaRe2 multi-center , semantically-interoperable easily-customizable cancer data resource aim collecting , managing , mine share comprehensive , multi-dimensional cancer-related data cancer patient biospecimens ( tumor specimen , germ line DNA , serum , urine , plasma ) collect individual . The iCaRe2 provide : ( ) HIPAA compliant , secure , efficient user-friendly mechanism data validation ; ( ii ) utilization standard vocabulary data element ; ( iii ) ad-hoc data reporting capability . The iCaRe2 serf collaboration platform study ( include clinical trial ) perform center expertise cancer biology , pathology , epidemiology , genetics , early detection , patient care . The iCaRe2 develop expansion biocomputing framework initially include four multi-center collaborative registry : ( ) PCCR ( Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry establish 2001 ) , ( ii ) BCCR ( Breast Cancer Collaborative Registry - establish 2006 ) ; ( iii ) TCCR ( Thyroid Cancer Collaborative Registry - establish 2006 ) , ( iv ) GPHID ( Great Plains Health Informatics Database - establish 2011 enroll subject personal history cancer diagnosis time enrollment ) . At present , framework incrementally expand include Thoracic Oncology Collaborative Registry ( TOCR ) , GenitoUrinary Cancer Collaborative Registry ( GUCaRe ) , Head Neck Cancer Collaborative Registry ( HNCCR ) , Gastrointestinal &amp; Abdominal Cavity Cancer Collaborative Registry ( GACCaRe ) , Central Nervous System Tumor Collaborative Registry ( CTCR ) , Leukemia Myeloid Neoplasm Registry ( LeMN ) , Gynecological Cancer Collaborative Registry ( GCCR ) , Sarcoma Collaborative Registry ( SARCR ) , Melanoma Collaborative Registry ( MELCR ) Auxiliary Cancer Registry ( ACR ) . The iCaRe2 group elect use `` confederation model '' , oppose traditional registry network model . It felt latter model imply registry network would assume control individual Center 's database . The major advantage confederation model include flexibility use select Centers different research project base Center 's resource expertise ability different strategy address various research question . It also recognize model successful , essential standardized approach data collection ( patient information biospecimen annotation ) reporting . A confederation would also encourage participation interested Center , irrespective size location . A web-based registry iCaRe2 develop make available Center participate data collection storage cancer relate data .</detailed_description>
