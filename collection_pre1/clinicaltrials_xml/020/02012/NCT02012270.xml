	<detailed_description>Principles= Prevention incision hernia primary closure mid line laparotomies best-evidenced suture technique . Background : Although many data prospective study set evidence-based principle adopt close mid line laparotomy incision , principle find widespread implementation surgical community . Surgical practice continue rely largely tradition rather high-quality level I evidence . Incision hernia laparotomy treatment abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) high incidence 10 % 37 % depend method follow ( clinically , ultrasound CT scan ) duration follow . It known surgical technique use close fascia mid line laparotomy important parameter regard wound complication like wound infection incision hernia . At moment best result prospective randomise clinical trial consider incisional hernia rate wind infection , report surgeon Sundsvall clinic Sweden . Their technique use suture wound length ratio least 4/1 use many small stitch describe protocol `` Principles Technique '' . We want explore result indeed prevent incision hernia significantly implement train tutor . Methodology : Vascular surgeon , use principle yet , show interest learn Principles , ask monitor cohort AAA patient use current suture surgical technique . Some vascular surgeon undergo training want , proctor first procedure use Principles . A cohort 120 AAA patient close accord Principles monitor . The result 120 patient compare control group consist patient close conventional technique non -- ‐trained surgeon . Study hypothesis sample size calculation : Investigators might improve incision hernia rate AAA treatment mid line incision 12 month use Principles estimate 25 % conventionally close patient 10 % patient close use Principles . Calculation : To show decrease 60 % incision hernia rate 12 month ( 25 % vs 10 % incision hernias 12 month ) power 80 % significance level 5 % , investigator need 100 evaluable patient 12 month arm . To compensate 20 % lose follow , include least 120 patient `` principle train '' 120 patient afterwards . So trial end inclusion 120 AAA patient enter use Principles . Most likely control group large 120 patient , depend number vascular surgeon participate teach course time course . Primary endpoint : The incidence incision hernias 12 month determine clinical examination . Data management ownership : The data collect paper form introduce database ( SPSS Statistics , IBM ) statistical analysis make .</detailed_description>
