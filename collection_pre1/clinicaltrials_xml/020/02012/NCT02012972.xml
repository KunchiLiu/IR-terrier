	<brief_summary>For national antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) program , important health system goal reduce morbidity mortality among HIV-infection patient initiate treatment early eligibility criterion allow achieve high possible long-term retention patient ART . In South Africa , cohort data consistently find high attrition among ART patient , combine cumulative outcome death loss follow average 25-40 % first five year ART initiation . Like many middle income country , South Africa also face high rate non-communicable disease ( NCDs ) NCD risk . Despite , virtually study look interaction ART NCDs , none consider effect NCDs NCD risk factor achieve second health system goal mention : long term retention ART . The main RapIT study focus rapid initiation ART , short-term ( 6-month ) attrition treatment viral suppression primary outcome . In supplemental study , evaluate role NCDs NCD risk factor long-term retention ART , outcomes include mortality , loss follow , viral suppression immunologic improvement , physical functioning , ability perform normal daily activity , economic productivity among patient already ART . The study enroll 400 adult patient already ART ≥ 12 month RapIT study site . At enrollment , consent subject screen elevated level several NCD risk factor include body mass index ; glucose use HbA1c level ; blood pressure cholesterol ; well sign abnormality hepatic , renal , lung function . A medical history take , questionnaire gather information chronic pain , alcohol use , smoking , physical functioning , ability perform normal daily activity , economic productivity . Referral NCD diagnosis care offer need . Existing electronic medical record access obtain retrospective data since ART initiation follow subject prospectively 24 month enrollment screen complete . Six month enrollment , subject NCDs high risk NCDs re-screened routine ART medication pickup visit assess uptake referral whether risk , condition , outcomes change . The study help identify reason poor outcome ART point intervention help achieve overall goal national ART program .</brief_summary>
