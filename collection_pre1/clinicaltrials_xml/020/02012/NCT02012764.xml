	<brief_summary>This 12-month , prospective , observational cohort trial involve Primary Care Trusts ( PCTs ) wish take part study Early Arthritis Clinic ( Anti-CCP sub-clinic ) Chapel Allerton Hospital . The approximate duration subject participation 12 month approximate total duration study 10 year . Patients develop inflammatory arthritis within 12 month period opportunity continue follow within clinic annual basis additional visit clinically indicate development IA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CCP Study : Coordinated Programme Prevent Arthritis - Can We Identify Arthritis Pre-clinical Stage ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There accumulate evidence need identify patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) early . Damage occur early early treatment effective . Clearly need improve way identify patient . It recognise patient RA often non-specific musculoskeletal complaint month year prior development RA ( unpublished observation ) . Family member patient RA also great risk develop RA . Given know early identification patient enable earlier treatment lead good long-term outcome , need method identify patient pre-clinical stage disease . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) acute phase reactant , produce liver , primarily response stimulation interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . The low limit detection routine CRP 8mg/dL ( high ) , yet mean CRP general population &lt; 2mg/dL11 ( measure high sensitivity assay ) . Therefore , patient early RA may low-grade inflammation detect routine CRP . This demonstrated patient establish disease12 , study do early disease . Disease activity variable correlate increase highly-sensitive CRP ( hs-CRP ) hs-CRP well ESR predict disease activity severity12 . Interestingly , retrospective analysis blood donor serum , increased level hs-CRP note RA patient pre-clinical phase , commonly within two year prior symptom onset13 . This suggest immunologic change occur prior development symptomatic stage provide exciting tool assist diagnosis early inflammatory disease</detailed_description>
