	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate cumulative exposure tenofovir diphosphate ( TFV-DP ) use dry blood spot ( DBS ) treat HIV-infected patient receive TFV-based regimen . Using DBS allow investigator assess simple method measure drug exposure clinical setting . The investigator hypothesize TFV-DP level low individual detectable viral load high viral suppression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantifying Drug Adherence Drug Exposure Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral drug exposure directly link individual host factor include age , weight , diet , genetics . However , main factor impact long-term drug exposure drug adherence . Adherence strong predictor HIV treatment outcome , measure adherence difficult due inaccuracy self-reporting commonly use monitoring method . To date , gold standard measure monitor antiretroviral exposure adherence apply clinical practice . Tenofovir ( TFV ) active metabolite , tenofovir diphosphate ( TFV-DP ) , distinctive pharmacological characteristic make ideal candidate drug adherence exposure monitoring . The long half life ( ~14-17 day ) TFV-DP red blood cell ( RBC ) property well suit monitoring average dose exposure time . Based , investigator propose RBC level TFV-DP accurate precise measure long-term drug exposure HIV-infected individual . In addition , investigator aim quantify TFV-DP dried blood spot ( DBS ) simple method measure drug exposure . This observational , 48-week prospective study HIV-infected individual treat TFV investigator compare DBS TFV-DP level virologically suppress vs. non-suppressed individual evaluate utility TFV-DP DBS predict virologic failure also drug toxicity . To accomplish , investigator approach HIV-infected patient currently take TFV ( prescribe primary care physician ) present clinic regular HIV care . After informed consent obtain , investigator collect extra blood sample DBS TFV-DP obtain information drug adherence . The investigator also collect extra blood sample DBS TFV-DP subject 's subsequent visit approximately 3 visit 48 week period time .</detailed_description>
