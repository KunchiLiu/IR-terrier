	<brief_summary>Rationale : The combine data 3 study outside Unites States investigate Lung Volume Reduction Coil system ( RePneu LVRC ) show statistically significant improvement pulmonary function , exercise capacity quality life 6-Months 12-Months post treatment . 24 month post treatment improve pulmonary function exercise capacity slightly decrease . Retreating patient LVR coil system part lung could potentially lead new improvement lung function , dyspnea , exercise capacity quality life may reduce rate decline . Objective : To investigate safety feasibility re-treating patient severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) RePneu LVRC system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The combine data 3 study outside Unites States investigate Lung Volume Reduction Coil system ( RePneu LVRC ) show statistically significant improvement pulmonary function , exercise capacity quality life 6-Months 12-Months post treatment . 24 month post treatment improve pulmonary function exercise capacity slightly decrease . Retreating patient LVR coil system part lung could potentially lead new improvement lung function , dyspnea , exercise capacity quality life may reduce rate decline . Objective : To investigate safety feasibility re-treating patient severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) RePneu LVRC system . Study design : This study non randomize uncontrolled intervention . Study population : Patients severe emphysema previously treat lung volume reduction coil system significantly improve lung function , exercise capacity quality life , 6 month treatment . Intervention : Patients receive lung volume reduction coil treatment bronchoscopy . Main study parameter : The safety objective study identify potential number type device-related procedure-related adverse effect . Secondary study parameter : Lung function - Change RV , 6 month follow treatment - Change RV/TLC ratio , 6 month follow treatment - Changes FEV1 FVC , 2 6 month follow treatment Quality life - Change SGRQ score , 2 6 month follow treatment - Change CCQ score , 2 6 month follow treatment Functional measure - Change mMRC score , 2 6 month follow treatment - Change 6MWD , 2 6 month follow treatment</detailed_description>
