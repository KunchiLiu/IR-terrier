	<brief_summary>Migraine widespread , debilitate , chronic pain disorder major public health challenge . Most conventional , pharmaceutical treatment fail give satisfactory long-term relief repeat use important side effect . This project involve implementation substantial dietary change adult migraine . Our goal test hypothesis causal relationship exist migraine symptom amount proportion food consume contain defined amount polyunsaturated fatty acid . Significant finding support hypothesis lead major shift prevention management migraine chronic pain disorder . Emphasis low-cost , health improvement strategy utilize specific dietary modification pain management , base solid clinical research evidence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Episodic migraine debilitate chronic pain condition afflict 12 % American adult . Current conventional treatment rely medication provide limited transient relief , target symptom rather underlie cause pain , associate significant side effect cost . It therefore essential investigate non-pharmacologic approach conventional headache treatment . Certain fatty acid bioactive metabolite regulate multiple pain-related biochemical pathway . Controlled clinical trial investigate pain modulation response dietary change explore relevant mechanism action human lack . In recent feasibility study patient chronic daily headache ( CDH ) , find target fatty acid modification alter circulate endovanilloids , reduce headache frequency improve quality life . These finding support propose model diet-induced alteration endovanilloids modulate transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ( TRPV1 ) activity vivo , lead important implication migraine chronic pain general . The goal research ass whether dietary PUFA modification result predict change circulate endovanilloids improvement headache-related clinical outcome . The propose 3-arm , 26-week , randomize , control , single-blind trial , 51 subject group , include 4-week baseline usual care , follow randomization one three 22-week dietary intervention plus usual care . Each three arm involve specific modification dietary fatty acid intake whole food diet . Participants dietary intervention receive food sufficient 2 meal 2 snack daily along extensive dietary counseling . Specific aim : 1 . To assess efficacy dietary intervention induce predict change circulate fatty acid endovanilloid derivative ; 2 . To compare clinical effect migraine specific outcome two 16-week analgesic dietary intervention control diet ; 3 . To test , exploratory manner , model propose causal chain link change fatty acid , endovanilloid derivative , headache clinical endpoint . This proposal utilize innovative design hypotheses address current research funding priority , examine clinical efficacy underlie mechanism promise dietary manipulation distinct potential high impact term ameliorate chronic , disable pain disorder .</detailed_description>
