	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) , common form arthritis , prevalent debilitate disease without therapy alter disease progress currently manage symptom-modifying therapy modestly effective . In spite substantial progress understand pathogenesis OA , effective disease modify intervention establish . Degenerative joint cartilage central feature OA , yet joint cartilage limited capacity repair . Results animal research demonstrate pulse low intensity ultrasound ( PLIUS ) mechanically stimulate , may promote , cartilage repair . This exploratory trial investigate whether PLIUS potentially effective disease symptom modify intervention patient early knee OA .</detailed_description>
