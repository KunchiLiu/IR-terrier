	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) person stop breathe repeatedly sleep . Breathing stops airway collapse prevents air get lungs.This airway closure result decrease amount oxygen blood . Anesthetics give surgery know increase tendency patient 's airway close immediately surgery recovery room reduce amount oxygen patient 's blood immediately surgery . These two factor combine could profound effect patient 's well surgery . Recent advance general anesthesia , pain medication , surgical technique make outpatient surgery common . Due increase outpatient surgery , pain management technique work efficiently long period time necessary . One technique nerve block , coat nerve numb medication block pain area . Nerve block routinely use along general anesthesia outpatient surgery help reduce eliminate need IV oral pain medicine surgery . Nerve block provide good pain relief early recovery few side effect ( nausea , vomit , etc . ) relate narcotic pain medicine . Unfortunately , study look effect anesthesia nerve block breathe pattern oxygen saturation level discharge outpatient surgery . We therefore propose study change lung function test blood oxygen level nerve block general anesthesia outpatient shoulder surgery . We would like conduct home sleep study include measure oxygen level subject sleeping , , surgery , test lung function surgery see difference . We recruit 10 subject eligibility base clinically indicated shoulder surgery nerve block . The study non-interventional surgery . It possible future screen out-patient shoulder surgery include preoperative overnight oxygen saturation measurement identify patient high-risk change oxygen level .

	<detailed_description>History &amp; Significance : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) syndrome sleep related airway obstruction ( snore ) reduction blood oxygen level affect 2 % 24 % general population1 . In word , person stop breathe repeatedly sleep OSA . Breathing stop airway collapse prevents air get lung . The impact OSA systemic heart lung disease slow progressive course year . Exposure anesthesia increase tendency postoperative airway obstruction reduction oxygen levels2 , could significant impact patient well-being . Recent advance general anesthetic , opioid analgesic drug surgical technique make outpatient surgery common significant proportion patient . It estimate approximately 50 % procedure currently perform University Michigan Health System day-case procedure , vast majority require deep sedation general anesthesia . The reduction postoperative hospital base care place considerable emphasis efficient delivery pain relief result increased usage peripheral nerve block reduce need intravenous sedative opioid analgesic deep level anesthesia . Shoulder surgery particularly good example nerve block neck region ( typically inter-scalene brachial plexus block ) place anesthesia provide good pain relief early recovery less side effect directly relate opioid analgesic . Nevertheless , one side effect interscalene nerve block temporary ( 12-18 hour ) weakness diaphragm muscle side block , due phrenic nerve blockade . As result , change patient 's breathing pattern typically compensate increased work muscle respiratory system3 . However , important note shoulder joint disease common middle-aged patient typically great risk OSA . The baseline abnormalities respiration OSA patient put increase risk breathe abnormality inter-scalene nerve block . As result , surgery present unique challenge anesthesiologist look balance benefit risk inter-scalene nerve block . Unfortunately , study look effect anesthesia inter-scalene block breathe pattern oxygen saturation level discharge outpatient surgery , measure spirometry , sleep study pulse oximetry . We therefore propose study change lung function test blood oxygen level inter-scalene block general anesthesia outpatient shoulder surgery . It possible future screen out-patient shoulder surgery include preoperative overnight oxygen saturation measurement identify patient high-risk change oxygen level . These patient may benefit hospital admission surgery close observation . Thus , study could significant implication patient safety resource utilization . Sample Size Estimation : We hypothesize patient undergo inter-scalene block general anesthesia shoulder surgery develop double significant oximetric change base standard measure use sleep study . At least 8 patient require study 5 % type-I 20 % type-II error prove hypothesis . We plan recruit 10 patient study , patient double control , allow 20 % ( 2 subject ) withdrawal rate . We anticipate 50 screen failure . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure study incidence postoperative sleep disorder breathing ( apnea-hypopnea index ) define ≥5 episode per hour &gt; 50 % reduction expiratory air flow associate ≥4 % reduction oxygen saturation ( refer ODI4 oxygen desaturation index &gt; = 4 point drop SpO2 ) last least 10 second measure pulse oximeter . Secondary outcome measure include change lung function test lowest mean oxygen saturation level sleep . Study Design : This observational longitudinal study , wherein patient act control . 10 patient high risk prediction factor OSA , screen Perioperative- Sleep Apnea Prediction Score ( P-SAP ) ≥6 , present outpatient shoulder surgery , approach participation study.The P-SAP score consist three demographic variable ( age &gt; 43 year , male gender obesity ) , three medical history variable ( history snoring , type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension ) three airway measure ( thick neck , modify Mallampati class 3 4 reduced thyromental distance ) number significant variable present give patient P-SAP score . The respiratory effect anesthetic block assess use pulse oximetry , spirometry , overnight sleep study . Preoperative postoperative value compare significant difference . Standard monitor employed anesthesia include continuous electrocardiography , non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 3 minute , continuous pulse oximetry , continuous capnography , continuous respiratory gas measurement , neuromuscular function monitor continuous body temperature . Anesthesia technique include preoperative interscalene block , follow induction anesthesia midazolam , fentanyl , propofol muscle relaxation succinylcholine and/or vecuronium indicate . This follow tracheal intubation protect airway ensure conduit adequate intraoperative control ventilation . Anesthesia maintain total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , oxygen air , titrate ensure adequate depth anesthesia . Additional analgesia provide bolus continuous infusion remifentanil need . Institutional protocol prevention nausea vomit employ . At end surgical procedure , full recovery neuromuscular function facilitate use neostigmine glycopyrrolate , removal endotracheal tube . On arrival post anesthesia care unit , patient monitor managed ensure safe comfortable recovery surgical procedure . Additional fentanyl use pain relief need standard postoperative protocol management care follow . Discharge PACU do full recovery satisfy institutional PACU discharge criterion . Prior discharge PACU second set pulmonary function test perform research assistant . Patients discharge home standard postoperative analgesia include acetaminophen hydrocodone surgical resident 's discretion . Study Design Rationale The American Society Anesthesiologists ' practice guideline obstructive sleep apnea ( Anesthesiology 2006 ) clearly support use regional anesthesia analgesia way reduce perioperative opioid usage . The technique describe proposal essentially `` single intervention '' anesthetic always include general anesthesia . As standard care , would able employ randomize control design deny `` good care '' randomly patient . A non-random selection case study effect general anesthesia vs. block would difficult absence block , patient get high dos opioids general anesthetic . This make impossible compare perioperative sleep disturbance patient get additional inter-scalene block ( opioids general anesthetic agent directly impact severity sleep relate breathing disturbance ) Also , since patient medical personal reason avoid block , would negatively impact likelihood recruit comparable study population We use longitudinal study design pre-block postoperative spirometry , way account inter-individual difference effect scalene block lung volume . At low lung volume , patient likely develop airway obstruction . As first step , would like test influence lung volume change outcomes , rather identify part anesthetic causing lung volume change . We therefore , include control group . Research Procedures : 1 . Pre-Operative Clinic Visit Patients approach base inclusion criterion state . Patients screen consent study visit Dominos Preoperative Clinic . The subject receive phone call two day schedule surgery answer question may still , remind use portable sleep study machine ( Compumedics Somte System Ambulatory Cardio-respiratory system ) night , remind bring Somte sleep device day schedule surgery . Once patient consent study , study measurement begin day prior surgery . 2 . Pre-Operative At Home The study team call subject arrange convenient time come subject 's house teach use portable sleep study machine elastic band fit around chest pulse oximeter , record level oxygen blood . The subject keep portable sleep study machine pulse oximeter home wear two night schedule shoulder surgery . 3 . Pre-Operative Day Of Surgery On morning schedule surgery subject arrive outpatient surgical center , subject give baseline lung function test . After procedure complete , interscalene nerve block place anesthesiologist subject go operate room . An interscalene nerve block procedure do make shoulder arm numb first hour surgery help pain operation . It injection numb medication , similar dentist would use , around near nerve area operate temporarily control pain . Most shoulder surgeon , recommend nerve block place anesthesiologist part normal standard care surgery . Before block place , subject IV put monitor hook , include heart rate , blood pressure , breathe rate , pulse oximeter . These procedure part normal pre-operative care . Sedation general anesthesia use nerve block , decide anesthesiologist , subject completely asleep procedure . An ultrasound machine nerve stimulate device use find correct nerve help accurate placement block base neck . After block place , subject go operate room general anesthesia shoulder surgery per normal standard care administer . 4 . Post-Operative Day Surgery After surgery another spirometry lung function test perform . The subject use Somte device night surgery well . 5 . After Going Home The subject wear portable sleep study elastic band pulse oximeter home first night surgery . We arrange convenient time someone pick two item subject home . The patient 's involvement study end day surgery .</detailed_description>
