	<brief_summary>This study implement 3 aim . The first conduct systematic literature review CKD intervention model effectiveness . Findings adopt intervention program . The second purpose establish practical management model intervention model CKD patient high risk population 18-month follow-up.In third year , use social perspective point evaluate cost benefit intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cost Effectiveness Evaluation Disease Management Chronic Kidney Disease High Risk Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The object study screen adult ( 20 year ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD stage 1-3a ) high-risk group . They randomly assign experimental group ( self management peer-assisted management ) control group ( general management ) . All participant receive general education knowledge care early chronic kidney disease recently establish National Health Insurance system . We use cross-theoretical model assess intervention among three group . We collect information baseline follow-up data biochemical physiological check-ups , health promotion behavior , dietary intake status , self-efficacy cost etc . Information behavior change , include smoking , chew betel nut , medication , exercise diet , also collect assess . Participants self-management group expect emphasize self-managed intervention , include self-monitoring record keep , self-education digital video disc ( DVD ) course . We negotiate behavior change set goal etc . The peer-assisted management group receive similar program 3 month , peer orient group activity follow , include group discussion share experience sport map etc . The effectiveness assessment set baseline , 3rd , 6th , 12th 18th month . With one year intervention period , 3 group assess 18th month follow-up next year . In third year , use social perspective point evaluate cost benefit intervention . We suppose 100,000 people screen case chronic kidney disease ( CKD stage 1-3a ) high-risk group , compare cost-effectiveness analysis experimental group accept intervention 12 month control group without receive extra intervention .</detailed_description>
