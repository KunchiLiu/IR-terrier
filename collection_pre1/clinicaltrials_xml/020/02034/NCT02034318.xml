	<brief_title>Fatigue Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigator-initiated study mean determine whether correlation exists cardiac denervation ( assessed 123I-mIBG scan ) subjective rating fatigue patient Parkinson disease . Subjects recruit Movement Disorder section department Neurology . Subjects fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion undergo test exclude confound factor depression sleep dysfunction . Subjects also complete several validate measure fatigue . These measure correlate calculated ratio obtain 123I-mIBG scan provide indication relative denervation present subject . These finding serve pilot data large prospective study explore topic . Patients find possible sign depression base depression rating scale perform study provide referral mental health specialist evaluation treatment . Patients endorse thought suicide homicide refer Jackson Memorial Mental Health Crisis Intervention Center acute evaluation . The radiopharmaceutical 123-I-mIBG approve assessing sympathetic activity neuroendocrine tumor currently undergo investigation study sympathetic innervation heart heart failure variety electrophysiologic abnormality heart , sympathetic innervation may play role . The subject expose small dos radiation course scan . Nuclear medicine use five decade , know long-term adverse effect low-dose exposure . Allergic reaction radiopharmaceutical may occur extremely rare usually mild . This risk minimize exclude individual previous allergic reaction iodine . Injection radiotracer may cause slight pain redness rapidly resolve . Some medication may stop hour 123-I-mIBG scan perform .</detailed_description>
