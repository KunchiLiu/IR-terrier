	<brief_title>The Effect Processing Measured Energy Value Almonds Human Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolizable energy value , Atwater general factor , protein , fat , carbohydrate commonly use calculate metabolizable energy diet . Atwater factor base average value mixed diet exact ; thus , use value could introduce error calculate metabolizable energy particular food due difference chemical structure availability . Studies demonstrate Atwater general factor overestimate energy derive protein fat , well measure metabolizable energy mixed diet , particularly high dietary fiber . Studies lack , however , examine different process method affect metabolizable energy food due difference chemical structure availability .</detailed_description>
