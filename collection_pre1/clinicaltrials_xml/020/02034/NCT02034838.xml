	<brief_summary>This open-label , single group study determine pharmacokinetic profile atazanavir 300 mg daily boost ritonavir 100mg daily HIV-infected patient period 9 day . Ritonavir atazanavir protease inhibitor use treat HIV . However , ritonavir , use low dos ( 100mg ) HIV activity , enhance ( boost ) blood concentration drug like atazanavir . Recently , study show take 50mg ritonavir administer oral solution lead similar blood concentration atazanavir give 100mg ritonavir . Potential benefit associate low dose ritonavir may include reduction side effect upset stomach improvement cholesterol level . This study look amount atazanavir blood give ritonavir tablet formulation 50mg 100mg standard atazanavir dose ( 300mg ) .</brief_summary>
