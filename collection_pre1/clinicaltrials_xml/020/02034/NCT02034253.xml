	<brief_summary>The early stage schizophrenia associate significant decrease social intellectual ability , decline chronic disease . Studies identify relationship duration untreated psychosis ( duration onset positive symptom treatment ) bad long term outcome . However , neurobiology phenomenon implication response antipsychotic medication remain poorly understood . Glutamatergic excess alter brain connectivity might provide explanation long duration untreated psychosis worse clinical outcome . The investigator propose use neuroimaging study 67 first episode psychosis subject sixteen week treatment risperidone , common antipsychotic . We measure ( 1 ) glutamate ( 2 ) structural functional brain connectivity test hypotheses glutamatergic abnormality present first episode patient long duration untreated psychosis associate great connectivity abnormality set stage poor response treatment . 67 demographic-matched control also recruit comparison group - healthy control receive antipsychotic medication . The investigator 's previous study make progress understand abnormality glutamate system brain connectivity unmedicated patient schizophrenia modulation antipsychotic medication . Two index glutamatergic dysfunction identify . While antipsychotic medication appear modulate glutamate , disturbance relationship metabolites restore treatment . In addition , investigator find structural functional connectivity abnormality unmedicated patient schizophrenia predict patient ' response treatment . To investigator 's knowledge , group perform study use combination complementary neuroimaging technique allow generate broad characterization glutamatergic function brain connectivity first episode psychosis change treatment . The result propose study could suggest mechanism duration untreated psychosis associate poor treatment response might lead new intervention target illness .</brief_summary>
