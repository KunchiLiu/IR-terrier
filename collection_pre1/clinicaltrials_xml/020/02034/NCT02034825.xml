By retrospective nature study , case may several year post-RP . It expect participation study impact actual clinical management patient . Participants ask complete two web-based electronic Case Report Questionnaires ( eCRQ ) : 1 . Pre-Decipher : collect information recommend treatment decision decision confidence base de-identified clinical pathological information provide patient case . 2 . Post-Decipher : collect treatment recommendation decision confidence de-identified patient case presence Decipher test result .</detailed_description>
