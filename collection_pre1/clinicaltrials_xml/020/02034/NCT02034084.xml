	<brief_summary>Previous study show transradial cardiac catheterization decrease bleed complication related access site procedural discomfort also morbidity hospitalization compare transfemoral approach . At present , right radial approach ( RRA ) first choice routinely coronary angiography intervention daily clinical practice despite marked subclavian artery tortuosity leave radial approach ( LRA ) . Although LRA think direct access ascend aorta similar transfemoral approach may reduce fluoroscopy time cerebrovascular complication compare RRA , application LRA coronary intervention still low . Moreover , several study also obtain conflict result show difference procedural success rate compare LRA RRA use Judkins catheter . To date , remain unclear whether LRA superior RRA term safety feasibility coronary angiography intervention real world practice data randomize control trial available . The aim study randomly investigate compare safety feasibility LRA compare RRA coronary diagnostic angiography Chinese subject . The investigator enroll consecutively 2 year patient undergo coronary diagnostic procedure trans radial approach . The primary outcome total procedural duration . Secondary outcome include fluoroscopy time , dose radiation include cumulative air kerma dose area product , contrast volume incidence vascular complication .</brief_summary>
