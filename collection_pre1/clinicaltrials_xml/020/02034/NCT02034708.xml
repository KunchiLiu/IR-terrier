	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate non-inferiority Dotarem®-enhanced MRI compare Gadovist®/ Gadavist®-enhanced MRI diagnosis brain tumor term overall lesion visualization characterization ( off-site assessment ) . 270 patient randomize 2 arm define sequence administration contrast agent dose 0.1mmol/kg , minimum 48 hour maximum 14 day . Each patient , therefore , receive two MRI his/her participation study . The two arm consist : - Dotarem® first MRI , Gadovist®/Gadavist® second MRI . - Gadovist®/Gadavist® first MRI , Dotarem® second MRI . Contrast-enhanced MRIs perform 1.5 3 Tesla system . MRI examination evaluate centrally blind independent reader main evaluation criterion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female male adult patient ( patient reach legal majority age ) Patient know highly suspected primary intracranial tumor ( intraaxial extraaxial ) detect previous CT MRI examination schedule undergo routine contrastenhanced MRI Female patient must effective contraception throughout study must negative urine pregnancy test inclusion , surgically sterilize , postmenopausal ( minimum 12 month amenorrhea ) Patient provide his/her write informed consent participate trial prior studyrelated procedure conduct Patient national health insurance ( accord local regulatory requirement ) Patient rapidly evolve brain tumor could change appearance time two study MRI examination . Patient undergoing current recent treatment within past 6 week schedule treatment could result change lesion appearance two study examination . This would include , restrict , follow : current recent radiation therapy , surgery , start recent chemotherapy . Patient contraindication MRI ( e.g. , pacemaker , aneurysm clip , severe claustrophobia , infusion pump , cochlear implant metallic others accord image site standard practice ) Patient know severely impaired renal function ( define eGFR MDRD &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 ) Patient know Class III/IV congestive heart failure accord New York Heart Association classification Patient know severe adverse drug reaction contraindication GadoliniumBased Contrast Agent Patient receive contrast agent within 48 hour prior first study contrast agent injection schedule study patient expect receive contrast agent within 24 hour last study contrast agent injection Patient present condition , base investigator 's clinical judgment , would prevent patient complete trial assessment visit Patient guardianship and/or unable unwilling cooperate requirement trial Pregnant breast feed female patient Patient already include trial Patient include another clinical trial involve IMP within 30 day first investigational contrast agent injection .</criteria>
