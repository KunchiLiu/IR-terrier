	<brief_title>3-part Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics &amp; Pharmacodynamics Multiple Doses CC-220 Relative Bioavailability Formulated CC-220 Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 3-part study conduct single study center . Part 1 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , ascending-dose study . During course Part 1 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow visit . There total 4 cohort , consist different dose level and/or dose duration , 8 9 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC-220 remain subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . In 2 cohort , study drug administer daily total 14 day . In 2 cohort , study drug administer daily 28 day . In one 28-day dosing cohort , 2 vaccination ( tetanus toxoid adsorb pneumococcal vaccination ) also administer Day 14 28-day dosing period help characterize effect CC-220 antibody response . Part 2 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study explore effect alternative dose schedule pharmacodynamics CC-220 . During course Part 2 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow visit . There total 2 cohort , consist different dose level , 9 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC-220 3 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . The dosing frequency either every 3 day 14 day every 7 day 28 day . Part 3 randomized , open-label , two-period , two-way crossover study evaluate relative bioavailability one CC-220 formulate capsule , relative two reference capsule , follow single oral dose CC-220 . During course Part 3 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase consist 2 period , follow visit . There one cohort consist total 12 subject . In study period , approximately 6 subject receive single dose CC-220 one formulate capsule ( test product ) approximately 6 subject receive single dose CC-220 two reference capsule ( reference product ) .</detailed_description>
