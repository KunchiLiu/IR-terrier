	<brief_summary>Lipodystrophies part clinically heterogeneous group disorder characterize loss ( lipoatrophies ) / accumulation fat , usually result change normal tissue surface . Millions plastic reconstructive surgery perform annually repair soft tissue defect due trauma , tumor resection congenital defect . Surgical option lipoatrophy , lipodystrophy type characterize subcutaneous adipose tissue atrophy , include : Transfer autologous fat , Dermis - fat graft , Skin flap Commercially available filler . Currently , commonly filler agent use lipodystrophy treatment polymethylmethacrylate , consider permanent history short- medium-term adverse effect . Biocompatible temporary filler agent hyaluronic acid , polylactic acid collagen use 25 year cosmetic purpose lipoatrophies . More recently , use autologous fibroblast prove efficient solve acne scar enable dermis regeneration . Studies mice show combination pre - adipocytes biomaterial much effective tissue reconstitution injection adipose tissue , provide volume also stimulate cell proliferation differentiation increase production extracellular matrix . This project aim phase I clinical trial filler agent , compose mesenchymal stem cell derive autologous adipose tissue associate hyaluronic acid .</brief_summary>

The intervention perform study transdermal injection filler agent patient undergo elective cosmetic liposuction procedure , legal age without exclusion criterion item . Patients evaluate accord parameter total period 12 month . Individuals control group transdermal injection hyaluronic acid evaluate parameter use study group also period . In study , 25 volunteer attend Dermatologic Service Bonsucesso Federal Hospital ( HFB ) include . The research subject evaluate preliminarily regard inclusion exclusion criterion study procedure perform signing Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . The efficacy safety study conduct follow Good Laboratory Clinics Practices . Patients meet study eligibility criterion randomly assign one two treatment group : Test Control . The first follow-up visit occur first month post-procedure . Subsequent consultation hold 3 , 6 12 month procedure .</detailed_description>
