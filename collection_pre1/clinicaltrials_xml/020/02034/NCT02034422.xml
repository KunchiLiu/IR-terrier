	<brief_title>Understanding Exercise-Hypertension Paradox</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 37 % Veterans clinically hypertensive , make hypertension common medical condition VA Health Care System . Importantly , 67 million Americans diagnosed hypertension less half effectively treat condition . Hypertension constitute major risk factor cardiovascular disease leave untreated lead development heart failure , coronary heart disease , peripheral artery disease , stroke , renal disease . Exercise regular physical activity consider cornerstone prevention management hypertension . However , individual hypertension exhibit exercise intolerance characterize impaired skeletal muscle blood flow heighten afferent fiber sensitivity lead exaggerated great normal physiologic increase blood pressure exercise ( i.e . exercise pressor reflex EPR ) . This imbalance beneficial effect exercise exercise intolerance create interesting paradox , cause consequence poorly understood . The etiology hypertension undoubtedly complex , however common denominator condition , elevate oxidative stress , may contribute impaired muscle blood flow heighten skeletal muscle afferent feedback lead exaggerated EPR . Previous work investigator ' laboratory others suggest elevate oxidative stress associate age impairs muscle blood flow . Additionally , free radical , initiator oxidative stress , directly stimulate skeletal muscle afferent fiber lead exaggerated EPR . Importantly , role oxidative stress regulate muscle blood flow afferent fiber function human hypertension determine . Preliminary study support significant role oxidative stress impair muscle blood flow contribute exaggerated EPR hypertension . With information context two aim propose systematically identify consequence elevate oxidative stress hypertension . Specific Aim 1 determine consequence oxidative stress examine elevate free radical contribute heighten skeletal muscle afferent feedback impaired muscle blood flow exercise hypertension lead exaggerated EPR . Additionally , vascular endothelial cell collect antecubital vein provide novel insight regard endothelium potential source elevate oxidative stress hypertension . Specific Aim 2 determine effectiveness combine antioxidant therapy exercise rehabilitation treatment hypertension . The overall goal proposal provide novel information regard role oxidative stress critical regulator cardiovascular hemodynamic response exercise hypertension . By identify potential cause consequence oxidative stress , important insight gain facilitate development novel approach therapeutic strategy treatment hypertension . Importantly , practical application test study ( i.e . antioxidant treatment combine exercise rehabilitation ) design identify document effective countermeasure aid treatment management hypertension allow safe performance exercise large number Veterans .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A total 72 middleaged ( 40 60 year age ) healthy hypertensive men woman participate protocol provide write informed consent . The investigator aim include 1 1 ratio female male group . Individuals diagnose present stage 1 stage 2 hypertension ( range 140/90 179/109 mmHg , accord seventh report Joint National Committee Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High BP ) may eligible study . Blood pressure status assess triplicate laboratory medical exam 24 hour period use ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . Both method must confer hypertension study enrollment . Other hypertension , hypertensive patient otherwise healthy free overt disease assess : medical history ; standard blood chemistry ( chem . 7 panel ) , ECG rest ; limb vascular examination ( anklebrachial BP index &gt; 0.9 ) ; rest BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg ; skinfold % body fat assessment . Subjects body mass index ( BMI ) 19 30 plasma glucose concentration &lt; 7.0 mmol/L fast condition &lt; 11.1 mmol/L 120 minute oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , define American Diabetes Association . To reduce heterogeneity hypertensive subject maintain `` real world '' approach follow class drug allow ; diuretic , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) . Healthy normotensive subject match hypertensive counterpart free overt cardiovascular disease accord criterion describe . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion specific reference exaggerate exercise pressor reflex : Hypertensive subject must exhibit 10 mmHg great increase MAP 25 % workrate maximum knee extension exercise include study . Established criterion define cut `` exaggerated '' exercise pressor reflex exist . Therefore , investigator set operational definition 10 mmHg great increase MAP 25 % workrate maximum knee extensor exercise . This 10 mmHg increase MAP choose value closely match investigator ' preliminary data ( Figure 1 ) previous report concomitantly correspond increase BP least 2 standard deviation great normotensive response ( i.e . 6 2 ( SD ) mmHg increase MAP 25 % workrate maximum ) . The magnitude exerciseinduced increase MAP determine preliminary testing . It note magnitude pressor response grade relation exercise intensity , therefore , establish inclusion criterion 10 mmHg 25 % workrate maximum , low intensity use propose study , investigator set conservative standard study enrollment . Candidates demonstrate dyslipidemia base National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines plasma total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl LDLcholesterol &gt; 160 mg/dl exclude participation . Hypertensive patient receive dual monotherapy treatment hypertension may include . Less frequently prescribe class drug hypertension ( beta blocker , aldosterone receptor blocker , centrally act sympatholytics , calcium channel blocker , direct vasodilator , renin inhibitor , alpha blocker ) exclude . Additionally , subject report history myocardial infarction , unstable cardiac ischemia , recent cardiac catheterization , carotid artery disease , transient ischemic attack exclude . Participants must orthopedic limitation would prohibit kneeextensor exercise aerobic activity include cycle ergometry treadmill exercise . Due age requirement subject woman may either pre postmenopausal . All premenopausal woman study day 1 7 menstrual cycle standardize influence female hormone . Women take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) currently precede year exclude proposed study due direct vascular effect HRT variety regime employ . Participants make primarily Veterans .</criteria>
