	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate pattern BCR-ABL mutation CML Ph positive ALL patient imatinib resistance year 2001-2009 Asian institute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patterns ABL Mutation Asian With Imatinib Resistant Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Ph Positive Acute Lymphocytc Leuekmia Patients ( AMICA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Awareness significance BCR-ABL mutation generally low across Asia . This partly due historical limitation capability mutation test . While numerous mutation study do non-Asian population , publish report mutation Asians . CML management Asia therefore continue largely intuitive . Anecdotal report , suggest may differences presence absence mutation time initial diagnosis occurrence imatinib treatment . At present , however , comprehensive formal knowledge actual nature mutation Asians . There move towards establishment CML registry capture pattern mutation among Asian patient . In recent year , several laboratory region perform mutation analysis . However , systematic evaluation report data undertaken . This study therefore intend collect document mutation data Asian CML Ph positive ALL patient identify Asian institute . While retrospective , cross-sectional analysis mutation information , study provide first comprehensive formal report mutation Asian CML Ph positive ALL patient . The collect information potential well inform clinical management CML Ph positive ALL Asia accord mutation result possibly future research patient .</detailed_description>
