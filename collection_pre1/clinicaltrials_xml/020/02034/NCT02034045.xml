	<detailed_description>Imagine could leverage exist infrastructure enhance well manage support patient chronic disease community ? Three common chronic disease worldwide Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) , Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . These disease rise currently cost Canadian health care system billion dollar every year include cost unnecessary hospitalization ED visit . The current structure health care system capacity effectively care patient future . Paramedics currently employ 24-7 provide Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) urban , rural setting across Canada . They highly train health care practitioner connect mobile community currently work medically delegate act model physicians regularly rely independent judgment give significant advantage assess patient . The evidence already tell u collaborative Chronic Care Models improve patient outcomes decrease overall health care utilization . What leverage incredible resource enhance patient care community set ? We hypothesize train paramedic chronic disease management conduct home visit assess treat patient medical delegation patient ' primary care physician reduce rate acute care hospitalization , ED visit , EMS utilization , Family Health Team ( FHT ) utilization COPD , DM CHF patient . So find work ? We propose randomize controlled trial ( Level 1 evidence ) rigorously study effectiveness community paramedicine model versus standard care . The primary study question whether non-emergency community paramedic conduct home visit undertake assessment evidence-based treatment patient medical delegation primary care physicians decrease rate hospitalization chronic disease patient . Our intervention apply select Ontario Family Health Team ( FHT ) patient diagnose COPD , CHF DM . We plan randomize 695 patient : patient randomize intervention group assess treat home visit community paramedic . Patients randomize control group continue receive usual care participate Family Health Teams . The number hospitalization , hospital length stay , ED visit , EMS utilization cost-effectiveness compare use exist administrative database . We feasibility trial since March 2013 confirm recruitment data collection approach . The intent Partnerships Health System Improvement ( PHSI ) program strengthen Canada 's health care system collaborative , applied policy-relevant research . Our project develop strong partnership Centennial College ; Central Community Care Access Centre ; York Region Emergency Medical Services ; Health For All Family Health Team ; Markham Family Health Team ; Rescu , Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute , St. Michael 's Hospital ; Sunnybrook Centre Prehospital Medicine . We also partner directly Primary Care Branch Ministry Health Long Term Care ensure fruitful integrate knowledge translation plan policy level . By engage key stakeholder upfront already create necessary linkage make health system innovation possible . If find effective , simplicity community paramedicine model allow scalable various way EMS service across country . It could also expand include management several condition . Funding get tight health care capacity increasingly challenge come year - innovation use exist resource future health system improvement . Community paramedicine perfect example type innovation project provide evidence need decision maker knowledge user significantly impact primary care policy make future .</detailed_description>
