	<brief_summary>This Phase II , open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study oral Dabrafenib combination oral Trametinib subject rare cancer include anaplastic thyroid cancer , biliary tract cancer , gastrointestinal stromal tumor , non-seminomatous germ cell tumor/non-geminomatous germ cell tumor , hairy cell leukemia , World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade 1 2 glioma , WHO Grade 3 4 ( high-grade ) glioma , multiple myeloma , adenocarcinoma small intestine , BRAF V600E positive-mutations . This study design determine overall response rate ( ORR ) oral Dabrafenib combination oral Trametinib subject rare BRAF V600E mutate cancer . Subjects need fresh frozen tumor tissue sample provide confirm BRAF V600E mutation status . Only subject histologically confirm advanced disease available standard treatment option eligible enrollment . Subjects undergo screen assessment within 14 day ( 35 day ophthalmology exam , echocardiogram disease assessment ) prior start treatment determine eligibility enrollment study .</brief_summary>

BRAF V600E mutationpositive tumor : Local test Local BRAF mutation test result obtain Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) approve local laboratory may use permit enrollment subject positive result . Local BRAF mutation test result subject central verification ; Central test Local BRAF mutation test result confirm central test CLIA approve , designated central reference laboratory THxID BRAF assay alternate GSK designate assay . NOTE : For central testing , Formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) core bone marrow ( BM ) biopsies acceptable subject Multiple myeloma ( MM ) cohort . Able swallow retain orally administer medication . NOTE : Subject clinically significant gastrointestinal ( GI ) abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . For example , subject 50 % large intestine remove sign malabsorption ( i.e. , diarrhea ) .NOTE : If clarification need whether condition significantly affect absorption study treatment , contact GSK Medical Monitor . Female Subjects Childbearing Potential : Subjects must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior first dose study treatment agree use effective contraception , throughout treatment period 4 month last dose study treatment . French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Prior treatment : BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor ( ) ; anticancer therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy delay toxicity , immunotherapy , biologic therapy chemoradiation ) within 21 day ( within 42 day prior nitrosourea mitomycin C contain therapy ) prior enrollment and/or daily weekly chemotherapy without potential delayed toxicity within 14 day prior enrolment ; Investigational drug ( ) within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , prior enrollment Previous major surgery within 21 day prior enrollment . Prior extensive radiotherapy treatment within 21 day prior enrolment . NOTE : Limited radiotherapy palliative care permit within 14 day prior enrollment long radiationrelated toxicity resolve prior enrollment . Prior solid organ transplantation allogenic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . NOTE : Previous autologous bone marrow transplant ( ABMT ) autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) permit . History : Interstitial lung disease pneumonitis ; Another malignancy . NOTE : Subjects another malignancy eligible : ( ) diseasefree 3 year , ( b ) history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer , and/or ( c ) indolent second malignancy ( y ) define slow grow second/concurrent malignancy characterize slow growth , high initial response rate relapsing , progressive disease course . For example , previously untreated low grade select intermediategrade lymphoid malignancy would allow per available body evidence . There available clinical alternative propose population . Consult GSK Medical Monitor unsure whether second malignancy meet requirement specify . Presence : cerebral metastasis ( except subject WHO Grade 1 2 Glioma WHO Grade 3 4 Glioma histology cohort ) . NOTE : Subjects brain metastasis may include : All know lesion previously treat surgery stereotactic radiosurgery , Any remain cerebral lesion ( ) asymptomatic confirm stable disease ( i.e. , increase lesion size ) &gt; =90 day prior enrollment document two consecutive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan contrast , No treatment corticosteroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant require &gt; =30 day prior enrolment . Approval receive GSK Medical Monitor . Presence symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal spinal cord compression . NOTE : Subjects previously treat condition stable central nervous system ( CNS ) disease ( documented consecutive imaging study ) &gt; 60 day , asymptomatic currently take corticosteroid , stable dose corticosteroid least 30 day prior enrollment , permit . Presence preexist &gt; = Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . Presence unresolved treatmentrelated toxicity &gt; = Grade 2 ( except alopecia ) toxicity list general histologyspecific adequate organ function table time enrolment . Presence serious and/or unstable preexist medical disorder ( aside malignancy exception ) , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study procedure . History current evidence/risk retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) : History RVO CSR , predispose factor RVO CSR ( e.g. , uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , uncontrolled systemic disease hypertension diabetes mellitus , history hyperviscosity hypercoagulability syndrome ) ; Visible retinal pathology assess ophthalmic examination consider risk factor RVO CSR evidence new optic disc cupping , evidence new visual field defect intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg . History evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : Acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting within 6 month prior enrolment ; Clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias NOTE : Subjects control atrial fibrillation &gt; 30 day prior enrollment eligible ; Class II higher congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) criterion ; Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) institutional low limit normal ( LLN ) . NOTE : If LLN exist institution , use LVEF &lt; 50 % . ; Corrected QT ( QTc ) interval heart rate use Bazettcorrected QT interval ( QTcB ) &gt; =480 millisecond ( msec ) ; Intracardiac defibrillator and/or permanent pacemaker ; Treatmentrefractory hypertension define blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 140/90 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) may control antihypertensive medication ( ) and/or lifestyle modification ; Known cardiac metastasis . Current use prohibit medication ( ) requirement prohibit medication study . NOTE : Use anticoagulant warfarin permit ; however , international normalization ratio ( INR ) must monitor accord local institutional practice . Positive : Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody . NOTE : Subjects laboratory evidence clear hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection permit . NOTE : False positive subject may clear enrollment base RNAbased assay ; Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ; test require .
