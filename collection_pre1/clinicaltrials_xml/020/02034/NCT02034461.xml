	<brief_summary>The investigator study basic physiology human peripheral nerve use high-count microelectrode array implant peripheral nerve patient limb amputation peripheral nerve injury . These microelectrodes custom-made available commercial distribution . The investigator hypothesize record neural signal large number microelectrodes provide selective motor information high enough number allow control future artificial device many move part , i.e . artificial limbs shoulder , elbow , wrist , and/or individual finger move . These study also investigate extent microstimulation nerve fiber provide sensory feedback prosthetic limb . The investigator also conduct three acute surgery Utah slant Electrode Array ( USEA ) implant volunteer undergo limb amputation . These acute implantation provide Dr. Hutchinson human surgical experience implant USEAs evaluate containment system use immobilize implanted USEA nerve .</brief_summary>
