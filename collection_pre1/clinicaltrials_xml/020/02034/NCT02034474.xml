	<brief_title>Tocilizumab Add-On Treatment For Residual Positive , Negative , Cognitive Symptoms Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One main mediator effect infection/inflammation human body cytokine . Recent data suggest cytokine , particular IL-6 , may mediate effect lifetime prenatal infection schizophrenia risk . Preclinical model schizophrenia support convergence role IL-6 pathophysiology schizophrenia major neurochemical hypothesis schizophrenia-the dopamine glutamate hypothesis . Namely , IL-6 dysfunction excess promote schizophrenia-like behavior schizophrenia-like biochemical electrophysiological profile , IL-6 knockout neutralization mitigate abnormality . Furthermore , plasma IL-6 level elevate acutely psychotic treat patient , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) study show active inflammation brain individual psychosis . Finally , treatment individual schizophrenia non-specific anti-inflammatory agent , celecoxib aspirin , suggest role anti-inflammatory agent schizophrenia . These data also suggest study immunologic agent specifically target underlie pathophysiology schizophrenia may efficacious . Tocilizumab ( ActemraÂ® ) FDA-approved humanize monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor use treatment rheumatoid arthritis individual respond least one TNF-alpha therapy juvenile idiopathic arthritis</detailed_description>
