	<criteria>Signed date informed consent , approve Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , obtain prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment . The subject must able understand comply protocol requirement instruction . Males females &gt; =18 year age ( time consent obtain ) . Histologically cytologically document stage IV NSCLC , prior histopathological report show one following : Evidence Epidermal growth factor receptor activate mutation positive ( EGFRm ) Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) / Wild Type ( WT ) gene Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) derive formalinfixed paraffinembedded human nonsmall cell lung cancer tumor tissue ; An orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ( ROS1 ) chromosomal rearrangement determine ectopic expression ROS1 protein immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and/or detection ROS1 rearrangement determine Fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; In Cohort 3 , subject alternative molecular profile ( e.g. , Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [ NRTK ] , Tyrosine kinase receptor member glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) family [ RET ] , etc . ) may enrol subset cohort emerge data suggest would likely respond therapy . If genetic analysis perform previously , copy complete mutation profile request . Tumor biopsy : For Cohort 1 Cohort 2 , fresh tumor sample progression erlotinib , gefitinib , afatinib , another EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) start study require ; addition , archival sample obtain preEGFRTKI require ( available ) . For Cohort 3 , subject crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive require provide copy genetic report show ROS1 positive mutation archival tissue available ; subject ROS1 fusion progress crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor require provide copy genetic report show ROS1 positive mutation fresh biopsy . Subjects must meet one follow : Cohort 1 ( EGFRm ) : Has document progression ( base RECIST 1.1 criterion ) &gt; =4 month clinical benefit prior erlotinib/gefitinib/afatinib therapy within 30 day prior first dose foretinib ; Cohort 2 ( EGFR/WT ) : Has document progression ( base RECIST 1.1criteria ) &gt; =2 month clinical benefit prior EGFRTKI therapy within 30 day prior first dose foretinib , ; Cohort 3 : For ROS1 subset , document progression ( base RECIST 1.1 criterion ) intolerant prior crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor therapy naive crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor . Note : Crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive subject eligible study crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor available participation trial option target ROS1 treatment . For additional biomarkerdriven subset , write documentation entry requirement provide IRB ( ) /IEC ( ) . Only one prior line EGFRTKI therapy immediately precede enrolment current study Cohorts 1 2 . Progression occur single agent EGFRTKI treatment 1st line set EGFRm subject , 2nd line maintenance set EGFRm EGFR/WT subject . Measurable disease , i.e. , present least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 . Subjects must participate another clinical trial except single agent EGFRTKI crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor within past 3 month may receive intervene therapy kind ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , etc . ) time progression prior TKI enrolment trial . Additional requirement regard prior therapy may add Cohort 3 subset add study . Note : Subjects may continue treatment prior TKI progress 30 day period discretion investigator , must discontinue prior TKI allow 5 halflives drug prior first dose foretinib study . A minimum 14 day must elapse since palliative radiotherapy subject must recover treatment related toxicity prior enrolment . A minimum 14 day elapse last surgery prior first dose wound healing occur . If subject exploratory thoracotomy , must recover procedure prior start . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Any ongoing potentially reversible treatmentrelated toxicity must ( National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 4.03 ( NCICTCAE v4.03 ) &lt; =Grade 1 progress severity , except alopecia expect EGFRTKI toxicity rash diarrhea stable intervention agree GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor investigator . Adequate baseline organ function define protocol . Note : Laboratory result obtain Screening use determine eligibility criterion . In situation laboratory result outside permitted range , investigator may opt retest subject subsequent within range screen result may use confirm eligibility . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day first dose study treatment agree use effective contraception , define protocol , study 21 day follow last dose study treatment . Men female partner childbearing potential must either prior vasectomy agree use effective contraception describe protocol least 14 day prior administration first dose study 21 day last dose study treatment allow clearance alter sperm . Subjects must discontinue hormone replacement therapy prior study enrolment due potential inhibition cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize estrogen progestin . Cotinine level within quantification limit assay . Subjects erlotinib combination cohort must stop smoke prior study entry must use nicotinecontaining product , include nicotine patch gum , within past 6 month . Able swallow retain orally administer study treatment . French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Lactating female . Active malignancy disease study within past 3 year , except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin Subjects untreated brain meningeal metastasis eligible ( computerized tomography [ CT ] scan require rule unless clinical suspicion central nervous system [ CNS ] disease ) . Subjects treat radiologic clinical evidence stable brain metastasis ( confirm 2 scan least 4 week apart ) , evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion eligible provide asymptomatic require corticosteroid . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent , compliance study procedure , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor . Current use prohibit medication requirement medication treatment foretinib erlotinib . Have know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate foretinib erlotinib excipients opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor contraindicate participation . Presence active gastrointestinal disease ( include Gastrointestinal [ GI ] bleed ulceration ) condition could affect GI absorption ( e.g. , malabsorption syndrome ) , history biliary tract disease , presence uncontrolled emesis . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , hepatic , renal , cardiac disease ) . Subjects appreciable cavitation central thoracic lesion lesion abut major blood vessel eligible . Subjects overt bleed site ( &gt; 30 milliliter [ mL ] bleeding/episode ) within 3 month study entry eligible . No clinically relevant hemoptysis ( &gt; 5 mL fresh blood ) within 4 week prior study entry permit . Subjects fleck blood sputum permit . Any question criterion direct GSK Medical Monitor prior registration . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; =470 millisecond ( msec ) . Other clinically significant ECG abnormality include 2nd degree ( type II ) 3rd degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block . History pulmonary embolism ( PE ) deep venous thrombosis ( e.g. , calf vein thrombosis ) within past 6 month except subject recent Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) treat therapeutic anticoagulating agent least 6 week .
