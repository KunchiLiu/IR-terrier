	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single dose GSK2256294 healthy young elderly subject explore effect food , gender age drug exposure . The biliary metabolite healthy young male investigate use Entero-test single oral dose GSK2256294 . This study conduct two cohort ( Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ) . Cohort 1 open label order characterise PK profile GSK2256294 healthy young male also investigate biliary metabolite GSK2256294 . Cohort 2 us crossover design allow comparison PK parameter GSK2256294 feed fasted state within subject also compare PK parameter GSK2256294 male female subject . A washout period minimum 2 week choose allow adequate washout GSK2256294 .</brief_summary>

Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 2 week postlast dose . Body weight &gt; =60 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 19 35 kg per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xUpper limit normal [ ULN ] ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Consultation GSK Medical Monitor require . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Safety Cohort 2 Only A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy [ definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ] ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milli international unit per milliliter ( mIU/mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per milliliter ( pg/mL ) ( &lt; 147 picomole per liter ) confirmatory ] . [ Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method list protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . ] Other Cohort 1 Only . Cohort 1 : Male age 18 45 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Cohort 1 : BP &lt; =130/80 .
