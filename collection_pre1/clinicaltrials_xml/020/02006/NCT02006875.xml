	<brief_summary>To use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) treat stroke patient get popular idea . Previous study seem support effect facilitate motor recovery stroke . This study focus motor recovery low extremity . Investigators conduct study evaluate treatment effect rTMS functional performance low extremity term postural control , balance , mobility stroke patient . Investigators hypothesize performance could improve good motor control low extremity cause rTMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS Study Improve Functional Performance Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol : 1 . Setting : inpatient rehabilitation department Shuang-Ho Hospital . 2 . Study population : Patients receive inpatient treatment rehabilitation stroke Shuang-Ho Hospital ( SHH ) . 3 . Eligibility . Screening eligibility do 2 physiatrists rehabilitation department SHH . 4 . Study design : control trial stratify randomization 5 . Blinding 1 . The patient blind real sham coil rTMS 2 . The assessor perform outcome measurement blind assignment treatment . 6 . Measurements . 1 . Baseline demographic record . The stroke severity measure National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) , Modified Rankin Scale ( MRS ) , Brunnstrum stage , Manual muscle test ( MMT ) intervention . 2 . Clinical assessment . - Postural control assess Postural Assessment Scale Stroke Patients ( PASS ) - The motor recovery low extremity assess low extremity subscale Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA-LE ) - The balance gait subscales Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment ( POMA-b POMA-g ) - Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test use assess gross mobility . - Barthel Index ( BI ) ADL independence - modify Rankin Scale ( MRS ) disability classification also collect . 3 . These measurement ( include clinical corticomotor excitability assessment ) perform one researcher responsible measurement . 7 . Compliance side effect . The compliance intervention investigate . The attendance treatment ( include rTMS session physical therapy session ) possible side effect/discomfort record intervention researcher . He also try understand reason drop-out study .</detailed_description>
