Patients prior exposure agent direct HER axis ( e.g . erlotinib , gefitinib , cetuximab , trastuzumab ) . 2 . Received treatment investigational agent , participate another clinical trial , follow exception . Chemotherapyonly trial permit ( completed≧ 28 day prior receive first dose study drug ) . Previous adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment nonmetastatic disease permit complete ≥ 6 month receive first dose study drug ; c ) Prior surgery permit perform ≥ 4 week receive first dose study drug patient fully recover . Prior localize radiotherapy permit administered target lesion select study , unless progression select target lesion within radiation portal document , provide complete ≥ 4 week receive first dose study drug . Participation methodological observational study investigational agent give 3 . Patients brain metastasis spinal cord compression yet definitively treat surgery and/or radiation ; previously diagnose treat CNS metastases spinal cord compression without evidence stable disease ( clinically stable image ) least 2 month 4 . History another malignancy last 5 year exception following : Other malignancy cure surgery alone continuous diseasefree interval 5 year permit . Cured basal cell carcinoma skin cure situ carcinoma uterine cervix permit . 5 . Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality , especially severe dry eye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , Sjögren syndrome , severe exposure keratitis disorder likely increase risk corneal epithelial lesion .
