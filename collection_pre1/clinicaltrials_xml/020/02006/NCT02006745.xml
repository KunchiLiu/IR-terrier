	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore treatment patient acute hepatitis C infection ( infection acquire within last 6 month ) also infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Trial Pegylated Interferon , Ribavirin Telaprevir Versus Pegylated Interferon Ribavirin Alone Treatment Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Virus Infection Patients With HIV-1 Co-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , compare two treatment option hepatitis C patient also HIV infection , see difference number patient treat successfully get rid hepatitis C virus treatment complete . We also compare well two treatment option tolerate patient take .</detailed_description>
