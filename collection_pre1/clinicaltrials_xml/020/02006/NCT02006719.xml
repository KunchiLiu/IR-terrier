	<criteria>Unilateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis one shoulder least 3 month 12 month ( Frozen Stage ) Normal range motion contralateral shoulder Restricted active range motion ( AROM ) affect shoulder define : deficit least 60 degree total AROM affect shoulder compare total AROM contralateral shoulder deficit least 30 degree AROM least one follow plane compare contralateral shoulder : Forward flexion Abduction External rotation elbow 90 degree abduction Internal rotation elbow 90 degree abduction Has receive treatment adhesive capsulitis plan receive treatment adhesive capsulitis time study include limited : physical therapy acupuncture within 2 week first injection study drug intraarticular intrabursal injection ( ) lidocaine ; suprascapular nerve block ; corticosteroid , electroanalgesic and/or thermoanalgesic modality within 1 month screen visit intraarticular intrabursal injection ( ) sodium hyaluronate and/or glenohumeral distension arthrography within 3 month screen visit surgical intervention ( include shoulder manipulation anesthesia ) time Has follow condition , determine investigator potentially confound evaluation safety efficacy : Adhesive capsulitis result traumatic injury ( ie , direct injury shoulder fracture humerus clavicle immediately precede onset episode adhesive capsulitis ) . Traumatic event past temporally relate onset episode adhesive capsulitis would necessarily exclude subject participate study . Active subacromial impingement affect shoulder Calcified tendonitis affect shoulder Glenohumeral joint arthritis affect shoulder Arthrosis affect shoulder Chondrolysis affect shoulder Subscapularis tendon rupture affect shoulder Other rotator cuff injury affect shoulder Uncontrolled hypertension Uncontrolled diabetes Uncontrolled thyroid disease History thrombosis postthrombosis syndrome Physical impairment would preclude perform protocol define exercise Active infection area treat Clinically significant neurological disease Bleeding disorder Chronic use anticoagulation medication subject clear medically stop take medication 7 day prior injection . Less equal 150 mg aspirin allow study . Known active hepatitis A , B , C Other significant medical condition ( eg , morbid obesity , cervical disc disease ) , investigator 's opinion would make subject unsuitable enrollment study Has receive oral intravenous steroid reason within 3 week screen visit Has receive investigational drug treatment within 30 day first dose study drug . Has know allergy collagenase excipient AA4500 procedural medication . Has , time , receive collagenase treatment adhesive capsulitis . Is unable undergo xray MRI ( contraindication ) evaluation affect shoulder . Is plan treat commercial XIAFLEX time study .</criteria>
