	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose The purpose study investigate whether perform single bout exercise 24 hour prior receive infusion anthracycline chemotherapy agent doxorubicin breast cancer prevent damage cardiac effect . Currently , doxorubicin effective chemotherapy agent breast cancer also damage . As , increase risk cardiovascular disease grow concern doxorubicin-treated patient . Current strategy minimize cardiac injury dose reduction discontinuation therapy , compromise effectiveness treatment . Interventions minimize cardiac injury associate doxorubicin could reduce cancer-related cardiovascular disease-related mortality woman diagnose breast cancer . 2 . Hypotheses 1 . Performing acute bout exercise within 24 hour anthracycline infusion decrease acute negative change marker cardiotoxicity first anthracycline infusion see exercise 72 hour prior . 2 . Performing exercise within 24 hour every infusion anthracycline decrease negative change marker cardiac dysfunction see end chemotherapy exercise 72 hour prior infusion . 3 ) Justification An acute exercise bout prior induction myocardial infarction animal provide cardioprotective benefit reduce size infarct relative control animal . Recently , acute exercise perform 24 hour anthracycline injection rodent also provide cardioprotective benefit . Oxidative stress apoptosis cardiomyocyte mitochondrion primary mechanism anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity . The single acute bout exercise prevent attenuate anthracycline-induced negative effect cardiomyocytes include oxidative stress , apoptosis , mitochondrial dysfunction , well systolic dysfunction . There study date investigate cardiac effect acute bout exercise close proximity anthracycline infusion human . Aerobic exercise training recommend throughout chemotherapy treatment , guideline place term time exercise relation receipt chemotherapy infusion . 4 ) Objectives 1 . To compare acute effect perform exercise ( within 24 hour first infusion ) compare exercise ( exercise 72 hour prior first infusion ) marker cardiotoxicity 24-48 hour first anthracycline infusion . 2 . To compare chronic effect perform exercise ( within 24 hour every infusion ) compare exercise ( exercise 72 hour prior every infusion ) marker cardiotoxicity 7 14 day final anthracycline infusion 5 ) Research Method This study two-arm randomize control trial . Twenty-four woman age 18 old newly diagnose stage I-IIIA breast cancer , schedule receive neoadjuvant adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy cycle 2-3 week recruit oncologist referral poster . Participants randomize one two condition : ) acute bout exercise perform ≤24 hour prior cycle anthracyclines exercise 24-48 hour post ; ii ) exercise 72 hour prior 24-48 hour post cycle anthracyclines . 6 ) Statistical Analysis The primary outcome global longitudinal strain measure echocardiography . The secondary outcome NT-proBNP cardiac biomarker measure assay blood take via venous blood draw , cardiac strain parameter , well standard systolic diastolic echocardiographic parameter . The exploratory outcome signal-averaged electrocardiography . Outcome measure perform follow time point : 1 ) Post diagnosis &gt; 24 hour prior first cycle anthracyclines ; 2 ) 24-48 hour first cycle ; 3 ) least one week last cycle anthracyclines , subsequent chemotherapy treatment . Baseline characteristic two group compare independent t-tests . Descriptive statistic frequency calculate continuous categorical variable . The Shapiro-Wilk test use test assumption normality continuous variable . Levene 's test use test homogeneity variance assumption . The acute effect determine difference time point 1 ) 2 ) . The chronic effect determine difference time point 1 ) 3 ) . For analysis , time condition ( 2 x 2 ) repeat mixed model ANOVA perform . If interaction effect statistically significant , main effect time condition explore . An alpha 0.05 used analysis . The required sample size estimate 20 participant base report global longitudinal strain change prior anthracyclines post anthracyclines breast cancer patient . To allow 20 % dropout rate , 24 participant total recruit .</detailed_description>
