	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Flares Following Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Children With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , pilot , observational , prospective study safety inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV ) child systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) conduct 2013-2014 influenza season . Annual receipt IIV recommend person SLE consider standard care medical practice . The study test conventional novel biomarkers assess disease flare vaccine response also collect self-reported signs/symptoms reactogenicity diaries 14 day vaccination . Little known immune response influenza vaccine child adolescent autoimmune condition , term immunogenicity well potential trigger worsen immune/autoimmune pathway . Patients SLE often must take two immunosuppressive medication control illness . Thus , critically important study vaccine safety immunogenicity within pediatric SLE population rather extrapolate limited data available adult clinical study . Newly diagnose , untreated patient sick include study . After , patient immunosuppressive regimen extend period time . This project inform process subsequent large multi-center study ass IIV safety utilize establish clinical research network pediatric rheumatology , Childhood Arthritis Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) venue . The pilot study enroll 30 child mild moderate SLE define Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) &lt; 6 . A SLEDAI score SLE Disease Activity Index consist 24 item make clinical data laboratory result . This score assess time patient SLE see clinic . It anticipated subject would enrol 2 3 month prior influenza season , immunize SLE patient IIV would expose circulate wild-type influenza virus . Patients follow 3 month . Thirty patient receive one two different treatment regimens standard-of-care regime , `` Prednisone + Hydroxychloroquine '' Prednisone+ Hydroxychloroquine + Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) , observe . All subject receive US-licensed influenza vaccine part standard medical practice . These two regimen choose represent customary care immunosuppressant medication regimen person SLE . In addition , MMF second treatment arm inhibitory effect plasma cell development , therefore allow u explore whether patient receive drug diminish antibody responses response vaccination . Fifteen patient already receive Prednisone + Hydroxychloroquine 15 patient already receive Prednisone+ Hydroxychloroquine + Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) routine care</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow criterion allow participate study : 1 . Complete immunization history must available time enrollment 2 . Patients age 818 year time enrollment 3 . Patient stable disease activity ( change SLEDAI &gt; 2 point ) 3 month precede enrollment . 4 . Patients enrol soon seasonal IIV available prior onset influenza activity community . Generally September 2013January2014 . If feasible , enrollment end December 2013 , usually influenza circulates widely community . Subjects meet follow criterion allow participate study : 1 . Females know pregnant breastfeeding 2 . Moderate high SLE disease activity enrollment ( SLEDAI &gt; 6 ) 3 . Oral temp ≥100F ( ≥37.8 ) within 72 hour prior vaccination 4 . History allergy egg egg product history allergic reaction previous influenza vaccination vaccine constituent 5 . History GuillainBarré syndrome previous immunization 6 . Unstable SLE disease activity 3 month prior enrollment ( change SLEDAI score &gt; 2 ) 7 . Requirement highdose IV Solumedrol and/or Cytoxan pulse therapy 6 month prior study 8 . Any condition study site investigator deems would put patient unacceptable risk injury render patient unable meet requirement protocol . 9 . Received premedication analgesic antipyretic agent 6 hour prior first vaccination , plan medication analgesic antipyretic week follow first vaccination . This criterion preclude subject receive medication need arises . However , premedication discourage . 10 . Patient receive inactivated vaccine within 14 day prior administration IIV . 11 . Patient schedule receive another routinely administer inactivated vaccine within 14 day IIV . 12 . Patient currently participate study involve experimental agent ( vaccine , drug , biologic , device , blood product , medication ) , expect receive another experimental agent participation study</criteria>
