	<brief_title>Imaging Kidney Transplant Rejection Using Ferumoxytol-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In child kidney transplant , immunologically mediate rejection major cause allograft failure . Thus , therapeutic success kidney transplant highly dependent ability avoid rejection acute chronic phase transplantation . Children kidney transplant currently undergo least three routine ( protocol ) biopsy first two year transplantation addition biopsy require investigate deterioration kidney function . These biopsy invasive nearly always require general anesthesia , cause anxiety distress patient parent , well significant cost health care system . There currently non-invasive diagnostic tool capable detect rejection vivo . Thus , goal study develop non-invasive image test vivo detection kidney transplant rejection . The investigator propose accomplish goal detect macrophage infiltration kidney transplant iron oxide nanoparticle-enhanced MR imaging . Macrophages play major role transplant rejection . CD68-positive macrophage comprise approximately 50 % infiltrate leukocyte population renal allograft rejection , co-localize area tissue-damage fibrosis , preponderant severe form rejection . The investigator hypothesize iron oxide nanoparticle-enhanced MR image detect difference macrophage infiltration renal allograft undergo rejection oppose allograft without significant rejection . This hypothesis base bio-physical property intravenously inject superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles , phagocytosed tissue macrophage cause strong signal effect MR image . The specific aim study follow : Aim # 1 . Technical Development Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping ( QSM ) -Sequence vivo MRI detection quantification iron oxide nanoparticle-labeled macrophages.This aim focus technical development Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping ( QSM ) , novel MR imaging pulse sequence use accurately quantify tissue concentration free ferumoxytol ferumoxytol macrophages renal allograft . Based pulse sequence optimization phantoms know concentration free cell-bound iron , expect generate accurate estimate tissue iron concentration macrophages QSM-MRI method . Aim # 2 . Detect rejection kidney allograft ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI . The investigator hypothesize ferumoxytol detect quantify macrophages kidney allograft , base upon observation iron oxide nanoparticles take macrophage malignant tumor . The investigator evaluate ability ferumoxytol map macrophage quantity renal allograft , histopathological correlation . We expect significantly high ferumoxytol-MRI enhancement macrophage quantity reject allograft compare non-rejected allograft .</detailed_description>
