	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Feasibility Chronic Cavernous Nerve Stimulation Promote Regeneration Erectile Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study explore feasibility use implantable neurostimulation device/leads post radical robotic prostatectomy method enhance neural recovery/penile rehabilitation and/or erectile dysfunction treatment . This single center pilot study 10 patient . The lead place stimulate intraoperatively assess proper placement stimulation parameter need achieve change penile length and/or circumference . One week post operatively , lead connect external stimulator device activate . Subjects instructed stimulate lead turn device day six week . The lead remove six week post operative subject follow two year .</detailed_description>
