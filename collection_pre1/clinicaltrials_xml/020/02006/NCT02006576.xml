	<detailed_description>The Prostaglandin Inhibition Emphysema ( PIE ) study determine currently available therapy , ibuprofen 600 mg three time daily , block PGE production lower respiratory tract result improvement measure lung repair function . This proof-of-concept study . The PIE study set stage novel therapy modify course chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . COPD third lead cause death United States . No currently available treatment meaningfully restore lung function lose disease . Emphysema major component COPD result lung damage exceeds ability lung repair . Recent evidence indicate repair process present normal lung deficient patient emphysema due , part , suppression repair inflammatory mediator : prostaglandin E ( PGE ) . Currently available therapy block PGE production , whether achieve lung COPD unknown . The PIE study answer question . This accomplish perform randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study compare widely use well-tolerated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , ibuprofen 600 mg three time daily , placebo . PGE measure directly low respiratory tract sample lung technique bronchoalveolar lavage . Secondary measure make , quantify PGE induce sputum quantify PGE metabolite blood urine . In addition , current proposal determine biochemical measure lung repair restore treatment block PGE production . Additional outcome also assess include effect treatment PGD eicosanoids assess IL-8 neutrophil sputum BAL fluid select inflammatory biomarkers present serum may associate lung function decline . Finally , accompany Ancillary Study , current proposal determine alveolar macrophage over-produce PGE and/or PGD COPD determine microRNA miR-146a modulates production prostaglandin , demonstrate lung fibroblast . The Ancillary Study also determine genetic variation miR-146a related differential expression . The propose research , therefore , determine inhibition PGE production achieve lung , appear restore lung repair mechanism help determine would benefit therapeutic approach . This highly novel approach treatment emphysema potential restore lose lung function , crucial unmet medical need major public health problem .</detailed_description>
