	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Find Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) TLC399 ( ProDex ) Patients With Macular Edema Due Retinal Vein Occlusion ( RVO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 part : Part 1 open-label , sequential dose escalation part determine Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) TLC399 ( ProDex ) patient macular edema due central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Part 2 randomize , single-masked part study design investigate use TLC399 ( ProDex ) patient macular edema due central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Each 3 group maximum 10 subject , add Part 1 Part 2 . Part 1 : About 9 18 patient undergo screen fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion order eligible enter part study . The screening period last 28 day . At first , 3 patient enrol Group 1 administer single intravitreal injection TLC399 ( ProDex ) , i.e. , 0.36 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate ( DSP ) 100 mM phospholipid ( PL ) ( 30 µL ) Day 0 . After intravitreal injection , patient observe 4 week Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) . If 1 3 patient develop Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , cohort expand maximum 6 patient ( another 3 patient add subsequently ) . If exactly 1 6 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , escalation next dose level ( i.e. , Group 2 ) occur . If 1 patient 6 develops Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , study temporarily suspend . The protocol amend new dos identify restart study . If none first 3 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , dose escalation proceed next cohort patient ( i.e. , Group 2 ) . n Group 2 , similar manner , 3 patient enrol administered single intravitreal injection TLC399 ( ProDex ) , i.e. , 0.6 mg DSP 100 mM PL ( 50 µL ) Day 0 . After intravitreal injection , patient observe 4 week DLT ( ) . If 1 3 patient develop Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , cohort expand maximum 6 patient ( another 3 patient add subsequently ) . If exactly 1 6 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , escalation next dose level ( i.e. , Group 3 ) occur . If 1 patient 6 develops Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , dose Group 1 Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) . This part study stop Part 2 study commence dose . If none first 3 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , dose escalation proceed next cohort patient ( i.e. , Group 3 ) . In Group 3 , similar manner , 3 patient enrol administered single intravitreal injection TLC399 ( ProDex ) , i.e. , 0.6 mg DSP 50 mM PL ( 50 µL ) Day 0 . After intravitreal injection , patient observe 4 week Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) . If 1 3 patient develop Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , cohort expand maximum 6 patient ( another 3 patient add subsequently ) . If patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) exactly 1 6 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , study proceed Part 2 3 dose group , Groups 1 , 2 , 3 . If 1 patient 6 develops Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , dose Group 2 Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) . Part 2 study commence 2 dose group , Groups 1 2 . After completion Part 1 , patient continue evaluate efficacy safety outcomes period 12 month unless patient withdrawn discontinues study . The evaluation similar Part 2 Visit 3 onwards end study . Escalation next plan dose level require approval informal cohort review meeting . The cohort review group comprise Principal Investigator , contract research organization 's ( CRO 's ) Medical Monitor Project Manager ( facilitate meeting write minute ) , Sponsor 's Chief Scientific Officer , President , designee . The review meeting hold patient complete 4-week observational period dose group . The Investigators whose patient review meet must participate meeting . The rest Investigators study invited participate optional basis . The cohort review group review safety data date include adverse event ( AEs ) , clinically significant laboratory abnormality , Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) ( define later synopsis ) decide whether study advance unaltered , protocol require amendment , halt recruitment resolution specific issue , terminate study . Part 2 Once Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) establish , enrollment continue expand dose cohort ( dose cohort ) maximum 10 subject dose level ( inclusive subject Part 1 Part 2 study ) . After completion Part 1 study , patient screen period 28 day eligible part study . The inclusion exclusion criterion Part 2 Part 1 study . The number subject enrol part decide completion Part 1 . About 12 21 patient randomize Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) observe 2 subject dose level 1 3 group ( Groups 1 , 2 , 3 ) : - Group 1 : 0.36 mg DSP 100 mM PL ( 30 µL ) - Group 2 : 0.6 mg DSP 100 mM PL ( 50 µL ) - Group 3 : 0.6 mg DSP 50 mM PL ( 50 µL ) Randomization perform centrally . Stratification enrol patient do RVO type ( BRVO CRVO ) meaningful data analysis . Only patient mask . The Investigator well administration staff aware dose study medication . The safety efficacy outcome assess 12 month . If 2 6 subject Group 2 experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , Part 2 study proceed subject Group 1 . If 2 6 subject Group 3 experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , Part 2 study proceed subject randomize either Group 1 Group 2 . Parts 1 2 The Investigator select 1 eye per patient study eye . During trial , underlie inflammatory condition fellow eye , topical steroid periocular intravitreal steroid injection could use . If eye eligible study , eligible eye short duration disease ( macular edema ) use study eye . Any patient experiencing worsen disease judge Investigator visual acuity loss 15 letter ( study eye ) base Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) measurement may treat therapy ( include laser photocoagulation , intravitreal periocular steroid injection , intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] ) Investigator deem appropriate ensure patient safety . These treatment , though prohibit , require patient discontinue study . Their efficacy safety outcome include intent-to-treat ( ITT ) safety analysis , respectively . The data patient receive prohibited treatment/medications consider major protocol violation exclude per-protocol ( PP ) analyse . Safety interim analysis perform every 6 month formal safety interim analysis report issue .</detailed_description>
