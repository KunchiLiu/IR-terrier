	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect telemedicine video-consultation ( TVC ) frequency hospital re-admissions 12 month follow-up TVC among patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Our secondary aim assess impact TVC length recurrent hospital stays time re-admission within 12 month follow-up TVC . We also want evaluate patient satisfaction relate TVC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Readmissions Hospital Among Patients With COPD After Telemedicine Video Consultation - Pilot Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct retrospective uni-center observation study population COPD patient discharge hospital acute COPD exacerbation , outpatient treatment acute COPD exacerbation , monitor 2 week TVC pilot project period 16 April 2010 31 December 2011 . To study possible change amount hospital admission compare frequency duration event TVC comparable time period . A detailed patient history comprise demographic data , social status , smoke habit , body mass index ( BMI ) , use medication , co-morbidity habitual lung function register . Dates admittance discharge note . Retrospectively , medical record scrutinize re-admissions due COPD exacerbation 12 month follow-up . Frequency date re-admissions , length hospital stay , clinical data record . Also frequency admission due COPD exacerbation length hospital stay ( ) last 12 month prior TVC record , date last discharge note . Finally , patient encourage complete questionnaire concern patient satisfaction impact patient 's quality life . All answer register anonymously . Data enter database one trained nurse monitor another person , compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency data field registry . All patient monitor TVC pilot project period , give inform consent participate observational study , patient lose follow-up . Continuously distributed variable baseline characteristic give mean + SEM , variables skewed distribution give median upper low quartile . The Shapiro-Wilk test normality perform study distribution parameter . A chi-square test apply compare frequency re-admissions 12 month follow TVC frequency hospital admission last 12 month prior TVC . The total number day hospital last 12 month prior TVC compare number day hospital 12 month follow TVC pair t-test . Differences baseline characteristic patient re-admitted , analyzed Two-sample Student 's T-test , case non-normality , Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test . The number day re-admission follow TVC compare number day last discharge date index admittance display Kaplan Meier plot , hazard ratio ( HR ) calculation Cox regression analysis . A statistically significant level p &lt; 0.05 applied test . All statistical analysis perform use statistical package SigmaPlot Version 12 . Power calculation perform purpose pilot study , many unknown factor . The result study form basis power calculation future prospective randomize study .</detailed_description>
