	<brief_summary>Childhood chronic vasculitis describes group rare life-threatening disease common inflammation blood vessel vital organ kidney , lung brain . Most knowledge come adult patient . Severe disease require aggressive life-saving treatment steroid cancer drug cause damage , increase risk cancer severe infection . Conversely , mild disease treat less toxic drug . Different classification `` scoring tool '' use define type severity vasculitis measure damage cause disease drug . These turn help direct aggressively treat patient measure outcome . None tool however assessed child best balance disease treatment risk outcome child know . Although cause disease child adult probably , effect disease response ( good bad ) drug differ grow child . Because specialist may see one new child vasculitis year , obtain enough information learn childhood vasculitis require cooperation . We use international web-based registry doctor 50 center contribute patient data . We determine feature help good classify diagnose child compare adult . Through web collect analyze information patient similarly classify `` score '' successful treatment identify . Children vasculitis less likely disease associate age , alcohol smoking etc. , therefore may better group study underlie biology vasculitis . We use opportunity collect spit , blood tissue registry patient laboratory study aim find biomarkers well classify , define direct optimal treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Vasculitis Initiative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 3-year period , anticipate enrollment collection clinical data many 600 child various form childhood vasculitis , approximately one third ( 200 ) child also contribute biological sample study . For child vasculitis enrol study , clinical information obtain medical chart time diagnosis , post-induction ( 3-6 month post diagnosis ) visit , 12-month clinic visit , recent clinic visit last clinic visit discharge adult care ( ie . final outcome visit ) . Information collect include laboratory test result , biopsy imaging result , disease activity , clinical history , medication . Blood , urine , saliva sample also collect clinic visit . If subject experience disease flare , clinical data biological sample collect time flare later date disease remit . The PedVas study link adult vasculitis initiative call DCVAS : Diagnosis Classification Criteria Vasculitis . Our DCVAS co-investigators collaborator recruit 250 adult near time diagnosis follow form vasculitis : GPA , MPA , EGPA , TA , UCV . Clinical data collect part DCVAS study ; include information laboratory test result , disease activity , clinical history . Blood also collect analyzed parallel sample collect child vasculitis . Finally , DNA-biobank create house sample approximately 700 adult represent form vasculitis . Recruitment proceed accord DCVAS approve protocol conduct participate DCVAS centre patient formally consent participation DCVAS study . Healthy volunteer community recruit participate study word mouth recruitment poster . Participation child involve one-time donation blood urine sample , adult may donate blood urine 4 time course 18 month . All biological sample process analyzed Vancouver Child Family Research Institute University British Columbia . Detailed data collect electronic format include demographic variable , socioeconomic status , detailed clinical history &amp; physical finding , anthropometric measure , measure disease activity . All data systemic vasculitis patient directly enter site secure , online , web-based data entry system call REDCap manage data management centre University British Columbia Vancouver . All CNS vasculitis data enter Brainworks database manage data management team Hospital Sick Kids Toronto .</detailed_description>
