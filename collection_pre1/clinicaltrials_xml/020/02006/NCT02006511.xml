	<brief_summary>Wound complication associate surgical incision range minor life threaten . Surgical site infection occur usually occur within 30 day one common surgical complication . Perigraft infection groin wound devastate . Even superficial wound progress deep wound result graft infection , need explantation , sepsis amputation requirement . Negative pressure wound therapy favorable result close wound trauma population . Similarly , negative pressure wind therapy positive benefit close incision sternal wound follow cardiac surgery . As result , PrevenaTM Incision Management System ( IMS ) develop allow easy application negative pressure therapy close wound . Application PrevenaTM IMS dress would portend aforementioned benefit Vacuum Assisted Closure ( VAC® ) therapy add benefit protect wound contamination bolster wound edge good approximation consequently well aesthetic outcome . However , comparison negative pressure therapy dress standard wound dressing exist . The purpose study assess efficacy safety topical negative pressure therapy application Prevena™ versus standard care wound therapy close groin incision high risk patient undergo vascular surgery .</brief_summary>
