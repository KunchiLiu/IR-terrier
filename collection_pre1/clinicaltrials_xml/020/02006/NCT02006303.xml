	<detailed_description>The primary objective ass whether prostatic artery embolization similar efficacy safety profile compare GreenLight PVP treat patient urinary retention secondary benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) fail medical management . The target population compose subject refer urology department treatment BPH fail medical treatment , present permanent bladder catheterization meet eligibility criterion . Subjects consent randomize either Prostate embolization ( PAE ) arm GreenLight PVP arm . The primary endpoint efficacy procedure measure successful removal bladder catheter ability patient void . As well , secondary endpoint record : International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) , peak flow rate ( Qmax ) post-void residual urine volume ( PVP ) prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) measure 3 , 6 , 12 month post treatment . Trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) perform measurement prostate volume stratify randomization process . All adverse event capture analyze . MRI perform preoperatively , 3 month 12 month . Hospital stay procedure consider serious adverse event , unless hospital admission occur complication treatment perform .</detailed_description>
