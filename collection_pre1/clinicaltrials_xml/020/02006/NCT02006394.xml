	<brief_summary>Clinical rodent study demonstrate impact specific dietary factor modulate inflammation-related disease include insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease . Such dietary factor include polyunsaturated fat , polyphenols , glycemic index . The investigator know previous study literature reduce glycemic index increase omega-3 fat polyphenol content diet result improve metabolic index reduce inflammation . These improvement observe even within context persistent obesity . The investigator implement reduced-calorie , multi-pronged dietary approach improve insulin sensitivity reduce inflammation obese subject metabolic syndrome . The active diet include reduce glycemic index food together omega-3 fat polyphenol supplement . The primary hypothesis dietary combination reduce glycemic index food , omega-3 fat polyphenols work reduce insulin resistance inflammation efficiently placebo-controlled , calorie- macronutrient-matched diet obese subject metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
