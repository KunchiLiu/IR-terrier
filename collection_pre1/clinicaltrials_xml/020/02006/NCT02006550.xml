	<brief_summary>Cancer result undifferentiated cell grow uncontrolled manner , crowd normal cell , cause morbidity ultimately mortality . The cancer stem cell theory suggest tumor undergo process differentiation relatively rare cancer stem progenitor cell ( CSC ) give rise differentiate population cell ( include transiently amplify cell ) comprise bulk tumor . As result cellular diversity , one cell within tumor likely resistant therapy . Among cell resistant give therapy , CSCs repopulate tumor . A key feature resistant subset CSCs repopulate tumor resistant original intervention . The cellular program drive uncontrolled proliferation many solid tumor result aberrant activity Wnt , Shh , and/or Notch signaling pathway CSC . Thus , therapies down-regulate activity fundamental pathway CSCs effective treatment cancer . The investigator ' research program focus elucidation signal mechanism , control cellular process discovery small molecule selectively target Wnt , Shh , Notch signal pathway fundamental CSCs . Our preliminary result identify novel Notch associate protein NACK function transcriptional co-activator Notch . Moreover , Nack express human solid tumor require cell survival tumor growth notch -dependent tumor cell . The investigator ' aim interrogate link Notch Nack .</brief_summary>
