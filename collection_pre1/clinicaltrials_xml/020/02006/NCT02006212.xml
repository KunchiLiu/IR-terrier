	<brief_summary>Neurologic complication cardiac surgery range wide spectrum include postoperative delirium ( PD ) , postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) . The incidence neurologic event varies depend type surgery population study . The incidence PD and/or POCD influence type neurologic test use . Moreover , time test seem influence result . Intraoperative cerebral monitoring gain importance anesthesia field . Recent finding point cerebral hypoperfusion one hand deep level anesthesia hand major source adverse neurological outcome , detect different non-invasive cerebral monitors.The present investigator currently use NeuroSENSE速 , process electroencephalogram ( pEEG ) monitor together cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) daily basis every cardiac patient . This large , prospective , observational study investigate whether short- mid-term neurologic outcome adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery line observation make basis pEEG monitor NeuroSENSE速 cerebral NIRS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Whilst incidence perioperative management neurological complication cardiac surgery may vary , share common risk factor occurrence : advanced age , cardiovascular morbidity include peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , previous stroke , preoperative cognitive impairment dementia.As factor modifiable time surgery , condition control perioperative period deserve focus prevent occurrence neurological problem . Intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion generally accept worsen factor neurological complications.Besides hypoperfusion state , overdose general anesthetic among intraoperative factor evoke influence postoperative neurological complication . The main aim study know incidence POCD PD cardiac surgical population seek whether presence duration burst suppression detect NeuroSENSE速 one hand episodes cerebral desaturation detect bilateral cerebral NIRS hand risk factor develop complication . The magnitude burst suppression record total Area Under Curve ( AUC ) burst suppression hemisphere . Cerebral desaturation define AUC 25 % drop oximetry value compare preinduction value hemisphere . We evaluate whether concomitant presence burst suppression together cerebral oximetry desaturation predict POCD PD . Our study first analyze point . Otherwise , study investigator look eventual agreement cerebral NIRS NeuroSENSE速 monitor term detect cerebral abnormality . Lastly , line previous observation , investigator actively look intraoperative EEG abnormality particular sustain pEEG asymmetry appear together burst suppression . Although study observational frontal severe EEG asymmetry together appearance burst suppression carefully evaluate experienced anesthesiologist read interpret process EEG monitor . The case discuss multidisciplinary basis eventual CT scan performed.In absence hemorrhage large cerebral vessel occlusion identify , catheter angiography eventual thrombectomy realize aim extract clot .</detailed_description>
