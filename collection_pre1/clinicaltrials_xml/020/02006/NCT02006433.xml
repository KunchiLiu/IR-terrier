	<brief_summary>The Investigators propose investigation safety deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) alleviation chronic neuropathic pain patient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Aim 1 determine whether DBS periaqueductal/periventricular gray region ( PAG/PVG ) brain analgesic intensity produce systemic neurological adverse effect patient longstanding SCI ( &gt; 1 year ) , either immediately result prolonged application 40 week . Aim 2 determine whether acute application DBS PAG/PVG influence severity spontaneous ongoing pain cause longstanding SCI . Aim 3 determine whether DBS PAG/PVG affect stimulus-evoked persistent hypertension ( major sign autonomic dysreflexia ) chronic SCI patient . Aim 4 determine whether prolonged PAG/PVG stimulation ( 40 week ) lead cumulative change chronic pain severity motor autonomic symptom chronic SCI patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Pain Autonomic Dysreflexia Spinal Cord Injury With Deep Brain Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study attempt utilize deep brain stimulation periaqueductal grey ( PAG ) diminution neuropathic nociceptive pain spinal cord injury patient . Likewise , study look effect autonomic function well . Deep brain stimulation , treatment , gain widespread use treatment various movement disorder . It currently approve use FDA treatment Parkinsons Disease , Essential Tremor , Dystonia . Over 100,000 implant perform worldwide indication . The safety profile well define . Pain tremendous burden suffer SCI . Persistent pain injury level experience 2/3rd chronic SCI patient . As result pain least 1/3rd sub-population face severely reduce quality life ; authority consider rate much high , base survey pain rating . It report 23 % sample patient cervical high thoracic SCI 37 % low thoracic lumbosacral SCI would sacrifice sexual , bowel bladder function good pain relief . SCI pain typically mixture nociceptive pain , cause activation primary afferent ' receptor , neuropathic pain , cause damage nervous system . Neuropathic pain SCI frequently treat anticonvulsant agent . There good evidence randomize control trial degree effectiveness gabapentin pregabalin , weak evidence valproic acid . Tricyclic antidepressant also use control SCI pain , support evidence strong . Thus amitriptyline prove somewhat effective patient depress , trazodone report reduce post-SCI neuropathic pain placebo . Traditional analgesic also useful . Morphine provide effective relief neuropathic pain due SCI , combine alpha-2 agonist clonidine purpose . Subarachnoid epidural lidocaine use obtain short-term relief . For musculoskeletal pain SCI , nociceptive , antispasticity agent frequently use ; intrathecal baclofen , example , fairly effective . Despite considerable range choice , pharmacological treatment pain SCI remain inadequate . Low effectiveness , tolerance , side effect difficulty prolong local administration ( e.g. , subdural ) among problem encounter . Due combination severity chronic pain SCI patient face inadequate medical treatment available study pertinent . Although , prior attempt clinical study show efficacy DBS pain essentially fail , Investigators believe current protocol offer unique aspect . Likewise , mention earlier , neuropathic nociceptive pain related SCI devastate afflict . The Investigators perform detailed literature search review paper related DBS pain . To date study look DBS pain . Of paper , etiology pain variable small subset relate spinal cord injury . Of paper , include spinal cord injury none well control even few report detailed outcome , say pain control . Also importance none study truly look effect chronic stimulation pain control . This say , paper criterion , patient felt immediate relief pain time surgery else lead removed stimulation give . Most paper date detail outcome measure use determine pain relief . There various pain scale use determine level pain control , accurate others . Our study also look effect alternate stimulation parameter monthly basis therapeutic stimulation parameter sub-therapeutic parameter double blind fashion ( patient examiner ) . This method evaluation give u unique way evaluate pain control yet perform prior study . Likewise , Investigators also evaluate subject 's ability decrease antiepileptic drug well narcotic DBS progress . For reason , Investigators feel study different past . The Investigators believe due severity problem lack effective therapeutic option combine less stringent study date study do . The Investigators realize prior attempt pain control DBS lackluster . However , study base prior clinical attempt also basic science research Miami Project Cure Paralysis . These study perform Dr. Ian Hentall ( co-investigator ) suggest strongly stimulation periaqueductal grey chronic basis effective pain control . Likewise , suggest beneficial effect autonomic dysreflexia , potentially life threaten complication SCI , well . As result , study also focus evaluate effect DBS autonomic dysreflexia stringent outcome measure , another unique aspect study . There also data human suggest PAG central control center autonomic function . Key Points : Primary Rationale 1 . Need . Many patient chronic neuropathic pain due spinal cord injury ( SCI ) experience long-term suffering recourse adequate alternative therapy . Analgesic drug best weak inconsistent efficacy give patient produce serious side effect typical dos . This clinical trial therefore qualitatively different trial compare improve drug ( etc . ) currently use one . 2 . Prospects . Pain many type responsive acutely stimulation periaqueductal/periventricular gray region ( PAG/PVG ; anatomical target ) . There large confirmatory literature animal man , go back 3-4 decade . A review analyze PAG/PVG stimulation prior clinical study type drug-refractory pain uncover 148 case 79.1 % success rate lead internalization . 3 . Clinical evidence . With regard acute relief chronic SCI pain DBS PAG/PVG , Investigators believe useful evidence non-existent present , benefit PAG/PVG stimulation kind pain strongly justify targeted evaluation . In above-cited 2005 meta-analysis , pain originate spinal cord injury identify 10 case lead internalized 7 case , 5 show good long-term pain relief . Unfortunately , impossible tell case describe original article , many 1970s , whether sensory thalamus ( different brain region , probably less appropriate ) PAG/PVG stimulate . Moreover , clinical literature DBS SCI pain rarely describes type injury ( segmental level , completeness , age onset , etc . ) often include non-typical SCI summary category ( e.g. , root avulsion , myelopathy ) . Because conflation stimulation sit poor characterization injury , factor need revisit thorough analysis . 4 . Preclinical evidence . Prolonged DBS improve symptom SCI well pain . The Investigators find various type sensory motor performance anatomical damage restore . Recovery autonomic dysreflexia , improvement gastric emptying , insulin level glucose control measure recently . These improvement remain stimulation cease . Separately pain , important find man whether Investigators safely replicate finding , possible great benefit patient . Thus potential ( ) immediate pain relief , ( b ) long-term change pain status ( stimulation reduce stop ) , ( c ) general improvement different visceral motor symptom SCI syndrome . 5 . Surgical issue . In past , typically , point surgery , test do whether patient 's pain reduce immediately upon stimulation . If , lead never internalize . The Investigators believe protocol may reduce success rate needlessly . Acute effect electrode insertion may present prevent immediate benefit stimulation . Also , benefit Investigators postulate due long-term effect stimulation . So efficacy DBS pain , include SCI pain , may greatly underestimated . The present study include patient show acute benefit immediately surgical electrode implantation . 6 . Safety . DBS low rate complication , mostly correctable . Other Authorities 1 . The Granting Agency ( DOD ) , Regulatory Agency ( FDA ) Device Manufacturer ( waiver Medtronic Corp ) support validity study . 2 . The procedure ( DBS PAG/PVG pain ) currently use United Kingdom , Germany , Australia country .</detailed_description>
