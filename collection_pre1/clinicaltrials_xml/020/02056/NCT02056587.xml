	<brief_summary>An estimated 10,000 metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patient receive first-line therapy Russian Federation . Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) combination interferon-alpha ( IFN ) recommend first-line treatment metastatic RCC accord clinical recommendation Russian Ministry Health 15.07.2010 . Two randomized phase III trial ( AVOREN , CALGB ) show 50 % patient progress bevacizumab plus IFN within 8.5 - 10.2 month need sequential therapy . Everolimus ( Afinitor ) single agent evaluate demonstrated efficacy randomize phase III study ( RECORD-1 ) metastatic RCC patient failure target therapy . However , trial everolimus compare placebo treatment patient whose disease progress treatment sunitinib sorafenib ( n=227 ) . Only 9 % ( n=24 ) patient receive bevacizumab . Thus , efficacy data everolimus patient disease progression first-line bevacizumab limit . Evaluating effectiveness everolimus metastatic RCC patient failure bevacizumab with/without interferon alpha scientific practical sense , important Russian Federation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>17563 new case renal cancer 83790 associate death record Russian Federation 2008 . Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) responsible 4,3 % malignancy , increase risk disease age 60 year . Renal cell carcinoma account 90 % renal neoplasm , 85 % renal cell carcinoma case light-cell morphology diagnose . Papillary , chromophobic cancer cancer kidney collect tubule . 30 % patient localized renal cell carcinoma find progress surgical treatment . In 30 % renal cell carcinoma establish dissemination stage . Therefore approximately 60 % renal cell carcinoma patient estimate metastasis . According estimation Kidney Cancer Research Bureau , currently first line treatment indicate approximately 10,000 patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma Russia annually . Until recently opportunity systemic treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma limited administration cytokine clinical research investigate novel medication . Various combination dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) interferon-alpha ( IFN ) investigate randomized study metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Immunotherapy find limited efficacy ( overall response rate 15-16 % , survival 12 month ) . Therefore target medicine , specifically - tyrosine kinase inhibitor mTOR inhibitor , development first subsequent line treatment . According standard medical care establish Ministry Health Social Development Russian Federation July 15 , 2010 , combination bevacizumab ( Avastinâ„¢ ) interferon recommend first line treatment . According two randomized phase III trial ( AVOREN , CALGB ) half patient expect require treatment disease progression 8,5-10,2 month . Everolimus ( Afinitor ) medicine investigate phase III multicenter study ( RECORD-1 ) second subsequent line treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma resistant target agent . However , patient ( n=277 ) receive sunitinib sorafenib prior enrolment ; ( 24 patient ( 9 % ) receive bevacizumab . Therefore currently convince evidence everolimus efficacy progression prior treatment bevacizumab bevacizumab + IFN lack . Hence deem reasonable practically relevant investigate everolimus efficacy patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma previously treat bevacizumab-containing regimen , Russian Federation . Efficacy endpoint Primary : Primary endpoint proportion progression-free patient 2 month ( base result phase III study ) Secondary : Median progression-free survival overall survival time enrolment Response rate , accord RECIST 1.1 Treatment safety tolerability accord NCI-CTCAE v.4.0 Patients quality life , accord EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire</detailed_description>
