	<brief_summary>Introduction : Ankle sprain , common sports-related musculoskeletal injury , account approximately 25 % sport injury . An estimated 40 % individual progress develop chronic functional ankle instability ( CFAI ) , significantly affect athletic performance activity daily life . Stresses injury damage ligament , muscle , nerve mechanoreceptors . It widely accept ankle proprioception critical balance individual CFAI demonstrate decrease proprioception alter muscular function , impairs postural stability . The goal study determine single application electroacupuncture immediate positive outcome relate balance individual CFAI . Methods : This single blind randomized trial include 12 subject receive single application electroacupuncture 12 subject placebo group receive sham electroacupuncture . Subjects age 18-50 history unilateral inversion ankle sprain ( ) chronic symptom instability select . Balance assess pre- post-treatment use force plate data single-leg stance via Star Excursion Balance Test ( SEBT ) . GB-34 GB-40 use experimental group non-traditional point medial aspect leg use sham electroacupuncture group . Both connected electrical stimulation unit 10 minute . Results study may inform future research investigate ability EA decreasing risk ankle sprain , improve perceive stability , reduce risk subsequent degenerative change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single application electroacupuncture improve balance great placebo control subject chronic functional ankle instability Specific Aim # 1 : Evaluate effect single application electroacupuncture center pressure mean total velocity individual chronic functional ankle instability single-leg stance compare placebo control . H0 : EA improve postural sway single-leg stance compare placebo control . Specific Aim # 2 : Describe effect single application EA compare placebo mean total displacement , well mediolateral anterioposterior component single-leg stance possible trend inform hypothesis generation . Specific Aim # 3 : Correlate result Star Excursion Balance Test result single-leg stance measure inform hypothesis generation .</detailed_description>
