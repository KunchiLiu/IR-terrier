	<brief_summary>The aim study use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image measure change norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) concentration brain periphery healthy individual hypoglycemia . We hypothesize hypoglycemia , NE level increase within brain , especially hypothalamus , likely contributes activation glucose counterregulatory response . We hypothesize hypoglycemia , NET concentration key glucoregulatory region change order sustain prolong sympathetic nervous system activation counterregulatory response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect Hypoglycemia With PET Norepinephrine Transporter Ligand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoglycemia elicits multifaceted hormonal response aim restore glycemic level normal . As blood glucose level start fall , cessation insulin secretion . At top hierarchy counterregulatory response glucagon epinephrine , two principal circulate hormone increase glucose production inhibit glucose utilization raise plasma glucose level back normal . In conjunction circulate hormone activation sympathetic nervous system , act stimulate hepatic glucose production lipolysis suppress peripheral glucose uptake . In case prolonged and/or severe hypoglycemia , growth hormone cortisol mobilize stimulate synthesis gluconeogenic enzyme inhibit glucose utilization.In non-diabetic individual , glucagon epinephrine usually effective latter response rarely require acute situation . In contrast , impair glucose counterregulation present longstanding diabetes antecedent hypoglycemia.Within first five year onset type 1 diabetes , primary defense hypoglycemia , release glucagon , either become significantly attenuate completely absent impairment appear specific stimulus hypoglycemia . Hence , patient diabetes primarily depend release catecholamine main defense hypoglycemia . Unfortunately , long duration diabetes especially poor glycemic control , epinephrine secretion sympathetic activation also compromise , make patient even vulnerable threat hypoglycemia . In patient diabetes , hypoglycemia arises interplay relative excess exogenous insulin defective glucose counterregulation remain limit factor attain proper glycemic management . Both Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) conduct type 1 patient United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) conduct type 2 patient establish importance maintain good glucose control lifetime diabetes avoid ophthalmologic , renal neurological complication . However , lower glycemic goal patient diabetes increase risk hypoglycemia exposure . According DCCT , type 1 patient put intensive insulin therapy , though improve outcome diabetic complication , 3-fold high risk experience severe hypoglycemia compare conventional insulin therapy9 . Moreover , recent antecedent hypoglycemia reduces autonomic response ( catecholamine ) development symptom ( normally prompt behavioral defense eat ) subsequent hypoglycemia10-13 . Thus begin vicious cycle recurrent hypoglycemia hypoglycemia lead impairment counterregulatory response turn , begets hypoglycemia forth . Because imperfection current insulin therapy , patient attempt achieve tight glycemic control suffer untold number asymptomatic hypoglycemic episode . Current estimate symptomatic hypoglycemic episode range 2-3 incidence per week average severe , debilitate episode occur twice year . Therefore , understand body sens fall blood glucose level initiate counterregulatory mechanism crucial prevent eliminate hypoglycemia . Sensors detect change blood glucose level initiate glucose counterregulatory response identify hepatic portal vein , carotid body importantly brain . In brain , predominant sensor locate VMH crucial detect fall blood glucose level initiate counterregulatory response . Although VMH implicate primary glucose sensor rodent , human data available . Moreover , exact mechanism lead VMH activation well understood . It propose hypoglycemia , rise VMH norepinephrine ( NE ) level improve counterregulatory response hypoglycemia27 . While study highlight importance local NE elevation VMH , one examine mechanism regulate local NE level hypoglycemia . NETs limit action NE reuptake cytoplasm , regulate extent time NE remain synapse28 . Studies rat show chronic elevation intracerebral insulin significantly decrease NET mRNA expression locus coeruleus , hypoinsulinemia result streptozotocin-induced diabetes significantly elevate NET mRNA level . These data suggest endogenous insulin may one factor regulate synthesis re-uptake NE CNS . This hypothesis confirm show treat hippocampal tissue cervical ganglion neuron cell insulin lead decrease NET surface expression . However , direct effect insulin NET level human never study . We develop novel approach measure noradrenergic function use PET scan highly selective norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) ligand , ( S , S ) - [ 11C ] O-methylreboxetine ( [ 11C ] MRB ) . Measuring change brain NET concentration possible use [ 11C ] MRB high resolution HRRT PET system .</detailed_description>
