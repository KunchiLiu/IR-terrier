	<brief_summary>Fragmentation care lead poor treatment adherence patient chronic medical condition , turn , lead adverse health consequence , poor quality life , patient dissatisfaction . Poor treatment adherence may due lack sufficient patient education , time delay delivery care , lack adequate healthcare coordination , difficulty access various healthcare provider across front desk serve `` healthcare bottle-neck '' . Better efficiency healthcare delivery , great connectivity knowledgeable trained peer volunteer inexpensive cell-phones integrated smart telephone exchange may alleviate care communication burden face healthcare system . Specifically , community health education volunteer ( `` peer-buddies '' ) experience manage disease condition may able impart knowledge confidence recently diagnose patient much personalized manner group therapy session . An additional important advantage peer-buddy 's ability relate patient manner consistent social , ethnic , cultural believe without language barrier difference may stem socioeconomic stratum . We use sleep apnea example condition test effect peer-buddy helper ( combine universal availability personal cell phone ) problem poor care coordination treatment adherence `` CPAP '' treatment sleep apnea . Sleep apnea common condition affect 7-12 % US population , leave untreated , lead poor health even death effect high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke , motor vehicle accident . Fortunately , CPAP therapy lead 3-fold reduction consequence , patient adherence CPAP treatment generally poor . We recently complete small study demonstrate improved usage CPAP treatment patient receive help peer-buddy excellent result . We propose enhance `` peer-buddy '' community-volunteer concept propose research combine cell-phone technology telephone exchange improve access healthcare provider , technician , home care company . We hope show active community participation experience `` lay individual '' assist universal availability cheap cell-phones improve reach effectiveness healthcare system improve health well-being patient . If successful , innovative community-based approach apply chronic medical condition . Hypothesis # 1 : We hypothesize patient peer-driven intervention interactive voice response ( PDI-IVR ) group experience great patient satisfaction ( measure Likert scale64,70 PACIC71,72 ) perception care coordination ( measure CPCQ72,73 ) patient usual care ( control ) group . Hypothesis # 2 : We hypothesize patient PDI-IVR group experience great CPAP adherence ( measure device download ) , patient activation ( PAM ) , self-efficacy ( SEMSA ) patient usual care ( control ) group . Hypothesis # 3 : We hypothesize patient PDI-IVR group experience great improvement HR-QOL ( measure FOSQ ) vigilance ( psychomotor vigilance test ) blood pressure patient usual care ( control ) group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>COMPARATORS : 1 . Intervention group : In order address propose aim , recruit recently diagnose patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) initiate CPAP therapy randomly assign PDI-IVR system promote adherence CPAP therapy ( intervention group ) provide educational brochure regard OSA CPAP therapy ( usual care [ control ] group ) . In PDI-IVR intervention group , train experienced peer ( peer-buddy ) sleep apnea pair newly diagnose patient 6-month period . As preliminary study , peer-buddy matched subject regard age , gender , race , ethnicity , socioeconomic , educational background . During time train peer share experience cop strategy CPAP device equipment ( promote self efficacy ) , share positive experience ( motivational effect outcome expectancy ) , share knowledge perceive vulnerability due untreated sleep apnea ( promote risk perception ) , share method improve efficacy CPAP equipment interface ( patient education ) prepare subject upcoming physician respiratory therapist appointment ( patient activation ) . The interaction occur supervise `` in-person '' session ( two session day 1 day 7 ) also telephone-based conversation IVR system ( week one month follow telephone call fortnightly basis ) . Additionally , help patient navigate delivery system effect well care coordination IVR system patient-initiated request . 2 . Usual care description : All participant receive usual care follow initiation CPAP therapy . Usual care newly diagnose patient OSA consist attend CPAP initiation education class conduct either patient 's home office home care ( DME ) company dedicate respiratory therapist . Patients educate basic care operation device , mask related equipment . Following CPAP initiation education class , receive instruction either mail-in CPAP adherence monitor card ( `` Smart card '' ) mail therapist 4 week follow initial visit . The adherence information evaluate post electronic medical record . Patients OSA see sleep clinic 1 3 month follow initiation CPAP therapy option call care provider . In order balance number contact educational session two comparison group , educational brochure ( AASM ) video DVD ( Industry stakeholder ) mail participant . We incorporate attention-control arm require in-person contact comparator overarch goal proposal make study relevant real-world condition well measure usual care arm make study finding generalizable well inform patient ' decision-making . Such external validity felt great value compare two condition currently exist current practice . Peer-buddy system : Selection Training Peer-buddies : Fifty peer-buddies recruit four sleep clinic adherent CPAP therapy . Peer buddy consent compensated role research study ( $ 350 6 month participation per subject ) . Each buddy may pair 12 subject length study . Training : PI research staff educate peer buddy provide guideline interaction research participant . They instruct share experience provide medical advice . The share coping strategy fall follow category : ( ) Promote self efficacy : Strategies deal CPAP device equipment ( pressure ramp feature , humidifier setting , mask strap application ; clean device relate equipment ) . ( ii ) Promote outcome expectancy : Share positive experience regard effect CPAP energy level vigilance , sense well-being , hypertension control medical benefit possibly derive CPAP therapy . ( iii ) Risk perception : Share knowledge perceive vulnerability due untreated sleep apnea . Share method improve efficacy CPAP equipment interface ( patient education ) . ( iv ) Patient activation : Share experience prepare upcoming physician respiratory therapist appointment , question ask healthcare provider , take ( e.g. , CPAP adherence card malfunction device , humidifier , mask , expect give provider visit . At end training , mock interaction peer-buddy PI ( play role patient OSA ) undertake `` certifying '' `` graduate '' peer-buddy competent . Potential inter-personal conflict management plan : The peer-buddy research participant inform withdraw participation potential conflict difficult situation ( feel threaten , face verbal abuse subject , individual demanding , frequent call late night call ) . The peer-buddy subject start CPAP provide research coordinator availability sheet available take phone call and/or appear person . Each peer-buddy paired one research participant , may choose take 3 patient time take new assignment end 6-month participation period . Peer-buddy participant match age , gender , race , ethnicity , socioeconomic status . The peer-buddies instruct offer medical advice . If medical need problem arise , peer-buddies instruct provide research participant phone number call PI ( via call operator ) assess medical need situation . Fidelity assessment : Twenty percent telephonic communication peer-buddy patient randomly record IVR system fidelity assessments behavioral therapist ( Haynes , Co-investigator ) . Similarly , 20 % in-person visit assess behavioral therapist . Such fidelity assessment use increase fidelity ( efficacy ) study . In-person interaction : In-person interaction occur 2 occasion ( 30-minutes ) within first 10 day CPAP initiation . The research coordinator present interaction facilitate run interaction . A clean CPAP device relate supply patient need present interaction demonstration purpose . Telephonic IVR interaction : Once week first month follow 4 phone conversation subsequent 2 month period ( 8 schedule telephonic interaction ) need subsequent 3 month . There 10 `` as-needed '' phone call latter 3-months participant peer-buddy . Therefore , 6-months , excess 18 phone call per subject assign peer-buddy . Each phone conversation last maximum 30 minute . The PDI-IVR system program recognize peer-buddy 's phone ( cell home ) program link patient 's phone ( cell home ) thereby protect privacy participant . The dyad peer-buddy participant introduce first name basis require provide personal information . However , study preclude share information develop long-lasting friendship . For dyad , research coordinator may monitor call ( participant ' knowledge random IVR-based recording ) order monitor content level participation dyad ; however , coordinator direct participation way . Peer-buddies share experience would promote self-efficacy , outcome expectation , risk perception patient activation . During in-person interaction , great emphasis promotion self-efficacy place , consider physicality medical device ( CPAP ) therapy , mask , hose , humidifiers , filter . During phone interaction , great emphasis promotion outcome expectancy , risk perception , patient activation undertaken . The research coordinator may provide feedback peer-buddy regard performance remind cover topic cover order ensure fidelity . Either patient peer-buddy ( behalf patient ) initiate call member inter-disciplinary team , include obtain CPAP adherence data IVR derive industry server ( figure 2 ) . Call back provider ( physician , RT , RN , DME representative , sleep tech ) connect back initiator call ( Patient peer-buddy ) . IVR-initiated query regard CPAP device - adherence , leak , efficacy [ residual obstructive event ] data - faxed sleep physician 's office ( designee [ RN RT ] ) IVR note patient call back . Content interaction pertain OSA CPAP therapy related supply ( mask , hose , filter humidifier ) . Content include aspect pertain mask fitting , use ramp function CPAP unit , use CPAP humidification system , etc . Conversations regard erectile dysfunction similar sensitive matter discourage . Both peer-buddy subject would provide voluntary consent share experience CPAP therapy sleep apnea . A checklist content area provide peer-buddy ensure topical area discuss peer-subject pair . We refrain write script peer-buddy believe would detract sense bond trust within dyad .</detailed_description>
