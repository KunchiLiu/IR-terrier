	<brief_summary>· 2D Speckle Tracking echocardiography gain importance evaluation ventricle contractility . Many indication develop child population . However , comparability measurement different software system well define . We choose compare two software system often use paediatric subject : Echopac General Electric QLAB 9.0 Philips . We offer randomly second echocardiography child normal heart . We compare Strain Strain rate result two test study variability : ultrasound variability , operator variability , reader variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>· We select child address paediatric cardiologist serious reason ( heart murmur , chest pain , sport capacity… ) , normal heart evaluation . If satisfied inclusive criterion ( 5 17 year old , parental agreement , social security fund ) neither exclusive criterion ( cardiac , respiratory muscular problem , chronic disease , drug heart impact , poor image quality ) , randomly execute second echocardiography . Echocardiography do Vivid 7 ultrasound ( General Electrics ) and/or IE 33 ultrasound ( Philips ) one two trained operator . Strain loop take three standard apical view ( two , three four-chamber view ) , short axis midventricular aortic view , sub-costal short axis aortic view sub-costal four-chamber apical view . Strain analysis do second step one two trained reader adapt software : Echopac ( General Electrics ) QLAB 0.0 ( Philips ) . Strain Strain rate result collect ventricle dimension.We compare result two test do statistical analysis study variability : ultrasound variability , operator variability , reader variability ( correlation coefficient ) . We also do feasibility study use `` poor image quality '' exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
