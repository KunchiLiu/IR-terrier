	<brief_title>A Comparison Trial Between PCA Epidural Analgesia Pectus Excavatum Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pectus excavatum cartilaginous deformity common congenital anterior chest wall defect child [ 1 ] . Children disease process often complain dyspnea , decrease exercise tolerance , shortness breath imply restrictive pulmonary deficit [ 2 ] . Besides reported physical limitation , patient also exhibit manifestation psychological disturbance ( poor body image depression ) . Surgical repair correlate enhanced quality life improvement body image [ 3 ] recent study show improved pulmonary function cardiac output [ 4 , 5 ] . Surgery initially introduce Sauerbruch involved rib cartilage resection sternal osteotomy . This open procedure modify become [ 6 ] know Ravitch procedure . This mainstay repair 40 year introduction minimally invasive surgery without rib resection Nuss colleague 1987 [ 7 ] . The Nuss repair involve place intrathoracic brace small lateral chest wall incision aid thoracoscopy . Similar bracing teeth , Nuss procedure avoids osteotomy rib cartilage resection [ 8 ] . The Nuss procedure common minimally invasive procedure use today correct condition current standard surgical practice . Complications Nuss repair range anywhere 7 % 25 % [ 9 ] occur long bar place . Pain control remain major issue perioperative period patient may require week month oral narcotic become pain-free correction pectus . A prospective multicenter study report peak pain score 8 0-10 scale postoperative period mean score 3 discharge [ 4 ] . Postoperative pain pectus repair manage IV opioids administer patient control analgesia ( PCA ) device thoracic epidural infusion combination local anesthetic opioids . It unclear publish data method superior different tertiary care center USA preference different method .</detailed_description>
