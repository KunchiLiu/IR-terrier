	<brief_title>HEART Pathway Implementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Millions patient chest pain see Emergency Departments ( EDs ) every year . Over half ED patient chest pain admitted hospital undergo testing . Despite high test rate , less 1 10 patient chest pain ultimately diagnose acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) estimate annual cost $ 13 billion . Current care pattern acute chest pain fail focus health system resource , hospitalization cardiac testing , patient likely benefit . The HEART Pathway , combine clinical decision aid , two serial troponin measurement , develop identify patient chest pain safely discharge without objective cardiac testing ( stress test angiography ) . Prior retrospective observational study establish use HEART Pathway reduce cardiac test &gt; 20 % , maintain acceptably low adverse event rate . We seek integrate HEART Pathway `` real-world '' clinical setting determine effectiveness . The goal proposal build transformative collaboration bridge gap research , education , health system operation effectively efficiently provide patient care . The vanguard collaboration seek improve quality care patient acute chest pain integrate HEART Pathway cardiovascular care delivery Wake Forest Baptist Health ( WFBH ) . This project build prior work provide model use education operational strength US academic medical center disseminate initiative improve care delivery .</detailed_description>
