	<brief_title>De Novo Autoimmune Hepatitis Pediatric Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site study Yale University coordinate site . Our research plan follow : Aim 1 : To conduct refined phenotypical functional analysis regulatory T cell study control patient group . Rationale : We would like extend preliminary data observation large patient group use extend data set conduct refined phenotypical functional analysis regulatory T cell order explore regulatory T cell phenotype function d-AIH differs : ( A ) control define ( ) non-transplanted patient autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) , ( ii ) LT recipient acute rejection , ( iii ) LT recipients chronic rejection , ( iv ) non-transplanted patient chronic hepatitis C ; ( B ) accord disease etiology lead transplantation ; ( C ) accord immunosuppressive regimen prior diagnosis d-AIH make ( D ) time disease course . This could potentially give u insight cause immune tolerance breakdown d-AIH . Aim 2 : To investigate expression IL-17A HDAC9 gene relate regulatory T cell defect observe liver transplant recipient d-AIH . Rationale : Histone/protein deacetylases regulate chromatin remodeling , gene expression function many transcription factor . Acetylation histones lead open chromatin structure permissive initiation gene transcription expression . Histone deacetylase inhibition Trichostatin-A ( TSA ) demonstrate prevent production IL-17A sustain Foxp3 expression human T-regs . Importantly , differentiation T-regs Th17-like phenotype inhibit TSA d-AIH , might interest development new therapeutic modality . We would like first confirm preliminary data observation large patient population address concern RNA integrity formalin fix paraffin embed tissue use fresh liver biopsy tissue assess expression gene involve T-cell anergy immune tolerance LT recipient .</detailed_description>
