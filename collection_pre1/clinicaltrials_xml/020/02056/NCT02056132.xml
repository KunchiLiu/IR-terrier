	<brief_summary>There urgent need noninvasive method diagnose bronchial infection exacerbation patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . The current method diagnose infection involve either collect sputum sample obtain bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) . However , patient produce sputum . At time decision patient exacerbation continue subjective . In exploratory study , propose new , noninvasive method diagnose bronchial infection evaluate possible marker inflammation assist noninvasive way determination exacerbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breath Condensate Study Patients With Cystic Fibrosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize possible recover microbial product cause infection Exhaled Breath Condensate ( EBC ) sample well measure marker inflammation like Interleukin ( IL ) -8 , Leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , Interleukin IL-6 , Interleukin IL-1B , Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha , well proteases like neutrophil elastase , matrix metalloproteinase 2 9 antiproteases like secretory leukoprotease inhibitor ( SLPI ) , alpha one antitrypsin tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) . As way compare finding systemic inflammation also measure C-reactive protein serum . 20 patient cystic fibrosis chronic bronchial infection 20 control recruit . Their exhaled breath condensate sputum sample collect analyzed presence bacteria traditional , molecular nuclear acid amplification method well Pyrosequencing analysis . We also measure marker inflammation follow CF patient follow year continue collect exhale breath condensate exacerbation admit hospital well treatment exacerbation . We correlate marker patient 's clinical feature include pulmonary function test , Body max index , CF pathogens , CF genotype . If hypothesis turn true open possibility new noninvasive diagnostic follow method benefit cystic fibrosis patient . 2 . Hypothesis &amp; Specific Aims : A. Microbial product recover exhaled breath condensate . B . That microbial product recover exhale breath correlate recover sputum C. Markers inflammation recover exhale breath condensate .</detailed_description>
