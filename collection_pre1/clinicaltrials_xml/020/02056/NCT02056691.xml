	<detailed_description>Patients undergo investigation symptom colorectal cancer present hospital undergo standard diagnostic procedure . Once resectable nonmetastatic cancer diagnose ( i.e . cancer spread beyond bowel ) , amenable surgical resection decide colorectal multidisciplinary patient fulfills selection criterion , ask wish participate study . They give information regard study time diagnosis . If give consent formal consenting process take place next routine appointment . During appointment patient opportunity ask question . A member study team explain study detail , answer question potential participant ( partners/ carers ) . The patient free refuse participation withdraw study time without affect care , explain information discuss time informed consent . If patient agrees participate trial , follow provision inform consent embark exercise programme need fill two questionnaire , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( Long ) Dietary Intervention Primary Care Questionnaire ( DINE ) . They counsel try maintain normal exercise level calorie intake . Blood sample also take , analyze stored analysis include possible genetic analysis later stage start exercise regime . They muscle biopsy local anaesthetic take thigh , analysis storage . Participants undergo initial assessment baseline exercise ability oxygen absorption use upright exercise bike concurrent ECG reading breath analysis . The two week preoperative exercise regime plan depend patient 's operation date . The exercise regime consist 10 session exercise constant load , last 60 , separate 60 recovery elicit 90 % maximal heart rate . The 6 session hold 2 week period . Each patient exercise ability oxygen absorption remeasured end 2 week period second sample blood take comparison . During operation sample adipose tissue near tumour site take separately main sample . A muscle biopsy thigh also take time . As standard clinical care patient review outpatient set 6 week postoperatively . When patient attend follow appointment final blood test muscle biopsy ( local anaesthetic ) take assess long term effect exercise program . Patient consent seek separately although discuss initial introduction study . Patients free withdraw study time adverse event concern regard continuation study patient withdrawn .</detailed_description>
