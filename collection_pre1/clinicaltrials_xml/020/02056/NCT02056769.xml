	<brief_summary>Patients brain hemorrhage result rupture aneurysm ( SAH ) risk develop condition call vasospasm , one two week hemorrhage . This major cause stroke death follow SAH . A special type CT scan , call CT perfusion , analyze regional blood flow brain . We hypothesize CT perfusion scan perform admission day 6 post-hemorrhage enable u predict patient go develop vasospasm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Perfusion Imaging Predict Vasospasm Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rupture brain aneurysm result type bleed brain call subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . This substantial cause morbidity mortality world-wide : even best possible care , half patient die many leave disabled . Sometimes immediate brain damage bleed severe . However , many patient seem well first go develop something call `` vasospasm '' : narrow large artery brain . This result brain get enough blood , patient suffer stroke result . The lack blood brain call delayed cerebral ischemia ( DCI ) , major secondary cause stroke death patient survive initial aneurysm rupture . Vasospasm see angiogram ( blood vessel image ) two-thirds SAH patient , cause neurological symptom DCI half patient . It usually develop week SAH . Early diagnosis treatment cerebral vasospasm delay cerebral ischemia ( DCI ) reduce morbidity mortality SAH patient . CT perfusion image able identify area reduce cerebral blood flow risk DCI stroke . This technique able measure cerebral blood flow blood volume ( CBF , CBV ) , calculate two measure cerebral perfusion : time peak intensity ( TTP ) mean transit time ( MTT ) . Taken together , provide information amount blood brain receive whether brain compensating reduction flow . This helpful see vasospasm image enough predict brain ischemia stroke ; additional physiological information provide perfusion assessment strengthen diagnosis DCI . Early evidence suggest CT perfusion fast , accurate , inexpensive non-invasive method brain image identify patient DCI SAH , guide appropriate therapy . If able successfully predict patient high risk DCI and/or stroke , could intervene early . This could improve patient outcome , potentially allow well use limited intensive care nursing resource . Other study show patient DCI alter perfusion prior develop clinical symptom , know whether use CT perfusion predict patient risk , CT perfusion measurement ( e.g. , CBF TTP ) useful . The radiation risk associate CT perfusion image negligible , due advance CT technology allow routine simultaneous CT perfusion CT angiogram ( CTA ) without significant increase radiation dose conventional head CT-CTA alone . Judicious use CT perfusion , structure algorithm include routine perfusion scan admission peak risk period vasospasm , may actually decrease cumulative radiation dose patient SAH , rule perfusion deficit brain ischemia cause decrease neurological function limit repeat angiogram .</detailed_description>
