	<brief_summary>Postoperative Ileus define transient postoperative functional inhibition propulsive bowel activity . The ethiology process best describe multifactorial . In pathogenesis different mechanism involve hormone neuropeptides , inflammation , narcotic Autonomic nervous system . Is one common cause prolonged hospital stay abdominal surgery , thereby increase health-care resource utilization . More importantly , cause patient discomfort form nausea , vomit , stomach cramp . It variable duration usually solve 3 4 day . Prolonged Ileus associate postoperative complication like increase urinary pulmonary infection , profound venous thrombosis wound-site complication . Mosapride prokinetic agent act selective serotonin agonist ( 5- HT4 ) facilitate acetylcholine release intrinsic plexus . This accelerate gastric empty propulsive peristaltic movement low intestine . Mosapride action central nervous system therefore less side effect like cardiac arrhythmia extrapyramidal symptom . For safe drug choose center research . Two randomize control trial study Mosapride conclude shortens PI colorectal surgery . However trial take place specific population ( Orientals ) less 50 patient one include laparoscopic treatment specifically . Also end point study n't consider impact PI hospital stay cost health system . We therefore decide conduct prospective randomize study patient undergo laparoscopic colorectal surgery colon cancer . The patient randomize receive treatment placebo surgery . With study intend prove patient treated mosapride immediately surgery suffer shorter postoperative ileus earlier oral intake shorter hospital stay . The primary aim trial ass effectiveness use Mosapride shorten duration Postoperative ileus patient undergoing colorectal laparoscopic surgery . The trial hypothesis standardize use Mosapride immediately colorectal laparoscopic surgery safe accelerate recovery propulsive bowel activity , thereby shorten postoperative ileus hospital stay .</brief_summary>
