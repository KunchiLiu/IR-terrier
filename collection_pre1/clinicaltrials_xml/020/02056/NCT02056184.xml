	<brief_title>Targeted Ultrasound Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis common form inflammatory arthritis . It condition body 's joint become swollen damage . Currently , approach use manage rheumatoid arthritis so-called 'Treat Target ' approach . The aim approach treatment achieve absence sign symptom , best possible state low disease activity . It require use frequent routine clinical assessment help determine treatment use . Ultrasound image ( use sound wave take image joint surround tissue ) show well standard clinical measurement detect disease activity . Doctors already use ultrasound image part decisionmaking , term diagnosis alter treatment , clearly show associate well control disease . Participants randomly put 1 2 treatment group ( standard treatment group image group ) . All patient also undergo ultrasound assessment . In standard treatment arm , doctor know ultrasound result base treatment routine disease activity score alone . In image group , doctor use routine clinical disease activity score plus ultrasound result make decision treatment give treatment increase necessary . However , patient image group , even rheumatoid arthritis remain stable judged disease activity score , treatment increase base sign active disease ultrasound . Participation last 2 year . During study participant require attend 8 clinic visit . Approximately 400 patient number country Europe Japan expect take part study .</detailed_description>

Exclusion Criteria Patients stable dose methotrexate within 8 week screen , intolerance contraindication ( per clinician judgment ) Intramuscular , intraarticular change oral corticosteroid within 8 week screen visit . Oral Prednisolone dose &gt; 5 mg within 8 week screen Treatment investigational agent within 4 week ( 5 halflives investigational drug , whichever long ) screening . Patients previously receive biological therapy RA . History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanised murine monoclonal antibody Evidence serious +/uncontrolled concomitant disease investigator 's judgment would deem patient inappropriate inclusion study : include ( exclusively ) include cardiovascular ( NYHA class III/IV heart failure ) , nervous system ( demyelination ) , pulmonary ( include obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis ) , renal , hepatic , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ) gastrointestinal disease ( include complicate diverticulitis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease. ) . Known active current history recurrent bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial infection ( include limit tuberculosis atypical mycobacterial disease , Hepatitis B C , herpes zoster , exclude fungal infection nail bed ) . Any major episode infection require hospitalisation treatment IV antibiotic within 4 week screen oral antibiotic within 2 week prior screen . Patients persistent infection patient significant risk infection ( e.g . leg ulceration , indwell urinary catheter , septic joint within 1 year ( ever prosthetic joint still situ ) . Active TB require treatment within previous 3 year . Patients screen latent TB ( per local guideline ) , positive , treat follow local practice guideline prior commence study . Patients previously treat tuberculosis recurrence 3 year permit . Primary secondary immunodeficiency ( history currently active ) unless relate primary disease investigation . 12 . Evidence active malignant disease , malignancy diagnose within previous 10 year ( include haematological malignancy solid tumour , except basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix uterus excise cure ) , breast cancer diagnose within previous 20 year unless related primary disease investigation .</criteria>
