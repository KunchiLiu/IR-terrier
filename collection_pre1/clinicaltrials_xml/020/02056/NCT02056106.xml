	<brief_summary>This study compare two model implement antidepressant treatment 10 HIV clinic Uganda . Using cluster randomization , 5 clinic implement task-shifting , protocolized model , 5 others rely clinical acumen . The protocolized model include ( 1 ) routine depression screen clinic visit adult patient train expert patient triage , ( 2 ) training nurse diagnose depression prescribe monitor antidepressant treatment use algorithm-based protocol , ( 3 ) monthly supervision monitoring hire study psychiatrist . The clinical acumen model also include routine depression screen ongoing supervision , rely clinical acumen train primary care provider evaluate treat patient show sign depression screening , oppose structure protocol .

	<detailed_description>The study evaluate task-shifting approach depression treatment use algorithm-based , nurse-driven model manage antidepressant treatment 10 Ugandan HIV clinic . The model include ( 1 ) case identification facilitate routine depression screen clinic visit patient , ( 2 ) training nurse assist primary care provider implement antidepressant treatment perform initial evaluation , monitoring symptom side effect , make algorithm-based dose recommendation , ( 3 ) layer supervision monitor psychiatric specialist ensure safety quality care . This model implement 5 randomly select clinic ( protocolized arm ) , 5 clinic select also use routine depression screen rely primary care provider decide whether evaluate treat depression ( clinical acumen arm ) . At site , random sample 150 patient ( total n=1500 ) screen positive possible depression follow 12 month . We compare two arm depression evaluation , uptake antidepressant treatment , change depression ( treatment response ) . We also examine relationship change depression key economic public health outcome ( e.g . work status , condom use , HIV treatment adherence ) .</detailed_description>
