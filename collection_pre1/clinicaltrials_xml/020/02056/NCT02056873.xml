	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) possible new treatment Tourette Syndrome ( TS ) . This investigation ( 1 ) test hypothesis centromedian ( CM ) continuous brain stimulation effective , safe method treatment tic medication refractory TS , ( 2 ) define intra-operative post-operative physiological change , ( 3 ) test hypothesis responsive brain stimulation ( RBS ) provide alternative chronic DBS TS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal clinical care TS include cognitive behavior therapy , medication , supportive psychotherapy , and/or combination two . To meet entry criterion study , must already try method help symptom . DBS consider experimental treatment TS would do normal clinical care . Participation study require extensive pre-surgical screening determine eligibility DBS surgery , DBS surgical procedure , regular follow-up . Subjects see monthly post surgery 6 month . After 6 month , data assess RBS may offer stimulation set . If , stimulator setting change chronic responsive . If , subject continue receive chronic DBS stimulation . Subsequent visit schedule every 6 month total 24 month study participation . At end initial 24-month study period , subject choice 1 ) continue active stimulation current setting , 2 ) continue stimulation search new setting , 3 ) discontinue stimulation ( turn device ) , 4 ) device remove . If subject continue receive active stimulation , follow PI see yearly interval DBS system commercially available , FDA approve treatment TS , unavailable patient use .</detailed_description>

Must minimum single trial alpha2 adrenergic agonist ( 0.10.3 mg/day ) Clinically relevant depression must pharmacologically treat deem stable Must stabilize 1 month TS medication without dose change prior surgical intervention . If medication trial result discontinuation TS medication , subject must stabilize 3 month TS medicine Must willing keep TS related medication stable unchanged throughout trial Must offer habit reversal therapy/cognitive behavioral intervention therapy ( HRT ) subject prior enrollment . ( Subjects require participate HRT highly encourage , must complete prior start study 's protocol . Those improve significantly exclude receive DBS surgery ) If tic focal addressable botulinum toxin treatment , study neurologist offer administer trial botulinum toxin prior consideration surgical therapy .
