	<detailed_description>Written consent obtain investigator prior surgical procedure use Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent form . The medical record examine use analgesic medication 24 hour prior procedure record . Patients take OR anesthetize use standard procedure Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) department anesthesia , include monitor accord American Society Anesthesiologists guideline ( EKG , pulse oximetry , BP , temperature end-tidal expired carbon dioxide inhalation anesthetic gas ) . If Attending Anesthesiologist believe child risk aspiration gastric content , rapid sequence induction propofol 3-4 mg/kg succinylcholine 1mg/kg IV perform cricoid pressure , keep standard practice . In patient IV start induction anesthesia . An age appropriate endotracheal tube appropriate size laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) insert patient . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane , nitrous oxide oxygen , adjust keep blood pressure heart rate within 20 % baseline value , keep standard practice . All patient receive ketorolac 0.5mg/kg IV . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio one two study group : ultrasound guide supraclavicular block IV opioids , base computer generate random number use Random Allocation Software For Parallel Group Randomized Trials . The assignment make write informed consent obtain . There equal chance child assign one two group . Patients randomized systemic analgesia group receive 1mcg/kg fentanyl IV induction . Patients randomize supraclavicular block group receive ultrasound guide nerve block 0.2 ml/kg ropivacaine 0.5 % ( maximum 10 ml ) , use technique describe Marhofer et al . In order decrease variance success rate , ultrasound guide nerve block perform 1 4 anesthesiology co-investigators , successfully perform 100 ultrasound guide block past . Supraclavicular block perform use high frequency probe place coronal-oblique-plane supraclavicular fossa . The brachial plexus identify cluster hypoechoic nodule , lateral round pulsate hypoechoic subclavian artery lie top hyperechoic first rib . The cupola lung identify . If transverse colli artery visualize cephalically surround plexus , probe move toward good coronal oblique plane , direct ultrasound beam slightly caudally , order keep artery away plexus . The needle carefully introduce use in-plane ( IP ) technique lateral medial , toward brachial plexus . The entire needle image visualise time ensure enter vessel , nerve plexus pleura . The spread local anesthetic target plexus observe ultrasound image . The time take place block record time ultrasound probe first place child completion local anesthetic injection . The observer collect postoperative data present block place , band-aid place supraclavicular fossa patient maintain blind observer group assignment . During operation patient receive intraoperative fentanyl , 1 mcg/kg IV time , attend anesthesiologist believe clinically indicate . At end operation , anesthetic gas discontinue patient breathes 100 % oxygen . The trachea extubated patient responds command , child take Post Anesthetic Care Unit ( PACU ) keep standard practice . A validated pain scale ( verbal rating scale 0 = pain 10 = worst possible pain ever ) use throughout assess severity pain postoperative period . In keep current practice , patient pain score &gt; 4 treated morphine 0.05mg/kg IV 10 minute interval score 4 . Oral acetaminophen hydrocodone ( Lortab elixir 0.15mg/kg hydrocodone ) administer child pain score 2- 3 . Supplemental oxygen , rescue antiemetic antipruritic drug administer keep standard practice TCH clinical judgment Attending Anesthesiologist . The duration supplemental oxygen therapy , medication administer complication ( side effect nausea , vomit , itch , respiratory depression , prolong awakening ) record case report form . The blinded observer record pain score within 15 minute arrival PACU 30 minute , 1,2,6,12,24 , 48 hour arrival PACU . If child sleeping time , score record awake . Prior discharge home , parent educate use 0-10 pain scale give diary keep accurate record postoperative pain issue study period . The goal capture maximum pain score rest movement . Patient parental satisfaction pain management global perioperative experience also grade numeric scale 0-10 scale . Time readiness discharge also measure time patient enters PACU patient attain Aldrete score 9-10 . This standardized scale use assess discharge readiness TCH list : Aldrete Scoring System Activity Can move voluntarily command 4 extremity 2 2 extremity 1 0 extremity 0 Respiration Can deep-breathe cough freely 2 Dyspnea , shallow limit breathe 1 Apneic 0 Circulation Preoperative BP ( mmHg ) BP ± 20 mmHg baseline 2 BP ± 20-50 mmHg baseline 1 BP ± 20 mmHg 0 Consciousness Fully Awake 2 Arousable call 1 Not respond 0 Color Normal 2 Pale , dusky , blotchy 1 Cyanotic 0 Score 10 : ready discharge If patient discharge end 48 hour period surgery , give diary complete list medication give , assess pain various time interval ( 12,24 , 48 hour surgery ) , along satisfaction pain control . The patient contact discharge obtain data diary . Phone call also place POD # 1,2 , &amp; 3 family follow ass measure endpoint ( pain , medication usage , satisfaction , resolution nerve block ) . At time follow visit surgeon , complete physical examination do include neurological evaluation nerve injury .</detailed_description>
