	<brief_summary>Airway management maintain adequate ventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) important . The rule 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio endotracheal intubation keep 1 breath every 6-8 second advance airway generally accept accord 2010 Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) guideline . This recommendation emphasize time frequency ventilation CPR . However , poor clinical evidence establish concern adequate volume , airway flow pressure cycle . There increase evidence hyperventilation resuscitation reduces pulmonary venous return , therefore , compromise cardiac output circulation . Another research report use high flow oxygen mask alone basic life support ( BLS ) result well survival rate overall outcome compare conventional positive pressure ventilation . Our study applies flowmeter measure ventilation parameter frequency , duration , exhale volume airway pressure intubated patient receive artificial ventilation CPR . The parameter correlate information accelerometry capnometry simultaneously resuscitation . . Investigators also focus influence chest compression , increase intra-thoracic pressure considerably . This effect may act positive pressure ventilation probably minimize efficiency ventilation circulation.. Details ventilate one patient CPR include right timing , duration , adequate volume coordination debate . Unfortunately , current practice base clinical guideline emphasize little issue . Investigators commit refine contemporary practice hopefully improve quality resuscitation . Investigators propose hypothesis coordinate chest compression ventilation may minimize increasement airway pressure improve effect circulation</brief_summary>
