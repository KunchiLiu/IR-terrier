	<brief_summary>Previous study deal patient maintain antiviral drug 2 ~ 6 month final chemotherapy reveal many patient stop preemptive antiviral drug within 6 month experience viral reactivation . Based study result , guideline recommend preemptive antiviral therapy maintain least 6 month . Nevertheless , many clinician apply preemptive antiviral drug 1~2 year longer final chemotherapy without definite evidence , practice increase medical expenditure lot .

	<detailed_description>HBV reactivation cancer patient important directly affect severe hepatic failure also delay cancer treatment may cause reduction overall survival . Thus guideline accord previous study follow-up randomized study reveal patient positive HbsAg administer preemptive antiviral therapy least 6 month . However , ideal duration preemptive antiviral therapy suppress viral reactivation withdrawal hepatitis clearly identify present time . It previous data dealt efficiency preemptive antiviral therapy , analyze outcome withdrawal antiviral therapy . Frequent late-onset reactivation hepatitis association preemptive antiviral therapy mainly due drug-resistance post-withdrawal manifestation . Drug-resistance mainly associate lamivudine substitute entecavir tenofovir produce low incidence resistance ( &lt; 1.2 % 6 year ) . Therefore , issue present withdrawal hepatitis may due early cessation antiviral drug .</detailed_description>
