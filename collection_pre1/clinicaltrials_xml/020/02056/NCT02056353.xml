	<brief_summary>Most critically ill patient confront hyperglycaemia , associate increased mortality morbidity risk . Normalising elevate blood glucose level intensive insulin therapy may improve patient outcome , associate increase risk hypoglycaemia . The LOGIC-2 study hypothesise LOGIC-Insulin computerise software algorithm allow good ( less hyperglycaemia ) safer ( less hypoglycaemia ) blood glucose control critically ill patient nurse-directed blood glucose control .</brief_summary>
