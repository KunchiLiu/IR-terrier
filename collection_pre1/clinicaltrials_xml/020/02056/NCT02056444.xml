	<brief_summary>Bleeding total hip replacement surgery primary concern surgical anaesthetic team . Tranexamic acid commonly-used drug help blood clot decrease surgical bleeding . The investigator commonly administer drug intravenously prior procedure . Some patient unable receive drug form , risk related blood clotting . The investigator know , study total knee replacement surgery , investigator deliver tranexamic acid directly surgical site ( topically ) , similar benefit le drug absorb bloodstream , result less risk patient . The investigator seek find similar benefit term reduce blood loss see use topical tranexamic acid hip replacement surgery . The investigator ' hypothesis topical form equivalent , well intravenous form reduce intra- postoperative bleeding . The investigator also expect see decreased level tranexamic acid bloodstream administer topically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomize 2 separate treatment arm : IV administration tranexamic acid ( TXA ) skin incision topical administration time arthrotomy closure . Sample size calculation indicate 72 study participant group would allow study sufficient power detect clinically relevant change post-operative hemoglobin level , non-inferiority study design . A double-blind protocol implement , consent study participation obtain time Pre-Admission Clinic appointment . Randomization occur follow : A sealed envelope , append patient chart time pre-admission clinic appointment , provide physician time perioperative blood conservation program review . This physician open envelope ensure patient candidate receive TXA . The order place either topical intravenous form send patient operating theatre day surgery . The treating surgeon , anaesthesia team , resident nurse operate room day surgery away study participant 's randomization , instruct avoid discuss administration group maintain blind patient best possible . During procedure , either anaesthetist administer IV TXA prior skin incision , surgeon infiltrate , surgical wound , topical TXA time arthrotomy closure . No team member operate theatre involve data collection post-operative period , instructed disseminate information regard route administration electronic paper chart . Data collect independent reviewer involve randomization process , procedure . In fashion , data collector well participant blind intervention . In immediate postoperative period , surgical team responsible make clinical decision , without influence research team . Best effort make keep patient unaware result randomization in-hospital stay time subsequent follow-up visit . For intravenous TXA group , administration follow current protocol London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) , standard dose 20 mg/kg give patient prior skin incision . For topical group , standard dose 1.5 gram give per best current evidence total knee arthroplasty . The latter administer end procedure ; solution bathe operative field 5 minute arthrotomy closure , final prosthetic component situ . Primary outcome measure include difference postoperative hemoglobin level blood transfusion requirement . The investigator routinely measure hemoglobin level post-operative day 1 2 ; subsequent measurement base suspicion continue bleed . Comparison level make level obtain Pre-Admission Clinic appointment obtain delta hemoglobin level ( delta-Hgb ) . The low measured value patient 's stay hospital take determinate value . Secondary outcome measure include number unit pack red blood cell ( pRBC ) transfuse , well complication rate , transfusion-related procedure-related complication . Packed RBC transfusion per Health Canada-recommended Clinical Practice Guidelines , discretion treat surgical team . The investigator also measure plasma level tranexamic acid intraoperatively , immediate post-operative period , order compare systemic absorption level route administration . A 5 mL blood sample draw 1 hour administration . For intravenous group , occur intraoperatively ; topical route , draw PACU . Precise time administration blood sample collection mark Chart Abstraction Form . 5 mL blood require purpose . The specimen send core laboratory cool stored time centrifugation . Once centrifuge , serum sample freeze -80 degree Celsius ( -80C ) . Batches 20 sample send St. Michael 's Hospital Toronto , Ontario , Tandem Mass Spectrometry . This current available method analysis serum TEA level . All 120 participant study blood level TEA measure fashion .</detailed_description>
