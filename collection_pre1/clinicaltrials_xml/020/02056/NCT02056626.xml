	<detailed_description>The propose research design determine application classical conditioning operation could influence clinical effect regimen antihypertensive drug therapy . In double-blind , randomize , parallel-controlled clinical trial , It determine , capitalize condition pharmacotherapeutic effect , patient effectively treat small cumulative amount drug . To end , hypertensive patient treat partial rather continuous schedule pharmacologic reinforcement . These patient compare : ( ) patient continue treat standard regimen pharmacotherapy effective dose drug , ( b ) patient receive ( reduce ) cumulative amount medication continuous schedule reinforcement receive experimental patient treat partial schedule reinforcement , ( c ) patient receive dose frequency carvedilol Partial Reinforcement Group receive intervene condition stimulus . It possible non-continuous schedule pharmacologic reinforcement ( concomitant reduce amount active drug ) exert effect indistinguishable continuous ( standard ) regimen pharmacotherapy ( higher cumulative amount drug ) . That outcome comparison , however , critical evaluate role conditioning pharmacotherapy hypertension . Specifically , test hypothesis : 1. patient treat partial schedule antihypertensive medication show great amelioration symptom achieve patient treat ( reduce ) amount drug administer continuous schedule reinforcement ; Conditions permitting , also test prediction : 2. irrespective initial treatment regimen , relapse occur quickly follow withdrawal active medication patient continue receive condition stimulus ( placebo ) patient continue receive condition stimulus ; 3. active drug withdrawn replace conditioned stimulus alone , resistance extinction great ( i.e. , rate relapse le ) among patient treat partial schedule reinforcement patient treated amount drug administer continuous schedule reinforcement ( partial reinforcement effect ) . Positive result would transform study practice pharmacotherapy respect placebo effect provide new model within design treatment protocols patient chronic disease capitalize condition pharmacotherapeutic response . The model , testable hypothesis derive , also provide new framework research placebo effect mechanisms underlie phenomenon .</detailed_description>
