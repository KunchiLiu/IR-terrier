	<brief_summary>Human lipodystrophies ( lipoD ) represent heterogeneous group diseases characterize generalize partial fat loss , fat hypertrophy depot partial.3 , 4 Insulin resistance , dyslipidemia diabetes generally associate , lead early complication . Acquired lipoD generalize , resemble congenital form , partial , Barraquer-Simons syndrome , loss fat upper part body contrast accumulation low part . The common form lipoD iatrogenic . In human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient , first-generation antiretroviral drug strongly relate peripheral lipoatrophy metabolic alteration . Genetic form uncommon : recessive generalized congenital lipoD result case mutation gene encode seipin 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferase 2 ( AGPAT2 ) . Dominant partial familial lipoD result mutation gene encode nuclear protein lamin A/C adipose transcription factor PPARgamma . Importantly , LMNA mutation also responsible metabolic laminopathies , resemble metabolic syndrome progeria , syndrome premature age . Molecular genetic base many rare form genetic lipoD remain elucidate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification New Gene Involved Hereditary Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recently evaluate two sister ( index patient ) affect syndrome associating diffuse leukoencephalopathy partial lipoD . The investigator analyze numerous know genetic cause leukodystrophies lipoD investigator fail identify know cause syndrome never previously report . The investigator switch effort analysis exome use next generation sequence affected sister unaffected relative ( one sister two parent ) . The investigator identify excellent candidate gene homozygous missense mutation affect sister . The investigator aim prove involvement candidate gene lipoD 's determinism search additional mutation candidate gene series patient affected lipoD ( collaboration Pr Capeau 's Team ) ( LIPOGENE study ) functional analysis perform two index patient blood skin sample ( LIPOGENE sub-study ) .</detailed_description>
