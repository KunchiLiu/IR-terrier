	<brief_summary>In HIV+ cigarette smoker , prior history pulmonary infection , emphysema often develop early age significant cause morbidity despite treatment antiretroviral drug . Preliminary data gather HIV+ individual smoke cigarette strongly support hypothesis combination HIV infection smoke creates increase stress lower respiratory tract . To examine underlying factor contribute accelerate development emphysema cohort , sample low respiratory tract provide HIV+ HIV- subject . The sample collect serve biomarkers assess onset emphysema .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study analyze biologic sample blood , airways and/or urine HIV- HIV+ smoker non-smokers well understand etiology pathogenesis emphysema association HIV infection . The underlying hypothesis combination HIV infection smoking create chronic oxidant stress lower respiratory tract promote cellular loss contributes progressive development emphysema . Preliminary data strongly support hypothesis accelerate development emphysema among HIV+ smoker due part interaction HIV directly macrophage find pulmonary alveolus . The interaction cause release exaggerated amount oxidant low respiratory tract lead increase level oxidize metabolite . HIV+ individual emphysema high plasma level apoptotic pulmonary capillary-derived micro particle contain oxidized metabolite . The increased release micro particle characteristic apoptotic process . We study hypothesis sample HIV+ HIVâ€¾ subject alveolar macrophage ( AM ) , find epithelial surface lung , epithelial lining fluid ( ELF ) find low respiratory tract . We also assess plasma pulmonary capillary-derived endothelial microparticles ( EMPs ) biomarker pulmonary apoptosis . Using newly develop mass spectrometry methodology , quantify oxidant stress AM , ELF plasma EMPs , identify specific oxidize metabolite within compartment . Finally , examine interaction vitro tease apart contribution component ( AM , ELF , plasma EMPs ) interaction . To assess concept , follow aim address : Specific Aim 1 ( n=160 ) . To explore extent oxidant stress lower respiratory tract association HIV infection smoking . Specific Aim 2 ( n=160 ) . To evaluate plasma level capillary apoptosis oxidation state HIV+ nonsmoker smoker . Specific Aim 3 ( n=160 ) . To examine interaction pulmonary capillary endothelium various oxidant effector component identify oxidant-vulnerable pathway relevant development new treatment therapy .</detailed_description>
