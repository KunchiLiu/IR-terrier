	<detailed_description>Oral appliance accept mean treat obstructive sleep apnea . In order determine effective , polysomnogram need conduct oral appliance place . We propose develop monitoring sensor could insert commercially available oral appliance order monitor effectiveness oral appliance treat sleep apnea . We propose look heart rate variability marker ongoing sleep apnea . We use temperature mean detect long device mouth mean assess adherence . The objective Phase I project validate hypothesis answer five question : - What optimal sensor suite ? We determine optimal suite sensor provide adequate sensitivity specificity determine OA usage effectiveness without compromise patient comfort . - Can develop design compatible popular OAs ? We design develop prototype version OAMS compatible three popular commercially available OAMS product ( potential candidate include EMA , TAP , SomnoDent , Herbst , Suad ) . - Do experienced dental care provider specialize OAs approve design ? We collaborate dental care clinician iteratively refine OAMS design maximum performance patient comfort . - Does OAMS provide data consistent PSG instrumentation ? We collaborate Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ( DHMC ) Sleep Disorders Laboratory assess OAMS sensor accuracy approximately five healthy volunteer compare OSA-related OAMS data data standard PSG instrumentation . - Can formulate cogent Human Subject Testing plan Phase II ? We develop detailed HST study plan conduct Phase II demonstrate fully integrated functional OAMS broad range OSA patient candidate OA .</detailed_description>
