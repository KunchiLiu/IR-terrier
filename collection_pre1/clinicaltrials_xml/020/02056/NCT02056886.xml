	<brief_summary>Breast carcinoma require frequently adjuvant therapy surgical excision : way , one major criterion indicate need adjuvant chemotherapy diagnosis metastatic lymph-node invasion , mainly axillary field . Axillary surgery therefore mandatory diagnosis breast carcinoma . For many year , order avoid unnecessary complication due extensive axillary surgery ( instance , arm enlargement lymphedema ) , limited surgery frequently perform first suppose invade lymph-nodes ( LN ) call `` sentinel '' LN technique ; sentinel LN invade , extensive axillary surgery omit . To decide surgery , remove sentinel LN cut 3 4 slice examine immediately smear ( cytology ) frozen slice ( pathology ) . However , due hazard cut LN , micro-metastases misdiagnosed . That recent molecular biology method develop total LN crush blend , analyzed OSNA technique ( One Step Nuclear Acid analysis ) amplify detect mRNA cod cytokeratin-19 protein witness LN metastatic invasion . A standardized automate technique available mean time 30 50 minute accord number analyze LN . In 12 international study ( 2830 case ) consistency OSNA technique final pathology 91 98 % sensitivity seem high . Less 5 % breast carcinoma cell n't express CK-19 protein . The use OSNA technique require dedicated machine skilled pathologist , increase slightly operation time ; however allow avoid immediate long-term complication due radical LN axillary surgery case negativity sentinel LN procedure . To date , three technique include extemporaneous examination ( OSNA classical method ) ( classical pathological analysis ) advantage drawback . `` SAGE '' study main objective compare three technique term direct cost Quality Life impact . The superiority three technique purpose SAGE study , economic burden OSNA technique comparison 2 others standard set France . Quality Life Pain evaluation perform immediately surgery 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medico-economic Study Three Strategies Sentinel Lymph Node Analysis Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , standard treatment early Breast carcinoma start surgical step consist tumor resection sentinel lymph-node ( SLN ) detection , order select patient propose complementary axillary lymphadenectomy . This requested information may obtain operation time intra operative examination , surgery consequence second surgical procedure lymphadenectomy appear indicate . In France , three strategy currently use management sentinel lymph node : - intra operative pathological frozen section examination follow final pathological diagnosis , - intra operative molecular biology use OSNA technique ( One Step Nuclear Acid analysis ) - intra operative examination , final pathological examination . Each 3 strategy advantage drawbacks cost . With 50000 new case per year France , Breast carcinoma , thanks population screening , small tumor detect information sentinel LN invasion need . Our propose study prospective , cost-effectiveness comparative non randomise study three strategy evaluate current practice participate team . Main Objective : • evaluate 3 strategy sentinel LN diagnosis , cost-effectiveness cost-utility ( QALY ) , Quality Life , … Secondary Objectives : - rate second surgery need - rate mico-metastases macro-metastases detect build decision score , - follow-up non re-operated patient despite positive sentinel LN , - RNA collection crush blended sentinel LN - Quality Life evaluation surgical time use QLQ C30 Br 23 scale . Medical section : At pre-operative consultation , patient inform consent participate observational study , without change treatment strategy . Inclusion parameter strictly three group . At time surgery , intra operative examination plan , patient inform complete axillary dissection could indicate . Included patient follow 15 day surgery 3 9 month . Then every 6 month 2 year , yearly . Economical section : Main objective `` SAGE `` study light decision maker strike balance strategy ( induced cost prevent cost ) result term health express individual preference depend different health status , treatment strategy clinical practice French center . In study , medico-economical evaluation quite National scale ( 17 different center ) take place practice standardization prospect . General methodology : In participate center , one 3 strategy sentinel LN analysis currently use ( without extemporaneous procedure ) . Cost-effect evaluation inventory undertaken cost strategy induce positive negative consequence , qualitative quantitative level use micro cost macro cost evaluation . Evaluation Quality Life adjust health include cost effect analysis . In study , population study localize breast carcinoma , woman age 18 65 year old likely active : inclusion criterion strictly 3 strategy study . In study , consider Hospital Health Insurance point view . Hospital prospect identify value cost pay health institution due use 3 technique . Insurance Health prospect value cost treatment strategy include direct cost related private medical care reimburse hospital . The study start time sentinel LN excision end 9 month later , include post-operative complication possible second surgery axillary LN excision . At 920 patient include 20 participate team .</detailed_description>
