	<brief_title>Transplantation Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Progenitors Severe Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure due coronary artery disease major problem high prevalence , increase incidence associate cost . When conventional medical/interventional treatment fail cardiac transplantation contra-indicated , alternate option need consider . Transplantation stem cell emerge one . While optimal cell type still remain debatable , compelling evidence cell whose phenotype closely matches recipient tissue look sound candidate . In context , human embryonic stem cell attractive possibility drive fate vitro , prior transplantation , towards cardiac phenotype . We develop process achieve commitment generate cardiac-directed cell . The objective study assess feasibility safety approach . In addition , disadvantage multiple intramyocardial injection recognize . We take advantage surgical set trial ( entails concomitant coronary artery bypass mitral valve procedure ) switch injection epicardial delivery fibrin gel progenitor cell embed . Coverage cell-loaded patch autologous pericardial flap finally design provide trophic factor underlie cellular graft hope improve viability .</detailed_description>
