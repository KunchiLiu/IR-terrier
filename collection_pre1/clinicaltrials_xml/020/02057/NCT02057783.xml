	<detailed_description>1 . Sleep apnea syndrome , resistant hypertension cardio-vascular risk . There many epidemiological clinical cohort study demonstrate increase cardiovascular risk associate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) . In epidemiological study , OSA severity incident hypertension link dose-response fashion . This true even take account usual confounding factor age , alcohol , tobacco consumption body mass index . More specifically , OSAS lead cause refractory hypertension OSAS prevalence 80 % patient resistant hypertension . 2 . CPAP treatment impact reduce blood pressure OSAS patient resistant hypertension A recent small sample size randomize trial ( n=35 ) demonstrate positive impact CPAP decrease clinical 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure . Compared control group , awake systolic/diastolic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring decrease significantly continuous positive airway pressure group ( Delta : +3.1±3.3 /+2.1±2.7 vs. -6.5±3.3/ 4.5±1.9mmHg control CPAP group respectively , p &lt; 0.05 ) . Interestingly , blood pressure change observe patient awake , nocturnal ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( Delta : +2.8±4.5/+1.8±3.5 vs. +1.6±3.5/+0.8±2.9mmHg , p=NS ) . HIPARCO Study , large Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) field ( n=194 ) recently publish JAMA ( 9 December 2013 ) also show significant limited impact CPAP blood pressure . In Intention To Treat analysis , CPAP significantly improve 24-h mean BP ( 3.0 mmHg ; 95 % CI 0.3 5.8 ; p=0.031 ) DBP ( 3.2 mmHg ; 95 % CI 1.0 5.4 ; p=0.005 ) SBP ( 3.1 ; 95 % CI -0.6 6.7 ; p=0.098 ) . Moreover , patient CPAP group 2.4 ( 1.2-5.1 ; p=0.019 ) time great probability recover dipper pattern . As CPAP alone enough OSAS sufficiently improve BP , study address efficacy combined therapy OSAS patient resistant hypertension . 3 . Resistant hypertension physical activity A study recently explore impact standardized exercise program patient suffer resistant hypertension7 . In RCT , author demonstrate group patient benefit physical activity program systolic diastolic 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor decrease 6±12 3±7 mmHg respectively ( p=0.03 ) . Thus , physical activity implement population enable good control blood pressure value . However author give information presence absence Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( SAS ) cohort . 4 . Study hypothesis : Investigators hypothesize CPAP treatment suppress OSAS combination physical activity program optimize 24-hour blood pressure control patient OSA-related resistant hypertension . Originality : Up study assess effect combine physical activity CPAP treatment patient sleep apnea resistant hypertension . Our work first aim evaluate benefit combination control systolic blood arterial pressure .</detailed_description>
