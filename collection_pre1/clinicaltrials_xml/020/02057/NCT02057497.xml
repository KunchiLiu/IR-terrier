	<brief_summary>G ( guanine nucleotide bind ) proteins associate G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) key player pathogenesis obesity diabetes target pharmacotherapeutic inter-ventions . In addition , G proteins bind GPCRs either directly permissively determine efficacy lifestyle intervention drug aim weight management diabetes treatment . Polymor-phisms fat mass obesity-related protein ( FTO ) gene also well characterise link energy intake , body fat mass well CVD risk susceptibility weight-reducing intervention . Stratifying patient accord G protein FTO-related genotyping may enable accurate prediction individual disease course responses therapeutic intervention term safety tolerability well efficacy . Although objective primarily refer analysis G pro-tein FTO-related genotype , also gene potential relevance evolution obesity and/ diabetes response lifestyle pharmacological intervention may analyse .</brief_summary>
