	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate physiological consequence extreme military training determine whether protein supplementation enhances recovery promoting gain lean body mass . This study conduct US Marine Survive , Evade , Resist , Escape ( SERE ) school Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . SERE school may ideal set assess nutritional intervention promote recovery severe military operational stress , identify innate experiential variable may lead increased level resilience Warfighters . Our laboratory recently demonstrate detrimental effect stressful nature SERE . Heart rate stress-related hormone increase dramatically , concomitant reduction circulate anabolic hormone . Additionally , SERE cause significant weight loss ( 15-20 lb ) , probably include lean body mass . The effect severe operational stress induce SERE , particularly loss lean mass , may degrade physical performance , increase injury risk , compromise military readiness . Under controlled laboratory condition , consume high protein diet supplemental high-quality protein promote muscle protein retention , enhances muscle protein synthesis , protect lean body mass response stress . Whether consume supplemental protein promote lean mass recovery physiological resilience follow 'real-world ' military stress determine . Further , level supplemental protein necessary optimize recovery extreme military operational stress elucidate . Up 90 US Marines enrol 46-day double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Using complex body composition measurement , kinetic modeling human metabolism , blood sample cognitive nutrition questionnaire , consequence SERE efficacy protein recovery nutrition lean mass accretion Warfighter resilience assess . We hypothesize consume specially formulate , high-quality supplemental protein ration item speed recovery lean body mass , physiological , psychological resilience follow extreme military operational stress .</brief_summary>
