	<detailed_description>A number publish study anesthesia demonstrate certain patient factor may impact patient perioperative outcome . Factors age , gender , cardiac function , hemodynamic status show predictive indicator . The goal present study evaluate factor effectiveness Goal Directed Fluid Management training patient outcomes major surgery document final perioperative outcome . This observational study patient ' de-identified clinical information extract University California , Irvine Medical Center electronic medical record system evaluate whether change patient ' outcome Goal-Directed Fluid Management training curriculum implement . We extract data training take place -- time-frame June 15 , 2011 September 15 , 2013 . Specifically look 30 day re-admission 90 day mortality follow surgery . There study procedure use biological material . Patient identifies utilized secure database utilized clinical management . When data extract database research purpose patient identifier remove patient identifier include information statistical analysis subsequent reporting . For publication , aggregate data utilized . No identifiable patient information release time . Statistical consideration may include : Sample Size Considerations , Predictors , Covariates/Cofounders , Statistical Goal ( ) , Statistical Approach , Secondary Analysis . Specifically , statistical analysis perform use computerize software ( SPSS Windows version 12.0 ) . For data non-normally distribute Mann Mann-Whitney test use normally distribute data compare use Student T-test . Ordinal nominal data compare use Chi-Square analysis . A p value small equal 0.05 consider significant . These statistical consideration aid support study 's hypothesis patient outcomes improvement Early Goal Directed Fluid Management training .</detailed_description>
