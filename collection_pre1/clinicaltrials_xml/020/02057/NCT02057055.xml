	<brief_summary>Recent research investigator 's lab show bacteria present out surface skin , also deep component well . In study , investigator study bacteria present different component skin include epidermis , dermis , subcutaneous fat , hair follicle , determine bacteria change repeat use different commercially available hand soap . It expect bacteria population different skin component change use different soap .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist 5 visit approximately 2 month . All study procedure occur University California San Diego Division Dermatology Outpatient Clinic . The procedure visit describe . Visit 1 ( Day 0 ) At visit , obtain informed consent subject , inclusion/exclusion criterion review . This step require brief medical history skin examination perform . Both history physical exam perform licensed physician . Eligible subject proceed remainder study . These subject provide mild soap ( ID # 100000049586 ) use whenever shower remainder study . These subject also instruct may apply topical lotion , cream , product arm remainder study . Subjects also tell avoid excessive sun exposure arm , include tan use tan bed , participate study . Visit 2 ( Day 14 ) Subjects return Day 14 Visit 2 . Any adverse event record , subject 's interim medical history take . Two skin swab take skin subject 's upper inner arm . One swab right arm leave arm . A 4-mm punch biopsy take one arm near area swab . To perform procedure , skin inject 1-2 cc local anesthetic . A 4 mm punch use remove biopsy specimen location previously agree upon investigator subject . A 4.0 nylon suture use close biopsy site , ointment Band-Aid apply . Visit 3 ( Day 28 +/- 4 ) Subjects return around Day 28 third visit . At visit , adverse event since last visit record , subject 's interim medical history take . The suture remove site biopsy take Visit 2 . Subjects provide two body wash ( ID # 300000027003 ID # 300000029240 ) use shower wash upper inner arm . One soap use wash upper half right arm , soap use wash upper half leave arm . The subject continue use Mild Body Wash shower wash body part . The subject also instruct apply cream , ointment medication arm , avoid excess sun exposure upper arm time . Visit 4 ( Day 49 +/- 4 ) Subjects return around Day 49 next visit . Any adverse event well change interim medical history since last visit record . A skin swab upper inner arm take . A 4-mm punch biopsy take area skin upper inner region right leave arm total 2 biopsy take visit . At termination visit , subject resume use normal shower production application cream lotion normally use arm . Visit 5 ( Day 59 +/- 4 ) Subjects return day suture remove . Any adverse event record . This visit conclude study-related activity . All sample process lab . Skin swab undergo pyrosequencing determine different strain bacteria present subject 's skin , well quantitative polymerase chain reaction determine abundance S. aureus , S. epidermidis , P. acnes subject 's skin surface . Biopsy specimen section section place glass slide . The section undergo immunostaining stain bacteria . Laser-capture microdissection section four skin component use assist evaluate bacteria present different skin layer .</detailed_description>
