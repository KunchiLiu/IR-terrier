	<detailed_description>Background Significance : C. difficile emerge one important pathogen threaten health quality life many population . Data different study clearly indicate shed viable spore subsequent contamination environmental surface play important role transmission C. difficile . We aim perform analysis impact different oral antibiotic therapy microbiologic kinetics patient C. difficile diarrhea , : shedding , colonization environmental contamination . We believe data study inform whether drug therapy may use interrupt disease transmission improve infection control C. difficile . Purpose Study : The purpose study 1 ) determine impact oral fidaxomicin , oral metronidazole oral vancomycin baseline temporal variation C. difficile isolate specific body sit patient microbiology-proven CDAD 2 ) determine impact oral fidaxomicin , oral metronidazole oral vancomycin baseline temporal variation C. difficile isolate targeted surface hospital room . , More specifically , establish extent quantity C. difficile shed , colonization environmental contamination patient receive oral fidaxomicin , oral metronidazole , vancomycin duration stool remain positive C. difficile . This study prospectively study role environment Healthcare Associated Infections ( HAIs ) modern healthcare set specifically address many limitation previous study . The study use modern diagnostic molecular method describe microbiologic characteristic concordance culture environment patient , describe temporal variation relationship microbiologic profile culture obtain environment patient , assess confounders hand hygiene quality cleaning , provide longitudinal follow subsequent outcomes . This study utilize microbiologic molecular technique critically prospectively examine impact environmental bioburden risk colonization infection hospitalize patient . Data study provide novel , important information regard true impact hospital environment acquisition spread HAIs Multi-Drug Resistant ( MDR ) -pathogens hospitalized patient time . As , data collect study may provide important information mechanism relative frequency environmental source bacteria lead colonization infection hospitalize patient . These data may turn stimulate justify future development novel preventive intervention . Design Procedures/Study Interventions : This randomize , control study patient document CDAD , define polymerase chain reaction C. difficile patient 3 loose stool within 24 hour . Eligible patient enrollment identify microbiology-driven alert order contact isolation C. difficile . Study team alert approach patient provide information study obtain informed consent . This study obtain microbiological culture 2 source : 1 ) environmental surface room 2 ) body surface patient predefined interval start day enrol1ment . Cultures obtain Day 1 ( day enrol1ment ) , Day 3 Day 7 follow admission room , end subsequent week ( Day 14 , Day 21 , etc . ) , day discharge hospital room . Microbiological culture obtain follow body site : perianal stool specimen . Microbiological culture obtain 5 high-touch environmental surface outline protocol . Selection Subjects : A total 30 patient anticipate enrolled study , 10 three treatment arm . Patients block-randomized receive one three antibiotic treatment CDAD describe . The study enroll 10 patient receive metronidazole therapy , 10 patient receive oral vancomycin therapy 10 patient receive oral fidaxomicin therapy . As soon PI study coordinator find patient positive C. difficile result , primary care provider ( PCP ) hospital contact discuss patient . If PCP agree allow potential enrollment , PCP introduce study patient . If patient indicate willingness participate , PI study coordinator introduce PCP another caregiver know patient . The informed consent process take place patient interested participating . The patient enrol study subject eligibility criterion meet . The PCP formally prescribe fidaxomicin , metronidazole vancomycin follow randomization . Fidaxomicin supply study sponsor . Metronidazole vancomycin supply sponsor . If subject randomize receive fidaxomicin , PI study coordinator notify Duke Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) subject enrol order drug IDS . As soon 10th subject prescribe fidaxomicin enrolls , enrollment close patient prescribed fidaxomicin . Enrollment close subject take metronidazole vancomycin soon 10th subject group enrol . The subject begin treatment medication prescribe PCP hospital . No compensation offer participation study . Consent Process : The consent process conduct study coordinator principal investigator . This typically occur patient 's hospital room.. Subject 's Capacity Give Legally Effective Consent : Subjects need able give consent participate study . Risk/Benefit Assessment : The risk minimal study . First , patient may experience adverse effect antibiotic consent receive . Each three agent recommend treatment CDAD . Second , microbiological sample take may cause discomfort minor bleeding discuss patient consenting process . Declining participate study affect clinical care patient . Results study specimens analyze real-time sent back clinician . SAEs anticipate study . Any standard SAE event may occur report manufacturer IRB . There direct benefit patient study . The sponsor supply Fidaxomicin prescribe patient enrol study . The data study may prompt future study examine use oral antibiotic reduce transmissibility C. difficile . Data Analysis Statistical Considerations : Descriptive statistic use correlate culture result environment patient . Data Safety Monitoring : PI review sign adverse event problem occur submit report event IRB accordance HRPP policy sponsor accordance protocol . Privacy , Data Storage Confidentiality : Privacy swab shall maintain swab patient patient 's room door close would appropriate patient care , use Universal Precautions . To ensure privacy patient environmental sample use automatically generate ID room number place name , MRN personal identifier . Data collect study enter secure Access database . All connection system , external internal , occur encrypt channel . Access component system role-based grant administrator system . All collect information store server host Duke Medicine .</detailed_description>
