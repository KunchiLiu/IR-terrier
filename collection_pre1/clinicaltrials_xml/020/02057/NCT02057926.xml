	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate histological impact treatment tetracycline ( TTC ) solution two layer collagen membrane ( CMs ) bio-degradation , ridge preservation technique ( RPT ) . Additionally , secondary objective evaluate effect TTC bacterial colonization inflammatory response . This randomized simple-blind clinical trial . Consecutive patient refer Department Periodontology Universitat Internacional de Catalunya ( Barcelona , Spain ) , November 2009 April 2011 , include study . This study base data collect 20 surgical site 10 systemically healthy patient require 2 extraction SPT . Before start surgery , two teeth select patient randomize two group . The test group underwent RPT CMs embed TTC solution ( CMs TTC ) , control group perform without TTC solution ( CMs NO TTC ) . Randomization perform use SPSS software ( version 18 , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . In test group , membrane first dip 5 minute TTC solution ( 50 mg/ml ) . This involve use 250 mg tablet TTC 5 ml saline mixed sterile trough . A sample membrane use SPT retain negative control sample . The membrane sample retrieve 7 day initial surgery . At 14 day suture remove new control perform within 1 month . A sample negative control , test control group analyze patient . The specimen fix 10 % formalin solution , dehydrate series alcohol , embed paraffin , section 4-5Î¼ . The section stain hematoxylin eosin examine Olympus BH-2 optical microscope . The stained section photograph digital camera mount optical microscope magnification ( x100 , x200 x400 ) . According finding present study , conclude CMs exhibit rapid degradation expose oral environment . Histological interpretation suggest CMs immerse 50mg/ml TTC solution delay CM degradation expose oral environment . Statistical evaluation show difference bacterial colonization inflammatory response , finding may also affect limited sample size . The limit present study absence histomorphometric analysis , sample size , lack long-term evaluation clinical evidence advantage technique . More clinical study human require confirm effect TTC CMs degradation make recommendation .</brief_summary>
