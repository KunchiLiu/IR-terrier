	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective study develop field test non-pharmacological , technology base , psycho-educational behavioral ( exercise meditation ) intervention improve sleep Veteran/caregiver dyads . Research Plan : The specific objective accomplish execution three phase strategy : 1 ) evaluation phase , 2 ) development preliminary intervention field test phase , 3 ) intervention refinement , revision re-testing phase . All study use sample Veteran care receiver ( CR ) age 60 require assistance spousal cohabitating caregiver ( CG ) . A sub-study include collection data , however use non-Veteran care receiver ( CR ) age 60 require assistance spousal cohabitating caregiver ( CG ) . Study 1 cross-sectional study focus Sleep Evaluation 124 CG/CR Dyads . In SLEEP-E Dyads 1 actigraphy use objectively contemporaneously measure dyadic sleep . Daily journal use collect CG/CR self-reported sleep quality , daytime mood behavior identify nature type sleep disturbance . Electronic Tablets ( E-Tabs ) introduce , evaluate validated half dyad . Pre post journal video greeting test evaluated phase . Data SLEEP-E Dyads 1 analyze inform developmental tasks activity next phase study . An additional sub-sample caregiving dyad ( non-Veterans ) recruit implement study design compare data Veteran caregiving dyad data . The focus SLEEP-E Dyads 2 Sleep Enhancement CG/CR Dyads . This phase involve adaptation , implementation field test intervention proven efficacy population use Veteran dyad development new intervention use select component evidence base sleep intervention . The intervention test 12 dyad stratify dementia status . The tele-health device use collect daily diary information phase deliver sleep hygiene educational cognitive behavior therapy component intervention . In SLEEP-E Dyads 3 feedback CGs regard acceptability intervention process analyzed addition preliminary outcome data .

Clinical Relevance : This study address neglect topic sleep disturbance old caregiving dyads-a topic important implication safety , health , function QOL old Veterans living home care family caregiver . Because inter-related , bi-directional nature sleep stress , burden depression , efficacious intervention one consider risk factor relate sleep member dyad . Yet , study first attempt elucidate dynamic relationship CG care recipient sleep impact dyadic sleep daytime function well-being Veterans caregiver . These activity lead implementation evaluation definitive randomize clinical trial CG/CR dyad make significant important contribution complement emergent program caregiver research VA devote improve quality life Veterans family .</detailed_description>
