	<brief_summary>Vaccines one effective public health tool many need n't respond well protect . Adjuvants boost immune response commonly include vaccine preparation . Bisphosphonates commonly prescribe treatment osteoporosis may represent new class adjuvant . Bisphosphonates well tolerate chronic administration adverse effect . Research suggest medication stimulate immune system . Bisphosphonates special interest population impair immunity inability amount protective antibody response follow immunization .

	<brief_title>The Effect Alendronate Immune Response Hepatitis B Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Immunization one beneficial cost-effective disease prevention measure available , always efficacious , especially old immunosuppressed population . This commonly encountered failure produce protective antibody follow immunization leave large part population vulnerable serious morbidity mortality result potentially preventable communicable disease . Bisphosphonates , commonly prescribe treatment osteoporosis well tolerated adverse effect , recently show enhance B cell expansion antibody production vaccination mouse , may represent new vaccine adjuvant . Aims : The purpose project evaluate effect bisphosphonates immune response vaccination adult use two complementary research methodology : 1 . Evaluating effect bisphosphonates quantitative humoral immune response hepatitis B vaccine healthy old volunteer randomize clinical trial . 2 . Evaluating effect bisphosphonate treatment protection influenza influenza-like illness seasonal Influenza immunization adult population population-level retrospective analysis . Methods : The first part study consist randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study 20 healthy adult 40-70 year age seronegative Hepatitis B , randomize receive either two dos intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine alendronate hepatitis B vaccine placebo . The primary outcome evaluate quantitative anti-HB surface IgG antibody titer study group compare placebo group week 8 6 month . The second part study retrospective population base case-control study utilize extensive available data repository . Rates influenza , influenza-like illness lower respiratory tract infection per 1000 subject ascertain compare study control population year , adjust potential confounders .</detailed_description>
