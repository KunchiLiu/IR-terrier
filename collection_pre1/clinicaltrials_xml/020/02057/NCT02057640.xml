	<brief_title>MLN9708 ( Ixazomib ) Combination With Panobinostat Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study define tolerability safety MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) administer day 1,8,15 every 28 day schedule 4mg combination fix dose panobinostat dexamethasone patient relapse refractory myeloma . The secondary objective study assess response clinical benefit response rate accord international uniform response criterion adapt EBMT criterion , respectively . And assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) .</detailed_description>
