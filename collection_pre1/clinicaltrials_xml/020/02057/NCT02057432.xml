	<brief_summary>This research study pilot study design evaluate magnetic resonance imaging-guided therapy ( MRT ) possible treatment breast cancer . In pilot study , investigator study possible use intra-operative MRI guide surgery . The therapy take place Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating ( AMIGO ) suite Brigham Women 's Hospital . The purpose study investigate possible perform breast conserving surgery help intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging advanced multimodality image guide operate suite . It hop intra operative MRI may improve surgeon 's ability know exact margin tumor . Currently , approximately 40 % woman need come back operating room margin cancer re-excised .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment study consist standard lumpectomy sentinel node biopsy indicate , standard axillary dissection clinically indicate . The study include additional use MRI guide removal cancer . The MRI use powerful magnet link computer create detailed picture breast . The purpose current study find whether perform intra-operative MRI possible , safe practical . As part study participant need test show eligible participate research study.If participant meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Surgery Day - Wire localization ultrasound , Mammogram MRI non-palpable tumor place participant 's breast . The presence wire tumor help guide surgeon location tumor . - The sentinel node biopsy axillary dissection perform indicate . - Then lumpectomy perform . - The participant undergo intra-operative MRI scan AMIGO . -- -If MRI image indicate may tumor behind , tissue remove respective margin . No additional MRIs perform . - Most operation outpatient . However , need stay overnight may occur recovery anesthesia slow participant underwent axillary dissection . Within six week patient surgery . The participant follow procedure : - History physical exam - Wound check - The participant also inform final pathology , include margin status.The remainder follow per standard care breast conserve surgery breast cancer . The participant assess physical exam possible complication local recurrence . These visit likely overlap establish oncology care team follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must preoperative standard mammogram without ultrasound . These may perform outside institution . Participants must biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma . If biopsy do outside hospital , pathology review BWH/DFCI . Stage : Clinical Staging must Stage I II outline AJCC 7th edition . Preoperative diagnosis positive axillary node necessitate axillary dissection time lumpectomy disqualify patient . Preoperative sentinel node biopsy also disqualify patient . Participants must candidate definitive local therapy breast conserve therapy ( take account tumor breast size ratio appropriate BCS , ability undergo standard radiation therapy postoperatively ) . Participants must measurable disease , define one lesion accurately measure MRI . ( More one lesion exclusion criterion BCS ; lesion identify MRI also exclusion criterion ) . Age â‰¥ 18 year &lt; 75 . Completion magnetic resonance ( MR ) procedure screen form clearance MR technologist patient pacemaker , brain aneurysm clip , inner ear implant , neurostimulator metal fragment eye . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants know BRCA 1 2 mutation . Participants know LiFraumeni Cowden 's Disease . Participants prior mantle radiation . Participants locally advance breast cancer inflammatory breast cancer cancer grossly involve skin . Participants pregnant . Participants enroll preoperative therapy trial treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The neoadjuvant chemotherapy result complete pathologic response , result signal MRI . Participants know , active collagen vascular disease . Participants undergo breast surgery outside institution . Participants prior history breast carcinoma . Patients implant type breast reconstruction . Patients biopsy confirm multicentric disease . Participants document contraindication MRI . Participants document allergic reaction IV MRI contrast agent , contraindication administration IV contrast renal failure . Patients diabetes exclude high risk incur renal damage IV contrast . Participants exceed weight limit surgical table AMIGO , 350 lbs fit 70 cm diameter bore MRI scanner AMIGO 60 cm diameter bore preprocedure image MRI scanner .</criteria>
