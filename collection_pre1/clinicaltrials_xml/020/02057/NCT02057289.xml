	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine pharmacokinetics ( process drug absorb , distribute , metabolize , eliminate body ) micafungin give 5mg/kg dose immunocompromised child anti-fungal prophylaxis . These child high risk develop invasive fungal disease due compromise immunity associate variable degree duration neutropenia . Currently , child receive micafungin give daily alternate day dose . The investigator give ONE TIME dose micafungin draw PK level 96 hour post-infusion . The investigator goal obtain comparable micafungin drug concentration end 96 hour ( 4 day ) compare low dose every 24 hour dosing . The investigator dose proposal likely effective prophylaxis immunocompromised patient would broaden applicability large population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study Pediatric Micafungin Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disseminated fungal infection major cause morbidity mortality immunocompromised child . Many drug use fungal prophylaxis associate renal hepatic toxicity . Also , breakthrough infection report use oral agent due poor oral absorption . An alternative approach use intravenous micafungin fungal prophylaxis . Micafungin distinct advantage due good safety profile , specifically term hepatic renal toxicity . Currently , child receive micafungin give daily alternate day dose ( base last Pk study , Mehta et al 2010 ) . The investigator objective examine pharmacokinetics micafungin give less frequent schedule . The investigator hypothesize single dose micafungin ( 5mg/kg ) every 4 day provide drug exposure equivalent daily dosing ( 1mg/kg ) reduce administration cost improve patient convenience ( essentially twice week dose regimen ) . Both animal adult data support use approach . Fifteen patient enrol study give SINGLE DOSE micafungin antifungal prophylaxis ( 5 mg/kg ) . Blood sample draw pharmacokinetic measurement administration micafungin . Plasma concentration data analyze compartmental non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis . The data also analyzed population pharmacokinetic approach .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients risk fungal infection require prophylaxis . Example : patient undergo blood marrow transplant , immunodeficiency patient , patient aplastic anemia . Age &gt; = 6 month &lt; = 10 year ( time enrollment ) . Patients adequate organ function ( document within 2 week prior start micafungin ) : Creatinine &lt; 2 time upper limit normal Total bilirubin AST &lt; 3 time upper limit normal Patients history past evidence active fungal disease ( either radiological study biopsy proven ) treat presumed fungal infection . Patients history allergy micafungin echinocandin preparation , Caspofungin Anidulafungin . Patients receive micafungin echinocandin preparation previous two week . Patients receive antifungal prophylaxis Fluconazole time enrollment . This due fact transplant , Fluconazole usually switch agent well coverage . This avoid possibility reduce effective antifungal coverage purpose study . Failure sign inform consent , inability undergo inform consent process . It medically advisable obtain specimen necessary study .</criteria>
