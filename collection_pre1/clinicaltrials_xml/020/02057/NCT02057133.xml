	<criteria>Have diagnosis hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative metastatic breast cancer Parts A E , G. For Part A ( LY2835219 + letrozole ) : Except ongoing therapy letrozole , participant must receive prior systemic endocrine therapy metastatic disease . For Part B ( LY2835219 + anastrozole ) : Except ongoing therapy anastrozole , participant must receive prior systemic endocrine therapy metastatic disease . For Part C ( LY2835219 + tamoxifen ) : The participant may receive prior systemic endocrine therapy metastatic disease may receive ongoing therapy tamoxifen . For Part D ( LY2835219 + exemestane ) : The participant must receive prior systemic endocrine therapy least one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole ) metastatic disease may receive ongoing therapy exemestane . For Part E ( LY2835219 + exemestane + everolimus ) : The participant must receive prior systemic endocrine therapy least one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole ) metastatic disease may receive ongoing therapy either exemestane exemestane + everolimus . Have diagnosis HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer Part F. For Part F ( LY2835219 + trastuzumab ) : The participant must receive least 1 chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease may receive ongoing therapy trastuzumab . The participant must estimate leave ventricular ejection fraction within normal range either echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan For Part G ( abemaciclib + LY3023414 + fulvestrant ) : The participant may receive prior systemic endocrine therapy least one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole ) metastatic disease . For Parts A , B , C , D , E , F : Have either measureable disease nonmeasureable evaluable bone disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) For Part G : Have measureable disease define RECIST 1.1 . For Parts except Part F : Participants must either postmenopausal status premenopausal status continue begin ovarian suppression luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist goserelin . Have adequate organ function , include : Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 10^9/liter ( L ) , platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin ≥ 8 gram/deciliter ( g/dL ) . Hepatic : Bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 time ULN . Renal : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN . Have performance status ≤1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Have discontinue previous therapy breast cancer ( include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational therapy ) , except ongoing correspond combination therapy , least 21 day myelosuppressive agent 14 day nonmyelosuppressive agent prior receive study drug ( ) , recover acute effect therapy ( toxicity resolve either baseline least Grade 1 ) except residual alopecia peripheral neuropathy . For Part F : concurrent treatment trastuzumab emtansine ( TDM1 ) allow . Have metastatic breast cancer severe organ dysfunction assess symptom sign , laboratory study , rapid progression disease . Have brain metastasis without prior radiotherapy . For Parts A , B , C , D , E G : Have receive prior systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease . However , participant may receive prior systemic chemotherapy neoadjuvant adjuvant setting . Have serious preexist medical condition , judgment investigator , would preclude participation study ( example , history major surgical resection involve stomach small bowel ) . Have central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis either radiotherapy development neurological change ≤14 day prior receive study treatment . Participants may receive stable dose corticosteroid . Screening asymptomatic participant without history CNS metastasis require . For Part F Cardiac disease include myocardial infarction within 6 month , unstable angina , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great functional impairment .
