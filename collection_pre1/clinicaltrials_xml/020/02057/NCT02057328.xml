	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION We intend study effect telmisartan , new angiotensin-II receptor blocker nebivolol , cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker 24-h ambulatory blood pressure value subject stage I arterial hypertension total time period 12 month . At time , study effect treatment mention antihypertensive drug grade arterial stiffness hypertensive subject carry . The purpose project determine whether expect decrease arterial stiffness subject stage I arterial hypertension attribute blood pressure fall solely , factor , well . These factor possibly dependent action drug renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) peripheral vasodilatory action . The objective study observe compare , time period 12 month , performance two antihypertensive different drug category , telmisartan nebivolol , treatment patient stage I arterial hypertension improvement arterial stiffness . It observational study accord ESH ( European Society Hypertension ) guideline treatment patient arterial hypertension . METHODS Study population The study go applied subject attend Hypertension-ABPM Clinic 3rd department Internal Medicine Papageorgiou University Hospital . All individual enrol study give write consent participation . Healthy volunteer age 18 65 year diagnose stage I arterial hypertension ( 24h SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg ) select . All case regard initial diagnosis arterial hypertension , participant study receive previously receive antihypertensive medication . At attendance , individual body weight light clothing without shoe go record BMI ( body mass index ) go calculate ratio `` body weight ( kg ) / [ height ( cm ) ] 2 `` . Waist hip circumference also measure cm . Participants study divide three category accord BMI : Normal weight ( BMI 18,5 24,9 ) , overweight ( BMI 25 29,9 ) obese ( BMI 30 ) . Detailed case-history family history , smoke habit alcohol use record individual . A series laboratory examination execute : Hct , serum glucose , fast serum total cholesterol , HDL , LDL triglycerides , plasma urea , creatinine , uric acid , sodium , potassium . All participant study go patient initially instruct three-month lifestyle modification , accord ESH guideline . Recommended intervention include cessation smoking , physical exercise 3-4 hour per week , exclusion polyunsaturated fatty acid diet , high contamination natural fiber , reduction add salt minimum , aim reduce blood pressure normal . Patients present stage I arterial hypertension ( 24h SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg ) end three-month period lifestyle modification enter study undergo PWV-measurement , accord method describe . The final selection sample 80 patient diagnosed stage I arterial hypertension base ABPM result ( 24h SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg ) . Patients present normal ABPM value end 3-month period exclude study . Subjects diagnose white-coat hypertension [ increase office BP value ( SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg ) combine normal ABPM value ( 24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg ) ] also exclude study . Exclusion criterion : All subject contra-indications submission drug use research protocol go exclude study . The following category patient participate research : renal failure , hepatic failure , renal artery stenosis , bronchial asthma , vasoconstrictive ( Prinzmetal 's ) angina , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , aortic valve stenosis , mitral valve stenosis , sinus tachycardia , sinus bradycardia , sick sinus syndrome , Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome , chronic atrial fibrillation , second third degree atrioventricular block , right heart failure due pulmonary hypertension , pheochromocytoma , peripheral artery disease . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study ( history pregnancy test ) . At begin Phase I ( time 0 ) , patient randomize two group , accord antihypertensive medication go receive . The first group receive telmisartan , whereas second group patient instruct receive nebivolol . In telmisartan group , patient receive 40 mg telmisartan daily morning . Patients group nebivolol take 5 mg nebivolol daily morning . The aim study phase normalization BP participant ( 24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg ) . At end first month treatment , participant undergo 24h ABPM arterial stiffness measurement . Patients classify normal BP range base result ABPM ( 24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg ) continue medication scheme . For patient still classify stage I hypertensive range , treatment modulate follow : telmisartan group go receive 80 mg telmisartan daily morning , nebivolol group receive 10 mg nebivolol daily morning ( begin Phase II - time 1 month ) . The procedure ( 24h ABPM arterial stiffness measurement ) repeat end 6th month begin study . Patients classify normal BP range base result ABPM ( 24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg ) continue medication scheme . For patient still classify stage I hypertensive range , treatment modulate follow : 12,5 mg hydrochlorothiazide add medication scheme group . The telmisartan group start receive combination scheme telmisartan/HCTZ 80/12,5 mg morning dose , whereas nebivolol group start combination scheme nebivolol/HCTZ 10/12,5 mg morning dose . This point indicate begin phase III study ( time 6 month ) . When 12 month begin study complete , patient group undergo 24h ABPM arterial stiffness measurement . The end 12-month period begin study ( end Phase III ) indicate completion project . Analysis measurement method 24-h ABPM 24-h ABPM perform participant typical working day . All subject instruct follow usual program daily activity . The measurement device Spacelabs 90217 ( Spacelabs Inc. , Redmond , Wash. ) use . A cuff appropriate diameter adapt around non-dominant arm subject three BP measurement take place . A simultaneous measurement use sphygmomanometric device take , order make sure mean difference BP value two method ≥ 5 mm Hg . All participant maintain normal activity 08:00 22:00 , arm still loose measurement . One measurement take place every 15 minute 06:00 00:00 , every 30 minute 00:00 06:00 . Participants avoid intense physical exercise sleep daytime , instruct rest 00:00 06:00 rise bed 06:00 , even awaken time . Arterial stiffness measurement The measurement grade arterial stiffness participant take place phase study quiet examination room stable temperature ( 21ºC ) low light . Subjects instruct lie examination room 15 minute begin procedure . Also , avoid food , caffeine cigarette smoking three hour , alcohol use ten hour measurement . The method measurement carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , accord European Expert Consensus Arterial Stiffness , use define grade arterial stiffness . The velocity pulse wave ( PWV ) calculate equation PWV= D ( ) / ( ) , ( ) represent time need transmission arterial pulse wave across distance , ( D ) represent distance measurement point . ( D ) directly measure use measurement tape , whereas ( ) give Complior System ( Colson , Les Lilas , France ) . It quantify time space transmission pulse carotid radial femoral artery formation two waveform , respectively . The two waveform simultaneously record right common carotid artery right femoral artery ( 'foot foot ' method ) via mechanic sensor put body surface direct contact skin . Participants stay supine position avoid talk sleeping recording . All measurement execute observer . A second measurement PWV carry 15 minute first one . The two recording identically carry .</detailed_description>
