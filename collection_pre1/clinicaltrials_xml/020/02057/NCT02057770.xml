	<brief_summary>The purpose research study look overall health status acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) respond stem cell transplant follow cyclophosphamide . Some participant enrol study may receive transplant sibling , may receive transplant match unrelated donor , may receive call haploidentical transplant . A haploidentical stem cell transplant type transplant occur person need transplant find donor exactly match tissue type ( either among family member match unrelated donor ) . When match donor available , half-matched relate ( haploidentical ) donor may use . Haploidentical donor first degree relative sibling , child , parent . People undergo stem cell transplant experience complication rejection stem cell transplant severe graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD occur cell donor attack recipient 's tissue , result mild , moderate , even life-threatening side effect recipient 's skin , stomach , intestine , liver . However , recent research show receive cyclophosphamide stem cell transplant improve outcome transplant , purpose study .</brief_summary>
