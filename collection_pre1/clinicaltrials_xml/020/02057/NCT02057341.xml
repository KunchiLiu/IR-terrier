	<criteria>Key Patients idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy stable New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IIIa congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Stable , guidelinesbased medical device therapy , without CHF hospitalization change heart failure drug dose ≥ 50 % reduction dose ≥ 100 % increase dose past 3 month . Left ventricular ( LV ) end diastolic diameter transthoracic echocardiography &gt; 3.3 cm/m2 ( female ) 3.4 cm/m2 ( male ) and/or LV ejection fraction ≤ 45 % . Gene positive pathogenic mutation LMNA gene , determine CLIAcertified clinical laboratory ( mutation include limited : splicesite , nonsense , deletion mutation , missense mutation highly conserve codon , missense mutation involve major charge change , missense mutation previously associate genetic dilate cardiomyopathy ) . Within 3 week prior first dose study drug , complete distance six minute walk test ≥ 100 ≤ 350 AND/OR ≥ 100 ≤ 450 AND ≤ 60 % predict distance AND patient symptomatic dilate cardiomyopathy per Investigator judgment . On day day first dose study drug , complete distance six minute walk test ≥ 100 ≤ 400 ( great value within 10 % less value ) AND/OR ≥ 100 ≤ 475 ( great value within 10 % less value ) AND patient symptomatic dilate cardiomyopathy per Investigator judgment . Acceptable hematology , hepatic renal function laboratory value within 3 week prior first dose study drug . Additional criterion exist . Key Unstable clinical cardiac symptom require unscheduled hospitalization within 60 day prior study start . Clinically significant coronary artery disease , per Investigator judgment . Currently receive continuous intravenous ( IV ) inotrope infusion , presence ventricular assist device , history prior heart transplantation . Any follow within 60 day prior study start : Myocardial infarction , cardiac surgical procedure , acute coronary syndrome , hemodynamically destabilizing cardiac arrhythmia , serious systemic infection evidence septicemia , major surgical procedure require general anesthesia . Uncorrected , hemodynamically significant primary valvular disease . Initiation cardiac resynchronization therapy within 180 day prior study start . Likelihood , Investigator 's opinion , undergo cardiac transplantation , leave ventricular assist device device implantation , cardiac surgery within next 6 month ; require continuous IV inotropic treatment , referral hospice endoflife treatment . Active malignancy ( except surgicallycurative basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , cervical carcinoma ) . Receiving chronic immunosuppressant therapy . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Participation investigational study drug device within 30 day prior study start . Additional criterion exist .</criteria>
