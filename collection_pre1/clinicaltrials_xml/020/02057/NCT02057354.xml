	<brief_summary>The investigator examine effect exercise cardiovascular fitness cognitive process , brain function , amount several protein blood . These protein include hormone call cortisol , also know `` stress hormone , '' growth factor call `` brain-derived neurotrophic factor '' ( BDNF ) . The `` stress hormone '' cortisol produce adrenal gland . Stress , exercise , obesity , factor may influence cortisol level . BDNF protein promote health nerve cell brain body . It play role growth , maturation , maintenance cell . The amount protein blood sample therefore indicator healthy nerve cell function . Here , investigator investigate exercise improve brain function change BDNF level . Participation research study take approximately 4 month . During time , participant make four initial study visit . The first visit inform consent screening , second third visit baseline fitness testing , fourth visit blood draw , cognitive testing , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) exam . Functional MRI brain imaging technique use magnetic field `` take picture '' brain person performs give task . It take approximately three week complete initial four study visit . Following four initial study visit , exercise-training program begin . Participants randomize one two training program : aerobic exercise program non-aerobic exercise program consist strengthen , balance stretching exercise . The exercise training program last 12 week . There three one-hour exercise session per week . After completion exercise-training program , participant attend three follow-up study visit . The first two follow-up visit fitness testing . The third final follow-up visit blood draw , cognitive testing , MRI exam .</brief_summary>
