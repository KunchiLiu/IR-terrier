	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe 2 year progression-free survival men recurrent PSA-only disease prostatectomy receive combine enzalutamide standard androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) salvage radiation therapy . Eligible men recurrent PSA-only prostate cancer within 4 year prostatectomy , PSA 0.2 - 4 absence metastatic disease CT bone scan . In addition standard ADT radiation therapy , research participant take enzalutamide daily six month . It primarily hypothesize 2 year PFS rate improve combined therapy compare historical control data similar patient set .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis prostate adenocarcinoma . Variants prostate cancer , include neuroendocrine feature small cell carcinoma prostate , permit . Gleason sum 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 time prostatectomy . PSA relapse within 4 year prostatectomy define persistently detectable rise PSA surgery . Evidence disease recurrence progression evidence PSA &gt; 0.20 . This require 2 consecutive rise PSA , least 1 week apart , postprostatectomy nadir one PSA value 0.20 ng/mL patient fail achieve postprostatectomy nadir &lt; 0.2 ng/mL . Age ≥ 18 year Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 Adequate laboratory parameter Adequate bone marrow function : ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9g/dL AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x Institutional Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x Institutional ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Institutional ULN 24hour clearance ≥ 50 mL/min A minimum 4 week major surgery prior registration . Ability swallow , retain , absorb oral medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Must use condom sex pregnant woman . Male patient female partner childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable method birth control ( one must include condom barrier method contraception ) start screen continue throughout study period 3 month final study drug administration . Radiographic evidence metastatic disease . Patients nodepositive disease ( &lt; 2 positive node ) time radical prostatectomy eligible . Patients pelvic node 2 cm short axis time screen eligible . Patients enlarge lymph node retroperitoneum aortic bifurcation pelvic node ≥ 2 cm must exclude . PSA &gt; 4.0 ng/mL . Testosterone level ≤ 100 ng/dL . More 1 month prior hormone exposure hormone exposure within 30 day registration . Prior enzalutamide , ketoconazole , abiraterone , TAK700 prohibit . Prior 5α reductase inhibitor allow . Prior immunotherapy include sipuleucelT . Prior systemic chemotherapy ( docetaxel , cabazitaxel , estramustine , cytotoxic agent ) History solid organ stem cell transplantation . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke , prior head traumatic brain injury loss consciousness , prior current spaceoccupying lesion brain ) . Also , history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month Day 1 visit . Known suspected brain metastasis active leptomeningeal disease . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g. , active uncontrolled infection ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption enzalutamide increase risk radiation ( e.g. , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , prior small bowel resection , inflammatory bowel disease ) . Patients receive prior prostate pelvic radiotherapy , include external beam brachytherapy . Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy prior registration . Patients unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator .</criteria>
