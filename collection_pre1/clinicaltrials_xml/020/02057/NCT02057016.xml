	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate sustain clinical remission ( definition see ) patient inflammatory bowel disease receive long-term ( &gt; 2 year ) schedule treatment infliximab . Secondary objective include : - identify predictor sustain clinical remission long-term infliximab schedule treatment - identify predictor loose response infliximab schedule maintenance treatment - identify predictor maintain clinical remission patient discontinue infliximab long-lasting steroid-free clinical remission - evaluate percentage surgery treatment ( total follow-up ) - evaluate safety long-term infliximab schedule treatment List clinical hypothesis Infliximab indicate recommended moderate severe inflammatory bowel disease patient tolerate responsive conventional therapy . Most randomized clinical trial use infliximab inflammatory bowel disease limit 52 week data come observational study result prolong ( one year ) treatment infliximab . No validated predictor sustain clinical remission loss response available far . Moreover , data available hypothetical reduction IBD relate surgery `` biological era '' . In proposal suggest follow hypothesis : - infliximab schedule treatment may efficacious maintain long-term clinical remission ; - among clinical , laboratory endoscopic data predictor sustain clinical remission infliximab long-term scheduled treatment may find ; - among clinical , laboratory endoscopic data predictor loss response infliximab long-term schedule treatment may find ; - among clinical , laboratory endoscopic data predictor sustain clinical remission infliximab discontinuation long-lasting ( &gt; 6 month ) steroid-free clinical remission may find ; - maintenance remission infliximab may reduce rate surgery time ; - long-term scheduled treatment infliximab may safe well tolerate . Results study may really help clinician make practical decision particular clinical setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Scheduled Therapy With Infliximab Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This retrospective observational `` real life '' single-centre study . Materials method : Medical record IBD patient continue maintenance treatment infliximab clinical remission one year schedule therapy ( standard induction maintenance dose ) consider eligible study . Demographic , clinical , laboratory endoscopic data adverse event report database . In particular , data available patient concern : - age , - sex , - smoker status , - Montreal classification , - disease duration , - activity disease , - previous surgery , - concomitant arthritis , - concomitant corticosteroid , - previous concomitant immunosuppressive , - eventual infliximab dose escalation , - total number infliximab infusion , - reason eventual infliximab discontinuation , - time infliximab therapy , - total follow-up since first infliximab infusion , - IBD related surgery , - endoscopic data within first year beyond infliximab discontinuation time , - laboratory data ( C-reactive protein hemoglobin level ) , - adverse event . Clinical remission evaluate use Harvey-Bradshaw Index ( HBI ) Crohn 's patient ( HBI ≤ 4 ) partial Mayo score UC patient ( &lt; 2 rectal bleed subscore = 0 ) . Sustained clinical remission define HBI ≤ 4 partial Mayo score &lt; 2 ( rectal bleeding = 0 ) 54 week baseline . At baseline study patient already receive one year infliximab schedule treatment clinical remission ( define ) . Primary endpoint evaluate week 54 baseline ( 2 overall year treatment ) every year follow-up . Secondary endpoint evaluate consider available data end follow-up . Number patient : 232 IBD ( 131 CD , 101 UC ) Procedures : All IBD patient treat least one year infliximab active luminal Crohn 's disease active ulcerative colitis include study . Infliximab administration do accord SPC . Due retrospective observational pattern study , clinical management patient depend practice IBD unit . In particular , patient clinically evaluate visit every infusion infliximab . Also laboratory test periodically repeat ( every two month ) . No therapeutic change make consideration present study . The indication start infliximab treatment correspond report international guideline . This study conduct accordance ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki consistent International Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice ( ICH GCP ) , Good Epidemiological Practices ( GEP ) applicable regulatory requirement take account observational , non-interventional trial . Statistical analysis : Data describe use median interquartile range ( IQR ) continuous data percentage discrete data . Kaplan-Maier survival curve perform reveal variable may influence primary secondary endpoint . To compare hazard rate population define one variate time , Cox proportional hazard analysis , , perform aim identify predictor maintenance remission IFX treatment IFX discontinuation , predictor loss response schedule maintenance therapy IFX . Principal variable use statistical evaluation include : sex , age diagnosis , disease duration , smoke status , previous surgery , disease location , disease extension , concomitant arthritis , endoscopic activity ( mucosal healing ) , CRP hemoglobin level , previous immunomodulators , concomitant immunomodulators , need dose escalation .</detailed_description>
