	<brief_summary>We aim evaluate whether addition Omega-3 fatty acid oxybutynin , standard first-line treatment overactive bladder syndrome , improve symptom quality life . Secondarily , evaluate whether Omega-3 fatty acid help reduce adverse effect oxybutynin . Hypothesis - Primary : Omega-3 enhance beneficial role oxybutynin treatment overactive bladder ( OAB ) - Secondary : Omega-3 reduce side effect dry eye constipation associate oxybutynin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxybutynin Omega-3 OAB ( Overactive Bladder )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) trouble condition affect 17 million people U.S. estimate prevalence 16.9 % among woman . The cost burden nationally estimate $ 66 billion 2007 . The morbidity disease impact quality life score increase risk fall fracture . First-line therapeutic modality OAB focus anticholinergic medication behavioral modification . However , indirect impact medication gut salivary gland , trouble . Resultant side effect profile anticholinergic medication cause high rate cessation , study show low 14 % patient still take medication one-year follow . Given burden morbidity associate highly prevalent condition among woman , aim improve therapeutic option , possibly reduce subsequent side effect . As , potential revolutionize treatment condition . Omega-3 fatty acid evaluate success treat many medical condition . Specifically , diseases inflammatory component , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , rheumatoid arthritis see promise improvement addition Omega-3 fatty acid . Other study show beneficial role treatment dry eye , depression , burn injury , even cancer . Although previously explore set irritative bladder condition , believe Omega-3 fatty acid may helpful intervention OAB via several purported mechanism . Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) inflammation implicate biochemistry overactive bladder . Reduction PGE2 may paramount reduce symptom overactive bladder . In fact , propose mechanism action success anticholinergic medication , commonly first line treatment OAB , reduction PGE2 . Animal model demonstrate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) use decrease micturition frequency , think result anti-inflammatory process . In human , anti-inflammatory medication show decrease nocturia even cause urinary retention high dos . Omega-3 fatty acid show anti-inflammatory action ability reduce PGE2 . We therefore , reason believe may effective adjunct current therapy improve overactive bladder symptom . Additionally , Omega-3 fatty acid implement treatment dry eye animal study show role increase intestinal motility.Hence , propose Omega-3 fatty acid may help alleviate common side effect dry eye constipation associate common anticholinergic therapy .</detailed_description>
