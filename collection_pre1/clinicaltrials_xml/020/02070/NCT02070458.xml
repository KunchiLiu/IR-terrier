	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ixazomib give combination mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine treat patient acute myeloid leukemia unresponsive initial induction chemotherapy recurs follow initial complete remission . Acute myeloid leukemia cancer bone marrow cell ; bone marrow blood cell normally make . Ixazomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine standard treatment relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia . Giving ixazomib mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine may improve effectiveness chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend Phase 2 dose MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) combination mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine ( MEC ) patient relapsed/ refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe non-dose limit toxicity associate MLN9708 combination MEC patient relapsed/ refractory AML . II . To describe preliminary evidence clinical activity combination ( compete response [ CR ] rate ) relapsed/ refractory AML . III . To determine median cluster differentiation ( CD ) 74 antigen expression patient achieve response versus patient achieve response . IV . To determine gene expression profile pre- post-treatment correlate response therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ixazomib . Patients receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , etoposide IV 1 hour , intermediate-dose cytarabine IV 6 hour day 1-6 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-5 week .</detailed_description>
