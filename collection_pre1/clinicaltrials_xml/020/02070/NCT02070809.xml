	<detailed_description>A wound comprise break epithelial continuity disruption structure function underlie tissue , treat repair always great challenge clinical practice . The complex healing process make wound easy get tendency nonhealing result heavy burden life quality . Nowadays surgical repairing still main method , traditional split-thickness skin graft , flap transplantation tissue-engineered substitute transplantation . However , none method could effective satisfy outcomes . Because none treatment could repair skin structure function . Therefore , new treat technology tissue-engineered skin widely use recently show good response . As consequence , investigator provide quick effective method rebuild complete structure function skin base tissue-engineered skin technology . This method composite skin graft human acellular dermal matrix scaffold investigator use skin basal cell seed cell , moreover finish surgery without culture cell could greatly reduce time . To test efficacy safety new method , investigator propose prospective randomize controlled multicenter trial compare method traditional skin graft . If method could actually increase wound take rate , improve skin quality restore skin function extent , resolve problem wound repair large extent .</detailed_description>
