	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect take ipilimumab gene-modified T cell vaccine therapy treat patient advanced cancer spread area body respond standard therapy . This trial also determine best dose Ipilimumab use combination treatment . T cell special type white blood cell ( immune cell ) ability kill cancer cell . T cell take blood modified laboratory recognize specific protein express cancer cell , call NY-ESO-1 . This may allow T cell target kill cancer cell express protein . Dendritic cell another type blood cell teach cell body look cancer cell attack . Giving dendritic cell vaccine NY-ESO-1 protein may help dendritic cell teach immune system target cancer cell express protein , help T cell attack cancer . Ipilimumab monoclonal antibody , type drug manufacture laboratory similar antibody make human body fight infection . Ipilimumab block protein turn immune system , block protein may make immune system active . This may increase ability immune cell kill cancer cell improve effectiveness T cell transplant . Giving gene-modified T-cells , dendritic cell vaccine , ipilimumab together may teach immune system recognize kill cancer cell NY-ESO-1 protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The safety NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor ( TCR ) transgenic adoptive cell transfer ( ACT ) report . The current protocol include addition cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA4 ) block monoclonal antibody ipilimumab NY ESO TCR ACT dose escalation scheme two study cohort 1 3 mg/kg ipilimumab intravenous ( i.v . ) every three week maximum 4 dos ( q3wx4 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility deliver TCR transgenic cell dose CTLA blockade patient . II . To determine persistence NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) serial peripheral blood sample biopsy accessible metastatic lesion . III . To explore use positron emission tomography ( PET ) -based image use PET tracer [ 18F ] fluorodeoxy-glucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) goal determine adoptively transfer NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered PBMC administer ipilimumab home expand secondary lymphoid organ tumor deposit . IV . Clinical antitumor activity record objective response rate exploratory endpoint pilot clinical trial . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab . CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -5 -4 fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute daily day -4 -1 . NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC INFUSION : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduce autologous T cell IV day 0 . IPILIMUMAB ADMINISTRATION : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC infusion day 0 infusion day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) PEPTIDE PULSED DENDRITIC CELL ( DC ) ADMINISTRATION : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) peptide pulse DC vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 14 , 30 . LOW DOSE INTERLEUKIN-2 ( IL-2 ) ADMINISTRATION : Patients receive aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 90 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
