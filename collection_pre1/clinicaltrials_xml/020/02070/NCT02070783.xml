	<brief_summary>Studies hormone Erythropoietin ( EPO ) indicate EPO may antidepressant property . However , EPO may cause serious side-effects repeat administration ( thrombosis ) , limit usefulness antidepressant . ARA290 peptide effect EPO blood cell may still effect brain function . In attempt replicate previous finding ( single dose ) EPO healthy volunteer , study effect ARA290 cognitive neural processing emotion healthy volunteer . We hypothesize single dose ARA290 lead positive shift information processing compare placebo , 7 day post-administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Rationale : Studies cognitive neuronal effect single administration Erythropoietin ( EPO ) healthy volunteer depress patient suggest EPO may antidepressant effect . Due haematopoietic effect , EPO may cause serious side-effects repeat administration , limit usefulness antidepressant . ARA290 peptide haematopoietic effect EPO may still neurotrophic effect . Objective : To study effect ARA290 cognitive neural processing emotion healthy volunteer 7 day post-administration . Study design : Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiment . Study population : Male female healthy volunteer , n= 36 ; 18-35 yr old . Intervention : One group receive single dose 2 mg ARA290 , group receive placebo . Main study parameters/endpoints : 1 . Behavioral study : Performance Emotional Test battery ( ETB ) show sensitive antidepressant administration healthy volunteer . The ETB include measure facial expression recognition , emotional memory attentional vigilance . 2 . Neuroimaging study : Neural processing emotion , particular amygdala , hippocampal VMPFC response view facial stimulus express negative versus positive emotion . Nature extent burden risk benefit associate participation : Risks : No adverse event associate administration single dose 70 -2000 μg ARA290 among 36 individual , exception one individual ( undisclosed significant prior history fainting ) faint shortly intravenous dose administration 700 μg ARA290 recover without medical intervention . Fourteen individual participate multiple dosing study serious adverse effect . Single dose ARA290 patient renal impairment raise safety signal . Burden : Minimal . Emotional information process test battery , burden comparable play computer game . fMRI measurement . Benefits : Probably none . Possibly transient small improvement mood state . Financial compensation participating .</detailed_description>
