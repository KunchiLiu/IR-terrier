	<brief_summary>During type heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) use . CPB enable blood direct away heart lung pump body heart beating . Surgery heart easier beat bloodless area . Generally CPB lung need ventilate , blood flow lung body receive oxygen machine ( oxygenator ) attach CPB pump . In study investigate difference lung collapse heart surgery patient lung ventilate CPB , compare patient lung ventilate CPB . We use lung ultrasound scan determine degree lung collapse various time period heart surgery . We also investigate ventilation CPB affect : . ) rate lung infection pneumonia operation b . ) time take patient breathe tube remove intensive care unit operation c. ) time patient discharge home hospital d. ) concentration oxygen blood operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventilation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB ) Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Hypothesis : To determine continued mechanical ventilation ( low tidal volume ventilation ) cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) adult patient undergo elective cardiac surgery reduce degree pulmonary atelectasis post-operatively , compare control ventilate CPB . The degree pulmonary atelectasis assess quantified use non-invasive lung ultrasound ( LUS ) image . We conduct preliminary observational study ( pilot study ) ass feasibility study . The pilot conduct 40 patient , non-ventilated CPB . The specific feasibility question would like determine : 1 ) degree atelectasis demonstrate LUS patient ventilate CPB , 2 ) time need complete LUS operating room ( OR ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) whether efficient possible give busy operate room schedule , 3 ) help determine optimal time scan patient show maximal degree atelectasis , 4 ) help estimate number patient need show difference atelectasis definitive study . Primary hypothesis : low tidal volume ventilation CPB adult cardiac surgery reduce amount pulmonary atelectasis compare control ventilate CPB . Background : Respiratory dysfunction cardiac surgery relatively common , incidence anywhere 2- 25 % quoted literature . Pulmonary complication significant factor morbidity mortality post-surgical patient , therefore burden healthcare resource . ( 1 ) The etiology post CPB pulmonary dysfunction multi-factorial , include CPB-induced systemic inflammatory response , hypothermia , surgery , anesthesia , ventilation transfusion . ( 2-3 ) Modifications above-mentioned factor , amongst others , may lead good lung function postoperatively . Strategies include reduce CPB time , minimize extracorporeal surface area use miniaturize circuit . The partial restoration pulmonary artery perfusion CPB possibly contribute prevent pulmonary ischemia lung dysfunction . The use ultrafiltration scavenge pro-inflammatory factor may protective lung function . ( 4 ) Similarly , use corticosteroid leukocyte depletion filter may protective . ( 5-6 ) Reducing use cardiotomy suction device , well contact-time free blood pericardium , may prove beneficial . The evidence outcome benefit intervention , however , weak . ( 3-7 ) In standard care , lung unventilated deflated blood circulation shunt away pulmonary vasculature CPB . Restoration normal perfusion result release oxygen free radical , cause lipid peroxidation pulmonary endothelial damage ( ischemia-reperfusion injury ) . ( 8-9 ) Continued ventilation CPB experimentally show preserve pulmonary arterial endothelial function . ( 10 ) A significant consequence reperfusion injury dysfunction pulmonary vascular endothelium diminish nitric oxide ( NO ) production , cause secondary vasoconstriction increase vascular permeability . This lead pulmonary hypertension , pulmonary edema hypoxia . ( 10 ) Non-ventilation may result ischemic lung injury . During bypass blood flow pulmonary artery . The vascular hence oxygen supply lung via bronchial circulation . ( 11 ) In experimental porcine bypass model show bronchial artery flow significantly decrease CPB . ( 12-13 ) It hypothesize repetitive inflation deflation lung physiological intra-alveolar pressure necessary normal bronchial arterial flow secondary cyclical compression relaxation vessel . In case , cessation ventilation bypass would reduce bronchial flow predispose ischemic lung injury . ( 13 ) John et al ( 11 ) show randomize study ventilation CPB tidal volumes 5 ml/Kg result significant small extra-vascular lung water ( measure use Pulse Contour Cardiac Output ( PiCCO ) system ) short time-to-extubation . However , evidence clear clinical benefit maintain ventilation CPB inconsistent . Problematic study heterogeneous outcome endpoint small sample size . ( 11 ; 14 ) This study aim investigate continue low volume ventilation CPB would decrease amount pulmonary atelectasis present post-operatively cardiac surgery patient . De-recruitment lung volume occurs period non-ventilation CPB . Atelectasis may lead pulmonary complication post-operatively , address perioperative period active lung recruitment physiotherapy . Low-volume ventilation apply easily safely patient undergo CPB without hamper surgical progress . Lung ultrasound ( LUS ) use grade pulmonary atelectasis present various point time ( pre-operatively post-operative course ) . LUS non-invasive , easy-to-use , point-of-care investigatory tool . LUS well validate use operating room intensive care unit diagnosis pulmonary pathology . It show accurate plain film chest X-ray determine pulmonary consolidation , well pulmonary pathology . ( 13 ) LUS also show tight correlation previous study pulmonary CT finding . In 2012 first International evidence-based recommendation point-of-care LUS publish . ( 16 ) It become useful widely use modality clinical practice . ( 17-18 ) Several ultrasound study base examination leave low lobe transesophageal echocardiography confirm feasibility assess lung recruitment ( 19-20 ) . Another study show resolution ventilator-associated pneumonia antimicrobial therapy accurately assessed LUS : tight correlation find increase compute tomography ( CT ) lung aeration 7-day antibiotic administration ultrasound re-aeration score base observed change ultrasound pattern ( 21 ) . Therefore , reasonable hypothesize change lung aeration result therapy ( example , ventilation CPB ) detect corresponding change LUS pattern .</detailed_description>
