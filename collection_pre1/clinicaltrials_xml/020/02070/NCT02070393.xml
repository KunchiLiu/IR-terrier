	<brief_title>Breast-Sparing Proton Therapy Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results Program , estimate 8,490 new case Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( HL ) United States 2010 , estimate 1,320 death ( Jemal , Siegel et al. ) . The unadjusted rate 5 year overall survival approximately 95 % , remain among high childhood adult malignancy . With many child young adult survive advanced age , impetus develop less toxic yet equally effective treatment . One main approach take last 25 year minimize long-term treatment toxicity limit amount volume radiation receive patient . This pilot study continue along line , attempt refine delivery radiation therapy ( RT ) order avoid one notorious long-term side-effects : secondary breast cancer . Multiple study investigate late toxicity long-term survivor pediatric Hodgkin 's Lymphoma show risk breast cancer young female receive mediastinal radiation 50 time great age-matched counterpart . The Late Effects Study Group , median follow-up 17 year , report breast cancer incidence 16 % standardized incidence ratio 55.5 ( Bhatia , Yasui et al . 2003 ) . Through utilization breast-sparing proton therapy , hope provide young female patient benefit radiation therapy decrease risk secondary breast cancer , thus increase therapeutic ratio . In prior computer-based , in-silico , dose planning study , utilize basic beam orientation ( single PA beam ) , show dose breast tissue reduce minimum least 80 % proton treatment compare standard AP-PA photon treatment ( publication ) . Furthermore , dose clinical target volume maintain , dose normal structure statistically bad . We aim validate finding verify beam range , in-vivo , via post-treatment combine Positron Emission Tomography-Computer Tomography ( PET-CT ) image young female undergo supra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy Hodgkin 's Disease .</detailed_description>
