	<brief_title>Dietary Correlates Maximal Capacity Fat Oxidation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The capacity oxidize ( burn ) fat fuel exercise may important implication health performance . For example , increase fat oxidation could help induce negative fat balance time improve body composition . Furthermore , increase oxidation fat could spare carbohydrate utilization exercise improve endurance performance preserve body limit carbohydrate reserve latter stage competition . Interestingly , substantial individual variation balance fuel use energy exercise particular maximal capacity oxidize fat ( MFO ) . Whilst habitual diet know affect metabolic response exercise , influence nutrition individual variability observe maximal fat oxidation comprehensively study . Therefore , propose investigation aim build current understand various nutritional factor influence MFO exercise . Based previous small intervention study , suspect energy balance macronutrient content distribution may exert strong influence MFO exercise . Specifically , main hypothesis would negative energy balance ; high fat intake and/or low carbohydrate intake would strongest positive influencer 's MFO . Nonetheless , determination array habitual acute nutrient intake data relatively large cohort healthy individual enable insight influence comprehensive array nutrient MFO exercise . With great understanding nutritional factor influence MFO exercise , new nutritional intervention design promote oxidation fat improve health performance .</detailed_description>
