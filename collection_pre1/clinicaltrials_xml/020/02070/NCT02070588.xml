	<brief_summary>This feasibility study conduct determine potential association broad range clinical neurological symptom magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) , data , clinical finding involve mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . These association examine acute sub-acute period ( approximately 3 month ) follow injury provide information useful optimization MR pulse sequence mTBI application . Correlations exist sub-acute period clinical neurological MR data ( image , image read , RAW data ) , may indicate temporal evolution pattern . The intent study broadly generate potential biomarkers temporal evolution mTBI detectable MR image data ( `` MR mTBI biomarkers '' ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This hypothesis-generating feasibility study conduct determine potential association broad range clinical neurological symptom MR image , data , clinical finding involve mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . These association examine acute sub-acute period ( approximately 3 month ) follow injury provide information useful optimization MR pulse sequence mTBI application . The intent study broadly generate range potential mTBI biomarkers detectable use investigational MR pulse sequence technology . Feasibility data attain study may use engineering program decision-making support future scientific assessment , engineering development , publish research databases registry mTBI data image , purpose determine Sponsor . The result study intend use regulatory submission . Subjects examine commercially available MR scanner use investigational standard care MR coil series investigational MR Pulse Sequence set ( Application Packs ) . Each Application Pack consist predetermine sequence investigational pulse sequence ( IPSs ) optimize GE Healthcare ( GEHC ) mTBI . IPSs administer predetermine order part Application Pack .</detailed_description>
