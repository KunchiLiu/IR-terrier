	<brief_summary>Spinal anesthesia still regional anesthesia technique widely employ everyday clinical practice . The feared common well known side effect consist abrupt reduction systemic vascular resistance , consequence risk systemic hypotension . To prevent potentially severe complication , adequate correction patient ' volume status preventive administration fluid widely use . However volume repletion commonly accomplish empirical basis , without real insight patient hemodynamic status , carry risk possible volume overload . Aim study test clinical impact two simple , non-invasive method guide volemic repletion spinal anesthesia reduction significant hypotension rate , compare empirical fluid administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The result high density anesthetic block reproducibility technique make spinal anesthesia widely diffuse regional anesthesia technique . Nevertheless procedure still remain regional anesthesia technique burden potentially severe side effect , frequent systemic arterial hypotension . Subarachnoidal administration local anesthetic fact associate motor sensory block , also blockade autonomic nervous system , control peripheral vascular tone . Sympathetic block lead sudden decrease peripheral resistance , consequent significant increase vascular bed relative hypovolemia . Transient hypotensive episode generally well tolerate healthy patient , however may lead major complication patient increase cardiovascular risk . In common clinical practice , usual administer fluid empirically . An empirical preventive fluid repletion however represent per se risk patient impaired cardiac renal function , since volume overload heart chamber reduce compliance cause pulmonary edema congestive heart failure . Since ten year non-invasive invasive technique develop , specific purpose optimize fluid status rational basis . This method base correlation level mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) cardiac output ( CO ) , accord equation : MAP = CO * SVR . The latter explains , case vasodilation , unless CO increase , lower SVR inevitably translate decrease MAP . Determinants blood pressure : 1. volemic status ; 2. vascular resistance ( determine control sympathetic system ) ; 3. cardiac output . In case spinal anesthesia reduction SVR determine relative hypovolemia ( due increase total vascular bed ) . For reason spinal anesthesia appear fundamental optimization patient ' volemic status administration fluid ( eventually associate administration amine , order contrast massive vasodilation ) . The use method assess fluid responsiveness extensively study critical patient population . However technique study yet non critical patient . Spinal anesthesia model pharmacological vasodilation often generate significant hypotension , nowadays evidence-based rational treatment base guided volemic repletion still lack . WORKING HYPOTHESIS : The use non-invasive method proven accurate identification patient fluid-responsiveness currently validate patient undergo spinal anesthesia . Ultrasound inferior vena cava effective method determine responsiveness fluid patient mechanical ventilation , however proven inaccurate spontaneous ventilate patient critically ill patient , data available non critical patient . The study inferior vena cava base size inferior vena cava intra-abdominal portion ( approximately 2 cm emergency right atrium ) pattern diameter change breathe . This measurement obtain M-mode ultrasound subcostal view.. Passive leg raise test ( PLRT ) proven highly accurate method predict fluid responsiveness spontaneously breathe patient , population critically ill patient . The method base follow assumption : active leg elevation , addition effect venous pool shift low limbs thorax , exert contemporary effect stimulation peri-arterial sympathetic system iliac-femoral level , cause orthosympathetic reflex increase cardiac output , possibly mask hypovolemia . Passive low limb raise instead advantage mobilize low limb venous blood ( estimate 300-500 ml ) , without activate orthosympathetic reflex . This allow quantification clinical response bolus fluid , term decrease blood pressure variation follow leg raise . The hypothesis investigator want test use two method spinal anesthesia , compare standard method ( empirical fluid administration ) reduce impact systemic hypotension adequate titrate volemic repletion , avoid hypotension fluid overload . The final purpose ensure spinal anesthesia safe possible way . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY : Aim study determine whether vena cava ultrasound PLRT , two bedside , unexpensive , non invasive method , test predictor fluid responsiveness critical patient , effective guiding titrate fluid repletion non critical population , order decrease post procedural significant hypotension rate unnecessary fluid overload patient undergoing spinal anesthesia elective surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
