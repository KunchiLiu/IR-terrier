	<brief_summary>Operations liver , bile duct , gallbladder commonly perform abdominal operation United States . Cholecystectomy , removal gallbladder , common 750,000 perform annually . Injury common bile duct ( CBD ) procedures occur infrequently ( approximately 0.1 % 0.5 % ) , important source patient morbidity . Serious injury often require least one surgical repair , repair variable long-term outcome . Techniques allow visualization bile duct may prevent injury , provide vital information presence gallstone CBD show surgical road map duct . Near-infrared ( NIR ) cholangiography advantage standard cholangiography expose patient healthcare provider radiation . This technique also allow superimposition cholangiogram onto normal image . This study conduct optimize imaging technique call PINPOINT . Images obtain clinically necessary operation . The image evaluate determine best method locate outline anatomy . The information learn guide future use PINPOINT laparoscopic procedure .</brief_summary>
