	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose trametinib treat patient cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced ) without liver ( hepatic ) dysfunction . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block protein need cell growth . When protein block , growth cancer cell may stop cancer cell die . Hepatic dysfunction frequently find patient advanced cancer usually prevent patient receive standard treatment participate clinical trial . Patients may also need dose adjustment absorb drug differently . Trametinib may better treatment patient advance cancer hepatic dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer With Without Hepatic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To provide appropriate dosing recommendation patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction receive trametinib ( mild , moderate severe ) . II . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) trametinib advance cancer patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction . III . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile trametinib advance cancer patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document non-DLTs associate administration trametinib patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction . II . To document antitumor activity associate trametinib treatment patient enrol study . III . To explore characterize predictive biomarkers individual cancer patient utilize genomic sequencing technology . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
