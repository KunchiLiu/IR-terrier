	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy With LUZ11 Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LUZ11 new photosensitizer use photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) solid tumor , head neck cancer . PDT LUZ11 involve intravenous administration LUZ11 follow irradiation target tumor laser light appropriate wavelength . The light cause drug react oxygen , form reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) locally induce tumor cell death damage blood vessel tumor thus prevent receive nutrient . The primary objective study assess tolerability LUZ11 follow single ascend dos LUZ11 . The secondary objective study explore LUZ11 dose anti-tumor effect follow photoactivation determine LUZ11 pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>
