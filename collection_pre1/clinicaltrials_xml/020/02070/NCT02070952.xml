	<brief_title>CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiosurgery Low Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due advance ability detect early stage prostate cancer well , men diagnose disease able cure . Methods prostate cancer treatment include laparoscopic surgery , open surgery remove prostate , receive radiation therapy , brachytherapy ( place high energy x-ray destroy cancer cell ) . Although treatment option potential cure patient , treatment drawback . The healing time follow removal prostate substantial local treatment standard radiation brachytherapy potentially negative long-term effect . The CyberKnife system new type radiation machine use special system precisely focus large dos x-rays tumor . The device design concentrate large dos radiation use robotic image guidance onto tumor specifically injury radiation nearby normal tissue would minimal . The high dos radiation directly tumor would provide short series treatment faster recovery time . The purpose study determine effect CyberKnife radiosurgery patient prostate cancer . The purpose evaluation see treatment help patient low intermediate risk prostate cancer evaluate effect treatment patient ' quality life time . Prior entrance study patient already prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) check prostate biopsy within last 6 month . To include study , result biopsy must show patient prostate cancer . In addition , patient digital rectal exam ( DRE ) determine cancer felt . Based result test examination determine patient 's prostate cancer early stage likely spread outside prostate anywhere else body . If patient agrees study , ask read sign consent form procedure require participation . The patient ask complete short questionnaire CyberKnife treatment . These questionnaire ask multiple choice question patient 's bowel , bladder sexual function . They also ask patient general question mood , activity energy level , general health . The patient also physical examination procedure place 3 5 small gold seed prostate . This procedure commonly do patient receive standard external beam radiation ( type radiation treatment ) prostate cancer experimental procedure . These gold marker use determine location prostate CyberKnife treatment . An ultrasound probe place rectum needle contain gold seed guide prostate seed deposit . The patient need clean rectum take antibiotic day seed placement . Within 5-10 day placement gold seed , patient ask return hospital planning CT scan ( procedure take 3 dimensional image ) pelvis . This regular CT scan standard procedure patient receive external beam irradiation . The image obtain scan use plan CyberKnife treatment . The patient also MRI scan pelvis , unless medically contraindicate ( example pacemaker ) use treatment planning purpose . The patient may ask undergo scan urethral catheter place . The CyberKnife treatment usually start CT scan pelvis . The patient 's course radiation consist 5 separate CyberKnife treatment usually deliver 5 week day ( maximum 14 day ) , less 12 hour two fraction . Each treatment session take approximately 1.5-2.5 hour . The patient lie treatment table breathe normally receive radiation treatment . On last day treatment research team member ask patient question possible side effect . After CyberKnife treatment , patient need follow-up visit determine effective treatment treatment related side effect . One two week treatment complete , member research team call patient see . At 1 month completion CyberKnife treatment , patient ask return hospital follow-up examination check side effect . The patient also ask complete questionnaire complete prior CyberKnife treatment . These questionnaire ask bowel , bladder sexual function , well mood , activity energy level , general health . At 3 6 month completion CyberKnife treatment , patient ask return physician examination blood test measure PSA level . This standard procedure follow-up visit occur every 6 month thereafter 5 year . At visit , patient also ask complete questionnaire bowel , bladder sexual function well quality life . If suspected tumor grow concern disease progression patient 's PSA exam , prostate needle biopsy tumor may perform . Primary Objective : The primary safety goal study estimate , low-risk intermediate-risk cohort , rate acute late grade 3-5 gastrointestinal genitourinary toxicity observe follow CyberKnife SABR prostate cancer . The primary efficacy goal document rate biochemical Disease-Free Survival ( bDFS ) use Phoenix American Society Radiation Oncology ( ASTRO ) definition , 5 year . Secondary Objective : To measure follow study population : rate local failure , distant failure , disease-free survival , disease-specific survival , overall survival ; quality life ( QOL ) generic organ-specific domain .</detailed_description>
