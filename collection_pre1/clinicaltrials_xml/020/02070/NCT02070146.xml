	<brief_summary>Survival colorectal cancer ( CRC ) diagnosis strongly depend local tumor extent , lymph node involvement presence distant metastasis . However , remain great inter-patient variability regard treatment outcome . A combination biochemical factor , histopathological feature , genomic profile , environmental factor clinical factor likely influence prognosis treatment effect , independent tumor stage , still unclear , , extent factor influence tumor recurrence mortality early stage ( I-III ) late stage ( IV ) CRC . Although result prospective clinical trial remain backbone evidence base medicine , concern highly select patient population since large majority ( 85 % -95 % ) cancer patient participate clinical trial various reason . It unlikely trial participation significantly improve near future . This fact follow implication : 1 ) It highly desirable validate result trial general patient population . However , complicate fact documentation patient treat general practice ( i.e . outside scope clinical trial ) largely insufficient provide comparable patient cohort term prognostic characteristic treatment parameter . 2 ) There increase availability novel technology provide molecular marker potential prognostic and/or predictive value . To test clinical value marker large number patient require greatly exceeds number patient consent participate prospective clinical trial . 3 ) result rapid technical development , range new minimally invasive treatment option CRC enter market . These intervention potential great benefit patient term improved local control , high probability complete tumor removal , less damage surround tissue , fast recovery less short long term side effect . Still , intervention prove effectiveness , safety superiority ( non-inferiority ) standard cancer treatment patient level . A prospective observational cohort study great opportunity fill gap .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Data Collection Initiative Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives - To start prospective observational cohort study CRC patient primary diagnosis death . - After obtain Informed Consent , prospectively collect data medical history , serious comorbidities , baseline clinical parameter , image result , pathology result , tumor characteristic , treatment , treatment outcome , hospital stay , intervention grade 3/4 adverse event . - After obtain separate Informed Consent biobanking , store blood tumor tissue material , obtain routine practice , biobank . - The cohort serve infrastructure gear towards efficient , safe comprehensive clinical evaluation new ( image guide ) intervention treatment CRC . Expected outcome - More accurate data treatment clinical patient report outcome CRC daily practice . - A continuous infrastructure large variety research purpose include : A. Prognostic research B . Biological research ( epi ) genetic research C. Studies compare new therapy target population accord cohort multiple randomize controlled trial design . D. Health care policy cost-effectiveness study</detailed_description>
