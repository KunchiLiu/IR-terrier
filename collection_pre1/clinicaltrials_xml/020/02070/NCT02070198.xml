	<brief_summary>Despite progression assist reproductive technology ( ART ) , poor ovarian response control ovarian stimulation remain challenge clinician source distress patient . Multiple strategy try overcome obstacle . The increase gonadotropin administration associate low pregnancy rate . The introduction GnRH agonist protocol , take advantage initial rise endogenous gonadotropin follow agonist administration early follicular phase subsequently prevent premature LH surge , few cycle cancellation , improved cycle parameter increase pregnancy rate . Recently , GnRH antagonists introduce ART treatment . They effective prevent premature LH surge allow natural recruitment follicle follicular phase non suppress ovary . However , randomized study compare efficacy two regimen report conflict nonsignificant result . Moreover , recently adjuvant therapy COH growth hormone therapy pyridostigmine , oral L-arginine , transdermal testosterone fail improve IVF outcome . Recently , new treatment option corifollitropin alfa , able keep circulate FSH level threshold necessary support multi-follicular growth entire week , GnRH antagonist protocol seem potential beneficial effect poor responder . The aim study compare long-acting FSH/GnRH antagonist daily FSH/GnRH antagonist short GnRH agonist protocol IVF outcome poor responder patient .</brief_summary>
