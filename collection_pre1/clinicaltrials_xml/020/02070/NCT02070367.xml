	<brief_summary>This pilot study test new therapy , somatosensory rehabilitation , painful sensitivity experience person nerve injury and/or complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) . Several method measure pain sensitivity emphasize person 's evaluation symptom impact symptom daily activity also test make sure consistent accurate . Previous research suggest one assessment may also use assist identification CRPS : simple test evaluate see accurately identify person disorder ( currently diagnostic test ) . Together , improve treatment CRPS early , accurate diagnosis ability measure important change painful condition , set future study new rehabilitation treatment method .</brief_summary>
