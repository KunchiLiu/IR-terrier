	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose low risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) risk frequent low grade recurrence , usually necessitate surgical intervention general anaesthetic . This multicentre study aim establish short term efficacy chemoresection use chemotherapy within bladder treatment NMIBC . Should level complete response follow chemoresection meet predefined criterion , large phase III trial would develop assess long term disease related endpoint , aim standardise management recurrent low risk NMIBC potentially remove need thousand patient year undergo surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CALIBER phase II , multicentre , randomise clinical trial . CALIBER aim recruit 174 participant ; randomise 2:1 116 patient chemoresection group 58 patient surgical management ( control ) group . Patients assigned chemoresection group receive 4 weekly intravesical instillation 40mg Mitomycin C ( MMC ) outpatient . This treatment deliver via catheter local anaesthetic . Patients assign surgical management group receive standard surgical management use hospital treatment recurrence may include single post-operative installation 40mg MMC within 24 hour . All participant follow 3 week start treatment ( ie time final MMC instillation chemoresection group ) receive cystoscopy three month end treatment ass response , accordance European Association Urology ( EAU ) guideline . Subsequent cystoscopic follow take place 12 month treatment recurrence-free 3 month annually .</detailed_description>
