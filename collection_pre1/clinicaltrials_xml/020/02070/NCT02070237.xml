	<brief_summary>Pregnant recently postpartum woman significantly high risk develop blood clot arm legs know deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) and/or blood clot lung know pulmonary embolism ( PE ) compare non pregnant counterpart . It estimate risk increase anywhere 4 50 time higher pregnant versus non-pregnant woman increase almost 11 fold post partum period . This risk almost double patient undergoes cesarean delivery . In 2011 , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) issue updated guideline state patient undergo cesarean delivery additional risk factor clot thromboembolism , protective ( prophylactic ) treatment low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) type blood thinner consider . However , specific guideline risk factor consider , medication dos use provide . The American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines publish 2012 delineate give prophylaxis base various risk factor , however acknowledge recommendation base weak quality evidence . ACOG endorse either twice day dose high risk patient delivery state adjustment obese woman make case case basis . However , limited study dose LMWH specific subpopulation include post operative patient , pregnant patient obese patient . All study urge investigation correct dose high risk subject due change associate pregnancy level medication blood may put patient high risk venous thromboembolism . Many previous study show woman high risk category achieve protective level medication measure laboratory test ; anti Xa level . The investigator hypothesize due dual risk , obese post-operative recently pregnant woman may adequately protected daily fix dose might need frequent dose protect . The objective study assess proportion woman achieve desire anti Xa level fix daily dose versus twice daily weight base dosing ( 0.5 mg/kg ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Anti-XA Levels Post-Cesarean Patients Undergoing Enoxaparin Thromboprophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , randomize control study compare proportion patient achieve desire effect LMWH ( enoxaparin ) thromboprophylaxis measure peak anti Xa level weight base twice daily dose versus standard fix daily dosing . The investigator hypothesize enoxaparin dose maternal weight administer twice daily , anti-factor Xa level would frequently achieve prophylactic level compare take fixed 40 mg drug daily . Subjects woman BMI &gt; 35 undergone cesarean delivery receive thromboprophylaxis enoxaparin ( Lovenox ) judgment physician . Women eligible consent participate study randomize 1:1 ratio one follow group : Group 1 receive weight base dosing ( 0.5mg/kg BID ) enoxaparin ( Lovenox® ; Aventis Pharmaceuticals ) regimen Group 2 receive fix dose ( 40mg daily ) enoxaparin ( Lovenox® ; Aventis Pharmaceuticals ) regimen . Treatment begin 8 12 hour post operatively regimen continue discharge hospital , usually third fourth day surgery . A single peak anti Xa level drawn 3.5-4 hour third dose medication . The result anti Xa level research purpose guide clinical management . The primary outcome study assess peak anti-factor Xa level blood , whether subject achieve desired prophylactic level receive fix dose enoxaparin compare weight base dosing .</detailed_description>
