	<brief_title>Near Infrared Fluorescence Cholangiography ( NIRF-C ) During Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design determine clinical utility intravenous indocyanine green ( ICG ) injection pre-operatively cholecystectomy , follow visualizuation biliary tree near-infrared light source camera . Testing do abdominal surgery require gallbladder removal . Subjects recruit consult surgical procedure . The study take estimate 5 minute procedure . 2.5mg ICG inject intravenously 60-30 minute surgery , follow perfusion biliary tree , image record visibility appropriate anatomy assess use near-infrared light source camera . If fluorescence fade prior adequate visualization , repeat dose 2.5mg IV ICG may give . Following completion image , standard procedure cholecystectomy perform include intraoperative cholangiography ( IOC ) , standard care . Subject post-operative recovery monitor duration hospital stay . Adverse event monitor patient 's routine follow visit .</detailed_description>
