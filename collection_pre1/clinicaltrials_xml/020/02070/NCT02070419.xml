	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) work compare TACE plus radiation therapy treat patient end stage liver disease , liver tumor , potential liver transplant candidate . TACE involve reach blood vessel feed tumor catheter place groin vessel . Once physician define vessel go tumor , chemotherapy infused tumor vessel block , maintain chemotherapy long time inside tumor stop blood flow feed tumor . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) type radiation therapy delivers radiation tumor cell harm normal liver cell . It yet know whether TACE effective without SBRT treat liver tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TACE With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage A-C Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient stage A C hepatocellular carcinoma , stereotactic body radiotherapy TACE enhance response rate hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) compare TACE alone 3 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient stage A C hepatocellular carcinoma , TACE plus SBRT achieve downstaging rate &gt; = 30 % 3 6 month . II . To determine rate grade 3 4 adverse event associate SBRT liver tumor . III . To determine rate local progression SBRT . ( Based Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) IV . Number patient achieve liver transplantation . V. Overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm first loco-regional therapy TACE . ARM I : Patients undergo TACE accord institutional standard doxorubicin-eluting bead . ARM II : Patients undergo TACE Arm I 3 5 fraction SBRT give least 48 hour apart 14 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 month periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
