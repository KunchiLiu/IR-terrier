	<brief_summary>Currently ideal preventive modality available reduce gastric-cancer cause mortality organize population-based application . The primary objective study determine H.pylori screening follow eradication positive subject endoscopic follow-up serological evidence atrophic gastritis reduces mortality gastric cancer middle-aged people high-risk area . The GISTAR study multicenter randomize study H.pylori eradication pepsinogen test prevention gastric cancer mortality . Altogether 30.000 individual age 40-64 year enrol , provide 90 % study power detect least 35 % reduction gastric cancer mortality 15 year follow-up . Participants randomly allocate one two group . In active investigation/management group positive H.pylori offer eradication therapy individual decrease pepsinogen I/II ratio invite endoscopy . The control group receive standard health care . The primary endpoint trial mortality difference gastric cancer two group 15 year enough case accumulate demonstrate statistical difference . The study expect provide valuable information utility reduction gastric cancer mortality : 1 ) H.pylori eradication adult population-basis , include subject may already pre-malignant lesion ; 2 ) pepsinogen test screening setting . A pilot study 3,455 individual prior main trial conduct October 2013 December 2016 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentric Randomized Study H. Pylori Eradication Pepsinogen Testing Prevention Gastric Cancer Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer important global public health issue Eastern European region , burden disease substantial . There sufficient epidemiological experimental evidence support causal link H. pylorus gastric cancer . However , still limited evidence clinical trial prove whether H. pylorus eradication antimicrobial therapy approach choice entire infected population select group reduce risk gastric cancer whether eradication advance stage atrophy effective among patient . The current European global guideline propose screen pepsinogen test best available tool identify individual increase risk cancer development , yet insufficient evidence available effective test organize cancer screening setting . We therefore propose conduct multi-center randomize trial Latvia , Belarus Russia , area high burden disease , main objective evaluate H. pylorus screen follow eradication participant positive result endoscopy serological evidence atrophic gastritis reduce gastric cancer mortality . The propose trial also investigate retrospectively group chronic atrophic gastritis select subject require treatment achieve comparable gastric cancer reduction . Ultimately , study potential find effective prevention strategy identify appropriate target group could get benefit treatment . The aim study search new intervention strategy decrease mortality gastric cancer high-risk area . The primary objective study determine H. pylorus screen follow eradication positive subject endoscopic follow-up serological evidence atrophic gastritis reduces mortality gastric cancer high risk population among 40-64 year old subject . The secondary objective : 1 . To determine retrospectively biomarkers chronic atrophic gastritis others select group subject require treatment achieve gastric cancer reduction comparable primary objective . 2 . To evaluate rationale volatile marker test exhale breath early identification lesion stomach well condition relate increase risk . 3 . To evaluate role diet , lifestyle factor environmental factor development gastric lesion . 4 . To evaluate impact H. pylorus eradication select medical condition potentially associate infection ( e.g . obesity , inflammatory bowel disease , dementia , circulatory disease esophageal disease ) Methods : Approximately 30,000 men woman recruit randomized study . Eligible subject 40-64 year age entry resident high gastric cancer incidence area invite participate trial visit one study clinic set specifically trial . For eligible participant agree participate sign informed consent , risk factor questionnaire administer complete medical evaluation perform baseline . Participants randomly assign either Group 1 ( 50 % ) Group 2 ( 50 % ) . Among assigned Group 1 , H. pylori screen detect immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) group antibodies plasma/serum pepsinogen test perform . According result test , participant assign H. pylori eradication treatment upper endoscopy . Participants serological evidence atrophic gastritis ( low pepsinogen I/II ratio ) undergo upper endoscopy appropriate biopsy sample well follow-up endoscopy accord MAPS ( Management precancerous condition lesion stomach ) guideline . H. pylori positive individual offer standard eradication treatment appropriate . From subject group , breath sample also collect volatile marker study research nurse junior physician . Participants assign Group 2 ( 50 % ) constitute control group , medical evaluation time recruitment . During follow-up period group offer consult specialist require due clinical symptom . Both Group 1 Group 2 offer fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) benefit study participation . Any participant show positive FOBT result refer colonoscopy . All trial participant include Group 2 follow least 15 year collect systematic information medical condition , particular gastric cancer cause death . A follow-up telephone call /alternative communication make every 5 year outcome assessment . The general study precede pilot-study conduct October 2013 December 2016 test assumption well tool functionality study infrastructure . According result pilot study , require infrastructure tool plan general study adapt accordingly . Endpoints : The primary endpoint trial mortality difference gastric cancer Group 1 Group 2 15 year enough case accumulate demonstrate statistical difference group . In addition mortality difference gastric cancer two group , endpoint require achieve secondary objective list : - The difference gastric cancer incidence Group 1 Group 2 - The all-cause mortality difference Group 1 Group 2 - The difference incidence mortality medical condition Group 1 Group 2 - Sensitivity specificity pepsinogen test detect atrophy - The proportion gastric cancer arise patient non-atrophic vs. atrophic gastritis - The proportion cancer arise patient atrophy , negative H. pylorus infection - The difference incidence gastric cancer group successful eradication compare refusing/failing eradication within Group I - The proportion gastric cancer case identify schedule follow-up endoscopy total number case follow-up group - The difference test performance disease prevalence ethnic group - The performance ( sensitivity , specificity , overall accuracy ) volatile marker test approach diagnose gastric cancer well premalignant lesion stomach A pilot study 3,455 participant start October 2013 complete December 2016 Latvia .</detailed_description>
