	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Study TPI 287 + Avastin Adults With Glioblastoma That Progressed Following Prior Avastin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center trial phase 2 , dose-escalation study safety , tolerability ( MTD ) , efficacy TPI 287 combination bevacizumab subject GBM progress follow prior radiation TMZ therapy progress follow prior bevacizumab therapy . All subject administer TPI 287 intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( target duration 1 hour ) every 3 week ( Days 1 22 42-day cycle ) bevacizumab 30 90 minute IV infusion every 2 week ( Days 1 , 15 , 29 42-day cycle ) . The subsequent cycle start 3 week last TPI 287 infusion 2 week last bevacizumab infusion , maintain every 3 week every 2 week schedule , respectively . The dose TPI 287 escalate sequential dose cohort 3 6 subject , dose bevacizumab remain constant ( 10 mg/kg ) . The initial cohort 3 subject treat TPI 287 dose 140 mg/m2 ( dose level 0 ) . The next dose level 160 mg/m2 ( dose level 1 ) . Subsequent dose level increase increment 10 mg/m2 ( i.e. , dose level 2 = 170 mg/m2 , dose level 3 = 180 mg/m2 , etc. ) . If dose de-escalation start dose level require , dose level 130 120 mg/m2 use . Twelve ( 12 ) 18 subject plan enrollment dose escalation phase , depend number subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) . Once MTD identify , 6 additional subject enrol MTD ( total 12 ) good characterize toxicity profile level . Dose modification delay require described protocol . Subjects may continue treatment unless meet one discontinuation criterion outline protocol . Subjects discontinue prior complete Cycle 1 reason toxicity replace . Adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication monitor throughout study . Subjects give diary record AEs concomitant medication take visit . Additional safety evaluation include physical examination ( include neurologic examination ) , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) , weight ( body surface area , BSA ) , vital sign , hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis . Efficacy evaluation include magnetic resonance image [ MRI , include pre post-gadolinium T1-weighted scan T2/fluid attenuate inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) image ] , corticosteroid usage , neurologic status ( measure neurologic exam KPS ) .</detailed_description>
