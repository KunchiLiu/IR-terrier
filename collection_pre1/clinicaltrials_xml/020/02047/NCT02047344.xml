	<brief_summary>This single arm , open label , Phase II study KRAS-positive KRAS-negative patient stage IV ( include pleural effusion ) non squamous NSCLC fail two line anti-cancer therapy . A maximum 60 evaluable patient NSCLC receive antroquinonol , 30 patient KRAS-positive 30 patient KRAS-negative . An evaluable patient receive least one dose antroquinonol valid baseline tumor assessment . Enrollment continue target number evaluable patient enrol .</brief_summary>

Patients progression free tumor assessment progressive disease ( define accord RECIST guideline , version 1.1 ) point start treatment Week 12 . 2 . Objective response rate ( ORR ) , define proportion patient whose best overall response either CR PR accord RECIST version 1.1 . The best overall response best response record first 12 week treatment cycle . 3 . Disease control rate ( DCR ) , define proportion patient document CR , PR SD first 12 week treatment cycle accord RECIST version 1.1 . 4 . Duration overall tumor response ( DR ) , define interval date first observation tumor response ( CR PR ) date disease progression death . 5 . Progression free survival define time randomization objective tumor progression RECIST version 1.1 death due cause , whichever occur first . 6 . Overall survival ( OS ) define time randomization death cause . 7 . Time progression ( TTP ) define time randomization objective tumor progression RECIST version 1.1 .</detailed_description>
