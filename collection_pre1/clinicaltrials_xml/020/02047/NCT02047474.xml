	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy surgery work treat patient localize pancreatic cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient resectable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer treat peri-operative modified leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFIRINOX ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival . II . Determine objective response rate neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare R0 resection rate pathologic stage institutional historical control receive neoadjuvant therapy . II . Correlate early metabolic response , determine change glucose metabolism use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning , pathologic response , R0 resection , pathologic stage . III . Correlate early metabolic response , determine change glucose metabolism use PET scanning , progression-free overall survival . IV . Correlate pre-operative response CA19-9 progression-free overall survival . V. Collect bank serial serum plasma specimens subject future correlative biomarker study . VI . Collect bank tumor tissue subject prior treatment ( diagnostic endoscopic ultrasonography [ EUS ] -guided biopsy ) treatment six cycle FOLFIRINOX ( surgical specimen ) future correlative biomarker study . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT THERAPY : Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX comprise oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , levoleucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Beginning 3-8 week completion neoadjuvant therapy patient undergo surgical resection . ADJUVANT THERARPY : Beginning within 12 week surgery , patient receive mFOLFIRINOX neoadjuvant therapy . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
