	<detailed_description>The identification reliable biomarkers multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , neurodegenerative disease , become increasingly important development disease-modifying treatment . A range genetic , metabolic image biomarkers exist , correlation diagnosis , phenotypic expression , inflammation , degeneration prognosis ; although wide variation specificity , sensitivity , reproducibility cost . In MS specifically , know whilst primary pathological process demyelination neurones ( accompany inflammation , resolve symptom ) , subsequent axonal loss - neurodegeneration - give rise permanent functional disability . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan currently primary source objective information assess MS disease status , term neurodegeneration possibly prognosis . Measurements brain atrophy show worsen rate higher untreated MS patient compare healthy control also correlate subsequent disability status eight year later . However , brain atrophy measure sometimes reveal paradoxical outcome , particularly white matter atrophy , normal increase volume result pathological process , tissue damage repair , impact upon measure . The search marker neurodegenerative disease status prognosis continue , renew interest eye . In MS , early work suggest certain retinal measure , particularly width layer consist largely retinal ganglion cell nerve axon , candidate biomarkers , hypothesis neuroretinal tissue reflect global central nervous system ( CNS ) pathology . Conceptually , would seem reasonable , give frequency anterior visual pathway involvement primary presentation MS ; addition , unmyelinated ganglion cell axon form retinal nerve fibre layer ( RNFL ) direct extension brain , global neurodegeneration would expect involve neurones - particularly MS , disease lesion predilection periventricular region , close proximity optic radiation . However , natural history neuroretinal tissue integrity poorly understood , vivo measurement new modality , require validation context interpretation . In addition , retinal imaging permit direct visualisation , subsequent analysis , retinal vasculature - show study stroke hypertension accurate representation brain vasculature , diagnostic prognostic potential . In summary , combine score neuroretinal integrity measure retinal imaging may yield new insight sever neurodegenerative disease .</detailed_description>
