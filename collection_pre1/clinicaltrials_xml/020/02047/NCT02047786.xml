	<brief_summary>Introduction Appendicectomy ( appendectomy US usage ) single commonly perform emergency surgical operation perform British child . Previous investigation outcome follow appendicectomy suggest specialist surgeon high volume centre few `` negative '' appendicectomy ( i.e . appendix find non-diseased ) , although consistent association find hospital type surgeon experience complication rate admission rate . Scotland 3 dedicate child 's surgery centre straightforward child 's surgery appendicectomy also carry country 's general surgical centre . Appendicectomy outcome variation explore Scottish National Health Service ( NHS ) . Aim This study compare appendicectomy outcome child Scotland 's specialist paediatric centre general surgical centre . Methods This retrospective study appendicectomy perform Scotland period 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010 , child age 2 - 12 year old . It use routinely collect administrative data Information Services Division NHS National Services Scotland . The study compare risk-adjusted 30 day/in-patient mortality , 30 day re-admission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , post-operative length stay negative appendicectomy rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Appendicectomy Outcomes Children Between Paediatric General Surgical Centres Scotland</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare Scottish appendicectomy outcomes child specialise paediatric centre versus non-specialised centre . This retrospective study appendicectomy perform Scotland period 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010 , child age 2 - 12 year old young . It use routinely collect administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . The registry supply data study Scottish Morbidity Record 01 ( SMR01 ) , full title `` General / Acute Inpatient Day Case dataset '' ( see http : //www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/ ? detail ) . SMR01 collate administered ISD , data submission mandatory Scottish NHS provider in-patient day-case care . Approximately 1.4 million record added year . Diagnoses cod accord International Classification Disease ( ICD ) -10 standard procedure cod accord United Kingdom 's Office Population Census Statistics ( OPCS ) standard , current version 4.5 . The data quality SMR01 high assure regular internal audit . In 2010 audit accuracy , Main Condition record accuracy 88 % Main Procedure record accuracy 94 % . Where data inconsistency identify extract supply study , clarification obtain possible ISD 's data retrieval support team . The study period decide pragmatically desire provide assessment current practice , fully within era widely practise laparoscopic surgery . A power calculation also suggest would provide adequate sample size demonstrate difference . Our power calculation- specific length stay- base Faiz O , Clark J , Brown T , Bottle A , Antoniou A , Farrands P , et al . Traditional Laparoscopic Appendectomy Adults . Ann Surg . 2008 Nov ; 248 ( 5 ) :800-6 . In cohort 259,735 appendicectomy perform 1996-2006 , geometric mean length stay 3.52 , SD 1.8 . We decide difference 0.5 day would 'clinically significant ' . We specify alpha 0.05 Power 0.9 , allocation ratio 1:1 . A two-sided t-test difference two independent mean perform G*Power 3.1.7 . This demonstrated total N 548 require demonstrate difference . In last epidemiological study appendicitis Scotland ( Bisset AF . Appendicectomy Scotland : 20-year epidemiological comparison . J Public Health . 1997 Jun 1 ; 19 ( 2 ) :213-8 ) , 1522 appendicectomy 1993 perform child age 0-15 year old . This suggest 10 year cohort adequate detect clinically significant difference length stay . Data completeness high SMR01 . However , significant volume data miss unusable , need data imputation explore . The study compare risk-adjusted 30 day/in-patient mortality , 30 day re-admission rate , 30 day re-operation rate , post-operative length stay negative appendicectomy rate Scotland 's specialist paediatric centre general surgical centre . Potentially significant confound variable age , gender , co-morbidity study predictive value univariate model include multivariate model remain significant .</detailed_description>
