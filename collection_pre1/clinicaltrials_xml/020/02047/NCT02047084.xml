	<brief_summary>Given propensity venous leg ulcer become refractory , long standing lesion , incorporate active biologic graft standard compression therapy , show accelerate wound healing . The two product compare study commonly use treatment venous leg ulcer . Apligraf consider medical device FDA , clear treatment venous leg ulcer 1998 . It staple treatment venous leg ulcer , widely use throughout United States . It compose type 1 collagen matrix human foreskin-derived neonatal fibroblast grow , human foreskin-derived neonatal keratinocytes culture allow stratify . TheraSkin compose split thickness skin graft harvest within 24 hour post-mortem , organ donor clear standard safety screening . It classify FDA donate tissue . Once harvest , graft sanitize accord FDA specification , cryopreserved , deliver clinic application foot ulcer . It also widely use treatment diabetic foot ulcer . TREATMENT RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY Chronic wound low extremity affect substantial proportion population . Venous leg ulcer ( VLU ) account 40-70 % low extremity wound . The standard care treatment VLU 's wound center United States compression therapy combine application biologic graft material wind bed . This study may assist physician treat VLU 's comparing efficacy cost two commonly use biologic graft material VLU 's randomized prospective study . In addition standard compression therapy , investigation head-to-head study compare widely use bio-engineered skin substitute ( Apligraf ) cryopreserved , human skin allograft ( Theraskin ) . There randomize , prospective data compare two graft option treatment VLU 's .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Human Allograft Apligraf Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The product consider Apligraf , bioengineered skin substitute , TheraSkin , cryopreserved split-thickness human skin allograft . This head-to-head design study observe performance product compare result clinician readily see advantage heal time , infection rate , cost associate product . The study sponsor Soluble Systems Life Net Health . The Study three phase : The first phase consist series screen assessment design determine eligibility . The prospective patient must meet inclusion exclusion criterion . They randomly assign one two cohort equal number . In second phase , study treatment administer patient follow study ulcer completely heal ( i.e. , 100 % closure determine Investigator , 12 week . During Treatment Phase subject evaluate weekly basis . Efficacy evaluation week include Investigator assessment wound closure evaluation ulcer size . During third phase , immediately follow initial 12 week second phase , patient remain non-healed study wound treat follow additional 8 week treatment . Safety Assessments throughout study include assessment adverse event measurement clinical laboratory parameter . STUDY ENROLLMENT This study initially include 100 subject , enrol randomly two group , treat either Apligraf TheraSkin . The sample size determine power calculation base anticipated difference heal rate Apligraf TheraSkin . The following parameter use calculate sample size . The literature two product predict closure rate 68 % TheraSkin , 47 % Apligraf within 12 week . Assuming 68 % closure rate TheraSkin , 47 % closure rate , desire alpha value p &lt; 0.05 power 80 % , 64 subject would need . However , difference closure rate assume 10 % , closure rate 68 % TheraSkin 47 % Apligraf , power calculation predict 142 subject would need . A compromise difference 13 % use predict 84 subject would need . If assume 20 % dropout rate due lack compliance adverse event , need enroll total 100 subject .</detailed_description>
