	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient frequently develop muscle weakness due critical illness-related acute neuropathy and/or myopathy . This disorder associate difficulty wean mechanical ventilation , prolong intensive care unit hospital stay , increased mortality rate . In addition , many patient continue suffer decreased exercise capacity quality life month year acute event . Besides control risk factor , specific prevention treatment exist . Recommendations advice start early active passive exercise critically ill patient ( 1 ) . Having critically ill patient alert engage progressive rehabilitation lead mobilization , despite use life support therapy may reduce muscle atrophy lead improve strength physical function ( 2 ) . This randomize controlled trial design investigate whether daily train session use tilt table , start early stable critically ill patient expect prolonged ICU stay , could induce beneficial effect exercise performance , quadriceps force functional autonomy ICU hospital discharge compare standard physiotherapy program .</brief_summary>
