	<brief_summary>The prevalence incidence cardiovascular disease ( Hypertension ) increase exponentially age ( McDermott , 2007 ; ) These disease account 30 % global mortality ( WHO , 2011 ) . Vitamin D ( VD ) insufficiency affect many half otherwise healthy adult develop country ( Holick , 2007 ) . VD implicate control blood pressure ( BP ) inhibition renin-angiotensin system ( Yamshchikov , 2009 ) , although role VD supplementation prevention treatment HTA controversial.The purpose study investigate VD supplement elderly people reduces level BP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population Adults age ≥ 60 year essential hypertension recruit nursing home physical activity group state Colima , México . 45 subject assessed eligibility out-patient clinic . We exclude subject impaired renal hepatic function ; also subject treated vitamin D within last three month . None hormone replacement therapy , include subject anti-hypertensive 10 year dosages unchanged study . Before randomization , two subject withdraw informed consent personal reason , two subject exclude due diagnosis severe hypertension . Design The design double-blind , placebo control randomized clinical trial . The participant randomly assign use computer-generated randomization code two group : group 1 ( calcitriol group ) 22 subject enrol 6 week treatment daily dose 1000 IU cholecalciferol ( administer 1 capsule 25 μg ) group 2 23 subject ( control group ) receive similar placebo tablet also 6 week . During treatment , nine subject ( 20 % ) leave trial due personal reason . All patient provide write informed consent . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki II guidance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) . Approval obtain bioethics committee Faculty Medicine University Colima ( FM014/2012 ) . Measurement At screen visit prior randomization , subject routine clinical examination data concern medical history . BP measure 3 consecutive day time , use kit integrate aneroid sphygmomanometer stethoscope ( medimetrics 5769 ) patient seat least 5 min rest . The subject average BP &gt; 140/90 mm Hg include study . Once enrol study group , anthropometrics measurement collect . The measurement perform weight height light clothing shoe , indicator body mass index ( kg/m2 ) calculate . For determination serum 25 ( OH ) D , two blood sample collect morning overnight fast minimum 8 h day randomization end study . The patient attend control visit every week safety measure , adverse event registration assessment compliance.Returned pill count visit , compliance calculate percentage use pill compare expected number . Biochemistry Serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration measure use competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA : immunodiagnostic , Bernheim , Germany ) solid-phase extraction ( reference range : 17-53 pg/mL ) . The intra- interassay CVs 2 Vitamin D metabolites &lt; 7,0 % 9,0 % , respectively . Statistical Analysis The data analyze SPSS version 21 . The variable study described frequency , percentage median ( interquartile range ) ; inferential statistic perform non parametric test ( Mann Whitney related sample Wilcoxon test ) , correlation variable analyze bivariate correlation analysis Pearson 's correlation . Statistical significance set p value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
