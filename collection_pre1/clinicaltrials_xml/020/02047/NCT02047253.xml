	<brief_summary>This study test effective drug , Carfilzomib , reduce progression prostate cancer patient previously receive chemotherapy androgen inhibitor . Carfilzomib approve multiple myeloma approve prostate cancer . Therefore , consider investigational . Other approve method treatment metastatic prostate cancer demonstrate modest benefit . Novel tolerable agent necessary make gain extend overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial Carfilzomib Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Following Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First-line chemotherapy metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) combine androgen inhibitor modestly extend overall survival . Carfilzomib anticipate enhance progression-free survival ( PFS ) well reduce pain toxicity . Proteasome inhibitor promise agent use therapy prostate cancer . Carfilzomib potent irreversible proteasome inhibitor frequently use proteasome inhibitor , Bortezomib . In Phase I trials Carfilzomib demonstrate substantial antitumor activity exhibit tolerable side effect . Carfilzomib approve FDA patient multiple myeloma . The drug , however , approve use CRPC patient . This trial evaluate tolerance effectiveness Carfilzomib men metastatic progressive CRPC follow chemotherapy androgen inhibitor .</detailed_description>
