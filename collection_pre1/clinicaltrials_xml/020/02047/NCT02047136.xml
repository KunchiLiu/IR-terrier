	<brief_summary>Histamine biologically active component find many food beverage . Intake excessive histamine food beverage , trigger symptom include urticaria . A low histamine diet recommend one possible treatment patient chronic urticaria . There study confirm effectiveness diet , investigator ' knowledge , none Asia high histamine contain meal often eat ( personal observation ) . The objective present study investigate therapeutic effect low histamine diet relieve symptom patient chronic urticaria without angioedema , / pruritus ( U/A/P ) . The investigator hypothesize follow low histamine diet 4 week , symptom patient chronic U/A/P improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Treatment Chronic Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double blind parallel randomize control study 4 week conduct assess effectiveness histamine-restricted diet . Neither subject medical investigator know diet prescribe . The study conduct ethical approval grant informed consent . If child , informed consent obtain parent . Subject pay his/her consultation fee doctor 's dietitian 's consultation skin prick and/or blood test first visit normal charge subsequent visit relation trial . A period 4 week low histamine diet previously show sufficient determine whether dietary manipulation help management urticaria symptom . Selection Criteria sample size calculation 78 subject come Allergy Centre treatment idiopathic urticaria , without angioedema pruritus ( U/A/P ) , randomize two parallel group ; treatment group ( TG ) ask follow histamine-restricted diet 4 week control group ( CG ) ask follow well-balanced diet instruct dietitian 4 week . A well-balanced diet CG subject tailor-made dietitian accord subject 's usual intake ensure subject 's energy requirement meet food group consume . Subjects group also instruct adequate water intake study period . Both group ask record food diary symptom study period . Consent form state study compare efficacy diet . After study period , subject CG able follow low histamine diet proven beneficial , everyone potential benefit low histamine diet vice versa TG subject . Low Histamine Diet Histamine present almost food small quantity . Its presence increase maturation food . High quantity histamine find mainly product microbial fermentation , age cheese , sauerkraut , wine , process meat . Some oriental food high histamine content also included.The current Low Histamine Diet sheet Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital use ( Appendix I ) . Evaluation Symptoms When subject come first consultation ( randomization week ) , he/she give 4-point scale questionnaire ( see Appendix II ) evaluate his/her symptom ( pruritus severity number wheal ) . This complete every evening week prior 4-week treatment period . The pruritus severity score number wheal run week average use mean baseline score . The summation mean pruritus score ( MPS ) mean number wheal ( MNW ) mean total symptom score ( MTSS ) baseline period . Medical investigator also evaluate subject 's global symptom severity ( GSS ) first consultation ( randomization week ) second consultation ( end week 4 ) . MPS GSS score 0 = none ; 1 = mild ( present disturb ) ; 2 = moderate ( disturb hamper day time activity and/or sleep ) ; 3 = severe/intense ( disturb hamper day time activity and/or sleep ) . Number wheal score 0 = none ; 1 = mild ( less 20 wheal per 24 hour ) ; 2 = moderate ( 21-50 wheal ) ; 3 = severe ( 50 wheal ) . After first consultation medical investigator , skin prick test and/or blood test specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) eight major food allergen test , namely cow 's milk , egg , peanut , treenuts , wheat , soya , seafood , shellfish . Subject consult dietitian either well-balanced diet ( CG ) low histamine diet ( TG ) he/she ask start diet one week first consultation . The subject ask fax email his/her complete questionnaire food diary checking he/she start diet . Dietitian ensure questionnaire food diary complete correctly subject . Dietitian phone subject remind him/her start diet also make sure subject corrects error complete questionnaire food diary . If diary run period do poorly may repeat formal diet begin . Dietitian conduct subsequent weekly phone follow subject . Each subject remind complete questionnaire food diary every evening . For symptom score week average . The sum MPS MNW mean total symptom score ( MTSS ) also average week period . Evaluation compliance low histamine diet Each subject complete food diary , addition symptom score chart , he/she record his/her dietary intake snack meal 4-week study period . The food diary evaluate Allergy Centre dietitians adherence diet . Diet compliance score ( DCS ) score 0 = comply ; 1 = poor diet compliance ( intake 2 high histamine food daily ) ; 2 = good compliance ( intake 1 less high histamine food daily ) ; 3 = excellent diet compliance ( intake 3 less high histamine food per week ) . Randomization blinding After provision inform consent , subject allocate table random number either TG CG . The number sequence generate computer list prepared dietitian . Neither subject medical investigator know diet prescribed subject . Power calculation statistical analysis Sample size determine base previous drug study13 insufficient data low histamine diet . To detect clinically significant mean difference least 1 point active control group 4 point scale 80 % power p &lt; 0.05 require 35 subject trial arm . Allowing 10 % drop rate , total sample 78 individual . Statistical analysis perform hospital statistician use SPSS version 18.0.0 ( 2009 ) . The primary outcome change Mean Total Symptoms Score ( MTSS ) baseline group . Secondary outcome measure include assessment ( 1 ) change MPS group ; ( 2 ) change MNW group . ( 3 ) change GSS medical investigator group ; ( 4 ) comparison area curve ( AUC trend ) MTSS , MPS , MNW , GSS DCS group 4-week period ; ( 5 ) comparison total dose anti-histamine use group compare baseline within study period . All data analyze use paired student 's t-test .</detailed_description>
