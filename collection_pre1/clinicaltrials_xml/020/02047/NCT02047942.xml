	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease main cause death worldwide . Aerobic fitness relate long-term survival reduction mortality recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction subject cardiovascular disease . However , majority cardiac patient engage enough physical activity obtain benefit long-term struggle maintain physically active lifestyle . There need innovative rehabilitation method aim increase longer-term adherence hence sustain effect health relate physical fitness . One strategy might use home-based training combination telemonitoring guidance . Therefore , main objective randomize control clinical trial compare longer-term ( =1 year ) effect 3-month supervise center-based rehabilitation program patient-tailored home-based cardiac rehabilitation program telemonitoring guidance CAD patient ( phase III ) . The primary outcome measure physical fitness . It hypothesize patient randomize home-based training program telemonitoring guidance demonstrate high level physical activity one year follow-up , result high level physical fitness , compare patient enrol supervised center-based cardiac rehabilitation program control group . Ninety patient randomize Home-based training , center-based cardiac rehabilitation program advice group ( = control group ) . Assessment perform baseline , immediately completion intervention one-year follow-up include measurement exercise tolerance , cardiovascular risk factor , physical activity , muscle strength , endothelial function , health-related quality .</brief_summary>
