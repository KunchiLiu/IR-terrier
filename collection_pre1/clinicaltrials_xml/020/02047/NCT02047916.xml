	<brief_summary>The current definition neonatal shock/circulatory failure outdated inaccurate . This make development evidence base protocol treatment difficult . Furthermore definition often rely invasive method monitor patient arterial line . Since advent functional echocardiography neonatology increase interest non-invasive measurement neonatal circulatory failure . However research field confine premature infant . The purpose research look non invasive method assess infant circulatory status infant older 33 week gestational age order fill knowledge gap help development new definition neonatal circulatory failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research show current definition use doctor assess treat infant circulatory problem inaccurate lead large difference doctor treat problem baby . Treatments circulatory problem baby involve give medication adrenaline , dobutamine dopamine . However drug license use baby potentially harmful side effect . By investigate new method assess baby circulatory status intend help create new definition circulatory failure turn help doctor create study identify infant circulatory failure find best way treat condition baby . So far research area confine baby bear less 33 week gestation . We intend extend knowledge area infant older 33 week gestation . This pilot prospective observational study baby older 33 week . Infants consider healthy population ( i.e . receive routine care postnatal care special care neonatal unit ) . Potential participant approach member research team give information study inform consent take . For first three day live included infant two specific measurement day . These know : - 1 . Superior vena cava flow assessment- This involve measure blood flow one large vein connect baby ' heart use ultrasound machine . It painless procedure well tolerated infant . 2 . Pleth variability index- This involve place small probe baby 's hand foot measure oxygen level . This do time superior vena cava flow assessment perform . Again painless procedure well tolerated infant . Prior measurement infant blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation 's capillary refill time assess . This assessment perform addition routine care receive . Infants therefore measurement perform three time purpose study . If infant discharge clinical team third day life measurement perform prior discharge include final analysis .</detailed_description>
