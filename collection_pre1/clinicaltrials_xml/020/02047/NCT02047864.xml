	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis important health problem , cost Canadian health care system $ 2 billion per year . Loss bone mineral bone fragility especially prevalent postmenopausal woman . Of osteoporotic fracture , hip fracture traumatic . Creatine monohydrate nutritional supplement often combined strength training increase strength muscle mass . The investigator recently complete pilot study small number postmenopausal woman ( n=33 ) show creatine monohydrate significantly improve hip bone mineral density 1-year resistance training program . In current proposal investigator want determine whether creatine combine strength train even large effect bone mineral density hip give 2 year large group postmenopausal woman ( n=240 ) . The investigator also want determine whether lead reduce fracture woman year complete creatine strength training program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related bone muscle loss major risk factor fall , injury , fracture , Canada 's population aging , prevalence health concern escalate . Osteoporosis alone estimate cost Canadian health care system $ 2.3 billion per year 1.3 % , Canada 's total healthcare budget . Postmenopausal woman high risk osteoporosis experience high rate hip fracture , result disability , loss physical function premature death . The investigator ' study aim improve bone mass bone strength clinically relevant bone site , femoral neck , order reduce risk hip fracture . Specifically , determine effect nutritional supplement ( creatine monohydrate ) combine exercise training bone mineral density ( BMD ) proximal femur postmenopausal woman . . Creatine monohydrate find small amount meat fish , take nutritional supplement , increase muscle mass strength . The investigator conduct number preliminary study show creatine supplement take resistance train program , urinary marker bone resorption ( i.e . bone catabolism ) reduce compare placebo . The investigator recently complete small 12-month randomize control trial 33 postmenopausal woman either supplemented creatine monohydrate ( 10 g/d ) placebo resistance training program . Bone mineral density femoral neck decrease 0.5 % creatine group , 3.9 % placebo group ( p &lt; 0.05 group ) . This propose randomized control trial replicate investigator ' pilot design long duration ( i.e . 2 year ) determine sustain supplementation creatine monohydrate combine exercise training induce clinically significant difference bone mineral density femoral neck ( investigator estimate 5 % difference creatine placebo group capable predict significant reduction fracture risk ) . This trial use randomize , double blind , placebo control , parallel group , repeat measure design , perform Universities Saskatchewan Regina . Post-menopausal woman ( n=240 ) randomize creatine ( 10g/d ) placebo group participate exercise program ( resistance training walk ) three time per week 24 month . The investigator ' main dependent variable femoral neck bone mineral density , assessed baseline , 12 , 24 month . Secondary variable assess time point include geometric property proximal femur ( predictor bone strength ) , lumbar spine bone mineral density , ultrasound measurement bone distal radius tibia ( predictive architectural integrity bone ) , lean tissue mass , muscular strength , dynamic balance , gait speed . The investigator assess incidence fall fracture time point also 12 month post-intervention ( i.e . 36 month ) . The result study clinical potential , provide physician health-care professional evidence-based advice give postmenopausal woman interested take creatine novel strategy increase bone mineral density prevent osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
