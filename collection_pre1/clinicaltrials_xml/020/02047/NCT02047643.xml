	<brief_summary>Manually suspend insulin pump begin aerobic exercise reduces risk exercise-associated hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . However , since patient T1D often make exercise-related adjustment insulin regimen , group develop algorithm initiate pump suspension user-independent manner upon project exercise-associated hypoglycemia . The current study seek test efficacy algorithm ask user participate sport camp wear insulin pump , continuous glucose monitor , accelerometer/heart rate monitor ( detect exercise ) , communicate electronically pump shutoff algorithm . On one day algorithm use , day normal insulin rate continue comparative purpose . The investigator hypothesize use accelerometer-augmented computer algorithm insulin pump suspension exercise result significantly few episode hypoglycemia ( exercise post-exercise monitoring ) exercise without pump suspension algorithm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Regular aerobic exercise confers plethora health benefit individual consider essential component management type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) [ 1 ] . However , contrast non-diabetic subject - increase muscle energy requirement exercise lead suppression endogenous insulin secretion - patient T1D dependent upon exogenous insulin thus risk exercise-associated hypoglycemia [ 1 ] . Exercise-associated hypoglycemia frequently report adverse event relate exercise diabetes [ 2 ] hypoglycemia occur exercise several hour afterwards [ 3,4 ] . Although previous research show pre-meal dose reduction subcutaneous insulin effective decrease incidence exercise-associated hypoglycemia [ 5 ] , patient T1D often perform adjustment [ 6,7 ] . In contrast subcutaneous insulin injection , reliant upon patient caretaker determine dosage , insulin pump provide unique opportunity avoid hypoglycemia via user-independent , computer-based algorithm determine insulin delivery . Previous research conduct Stanford demonstrate algorithm base continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) data prevent hypoglycemia sedentary set induce insulin pump suspension [ 8-10 ] . In addition , study child adolescent conduct Stanford ( center DirecNet group ) demonstrate suspend insulin pump begin period moderate aerobic exercise reduces risk hypoglycemia exercise period subsequently overnight [ 11 ] . Thus , utilize exercise-detecting accelerometer algorithm initiate pump suspension exercise , likely possible people diabetes could avoid exercise-associated hypoglycemia even fail manually alter pump setting . However , date , publish study utilized accelerometer-derived data insulin pump suspension algorithm exercise . Accelerometers light-weight motion-sensing device wear provide information intensity duration physical activity [ 12 ] . They small , inexpensive , could easily incorporate current sensor `` patch '' pump . They also use independently combine heart rate monitor ( HRM ) [ 13 ] , although commercially available HRMs currently require chest strap uncomfortable wear . Previous study evaluate effect physical activity insulin sensitivity utilized accelerometer ( worn belt small back , right side trunk mid-axillary line , leave side chest ) without HRMs activity recognition subject ' everyday life . These data use classify activity sedentary , light , moderate , vigorous base acceleration signal count measure one-minute interval [ 13-17 ] . One study investigate four different accelerometer clinical research set find accurate assessing intensity physical activity , regardless subject ' body habitus [ 18 ] . Thus , device provide reliable mean onset , duration , intensity exercise recognize report real-time component artificial pancreas . When combined CGM insulin delivery data , exercise information valuable tool design algorithm decrease stop insulin delivery order decrease risk exercise-associated hypoglycemia . In first phase study ( press ) , 22 subject type 1 diabetes go everyday life wear insulin pump , CGM , accelerometer/heart rate monitor . After monitor period , device download data use augment exist predictive low glucose suspend ( PLGS ) algorithm incorporate activity . In computer simulator , PLGS algorithm reduce hypoglycemia 64 % , compare 73 % 76 % reduction accelerometer-augmented HRM-augmented algorithm , respectively . In next phase study , seek test newly develop algorithm real-life set form structure sport ( soccer ) camp .</detailed_description>
