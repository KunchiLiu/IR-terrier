	<brief_summary>Introduction 'Emergency Laparotomy ' umbrella term set commonly performed procedure know carry significant risk mortality morbidity . Previous work show considerable inter-hospital variation emergency laparotomy outcome within United Kingdom . It unknown whether significant difference outcomes follow laparotomy may explain difference hospital procedural volume . Aims The aim study compare emergency laparotomy outcome Scotland vary hospital procedural volume . Methods This research study retrospective observational enquiry utilise administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . Patient episodes identify set procedure code emergency laparotomy . The primary outcome measure risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality , secondary outcome measure 30 day readmission rate , 30 day re-operation rate length stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Hospital Volume Relationship Emergency Laparotomy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study explore possibility hospital procedural volume-outcome relationship Scottish emergency laparotomy outcomes . This retrospective study emergency laparotomy perform Scotland period 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010 . It use routinely collect administrative data Information Services Division ( ISD ) NHS National Services Scotland . Emergency laparotomy define non-elective abdominal procedure primarily gut tube ; case identify use set procedural code , validate local record . The registry supply data study Scottish Morbidity Record 01 ( SMR01 ) , full title `` General / Acute Inpatient Day Case dataset '' ( see http : //www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/ ? detail ) . SMR01 collate administered ISD , data submission mandatory Scottish NHS provider in-patient day-case care . Approximately 1.4 million record added year . Diagnoses cod accord International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) -10 standard procedure cod accord United Kingdom 's Office Population Census Statistics ( OPCS ) standard , current version 4.5 . The data quality SMR01 high assure regular internal audit . In 2010 audit accuracy , Main Condition record accuracy 88 % Main Procedure record accuracy 94 % . Where data inconsistency identify extract supply study , clarification obtain possible ISD 's data retrieval support team . Data completeness high SMR01 . However , significant volume data miss unusable , need data imputation explore . The study period decide pragmatically desire provide assessment current practice , fully within era widely practise laparoscopic surgery . A power calculation also suggest would provide adequate sample size demonstrate mortality difference . A recent paper show 30 day mortality emergency laparotomy 14.9 % ( Saunders DI , Murray D , Pichel AC , Varley S , Peden CJ . Variations mortality emergency laparotomy : first report UK Emergency Laparotomy Network . Br J Anaesth . 2012 Sep 1 ; 109 ( 3 ) :368-75 . ) We decide want able detect mortality difference ( absolute ) 2 % . Alpha specify 0.05 power 0.9 . Using chi-2 test G Power 3.1.7 , determine total N 5221 require show difference . In study already cite , 35 hospital submit data 3 month practice , give total 1853 patient . We extrapolate estimate one hospital complete 212 laparotomy per year . There currently 31 adult surgical centre Scotland , result estimate 6,565 laparotomy per year . Even accept small size Scottish hospital , demonstrate 10 year cohort adequate detect clinically significant difference length stay . Hospitals place tertiles high , medium low volume , accord number procedure perform study period . The study compare risk-adjusted 30 day/in-patient mortality primary outcome , secondary outcome 30 day re-admission rate , 30 day re-operation rate post-operative length stay . Potentially significant confounding variable age , gender , co-morbidity study predictive value univariate model include multivariate model remain significant .</detailed_description>
