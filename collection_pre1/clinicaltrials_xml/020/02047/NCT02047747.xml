	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Dacomitinib Progressive Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate use irreversible pan-ErB kinase inhibitor dacomitinib treatment brain metastasis , measure radiographic objective response rate . The rationale study three-fold . First , use dacomitinib , irreversible pan-ErB kinase inhibitor , improve duration response see reversible , EGFR inhibitor . Inhibition multiple ErB kinase may interfere receptor cross-talk method develop resistance ; indeed , patient fail erlotinib treatment systemic disease see response dacomitinib . The second rationale evaluate pharmacokinetics penetration dacomitinib CSF determine adequate drug level reach CNS , determine current dose regimen appropriate . The third rationale determine specific molecular phenotype preferentially respond dacomitinib . As part study , serum cerebrospinal fluid collect analyzed drug level molecular marker key element ErB signal cascade . The objective marker analysis identify distinct molecular phenotype may preferentially respond targeted drug therapy future .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) document extracranial diagnosis primary lung cancer , melanoma , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) amplify breast cancer , HER2amplified gastric cancer , brain metastasis detect contrast enhance MRI CT require . Patients concurrent leptomeningeal disease eligible . Has progression measureable brain disease brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) . Has stable , evidence , extracranial disease receive systemic therapy extracranial disease . Note : Patients stable disease must already receive standard therapy intolerant standard therapy . Prior therapy brain metastasis require ; patient may either refuse radiation therapy receive prior radiation therapy . Patients receive prior standard whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) must complete treatment great 4 week prior study initiation . Has recover toxic effect prior therapy Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) Grade 1 clinical baseline . Age ≥18 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month opinion investigator . KPS ≥ 60 % . Adequate organ marrow function . Current plan use systemic therapy extracranial primary tumor . Current anticipated use investigational agent . Presence uncontrolled seizure ≤ 5 day prior first drug dose , define status epilepticus multiple seizures respond appropriate therapy . Current anticipated use enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug Insufficient time recovery prior therapy : le 28 day WBRT SRS ; le 28 day investigational agent ; le 28 day prior cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day prior temozolomide , 14 day vincristine , 42 day nitrosoureas , 21 day procarbazine administration ) , less 7 day noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . When radiation necrosis suspect , confirmatory imaging perform , patient find consistent radiation necrosis exclude . Current use anticipate need treatment Coumadin® agent contain warfarin ( except low dose Coumadin ( 1 mg less daily ) administer prophylactically maintenance indwell line port ) . Heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LWMH ) , direct thrombin inhibitor factor Xa inhibitor allow . Rivaroxaban use caution . Antiplatelet agent allow . Current anticipate need treatment drug know substrate CYP2D6 Current anticipate need treatment proton pump inhibitor . Patients proton pump inhibitor switch H2blockers start study still eligible . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition dacomitinib . Known severe and/or uncontrolled medical disorder would impair ability receive study treatment ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic renal disease , chronic pulmonary disease , HIV , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , active infection ) . Impaired cardiac function include follow : Congenital long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome ; correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec ; history presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias ; clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) ; myocardial infarction within 1 year start study drug ; clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension ) Pregnant nursing . There potential congenital abnormality regimen harm nursing infant .</criteria>
