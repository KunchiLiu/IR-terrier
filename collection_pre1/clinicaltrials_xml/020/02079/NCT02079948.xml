	<detailed_description>If decide take part study , randomly assign ( much like flip coin ) receive either methotrexate placebo . A placebo substance look like give way experimental treatment contains medicine , example [ sugar pill , injection saline ( salt water ) ] . A placebo use research study show effect treatment compare take nothing . If assign receive placebo , receive benefit methotrexate , , expose risk , describe `` What possible discomfort risk ? '' Studies show , however , 1 3 person take placebo improve , short time . You physician person study know whether receive placebo methotrexate , information available need . Also , 50 % chance receive methotrexate 50 % chance receive placebo . Methotrexate lower folate ( vitamin B9 ) level body , someone take methotrexate , he/she need take folic acid . To make sure methotrexate lower level inflammation body folate , study participant group give folic acid . In remainder description do , methotrexate placebo call `` study treatment . '' You give study letter describes study . You ask show letter doctor medical specialist , know participate study study drug . You ask take study drug every morning mouth EMPTY STOMACH breakfast . The study capsule contain methotrexate placebo look . Participants methotrexate group slowly increase amount methotrexate take first month 15 mg/week . In first week , participant take 5 mg/week ( i.e. , 1 capsule Day 7 ) , second third week take 10 mg/week ( i.e. , 2 capsule Day 7 ) , fourth week take 15 mg/week ( i.e. , 3 capsule Day 7 ) . On Days 1-6 , participant take 1 folic acid capsule . Participants placebo group slowly increase number placebo capsule take first month . In first week , participant take 1 placebo capsule Day 7 , second third week take 2 placebo capsule Day 7 , fourth week take 3 placebo capsule Day 7 . On Days 1-6 , participant take 1 folic acid capsule . Store study medication room temperature 59째 86째F ( 15째 30째C ) keep away light . Keep medicine reach child . You ask take study drug 6 month , participation study last approximately 8 month . The investigator ask attend 12 study visit research center locate Institute Aging - Clinical &amp; Translational Research Building ( IOA - CTRB ) : 1 . Screening Visit 2 . Baseline Visit 3 . Baseline Functional Magnetic Imaging ( fMRI ) Visit 4 . 1-Month Visit 5 . 2-Month Visit 6 . 3-Month Visit 7 . 4-Month Visit 8 . 5-Month Visit 9 . 6-Month Visit 10 . 6-Month fMRI Visit 11 . Follow-Up Visit I 12 . Follow-Up Visit II The investigator also call approximately 9 time study ask feel find remember take study drug .</detailed_description>
