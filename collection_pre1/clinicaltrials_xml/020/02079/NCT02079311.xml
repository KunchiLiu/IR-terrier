	<brief_summary>This investigation undertaken investigate patient warm BARRIER® EasyWarm active self-warming blanket differs compare active warming force air warm term core body temperature perioperatively . A non-inferiority , prospective , open-labelled , randomize , parallel investigation . Randomized subject receive active warm BARRIER® EasyWarm force air warm . All subject may receive rescue warm core temperature fall 35.5°C . Rescue warm optional defined institution 's standard care prevent hypothermia . The primary purpose investigate clinically relevant difference core body temperature two treatment group . A total 60 subject include investigation , i.e . 30 subject treatment group . The number include 30 % drop-out rate .</brief_summary>
