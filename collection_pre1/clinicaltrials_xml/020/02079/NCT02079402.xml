	<brief_title>Conservative vs. Liberal Approach Fluid Therapy Septic Shock Intensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid resuscitation key intervention treatment sepsis , exact indication fluid amount fluid administer establish . Current guideline fluid therapy beyond 6 hour vague ungraded observational study suggest harm increase positive fluid balance . Objective To assess feasibility protocol compare conservative ( trigger guide ) vs. liberal ( target guide ) approach fluid resuscitation patient septic shock initial fluid resuscitation . Design Multicentre , parallel group , centrally randomise , open label trial adequate generation allocation sequence , adequate allocation concealment . Sample size 150 include patient need show 1.7 L difference fluid volume group base mean volume resuscitation fluid give within first 5 day observe 6S trial 5.3 L ( SD 3.7 L ) maximal type 1 2 error 5 % 20 % ( power=80 % ) , respectively . Funding The trial publicly fund Danish Council Strategic Research Statistical Analysis Plan Classic Trial Outcome measure The outcome measure `` Amount resuscitation fluid give ICU stay '' change secondary outcome measure co-primary outcome measure , differs Classic Trial protocol . The Classic Trial intervention period entire ICU stay consider appropriate outcome measure address co-primary outcome measure . This change approve Danish Ethical Committee Danish Health Medicines Authorities ( Applied June 19 2015 ) .Multiplicity issue address ( see Analyses section ) . Analyses All statistical test 2-tailed . Multiplicity adjustment . Dealing multiplicity , parallel gate keep method truncation parameter lambda = 0 use adjust observe ( raw ) P value primary secondary outcome ( Dmitrienko A , Tamhane AC , Bretz F. Multiple test problem pharmaceutical statistic . Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC biostatistics series ( 2010 ) ) . By approach null hypothesis divide two family : F1 include null hypothesis relate two co-primary outcome F2 include null hypothesis related secondary outcome . The raw P value adjust . If least one adjust P value family 1 less choose level significance hypothesis family 2 also test . If hypothesis family 2 accept without test . However , event raw P value well adjust one present . Lambda may vary 0 1 . If effect size primary outcome ( correspond null hypothesis F1 ) uniformly high lambda near 1 help improve overall power . On hand effect size expect vary across endpoint , overall power likely maximize lambda small ( Dmitrienko A , Tamhane AC , Bretz F. Multiple test problem pharmaceutical statistic . Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC biostatistics series ( 2010 ) ) . We expect degree correlation two co-primary outcome measure somewhat full correlation correlation , conventional adjustment significance level ( 0.05/2=0.025 ) may result conservative adjustment . Thus , choose adjust level significance factor full Bonferroni adjustment adjustment , 0.05/1.5=0.033 . In procedure raw P value significance level adjust usually α ( significance level ) choose 0.05 . In family 1 small raw P value adjust multiply 2 . Therefore , implement adjustment solve 2*0.0.033 ≤ level significance = &gt; level significance = 0.066 secure raw P value ≤0.033 co-primary outcome imply correspond null hypothesis reject . Revised power calculation The multiplicity adjustments co-primary outcome measure infer change power calculation . The revised power calculation base 150 included patient α=0.033 β=0.80 : Outcome measure 1.1 : Power show 1.8 L ( oppose 1.7 L α=0.05 ) difference fluid volume group base mean volume resuscitation fluid give within first 5 day observe 6S trial 5.3 L ( SD 3.7 L ) Outcome measure 1.2 : Power show 4.1 L ( oppose 3.7 L α=0.05 ) difference base mean 8.0 L ( SD 8.1 L ) total resuscitation fluid volume ICU stay day 6S trial . We regard revised power sufficient address research question ; thus , sample size change . 1 . Analysis outcome measure Two analysis do co-primary outcome measure ( 1,2 ) : 1. analysis adjust stratification variable ( site ) - primary analysis 2. analysis adjust stratification variable baseline covariates ( ( ) surgery current hospitalisation prior randomisation Y/N , ( b ) Age , ( c ) 5 L fluid ( crystalloids , colloid blood product combine ) give 24 hour prior randomisation Y/N , ( ) high dose noradrenalin 24 hour prior randomization , ( e ) estimate weight randomisation For exploratory outcome ( 10 ) perform unadjusted analysis ( log rank test ) analysis adjust stratification variable site . The remain outcome measure analyse adjust stratification variable ( site ) . Co-primary outcome ( 1,2 ) , secondary outcome ( 3-6 ) exploratory outcome ( 15 ) analyse use general linear model . The exploratory outcome ( 9 ) ( 13 ) analyse use logistic regression . The exploratory outcome ( 10 ) analyse use Kaplan Meier survival plot log rank test . Adjusted analysis do use Cox regression model stratify site . Secondary outcome ( 7 ) compare intervention group , major protocol violation occur conservative ( Trigger-guided ) group . Secondary outcome ( 8 ) , exploratory outcome ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) ( 14 ) analyse use Poisson distribution link = log offset negative binomial distribution link=log offset appropriate . As sensitivity analysis two group also compare use non-parametric test ( van Elteren test adjust site ) major difference result obtain two approach discuss . 2 . Sensitivity analyse The primary outcome analyze use two per-protocol population . Populations Intention-to-treat population : All randomise patient except withdraw consent use data . Per-protocol population : All randomise patient except patient one protocol violation define : 1 . One resuscitation fluid bolus give without fulfilment one Classic-criteria Conservative ( Trigger-guided ) group . OR 2 . Use colloid ( either Albumin synthetic colloid ) resuscitation OR 3 . Monitoring reveal one in- exclusion criterion violate OR 4 . Stopped/withdrawn patient Subgroups : 1 . Patients 5 L fluid ( crystalloids , colloid blood product combine ) give 24 hour prior randomisation The result subgroup analysis present P test interaction subgroup indicator intervention group indicator primary outcome &lt; 0.05 . The P-value test interaction present regardless . Missing Data Missing primary outcome data : We expect miss data co-primary outcome measure ( 1,2 ) . Only complete case analysis make . Missing secondary outcome data We expect miss data secondary outcome measure 7 8 . Only complete case analysis make . Missing data secondary outcome 3-6 : Since predictor ( centre indicator intervention indicator ) miss outcome may miss . In case complete case analysis unbiased since case outcome miss carry information . However , auxiliary variable ( i.e . variable include analytical model e.g . outcome ) may correlate outcome inclusion analysis improve efficiency . This possibility best dealt use structural equation model regression analysis direct maximum likelihood estimation inclusion auxiliary variable ( SAS proc cali continuous dependent variable may use ) . However , data may still miss random . Therefore , sensitivity analysis estimate range potential bias may cause data miss random do miss value one group replace minimum value whole material miss value group replace maximum value whole material vice versa . The corresponding P value estimate . The standard error two estimate regression coefficient replace correspond standard error complete case analysis ( direct ML analysis auxiliary variable use ) small former Missing baseline data Fluids give prior randomisation Yes/no Some patient may miss data fluid give prior randomisation . In case regression co-primary outcome centre , mention baseline covariates fluid give prior randomization Yes/no miss value . As long probability miss data predictor independent outcome complete case analysis give unbiased result even probability depend miss predictor value ( i.e. , data NMAR ) ( Allison PD Missing data Sage publication ( 2001 ) ) . Therefore , mean value outcome differ significantly ( P &lt; 0.10 ) patient miss value without miss value complete case analysis do . If multiple imputation miss baseline variable do use monotone logistic regression .</detailed_description>
