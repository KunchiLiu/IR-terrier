	<brief_summary>This open label , two-arm , phase II trial evaluate anti-tumor activity , safety , tolerability ziv-aflibercept combination XELOX chemotherapy first-line treatment subject mCRC . Two different schedule ziv-aflibercept combination XELOX evaluate study : every 2 week schedule ( Arm A ) every 3 week schedule ( Arm B ) . The choice arm A arm B depend investigator 's preference . Arm A ( every 2 week schedule ) Dosage dosage regimen study period - Capecitabine : administer 1,000 mg/m2 orally twice day Days 1 - 7 cycle , repeat every 14 day . - Oxaliplatin : administer 85 mg/m2 IV Day 1 cycle , repeat every 14 day . - Ziv-aflibercept : administer 4 mg/kg IV Day 1 cycle , repeat every 14 day . Arm B ( every 3 week schedule ) : Dosage dosage regimen study period - Capecitabine : administer 850 mg/m2 orally twice day Days 1 - 14 cycle , repeat every 21 day . - Oxaliplatin : administer 130 mg/m2 IV Day 1 cycle , repeat every 21 day . - Ziv-aflibercept : administer 6 mg/kg IV Day 1 cycle , repeat every 21 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study limit subject newly diagnose mCRC without prior systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease . The diagnosis metastatic colorectal cancer base histologic cytologic confirmation . Subjects must ability swallow oral medication . Subjects must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Any prior chemotherapy mCRC allow . Adjuvant chemotherapy oxaliplatincontaining regimen CRC within last 12 month allow . Adjuvant chemotherapy Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) capecitabine alone within last 6 month allow . Age ≥ 18 year . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 1 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 12 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Total Bilirubin 2 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) 2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( AST ALT ≤ 5.0 x ULN acceptable liver tumor involvement ) . Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) 30 mL/min . The effect combination zivaflibercept , oxaliplatin capecitabine develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , 6 month last administration zivaflibercept . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion therapeutic agent administration 6 month last administration zivaflibercept . Ability understand sign write informed consent document . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement give informed consent . Any prior chemotherapy mCRC . Adjuvant chemotherapy oxaliplatincontaining regimen CRC within last 12 month . Adjuvant chemotherapy 5FU capecitabine alone within last 6 month allow . CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min Any peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2 Patients know dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency Patients urine protein creatinine ration &gt; 1 urine protein &gt; 500 mg/24 hour . Patients radiotherapy within 4 week enter study recover adverse event due radiotherapy administer 4 week earlier . Patients uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Presence metastatic disease , opinion investigator , would require palliative treatment within 4 week enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study zivaflibercept , capecitabine , oxaliplatin agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother zivaflibercept , capecitabine , oxaliplatin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated zivaflibercept , capecitabine , oxaliplatin . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction zivaflibercept , capecitabine , oxaliplatin . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Malabsorption syndrome , ulcerative colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , resection stomach small bowel , disease condition significantly affect gastrointestinal function . Serious nonhealing wound , skin ulcer , bone fracture . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy active anticoagulation Coumadin . Any document stroke Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) within 6 month prior study entry Any grade 3/4 hemorrhage within 3 month prior study entry Any pulmonary embolism ( PE ) within 3 month prior study entry Any deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) within 3 month prior study entry Uncontrolled hypertension define &gt; 140/90 mmHg isolate systolic hypertension &gt; 160 mmHg 2 separate day past 3 month prior study inclusion . Any following cardiac condition : Documented congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry Unstable angina within 6 month prior study entry Symptomatic arrhythmia</criteria>
