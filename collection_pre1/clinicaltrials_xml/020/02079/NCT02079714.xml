	<brief_title>Streamlining Trauma Research Evaluation With Advanced Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : As part NIH Roadmap initiative , PROMIS ( patient report outcomes measurement information system ) develop tool , include item bank , short form computer-adaptive test ( CATs ) help standardize measurement many health-related quality life domain . These PROMIS tool test large general population sample across lifespan . The overall goal present study assess performance research utility new tool new patient population future comparative effectiveness research project . The propose project examine reliability , validity responsiveness PROMIS tool clinical research follow orthopaedic trauma . Specific Aim 1 : Examine measurement property exist PROMIS CATs item bank patient orthopaedic trauma . Investigators incorporate ten ( six core four exploratory ) PROMIS short form CATs longitudinal data collection five ongoing orthopaedic trauma clinical trial administer expand data collection interview time last study follow use : 1a : Evaluate reliability construct validity PROMIS CATs 1b : Compare measurement precision six exist item bank apply orthopaedic trauma population versus general population . 1. c : Identify item exist PROMIS item bank function differently population compare general population . Specific Aim 2 : Examine responsiveness exist PROMIS domains patient orthopaedic trauma . Specifically , investigator : 2. : Examine responsiveness PROMIS domains expect clinical recovery population . 2b : Examine responsiveness PROMIS domains well-defined clinical inflection point recovery process , infection , non-unions , flap failure , complication . 2c : Examine responsiveness PROMIS domains treatment effect observe intervention study trial , include psychosocial intervention , pharmacologic intervention , device . These trial evaluate use widely use traditional outcome measurement tool . Specific Aim 3 : Study integration PROMIS tool within data collection infrastructure METRC . Key feasibility component examine integration distribute electronic data capture system ( REDCap ) , use CAT technology across dozen trauma center orthopaedic trauma clinic . 3a . Compare rate use CAT-based assessment versus short-form data collection 3b : Compare data completeness use exist METRC approach , CAT short form PROMIS instrument 3c : Compare respondent burden use exist METRC approach , CAT short form PROMIS instrument . Study design : The STREAM study multi-center , prospective longitudinal observational study evaluate reliability , validity responsiveness PROMIS tool orthopaedic trauma patient .</detailed_description>
