	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE The purpose study determine Lying Head Back Head Down Forward head position administer topical atomize nasal medication result great distribution efficacy budesonide administer via mucosal atomization device chronic rhinosinusitis patient previous sinus surgery . 2 . HYPOTHESIS The investigator hypothesize endoscopic sinonasal mucosal score low ( improve ) patient orient LHB HDF position apply medication 12 week treatment . 3 . JUSTIFICATION : Topical medication administer nebulizer frequently utilized patient suffer refractory CRS . Nebulizers useful atomize medication increase contact surround mucosa . This technique useful widespread inflammation olfactory cleft , ethmoid , sphenoid frontal sinus increase inflammation may obstruct drainage pathway . Obstructed sinus ostia may prevent mucosal clearance , impair ciliary function subsequently contribute infection . Topical medication , steroid therapy safe effective method locally reduce inflammation . The success atomize nasal medication dependent multiple factor gravity , obstructive feature sinonasal anatomy patient interpretation prefer delivery method . Several delivery method topical nasal therapy previously evaluate determine optimal head position administration . However , review literature suggest optimal method administer atomize nasal steroid paranasal sinuses human subject yet determine . It previously suggest successful distribution intranasal steroid spray require topical agent contact remain desired mucosa prevent disease reoccurrence . In prospective single-cohort study , healthy subject recruit evaluate distribution clearance rate fluorescein-labeled nasal spray distribute use squeeze bottle , nasal gel nasal spray device . The investigator find significant difference clearance rate delivery method . This trial provide preliminary evidence support investigation rate distribution intranasal steroid administration CRS patient . The finding generalize wide CRS population , patient enrol healthy history CRS sinus surgery . Similarly , investigator report head position utilized administer treatment . Therefore , remain formal consensus optimal head position CRS patient suffer recurrent symptom distribution clearance rate intranasal steroid medication . Clinician experience St. Paul 's Sinus Centre ( SPSC ) recommend patient orient Lying Head Back ( LHB ) position effectively treat edematous mucosa ethmoid roof frontal sinus recess . These instruction base evidence collect previous cadaveric trial complete centre ( press ) . Our team evaluate effect head position distribution fluorescent nasal spray within paranasal sinus cadaver specimen . The investigator utilize two commonly instructed head position , Lying Head Back ( LHB ) Mygind position Head Down Forward ( HDF ) Moffat 's position . In trial investigator orient cadaver specimen either study position evaluate presence fluorescent nasal spray across eleven clinically relevant anatomical area . investigator conclude LHB position significantly great frequency distribution ( OR = 1.85 , 95 % CI : 3.0 , 6.9 , p &lt; 0.001 ) evaluate area HDF position . This trial limit number factor , include small sample size ( n=20 ) . Similarly , cadaveric specimen generalize human , moist ciliated mucosa , nasal polyp represent . Therefore , remain controversial optimal head position deposition intranasal medication . 4 . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective The primary objective clinical trial compare endoscopic sinonasal mucosal inflammation patient orient LHB HDF position 12 week treatment . Subject sinus cavity assess validated endoscopic mucosal stag system first baseline , 6 12 week treatment . Total score compare treatment group . The Lund-Kennedy ( LKES ) Philpott-Javer ( PJES ) endoscopic stag system utilized quantify severity sinonasal disease . The Principal Investigator complete endoscopic evaluation blind treatment allocation . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective trial compare LKES PJES score compare sensitivity change treatment period degree correlation total score change score score system . Inter-rater intra-rater reliability calculate compare score system . The purpose secondary outcome validate PJES `` gold standard '' widely use LKES , term overall score sensitivity treatment . 5 . RESEARCH METHOD : Study Design : Parallel , single-blind , randomize control trial subject previously randomize LHB HDF treatment arm ( Part 1 ) order compare endoscopic sinonasal mucosal score 12 week treatment . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study clinic . After study patient voluntarily consent participate study , data collection begin . Randomization Treatment Arm # 1 : Administering topical fluorescent-labeled nasal spray LHB position . Treatment Arm # 2 : Administering topical fluorescent-labeled nasal spray HDF position . Adult patient suffer refractory CRS symptom post-FESS randomize either Treatment Arm # 1 # 2 equal ratio . The sequence computer generate trial statistician . The sequence order random-permuted block ensure allocation remain conceal . The sequence maintain computer locate St. Paul 's Sinus Centre ( SPSC ) strict password necessary access . Non-transparent seal envelope treatment assignment keep secure environment accessible study personnel SPSC . When study personnel notify potential candidate , inclusion exclusion criterion evaluate . When consent provide next consecutive envelope take treatment group assign . After treatment assign , patient preserve envelope ensure Principal Investigator remain blinded treatment allocation . Blinding : Part 1 : As patient require orient appropriate study position , blind feasible subject . However , Principal Investigator two additional senior Rhinologists evaluate endoscopic image mucosal disease severity blind subject 's allocate head position . Patients randomized head position group , either Lying Head Back ( LHB ) Head Down Forward ( HDF ) position . Patients remain allocated group administer medication respective head position 12 week . As , patient blind position randomize . However , Principal Investigator two additional senior Rhinologists blind position subject orient throughout treatment period ( 12 week ) . Images sinus cavity capture baseline 12 week evaluate use LKES PJES score system . Total score change score compare . The randomization sequence break final analysis complete . Conduct Study : Baseline Intervention : Adult CRS patient previously receive FESS , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion provide consent randomize either LHB HDF position administer budesonide topical nasal corticosteroid spray sinus cavity . Baseline characteristic collect patient chart outline . Each subject study group receive sterile 3ml syringe fix Mucosal Atomization Device ( MAD ) tip ( Wolf-Tory Medical , Salt Lake City , UT ) . This device advantageous produce fine mist , increase surface area absorption within paranasal sinuses.4 Budesonide well-tolerated , glucocorticoid steroid primarily use treatment asthma nasal polyposis.20 At SPSC , standard practice prescribe budesonide treat postoperative sinonasal inflammation utilize MAD . From discussion senior Rhinologists SPSC , patient typically instructed administer treatment twice day 6-12 week . However , dosage frequency may modify suit individual circumstance . For purpose trial , patient instruct load syringe 2cc budesonide ( 1mg 2cc saline ) solution distribute right leave side nose . A designated research assistant collect baseline data describe demonstrate allocate study position separate room Principal Investigator . To ensure position correctly communicate , subject orient appropriate position guidance research staff require . Subjects randomize LHB position instruct lay supine clinical table , head hang edge bed far possible without discomfort ( Figure 1 ) . Subjects randomize HDF position instruct kneel , place top head ground forehead close knee nostril face upwards ( Figure 2 ) . Once position , subject insert MAD-syringe 45-degree angle nasal valve , direct tip lateral epicanthus ipsilateral orbit depress syringe plunger completely . Subjects remain positioned 60 second . At time designate research associate measure angle subject head relation horizontal plane , use analog protractor . As subject may able orient single standardize angle , investigator note angle comfortable determine range possible orientation . Subjects instructed administer budesonide 1mg/2cc nebule daily 6 week use MAD syringe , head position allocate randomized baseline visit . After time , subject return SPSC endoscopic examination sinus cavity . Bilateral nasal endoscopy perform use 2.3mm Karl Storz rigid nasal endoscope . The Principal Investigator capture image sinus cavity blind head position group subject randomize . Each sinus cavity assess independently image capture stored password-protected , centrally locate computer . Once endoscopic image capture patient return 12 week treatment , three independent senior Rhinologists score sinus cavity accord LKES PJES criteria.18,19 This complete twice , 1-week break assessment . Responses tabulate separate , password-protected spreadsheet Rhinologist receive study code prevent identification . A blind statistician summarize data compare total change endoscopic score treatment group . Secondary analysis complete determine extent correlation sensitivity LKES PJES response . Inter intra-rater reliability also compute determine extent agreement score system . Data collection : The follow data collect initial clinic visit : - Baseline characteristic collect include age ( year ) , sex ( male female ) , number cigarette per day ( count ) , height ( centimeter ) , weight ( kilogram ) , handedness ( right left ) , number prior sinus surgery ( count ) , preoperative disease severity ( Lund-Mackay CT Score ) . The following data collect 6 12 week follow-up visit : - PJ Endoscopic score - LK Endoscopic score - SNOT-22 score 6 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Sample size determination : From recent trial evaluate LHB HDF position human cadaver , incidence total spray distribution 76 % 41 % LHB HDF position . Incorporating finding , investigatorsperformed sample size calculation use Type I error ( alpha ) 5 % , Type II error ( beta ) 20 % effect size 73 % . The effect size calculate use incidence proportion centre 's previous trial cadaver specimen , identify clinically relevant practically achievable . A two-proportion calculation use compare average distribution anatomical site head position group . The calculation reveal necessary sample size 30 patient per group . Based clinical experience Principal Investigator estimate 60 % patient require sinus surgery ( n=400/year ) eligible enrollment ( n=280/year ) . Accounting 70 % enrollment eligible subject ( n=196/year ) , investigator estimate 16 patient recruit every month . Adjusting dropout rate 20 % , investigator increase total sample size ( n=60 ) 6 patient . investigator estimate desired sample size adjust loss-to-follow-up ( n = 66 ) achieve 4 month ( Figure 3 ) . Patients recruit equal ratio experimental control group ( 33 arm ) . Baseline characteristic analysis : Baseline characteristic two group report . Descriptive statistic report included mean , median , standard deviation range . These report age , height , weight , number prior surgery preoperative disease severity . The proportion male female , right left hand subject frequency blood clot adhesion present prior intervention also describe . End Study Analysis : Subject sinus cavity assess use LKES PJES scale . Measurements make baseline 5 week treatment . The LKES ass sinus ( ethmoid , maxillary , sphenoid , frontal ) presence polyp ( 0=absent , 1=present middle meatus , 2=beyond middle meatus ) ; presence edema , scar crusting ( evaluated 0=absent , 1=mild , 2=severe ) presence discharge ( 0=absent , 1=clear thin , 2=thick purulent ) . A total , bilateral score calculate sinus evaluate . The PJES similar scoring system evaluate sinus cavity individually yield total bilateral score total 80 . Additional point award presence allergic mucin purulent discharge . Two endoscopic score record subject , use scale baseline 5 week post treatment . The difference baseline 5 week result calculate subject sum together yield average change LHB HDF group . Outcome data summarize mean , median , standard deviation interquartile range . The Students t-test use test change endoscopic score significantly different treatment group . Pearson 's ( R ) correlation calculate determine extent linear association LKES PJES result . From previous study evaluate association endoscopic score system , priori decision make categorize R &lt; 0.49 weak correlation , 0.50 &lt; R &lt; 0.69 moderate correlation R &gt; 0.70 strong correlation . Linear correlation calculate term absolute score change score study time point . To determine extent clinical agreement senior Rhinologists evaluate subject , intra inter-rater kappa score calculate . It determine priori score &lt; 0 assigned agreement , 0.01 - 0.20 poor agreement , 0.21-0.40 slight agreement , 0.41-0.60 fair agreement , 0.61-0.80 good agreement , 0.81-0.92 good agreement 0.93-1.00 excellent agreement .</detailed_description>
