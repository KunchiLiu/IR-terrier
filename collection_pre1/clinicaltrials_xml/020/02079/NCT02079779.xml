	<brief_summary>Stroke principal cause permanent disability within investigator population . This incapacity justify intensive prolonged multidisciplinary rehabilitation , optimize robotics . The investigator team develop robot design rehabilitate upper limb . This robot allow patient perform active , passive , assisted exercise . The system also able assess movement quality provide feedback patient therapist via graphical interface . This therapy design improve functional recovery patient , quality life . Few quality study evaluate efficacy robotic assist therapy patient acute stage rehabilitation ( &lt; 3 month post stroke ) improvement observe . Thus , aim study objectify effectiveness robotic-assisted rehabilitation acute stage stroke evaluate 3 field ICF ( International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ) perform prospective multicenter randomize control single blind trial . In study , 60 stroke patient recruit randomized two group . All patient receive similar classical rehabilitation basis . Patients control experimental group receive supplement classical rehabilitation robotic-assisted therapy , respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Interactive Robot Rehabilitation Upper Limb Acute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The cerebral vascular accident affect two people per thousand year ( Duncan et al . 2005 ) . This injury lead cause permanent disability population . The brain damage express different neurological impairment functional disability . These disability justify intensive sustain multidisciplinary rehabilitation reduce neurological impairment , improve activity participation patient , , ultimately , quality life ( Duncan et al. , 2005 ) . Recently appear rehabilitation stimulate maximum brain plasticity robotic device meet actual recommendation exist stroke 's rehabilitation ( Langhorne et al. , 2011 ) . Indeed , robot allow execution large number movement whose quality control . A visual interface give patient feedback movement , offer exercise orient functional task mean possibly dive virtual reality . All element justify clinical development robot assist therapist ( Pignolo et al . 2009 ) . The therapeutic efficacy robot rehabilitation upper limb evaluate especially chronic stroke patient ( &gt; 6 month stroke ) ( Mehrholz et al. , 2012 ) . Unfortunately , quality study conduct patient acute stage rehabilitation , potential brain plasticity important large functional progress observe ( Stinear et al . 2012 ) . In addition , study evaluate effect therapy robotic three field ICF ( Mehrholz et al. , 2012 ) . Many study focus impairment ( e.g . muscle strength ) without assess functional ability patient activity daily live . OBJECTIVES To perform multicenter , single blind , randomize , control trial ass efficacy robotic-assisted therapy acute stroke patient evaluate three field ICF . METHODS Patients include Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc ( Brussels , Belgique ) center William Lennox ( Ottignies , Belgique ) . The patient randomise two group ( control experimental ) , use stratify randomization method ensure equivalence two group motor neurological impairment ( score Fugl-Meyer ) . This randomization organize independently centre participate study . The study statistical power show 27 patient per group necessary . This study power take account statistical power desire 99 % , minimum detectable change 0.09 standard deviation 0.08 upper limb kinematics patient ( Gilliaux et al . 2014 ) . In estimate risk drop 10 % , investigator plan recruit 60 patient . In centre , acute phase , patient receive daily multidisciplinary rehabilitation ( physiotherapy , occupational therapy , speech therapy , ... ) less intensive ( 60 300 min ) . In experimental group , one daily therapy devote rehabilitation robot , 4 time week 9 week . The control group benefit conventional treatment . As , duration support similar two group . All treatment administer therapist specialize neurological rehabilitation . Patients evaluate three time study : start treatment , end treatment , 6 month stroke event . All assessment carry therapist inform group patient assign ( single-blind ) . PERSPECTIVES From study , investigator hope demonstrate efficacy robotic-assisted therapy acute stroke patient evaluate three field ICF . These result could prove tool significant complement stroke rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
