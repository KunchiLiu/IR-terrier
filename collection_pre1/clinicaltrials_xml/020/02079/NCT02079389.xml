	<brief_summary>The following project deal Danish multicenter trial evaluate value Laparoscopic Ultrasound examination ( LUS ) laparoscopic surgery colon rectum cancer ( CRC ) . The project `` The value laparoscopic ultrasound patient undergo laparoscopic resection colon rectum cancer . - A prospective randomize trial '' part ph.d- study University Southern Denmark collaboration several surgical department hospital Southern Denmark . The primary purpose investigate whether use laparoscopic ultrasound examination ( LUS ) change stage tumor , lymph node metastasis ( TNM stage ) surgical approach patient undergo laparoscopic surgery colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . As secondary objective ; evaluation use LUS change treatment strategy individual patient CRC . As objective want investigate whether use contrast enhance ultrasound examination connection LUS procedure increase number detect liver metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value Laparoscopic Ultrasound Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Resection Cancer Colon Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery cancer colon rectum seem equal standing open surgery regard morbidity , mortality oncologic result ( radicality re-lapse frequency long-term survival ) . Laparoscopic surgery colon rectum cancer well-understood well-established surgical method , randomize trial deal long-term result . The late inventory work call good documentation long-term result call randomized study . Despite , number laparoscopic operation colorectal cancer ( CRC ) Denmark increase , laparoscopic surgery partially become established standard treatment CRC . Liver metastases frequent patient CRC 15-20 % patient already metastases diagnosis . Ultrasound examination open surgery ( IOUS ) show important diagnostic tool high sensitivity ( 98 % ) positive predictive value ( 86 % ) detection liver metastasis undiagnosed preoperative compute tomography scan ( CT ) Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan ( PET-CT ) . IOUS consider gold standard hepatic metastasis within open surgery CRC . In laparoscopic surgery option disappears , likely Laparoscopic Ultrasound examination ( LUS ) , may provide information found IOUS . While laparoscopy laparoscopic ultrasound examination ( LUS ) well establish stag treatment upper gastrointestinal cancer , method sparsely evaluate treatment CRC . There old data deal use LUS Tumor - lymph Node Metastases ( TNM ) stag patient cancer colon rectum . Several small study investigate use LUS evaluate M-stage laparoscopic colorectal surgery study show increased detection liver metastasis . Overall , seem LUS well current pre-operative image modality , LUS IOUS also find able locate small tumor colon . Based , recent review conclude data routine use laparoscopy LUS patient CRC sufficient , LUS probably could use assessment liver , liver-metastases non-regional lymph node . There randomized study deal use LUS laparoscopic surgery CRC . It standard routine use LUS liver , tumor retroperitoneum laparoscopic surgery CRC . In prospective blind study percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination ( CEUS ) liver prove able detect significantly liver metastasis CRC conventional percutaneous ultrasound . With new second-generation contrast agent CEUS seem equivalent contrast-enhanced CT Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detection liver-metastases . Liver metastases frequent patient CRC use intraoperative ultrasound ( IOUS ) open surgery CRC , previously regard gold standard . Contrast-enhanced IOUS ( CE-IOUS ) open surgery CRC sparsely evaluate , show increase sensitivity detection liver-metastases . There hand , find literature describe use laparoscopic CE-IOUS laparoscopic surgery CRC . With project want elucidate whether use LUS laparoscopic surgery CRC alter patient 's TNM stage surgical approach whether potential change clinical consequence individual patient . Furthermore , wish investigate whether contrast-enhanced LUS increase detection rate liver metastasis . Method The study design prospective , randomized multicenter study include 280 patient . At Department Surgery , Odense University Hospital , annually conduct around 150 laparoscopic resection CRC , department select patient material . To get representative sample patient CRC , get include many patient possible within give timeframe , project therefore conduct multicenter study . The participate center perform laparoscopic CRC surgery high level , technical equipment necessary scanning competency available department involve . Prior start project , surgeon include department trained LUS method , assessment description intra-abdominal finding standardize . They include patient randomly assign either department 's standard laparoscopic surgery standard laparoscopic surgery plus LUS examination . In standard arm condition abdomen assess laparoscopy immediately prior resection . In second group intra-abdominal condition also assess laparoscopy , supplement LUS examination primary tumor , liver retroperitoneum . Both laparoscopy LUS take place prior operation require intervention additional porthole . If LUS examination find undiagnosed liver metastasis lymph node outside plan operation field , patient send Department Surgery A , Odense University Hospital , multidisciplinary tumor conference . In case LUS examination suspect liver metastasis / remove lymph node metastases patient include project Department Surgery A , Odense University Hospital , intraoperative LUS-guided fine-needle aspirations- biopsy ( FNA ) tru-cut biopsy perform marked little silver pin . The latter use follow-up pretreatment locate potential rest tumor . All patient follow Departments usual routine adjuvant therapy . Those patient select laparoscopic resection Department A , University Hospital also offer participate contrast-enhanced laparoscopic Ultrasound examination surgery . A specialist skill contrast-enhanced ultrasound perform examination . Before contrast study perform surgeon note finding conventional LUS , patient examine University Hospital also part total material equal footing scan department . All patient include project undergo three-phase control compute tomography ( CT ) scan 3 month surgery . This evaluate whether might overlook metastasis laparoscopy LUS evaluation . All information patient enter recorded database . Information death deduct Civil Registration local administrative database . After completion inclusion patient , two arm compare account change TNM-stage surgical approach relation pre-operative assessment . The possible change evaluate strict , predefined criterion assess whatever clinical relevancy , finally potential effect contrast-enhanced LUS compare LUS alone assess .</detailed_description>
