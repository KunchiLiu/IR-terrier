	<detailed_description>We propose trial directly compare high intensity weight loss protocol moderate intensity weight loss protocol determine lead great improvement physical function severely obese old adult . We also interest compare safety two approach . If demonstrate effective weight reduction happen sufficient expediency impact improve physical functioning without increase adverse event severely obese old adult , sizable percentage population would benefit would significant reduction disability result cost saving healthcare system . This application specifically address objective 3 detailed announcement pilot funding mechanism ( Objective 3 . To develop reliably test clinical pre-clinical study novel intervention target adiposity , peripheral central nervous system , vascular , body composition and/or musculoskeletal related factor prevent age-related decline physical function prevent reverse progression disability ) . This application describe pilot randomize , control trial design address follow aim : - Assess efficacy safety high intensity medical weight management severely obese ( = stage II BMI ) old adult functional outcome ( i.e. , functional weight loss ) compare moderate intensity weight loss intervention . - Determine potential dose response relationship exist weight loss volume ( primarily excess fat ) improvement several measure physical function . - Identify change body composition ( fat lean include bone ) associate change physical function . - Identify biomarkers ( specific focus marker inflammation ) provide potential mechanistic link weight reduction change physical function severely obese old adult . Our primary hypothesis great improvement physical function high intensity weight loss intervention compare moderate intensity intervention .</detailed_description>
