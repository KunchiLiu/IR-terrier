	<detailed_description>Aim 1 test efficacy personalize high protein weight loss intervention compare low protein intervention use USDA MyPlate nutrition guide . It hypothesize participant randomly assign high protein dietary treatment lose weight base BMI-Z score 12 week compare participant low dietary protein treatment . Aim 2 test change subjective rating appetite differ dietary treatment ( i.e . protein intake ) . It hypothesize participant higher protein intervention report decrease hunger increase fullness compare participant low protein intervention . Aim 3 test change hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) measure rate limit step glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase ( GFAT ) glycosylation measure O-linked N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) transferase ( OGT ) differ dietary treatment . It hypothesize participant randomly assign high protein dietary treatment decrease change baseline level GFAT glycosylation ( OGT ) due decrease carbohydrate intake compare low protein treatment . Exploratory Aims : As exploratory aim , investigator test high protein lower protein dietary treatment differentially alter glucose , insulin , cholesterol , triglyceride ( marker metabolic syndrome ) .</detailed_description>
