	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale There currently objective , validated measure paravalvular leak ( PVL ) echocardiogram ( Lerakis et al ) . The PARTNER 2 year outcomes demonstrate even mild PVL associate poor prognosis ( Kodali et al ) decrease survival transaortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) . It propose severity PVL could measure base comparison jet arc length pressure half-time color Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) circumference valve annulus parasternal short-axis view . Accordingly , jet arc correspond &lt; 10 % annulus circumference indicate mild PVL , 10-20 % moderate PVL , &gt; 20 % severe PVL . However , grade method still need validated independent reference standard Cardiac MRI ( cMRI ) . Cardiac MRI ( cMRI ) reliable way measure PVL post-TAVR . It enable measurement regurgitant volume regurgitant fraction use gradient echo-based phase-contrast sequence velocity flow mapping , accurately measure forward stroke volume backward regurgitant flow across valve . Being independent jet morphology , cMRI may superior way follow patient post-TAVR . cMRI provide quantitative assessment regurgitant fraction therefore serve reference standard validation TTE-based grading scheme . Study Procedures Patients see The Heart Hospital Baylor Plano ( THHBP ) enrol study eligible provide write consent . Upon enrollment , demographic clinical risk factor data collect patient . All patient receive TTE cMRI , within 1 week , 30 day ± 14 day , 6 month ± 30 day , 1 year ± 60 day follow visit post-TAVR . TTE usually perform follow-up visit part routine clinical work . All female childbearing age urine pregnancy test prior cMRI . Patients assign PVL severity grade accord two diagnostic method Dr. Grayburn ( TTEs ) , Dr. Gopal ( cMRIs ) . Both investigator blind grade result . Risk/Benefit MRI use ionize radiation ( high-energy radiation potentially cause damage DNA , like x-ray use CT scan ) . There know harmful side-effects associate temporary exposure strong magnetic field use MRI scanner . However , important safety concern consider perform undergo MRI scan ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) : - The magnet may cause pacemaker , artificial limb , implant medical device contain metal malfunction heat exam . - Any loose metal object may cause damage injury get pull toward magnet . - If contrast agent use , slight risk allergic reaction . MRI contrast agent cause problem patient significant kidney disease . - Dyes tattoo tattooed eyeliner cause skin eye irritation . - Medication patch cause skin burn . - The wire lead use monitor electrocardiogram ( ECG ) trace respiration scan must place carefully avoid cause skin burn . - Prolonged exposure radio wave scan could lead slight warm body . There known risk TTE . During procedure , technician obtain view heart move transducer different location chest abdominal wall . The transducer send sound wave chest pick echo reflect different part heart ( Cleveland Clinic ) . Minimization Risk Patient safety study high priority . All diagnostic tests/treatments provide commonly accepted FDA approve . These test/treatments would provide part patient ' post-operative follow patient incur additional health risk subject study . The patient incur psychological , social , legal economic risk participate study . Benefits Subjects directly benefit research . The result study may provide important information medical imaging option future valve replacement patient . Adverse Events Adverse Events ( AEs ) purpose trial include AEs related TTE MRI .</detailed_description>
