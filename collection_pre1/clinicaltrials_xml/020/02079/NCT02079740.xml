	<brief_title>Trametinib Navitoclax Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity trametinib combination navitoclax , maximal dos drug safely administer together . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine response rate combination trametinib navitoclax subject KRAS NRAS mutation-positive advance metastatic solid tumor disease-specific expansion cohort . ( Phase II ) III . To confirm safety tolerability trametinib navitoclax combination recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine Phase 1b portion . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics drug administer together . ( Phase Ib ) II . To assess evidence response therapy . ( Phase Ib ) III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic response therapy tumor biopsy . ( Phase Ib ) IV . To evaluate pharmacodynamic response therapy tumor biopsy ( first 15 patient enrol overall ) . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) navitoclax PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If unacceptable toxicity observe , patient may receive trametinib PO QD day 1-14 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
