	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study safety drug distribution radioactive drug , 2'-deoxy-2'- [ 18F ] fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil ( fluorine F 18 d-FMAU [ 18F-FMAU ] ) , image positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) patient advance cancer . A PET scan procedure small amount radioactive glucose ( sugar ) inject vein , scanner use make detailed , computerized picture area inside body glucose take . Because cancer cell often take glucose normal cell , picture use find cancer cell body . PET/CT use drug fluorine F 18 d-FMAU , may help find cancer find far disease spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FMAU PET/CT Imaging Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine radiation dosimetry 18F-FMAU human , confirm absence adverse event human intravenous ( i.v . ) injection 18F-FMAU PET imaging , characterize incidence circulate metabolite 18F-FMAU human . II . To simply find whether visual uptake change 18F-FMAU tumor post-therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive fluorine F 18 d-FMAU IV follow PET/CT prior start cancer treatment . Patients may undergo 2 additional scan one week prior second course chemotherapy completion cancer treatment depend cancer type .</detailed_description>
