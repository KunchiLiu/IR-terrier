	<brief_summary>This trial use ultra high-resolution ultrasound system specialized transducer , intend use prostate imaging . The system 's image resolution significantly well standard care , due high frequency . This allow system visualize suspicious area structure , great accuracy guide biopsy . The primary objective study demonstrate ultra high-resolution transrectal ultrasound ( UHR-TRUS ) superior conventional low-resolution transrectal ultrasound ( LR-TRUS ) detect clinically significant cancer among men without know prostate cancer indication prostate biopsy . The secondary objective study compare difference rate detection clinically significant cancer LR-TRUS UHR-TRUS , investigator training investigator training . The tertiary objective investigation compare combine sensitivity specificity determine cancer detection overall image-guided biopsy UHR-TRUS vs. LR-TRUS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-arm multi-centre randomize trial LR-TRUS versus UHR-TRUS guide prostate biopsy men know history prostate cancer . This trial enroll minimum 800 maximum 2000 patient regular interim analysis determine trial 's final sample size . These number base predictive probability trial success . The investigation design comparative non-blinded analysis LR-TRUS vs. UHR-TRUS . Participants randomize either high-resolution low resolution ultrasound equal chance either group . The randomization scheme stratify centre . When subject arrive institution biopsy , Study Coordinator open seal envelope indicate study participant physician whether procedure perform use LR-TRUS UHR-TRUS . All subject indication prostate biopsy , thus , inclusion non-treatment group would necessitate group men receive standard care . As , control group subject population . Procedures study : - obtain informed consent subject - collect pre-biopsy information record case report form ( CRF ) - perform biopsy procedure - record biopsy detail CRF - prepare biopsy specimens pathology Data CRFs store proprietary database access web-based interface , access limit login password . No subject-identifiable information enter database . The primary endpoint detection clinically significant prostate cancer , i.e. , number men clinically significant prostate cancer determine pathology review among men randomize biopsied . Pathological analysis 12-core biopsy sample mechanism use determine study subject prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
