	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately two third patient stroke experience impaired arm motor function , compromise independence activity daily live , occupational area quality life . High intensity train challenge task many repetition key factor regain motor function stroke . Novel virtual reality ( VR ) rehabilitation system provide potential increase intensity offer challenge motivating task . The efficacy VR system demonstrate yet sufficiently power study . Methods : In study 120 patient 5 participate Norwegian , Danish Belgian rehabilitation institution randomize either group receive VR train addition conventional arm training group receive dose-matched therapist attention-matched conventional arm-training . During period 4 week patient offer additional 4-5 training session weekly 45-60 minute duration physiotherapist occupational therapist . Arm motor function , dexterity independence daily life activity evaluate baseline , post 3 month follow-up assessment Action Research Arm Test , Box Blocks Test Functional Independence Measure . Patient satisfaction therapist satisfaction implementation new technology base rehabilitation system also assess questionnaire interview . Objective : The objective VIRTUES trial study effectiveness acceptance novel VR training approach . The study provide evidence-based knowledge new virtual reality base treatment strategy clinician , patient health economist .</detailed_description>
