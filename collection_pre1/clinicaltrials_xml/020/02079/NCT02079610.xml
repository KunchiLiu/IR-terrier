	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether upregulating leave amygdala positive autobiographical memory recall via real time functional magnetic resonance image neurofeedback lead improvement clinician administer rating depressive symptom . The investigator predict patient major depressive disorder receiving leave amygdala neurofeedback increase amygdala response positive autobiographical memory recall compare receive control feedback region involve emotional processing ability associate clinically significant improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Amygdala Neurofeedback Depressive Symptoms Processing Biases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) lead cause year live disability worldwide . Traditional pharmacological and/or psychological intervention ineffective one-half patient , treatment ( electroconvulsive therapy , vagus nerve stimulation , deep brain stimulation ) available severely ill patient respond standard intervention invasive , associate potentially significant side effect . Therefore , need explore develop novel non-invasive treatment . One non-invasive method real-time functional magnetic resonance image neurofeedback ( rtfMRI-nf ) , allow person see regulate fMRI signal brain . Emerging evidence suggest rtfMRI-nf clinical utility reduce symptom chronic pain , tinnitus , Parkinson 's disease . The goal current study leverage recent advance rtfMRI-nf determine whether procedure adapt treatment MDD . While amygdala activity exaggerate response negative stimulus MDD , evidence suggest amygdala response positive stimulus attenuate MDD normalizes remission . Therefore , target rtfMRI-nf procedure leave amygdala . Participants randomly assign receive rtfMRI-nf either leave amygdala leave horizontal segment intraparietal sulcus ( HIPS ; region involve emotional processing ) increase activity within region target level think positive autobiographical memory . This neurofeedback condition alternate period rest counting backwards order allow participant disengage memory contemplation . A final run without neurofeedback information include determine whether participant maintain learned amygdala elevation positive memory recall absence neurofeedback . Participants complete two session within one-week period . Clinical rating take time scan determine whether amygdala rtfMRI-nf procedure result improvement depression symptom , change within emotional regulation network occur successful amygdala regulation examine . Furthermore , investigator aim determine whether rtfMRI-nf procedure alter assessment emotional processing conduct within three day prior , follow completion , rtfMRI-nf procedure . Specific Aim 1 : In individual MDD , determine degree rtfMRI-nf enhances voluntary control neural activity amygdala , co-modulates brain region within emotion regulation circuitry , alters depressive symptom severity rating . - Hypothesis 1.1 : MDD participant receive rtfMRI-nf regard blood oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) activity within amygdala learn voluntarily regulate activity response positive stimulus . MDD participant receive rtfMRI-nf regarding leave amygdala activity demonstrate great activity region contemplate positive autobiographical memory ( AMs ) MDD participant receive rtfMRI-nf regard BOLD activity leave HIPS , region involve emotion . - Hypothesis 1.2 : The investigator hypothesize enhance control amygdala via rtfMRI-nf increase connectivity strengths amygdala prefrontal region involve modulate emotional behavior include pregenual anterior cingulate cortex ventromedial prefrontal cortex . - Hypothesis 1.3 : The investigator hypothesize participant show great enhancement amygdala activity response rtfMRI-nf also show great improvement depressive symptom severity rating end study . Specific Aim 2 : In MDD patient , determine degree rtfMRI-nf amygdala restores normative mood-congruent processing bias process emotionally valenced stimulus . - Hypothesis 2.1 : During performance backward mask task emotional face present conscious awareness , investigator hypothesize MDD participant initially show process bias toward negative stimulus amygdala reverse processing bias toward positive stimulus participant receive active vs HIPS rtfMRI-nf - Hypothesis 2.2 : The investigator hypothesize MDD patient initially show mood-congruent processing bias toward negative stimulus P1Vital Emotional Test Battery reverse bias toward positive stimulus follow amygdala ( vs HIPS ) rtfMRI-nf . Results project lead new insight plastic neurobiological mechanism govern recovery MDD promote novel , non-invasive approach MDD treatment .</detailed_description>
