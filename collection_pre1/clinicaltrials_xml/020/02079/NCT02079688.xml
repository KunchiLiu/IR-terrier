	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) chronic chronic recur inflammatory skin disorder . Patients suffer eczema often severe pruritus affect skin , well frequent complication secondary infection . Next genetically predetermine defect epidermal barrier function vegetative dysfunction , AD arise upregulation Th2-modified immune response induce increased IgE-antibody production , cytokine secretion subsequently , local inflammation . Although standard therapy AD , modern topical corticosteroid , show good ratio therapeutic effect side effect , retain moderate acceptance due non-specific action , strict compliance requirement possible adverse effect . As new alternative , calcineurin inhibitor show few side effect raise concern regard long term risk include possibility skin carcinogenicity . Therefore , medical need remain novel therapy major public health problem , direct particular specific early disease-causing mechanism and/or molecular target , improve efficacy , safety compliance . Novel therapeutic strategy treatment chronic inflammatory disease target early disease-causing mechanism promise approach treatment AD . The transcription factor GATA-3 represent key regulatory factor Th2-driven immune response . It indispensable differentiation activation Th2 cell ; integrate Th2 signal induces Th2 cytokine expression . The investigational product SB011 contain DNAzyme hgd40 target GATA-3 . By cleave GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production thereby reduce key feature allergic airway inflammation . DNAzymes completely generate chemical synthesis produce Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) control condition . The DNAzymes biological drug , i.e . generate use live organism include cell culture bacteria . The molecule highly water-soluble apply water/oil/water ( W/O/W ) formulation since multiple emulsion show protect active ingredient degradation skin penetration enhance property comparison carrier system . This proof-of-concept study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) topical formulation SB011 contain 2 % hgd40 twice daily ( BID ) patient mild moderate atopic eczema .</brief_summary>
