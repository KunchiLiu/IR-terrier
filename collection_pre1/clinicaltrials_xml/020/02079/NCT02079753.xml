	<brief_summary>Introduction : Portable oxygen device simplify facilitate patient therapy . This study design compare oxygen saturation patient satisfaction portable oxygen concentrator combine system consist fix device continuous flow oxygen dispensation portable device pulse dispensation ambulation . Methods : This cross-over trial assess 25 patient COPD ( 92 % men ; mean age 72.2 ± 7.4 year ; mean FEV 34.14 ± 12.51 % ) four hospital Madrid . All patient previously use combined system , consist fix oxygenation system portable system ambulation , 16 ( 64 % ) use stationary portable concentrators 9 ( 36 % ) use stationary reservoir portable liquid oxygen bag . Oxygenation settings rest walking determine baseline . Patients maintain previous combined system one week switch portable oxygen concentrator one week . Mean SpO2 24 hour calculate software oximeter , compliance monitor</brief_summary>
