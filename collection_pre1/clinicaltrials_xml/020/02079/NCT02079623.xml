	<brief_title>Electroporation ( NanoKnife ) Treatment Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer high mortality 5-year survival rate le 10 % . Even though pancreatic cancer account 2-3 % cancer case , 4th lead cause cancer death . The best prognosis observe patient , tumor confine pancreas , curative resection feasible . This account 5-12 % patient . After complete surgical resection , patient median survival 15-25 month 5-year survival rate 8-15 % . Approximately 40 % patient pancreatic cancer metastatic disease time diagnosis , significantly bad prognosis median survival 6-12 month low long-term survival ( le 1 % ) . The remain 40-50 % patient locally advanced disease ( LAPC ) without metastasis . It possible complete surgical resection LAPC tumor infiltrate surround tissue blood vessel . These patient also severe prognosis poor long-term survival median survival time approximately 12 month . The majority patient LAPC offer palliative chemotherapy standard treatment . Few patient offer downstaging chemo-radiotherapy . In rare case downstaging result extensively tumor shrink enable subsequently surgical resection . However , majority patient remain none-resectable candidate palliative/symptomatic treatment . Electroporation new local treatment tumor . Tumor cell exposed series direct current impulse high voltage ( 1500 V / cm ) milliseconds duration . Electroporation originally use enhance sensitivity tumor cell certain cytotoxic agent increase permeability cell membrane . Later find direct current sufficiently high voltage destroy cell membrane cancer cell without damage surround connective tissue blood vessel . By modulate length impulse voltage , cell-killing effect achieve without significant heating tissue , reduces risk thermal damage . Electroporation differs way form local treatment radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , act heat coagulation tissue . The aim study implement electroporation therapy ( NanoKnife ) treatment patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Electroporation therapy ( NanoKnife ) give addition standard chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
