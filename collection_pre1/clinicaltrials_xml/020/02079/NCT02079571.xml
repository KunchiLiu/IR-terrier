From perspective TCM , constitution , disease , herbal medicine food divide two major category , i.e. , cold hot . Therefore , dietary therapy claim attribute food use oppose constitution order harmonize organ function maintain human vitality . The true benefit dietary therapy consider reestablishment harmonious balance cold hot , repletion vacuity , within human body . Previous study report capillary red blood cell ( RBC ) velocity nail fold microcirculation ( NFM ) subject hot constitution accelerate significantly take hot attribute age ginger tea , might result elevated vagal activity lead arteriole dilation subject . In contrast , subject cold constitution , capillary RBC velocity decelerate significantly skin temperature decrease markedly take cold-attribute coconut water , might induce sympathetic nerve activation cause arteriole constrict . As result , use capillary RBC velocity NFM measure laser Doppler anemometer may promise way classify attribute food ingredient commonly use Chinese medicine dietary therapy accordance different personal constitution . Accordingly , worthwhile task establish modern scientific methodology define attribute food ingredient . The aim project investigate relationship food attribute physiological signal produce healthy young subject different constitution . In first year project , investigator start determine pulse wave produce healthy subject different constitution Smart Pulse Wave Health Evaluation System ( S-PULSE ) . Then , investigator investigate relationship food attribute , channel entry physiological signal . Hopefully , result leverage powerful integration capacity within National Taiwan University ( NTU ) campus build hub global TCM cloud .</brief_summary>
