	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer ( PCa ) one deadly cancer 5-year survival rate le 10 % . The majority PCa find none-resectable time diagnosis . Only 10 - 20 % patient offer surgical treatment , chance cure . The mean survival time none-resected patient 3 6 month . Despite surgical treatment many patient experience recurrence . The high overall mortality mainly cause difficulty early diagnosis due unspecific/lack symptom early stage disease . Patients resectable tumor co-morbidity , 5-year survival rate 54 % . This indicate early detection disease , enable complete surgical resection tumor , way improve survival . Chronic pancreatitis one know risk factor PCa . Currently valid diagnostic marker PCa . Diagnosis require advanced method several invasive entail risk complication . A blood-based marker pancreatic cancer would major achievement great benefit patient , may even use screening . During development cancer change DNA arise , include DNA hypermethylation methyl residue attach DNA . The methylation frequently occur regulatory region gene lead inactivity . Some inactivated gene necessary ensure control cell growth . When gene inactivate , cell longer subject normal control mechanism may eventually develop cancer cell . Small amount DNA release blood detect blood sample . The DNA change may tumor specific potentially useable marker PCa . In 2012 research unit cooperation Department Molecular Diagnostic , Aalborg University Hospital publish optimized method detection hypermethylated DNA plasma . The method greatly improve sensitivity . The purpose study test whether alteration DNA hypermethylations blood use : - A diagnostic marker pancreatic cancer . - A prognostic marker pancreatic cancer . - A marker recurrence . - Monitoring patient chronic pancreatitis detect patient particularly high risk develop pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
