	<brief_summary>In project , investigator want analyse capacity Acetylsalicylic acid hydoxychlroquin ( HCQ ) induce Immune Quiescence ( IQ ) phenotype , previously associate natural protection HIV infection . This phenotype characterize low expression gene involve cellular activation , low resting level inflammatory cytokine production , low level systemic activate T cell , increased level systemic T regulatory , increased production anti-viral anti-protease serpins female genital tract reduce number HIV target cell ( mainly CD4+ CCR5+ T cell ) FGT ( female genital tract ) . The objective study determine daily oral administration Acetylsalicylic acid hydroxychlroroquin reduce systemic mucosal immune activation HIV negative woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inducing Immune Quiescence Prevent HIV Infection Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator enrol 80 non female sex work low-risk HIV negative woman 80 HIV negative female sex worker HIV negative form Nairobi , Kenya follow 3 month period . During first month , sample take monthly basis - blood , - vaginal sample : cytobrush/scarper cervico vaginal lavage ( CVL ) . This do determine baseline level systemic mucosal immune activation woman . In way , every woman act control thereby reduce variation control participant . Chemokine/cytokine level , well cellular immune activation T regulatory cell assess . At month two : woman divide two different arm ( oral administration hydroxychloroquine : 200mg/day Acetylsalicylic acid 81mg/day ) follow , monthly basis , 8 additional week . During time , monthly blood vaginal sample ( cytobrush/scraper CVL ) investigator take . They measure change systemic mucosal immune activation . Immune Quiescence phenotype ( decrease T cell immune activation , low immune gene activation expression pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression ) evaluate flow cytometry , microarray , multiplex bead array technology . Here sample take : 1 . A sample cervical mucus collect use cotton swab rotate 360º cervical o , second swab use collect secretion posterior vaginal fornix . Both swabs transfer single vial contain 5 mL phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) transport laboratory test culture sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea , chlamydia etc . 2 . Cervical cell collect use small brush wooden spatula . Both specimen transfer 15ml conical tube contain 5 ml PBS . This specimen use characterize cellular population specimen . 3 . Cervico vaginal lavage perform wash endocervix 2 ml sterile 1x PBS . The liquid collect form posterior fornix . Samples place conical tube , centrifuge remove cellular debris supernatant store -70°C ship liquid nitrogen dry shipper Winnipeg , Manitoba . Those specimen use innate soluble factor detection ( chemokines , cytokine , antibody , innate protein , etc 4 . 30ml venous blood take . ( Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells extract immune activation analysis , DNA use immune gene expression , plasma use protein innate soluble factor detection . )</detailed_description>
