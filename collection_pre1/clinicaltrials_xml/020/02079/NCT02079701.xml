	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine clinical benefit employ 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine among US military trainee . Secondary objective include : - determine etiology clinical pneumonia among U.S. military trainee ; - comparing serotype distribution S. pneumoniae ( Sp ) isolate recover vaccinated nonvaccinated trainee diagnose pneumonia ; - comparing day lose training due pneumonia acute respiratory disease vaccinate nonvaccinated subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participant . Given documented high rate respiratory illness , US military trainee select participation . A sample size 166,744 person-years calculate base follow assumption : 12 % attrition military training , clinical pneumonia attack rate 11 case per 1000 person-years , 20 % captured pneumonia cause Sp , 90 % capture Sp pneumonia cause vaccine-covered Sp strain , 70 % vaccine efficacy . Enrollment follow-up . This study approve multiple Department Defense ( DoD ) institutional review board . Using informed consent process , basic training recruit 5 recruit training center ( South Carolina , Missouri , Illinois , California ) invite participate first week training . Pregnancy screen performed woman , positive result enrol . Exclusion criterion include previously receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine previous 5 year medical condition either require precluded pneumococcal vaccination . Study participant complete study questionnaire administer pre-packaged , blind , randomize injection contain either 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Merck &amp; Company , Inc. ) saline 1:1 ratio . Study injection administer time recruit in-processing vaccination , may include vaccine polio , measles-mumps-rubella , varicella , tetanus-diphtheria , hepatitis A virus , hepatitis B virus , meningococcal disease ( A/C/Y/W135 ) , influenza . At end recruit training , questionnaire administer capture symptom sign illness might miss capture active passive surveillance . As enrollment continue two year , person-year contribution first enrol great enrol near trial 's end . The original planned surveillance period 1.7 year . This later extend 6.7 year enrollment first participant , continue monitor impact large double-blinded trial . Specimen collection . During active surveillance period , study participant suspect pneumonia identify attend physician . Study personnel obtain three throat swab , blood culture ( aerobic anaerobic ) , sputum sample ( producible ) , acute serum sample participant . Attempts make also capture convalescent serum sample 2 week acute presentation radiographically-confirmed pneumonia case . These attempt always successful . Barriers include : trainee discharge military service , difficulty obtain access recruit field exercise , recruit graduate move new duty station . Laboratory method . Specimens collect study participant examine use classic , molecular , serologic laboratory method Naval Health Research Center ( NHRC ) Respiratory Disease Laboratory , College American Pathologist ( CAP ) accredit laboratory . NHRC isolate adenovirus , influenza , parainfluenza , respiratory syncytial virus pharyngeal swab use fluorescent antibody antigen test . Adenovirus influenza isolates type use standard viral identification technique . Sputum specimens inoculate Sp culture use standard technique . When Sp specie identify , capsular serotyping perform , standard antimicrobial sensitivity assess . Paired acute convalescent serum assess IgM IgG titer pneumolysin . Sera test enzyme immunoassay use procedure describe Kalin , M , et al . For Chlamydophila pneumoniae polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) study , throat swab collect patient diagnose pneumonia , immediately place Chlamydia transport medium , transport ice . The throat swab use direct PCR method , procedure describe Campbell et al . Amplification product analyze electrophoresis 1.5 % agarose gel standard method . Sample preparation , PCR amplification , analysis amplification product perform separate room . To assess M. pneumoniae , throat swab collect immediately place 2.0 ml M. pneumoniae transport medium ( SP-4 broth ) . Culturing , sub-culturing , molecular testing perform per previously publish protocol . Capturing disease outcome . Outcome measure include cause pneumonia , cause respiratory disease , recruit training clinical pneumonia ( radiographically-confirmed recruit training period ) , day lose training . Active surveillance conduct radiographically-confirmed pneumonia recruit training period ( Marines—12 week , Navy—8 week , Army—9 week ) . Passive electronic monitoring health care encounter outcomes recruit train clinical pneumonia take place recruit training subsequent duty station use DoD comprehensive electronic database outpatient healthcare encounter ( SADR ) , inpatient encounter ( SIDR ) , encounter civilian facility bill DoD ( HCSR ) . ICD-9-CM cod 480 -486 487 monitor outcome throughout entire study period . Meningitis case ( ICD-9-CM cod 320 -320.2 , 320.9 , 322.9 ) also capture electronic database . Statistical analysis . After descriptive investigation population characteristic , univariate analysis perform assess significance association demographic variable acute respiratory infection , pneumonia , radiographically-confirmed pneumonia . Active surveillance time calculate participant 's enrollment date project completion training , diagnosis radiographically-confirmed pneumonia . Passive surveillance calculate date enrollment June 01 2007 , diagnosis pneumonia acute respiratory infection , separation active duty service , whichever occur first . Using regression diagnostics , collinearity among variable investigate . Cox 's proportional hazard time-to-event modeling use evaluate outcome among study participant , adjust difference population characteristic treatment arm account different enrollment date active passive surveillance period . The saturated Cox regression model reduce manual backward stepwise elimination approach remove variable insignificant α = 0.05 level confound measure association . Additionally , cumulative probability outcomes enrollment end follow-up period graph . Statistical model produce adjust hazard ratio ( HRs ) associate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) perform use Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) software ( Version 9.0 , SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , North Carolina ) . Crude vaccine effectiveness measure outcome calculated participant branch service use 1-relative risk x 100 % estimate . Days lose training estimate use survey administer end training convenience sample 71,692 study participant . Differences treatment arm evaluate use ANOVA .</detailed_description>
