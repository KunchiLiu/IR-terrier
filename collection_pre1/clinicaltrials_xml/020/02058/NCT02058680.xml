	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety efficacy vaccine direct prostate tumor cell . The researcher interested evaluate safety tolerability vaccine , effect vaccine survivability , time measurable disease , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level blood , immune response vaccine . Eligible patient include recurrent prostate cancer show elevated level PSA , although evidence tumor measurable image study . In addition , eligible patient must prostate cancer either treat hormonal therapy responsive hormonal therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1A/1B Study PSA/IL-2/GM-CSF Vaccine Recurrent Prostate Cancer Hormone Naive Hormone Independent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase 1A , hormone naive hormone independent patient enrol 1:1 ratio . All patient receive intradermal injection PSA/IL-2/GM-CSF induction vaccine Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 11 15 . In Phase 1B , initiate Phase 1A , first receive induction vaccine ( PSA/IL-2/GM-CSF ) accord schedule patient Phase 1A . Then , eligible Phase 1B patient , follow induction vaccine regimen , alternate maintenance vaccination administer follow : Weeks 23 , 31 , 39 , IL-2 alone administer ; Weeks 27 , 35 , 43 , complete vaccine ( PSA/IL-2/GM-CSF ) administer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Age great than18 year Rising serum PSA level document 3 value last 6 month prior study enrollment . Each value must great 2 week previous value . Patients rise PSA must either 1 ) prior definitive therapy include surgery radiation therapy ( hormonena誰ve , define hormonena誰ve patient patient receive hormone therapy past currently total testosterone great 50 ng/dL ) , 2 ) hormone suppressive therapy document surgical castration serum testosterone value le 50 ng/dL ( hormoneindependent ) . Patients must complete therapy least 6 month longer 20 year prior enrollment PSA value within 4 week start therapy le 20 ng/mL hormonena誰ve patient ( defined hormonena誰ve patient patient receive hormone therapy past currently total testosterone great 50 ng/dL ) less 60 ng/mL hormoneindependent patient . Patients must follow laboratory value : ANC great 1500/mcL , platelet count great 100,000/mcL , hemoglobin great 10 g/dL , bilirubin le 1.5 x upper limit normal , AST le 1.5 x upper limit normal Patients must adequate lung function , define oxygen saturation great equal 90 % pulse oximetry Patients must QTc interval less 450 msec Patients must adequate EGFR great 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ( per VA formula adjust gender race ) Patients female partner childbearing potential must use least one form Investigatorapproved contraception onstudy 30 day last administration study investigational therapy . Acceptable birth control option include : ) surgical sterilization ( subject and/or subject 's partner ) , b ) approve hormonal contraceptive therapy ( birth control pill , DepoProvera , Lupron Depot ) , c ) barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) use spermicide , ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Presence document neuroendocrine differentiation original pathology report Evidence metastatic disease Immune compromise patient include limited : systemic immune suppressive medication within 6 week enrol ; HIVpositive normal CD4 lymphocytes ( less 500 cell per microliter ) . Patients must test HIV seropositivity CD4 lymphocyte count eligible study Prior malignancy . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer great 3 year without evidence disease recurrence eligible Inability give inform consent Any condition , accord investigator , would make patient inappropriate study candidate . Patients pulmonary disease limit daily function require oxygen supplementation Patients significant cardiac disease include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition , history myocardial infarction within six month study entry , uncontrolled dysrhythmias , QTc great equal 450 msec Patients exist autoimmune disorder ( IL2 GMCSF carry theoretical clinical risk exacerbate underlie autoimmune disorder )</criteria>
