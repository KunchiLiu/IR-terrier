	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study enzalutamide add standard luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue therapy improve effect prostate cancer compare standard therapy LHRH analogue bicalutamide . Hormone therapies stop body produce block effect male sex hormone ( testosterone ) . Enzalutamide block effect male sex hormone responsible growth prostate cancer . Hormonal therapy low level testosterone among effective treatment prostate cancer spread area body ( metastasize ) . It yet know whether LHRH analogue therapy bicalutamide effective LHRH analogue therapy enzalutamide treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LHRH Analogue Therapy With Enzalutamide Bicalutamide Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare rate achieve prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) remission month 7 LHRH analogue therapy enzalutamide ( Arm A ) achieve LHRH analogue bicalutamide ( Arm B ) metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare primary endpoint race . II . To compare rate 2 type response treatment arm : measurable disease response ; PSA response . III . To compare 7 time-to-event endpoint treatment arm : duration overall response ( RD ) ; duration stable disease ( SDD ) ; time treatment failure ( TTF ) ; time-to-progression ( TTP ) ; TTP patient bone metastases ; progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To compare rate type toxicity treatment arm . V. To compare incidence rate skeletal related event ( SRE ) , time SRE , separately treatment arm . VI . To compare rate circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) response treatment arm . VIII . To explore molecular mechanism within androgen receptor pathway determine level chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) transmembrane protease , serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) -v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog ( ERG ) expression , androgen metabolism enzymes ; androgen receptor variant , length cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG ) repeat within androgen receptor gene , associate primary endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) undergo orchiectomy receive LHRH analogue therapy ( leuprolide acetate , goserelin acetate , Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] approve preparation ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive bicalutamide PO QD undergo orchiectomy receive LHRH analogue therapy Arm A . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma metastasis either start recently start LHRH analogue therapy . [ Late induction permit within 3 month start LHRH analogue therapy antiandrogen ] All patient initiate hormone therapy ( Early induction patient ) must elevate PSA ≥ 4 ng/ml within 28 day prior registration . For late induction registration , PSA must ≥ 4 ng/ml prior start androgen deprivation therapy ; either antiandrogen LHRH analogue GNRH antagonist .If patient antiandrogen , need discontinue least 7 day prior registration . Patients history prior neoadjuvant adjuvant hormone therapy eligible provide received twenty four less month hormone treatment ( single combination treatment , exclude orchiectomy ) . Both therapy ( neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormone therapy ) must discontinue least 6 month prior registration . This intended exclude patient might render indirectly androgen insensitive . There must plan receive concomitant chemotherapy , biological response modifier , radiation therapy hormonal therapy . Concomitant radiation therapy allow palliation severe pain/neuropathic compression . Prior concomitant use megestrol acetate treatment hot flash allow . Patients must performance status 0 2 Zubrod Criteria . Patients must recover major infection and/or surgical procedure , opinion investigator , significant active medical illness preclude protocol treatment survival . No prior malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell ( squamous cell ) skin cancer , superficial situ cancer bladder . For invasive cancer patient disease free least 3 year prior enrollment study . For patient bone scan must perform within 60 day prior registration tumor assessment . CT scan ( abdomen pelvis ) chest xray optional , must repeat used disease assessment . For late induction registration , tumor assessment image show metastatic disease must available prior start androgen deprivation therapy . Age 18 old willing able provide inform consent . Willingness swallow pill medical condition would interfere . Male patient female partner childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable method birth control ( one must include condom barrier method contraception ) start screen continue throughout study period 3 month final study drug administration . Patients also require use condom sex pregnant woman . Patient agree tumor tissue biopsy prior protocol enrollment . Post therapy biopsy optional . Patients treat GNRH antagonist willing switch LHRH analogue registration . Patients must one follow ) Low volume disease ( defined visceral metastasis &lt; 4 bone metastasis ) b ) candidate docetaxel base chemotherapy 3 ) refuse docetaxel chemotherapy History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke , significant brain trauma ) time past . Also , history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month Day 1 visit ; Known suspect brain metastasis active leptomeningeal disease ; Severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity , judgment Investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment ; Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/μL , platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL , hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL ) Screening visit . Total bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal Creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/L ( 2 mg/dL ) Clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction within 6 month ; Uncontrolled angina within 3 month ; Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , patient history congestive heart failure ( NYHA ) class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram multigated acquistion scan perform within 3 month result leave ventricular ejection fraction great equal 45 % ; History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) ; History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place ; Hypotension indicate systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) Screening visit ; Bradycardia indicate heart rate &lt; 50 beat per minute Screening ECG ; Uncontrolled hypertension indicate systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg Gastrointestinal disorder affect absorption ( e.g. , gastrectomy , active peptic ulcer disease within last 3 month ) ; Treatment concurrent 5α reductase inhibitor ( finasteride , dutasteride ) , estrogens , and/or cyproterone Treatment systemic biologic therapy prostate cancer ( approve bone targeted agent GnRHanalogue therapy ) agent antitumor activity within 4 week enrollment ( Day 1 visit ) ; History prostate cancer progression ketoconazole ; Prior use , participation clinical trial , investigational agent block androgen synthesis ( e.g. , abiraterone acetate , TAK700 , TAK683 , TAK448 ) agent block androgen receptor ( e.g. , ARN509 ) Previous enzalutamide therapy ; Use investigational agent within 2 week enrollment ( Day 1 visit ) ; Use herbal product may hormonal antiprostate cancer activity and/or know decrease PSA level ( e.g. , saw palmetto ) systemic corticosteroid great equivalent replacement steroid &gt; equivalent 10 mg prednisone perday within 4 week enrollment ( Day 1 visit ) ; Any condition reason , opinion Investigator , interfere ability patient participate trial , place patient undue risk , complicate interpretation safety data .
