Male female 18 55 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , removal ovary hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 21.7 International unit per liter ( IU/L ) oestradiol &lt; 110 picomole per liter ( pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method list protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one approve contraception method detail protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication followup visit .
