	<detailed_description>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( CE-MRI ) establish accurate non-invasive imaging modality characterize breast cancer . CE-MRI high sensitivity intravenous MR contrast agent highlight region increase vascularization vascular permeability compare normal breast tissue benign lesion . While research continue improve specificity CE-MRI , several MR technique require exogenous contrast agent show provide valuable information improve characterization breast cancer . These technique include magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , diffusion-weighted imaging , water T2 relaxometry . The long-term goal study develop technique produce quantitative MR-based biomarkers use supplement possibly supplant information provide CE-MRI . This project seek facilitate advancement advance , non-contrast technique . This study use piggyback design , subject already schedule receive CE-MRI study invite receive additional 10-20 minute scan help develop novel method . This efficient design allow refinement assessment new technique minimum risk inconvenience patient . With proposed improvement , technique may lead quantitative biomarkers guide critical clinical question treatment response , diagnosis , stag , high-risk screening breast cancer .</detailed_description>
