	<brief_summary>Abstract The administration antibiotic preoperatively important intervention help reduce risk post-operative health-care associate infection ( HCAI ) . These include urinary tract , surgical site blood stream infection . Based current Surgical Infection Prevention Project , ( SCIP ) recommendation , choice antibiotic base nature site surgery presence β-lactam allergy ( Table 1 ) . Currently , antibiotic treatment prevent surgical infection administer single bolus hour surgery , every four hour initial dose . This present concentration profile high concentration bolus , decay kidney remove antibiotic . In present study , investigator would like compare traditional method delivery constant infusion model would sustain constant level antibiotic define difference rate infusion rate clearance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current incidence post-operative surgical infection varies 6 % patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery great 30 % high-risk surgery . 1 The administration antibiotic preoperatively important intervention help reduce risk post-operative health-care associate infection ( HCAI ) . These include urinary tract , surgical site blood stream infection . Based current Surgical Infection Prevention Project , ( SCIP ) recommendation , choice antibiotic base nature site surgery presence β-lactam allergy ( Table 2 ) . The antibiotic choice perioperative prophylaxis remain first second generation cephalosporin . These drug broad range antimicrobial activity common skin pathogen excellent safety profile . Based current recommendation , cephalosporin administer 1 hour prior incision.1 Timing critical , early late administration antibiotic associate increase risk HCAI . Additional dose cephalosporin administer pre-set interval base duration surgery attempt maintain antibiotic concentration desire level . Antibiotics classify two broad class , base bacterial kill characteristic . Antibiotics concentration-dependent kill characteristic require high ratio peak concentration minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) pathogen , dose interval . Therefore large infrequent dose antibiotic result optimal antibacterial activity . In contrast β-lactam antibiotic , like cephalosporin , demonstrate time-dependent pharmacokinetics . This mean effective microbiological activity occur unbound ( free ) plasma concentration drug MIC specify time period . In infection model , bacteriostatic bacteriocidical activity occur antibiotic concentration maintain MIC 35-40 % 60-70 % dose interval respectively . However , surgical prophylaxis , preferred antibiotic concentration maintain MIC likely pathogen/s entire duration procedure . Therefore frequent dosing use extend continuous infusion drug well maintain pharmacokinetic goal . Recent study show plasma level β-lactam antibiotic fall MIC 1-2 hour initial bolus dose normal obese patients.2 , 3 Even appropriate re-dosing β-lactam antibiotic , time plasma concentration drug MIC . The combination sub-MIC plasma drug level high bacteremic load potentially increase risk develop post-operative HCAI . It follow effectively prevent microbiological activity perioperative period β-lactam antibiotic must remain MIC entire operative period . This particular importance patient undergo major abdominal surgery risk perioperative surgical site infection ( include superficial , deep organ specific infection ) 13.1 % . The aim study compare pharmacokinetics bolus continuous cefazolin infusion major abdominal surgery . Hypothesis Tested Hypothesis A continuous infusion cefazolin maintain unbound plasma concentration Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC ) duration operative procedure well traditional bolus administration every four hour . Specific Aims 1 . Compare pharmacokinetics bolus versus continuous cefazolin ( Ansef ) infusion major surgery A . Preliminary study There 2 study abdominal surgery population . The study Troconiz et al study pharmacokinetics bolus dose cefoxitin.3 The study Suffoleta study postoperative continuous infusion postoperative colorectal group.4 B . Experimental design method ( include data analysis ) Informed consent study obtain PETC ( Pre-anesthesia Clinic ) prior surgery . Induction maintenance anesthesia discretion attend anesthesiologist . Intraoperative analgesia provide discretion attend anesthesiologist may include intravenous narcotic and/or intrathecal morphine .</detailed_description>
