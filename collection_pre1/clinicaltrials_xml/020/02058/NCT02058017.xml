Using recommended phase II dose , efficacy tolerability OPB-51602 administer prior definitive chemoradiotherapy evaluate locally advanced NPC patient . This study 's overarch goal development STAT3 inhibitor novel class anti-cancer agent optimization patient selection STAT3 inhibitor therapy parallel biomarker study . This study hop establish therapeutic window OPB-51602 solid tumour evaluate potential targeted therapy NPC , since represent critical unmet clinical need . The development predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers tandem clinical evaluation OPB-51602 crucial therapeutic advancement enable understanding genetic context responsiveness resistance OPB-51602 , turn lead development effective drug combination overcome resistance.The study hypothesize OPB-51602 , first-in-class STAT3 inhibitor , efficacious solid tumour constitutively activate STAT3 , NPC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part I This lead-in dose-finding , open-label , non-randomised study OPB-51602 patient advance refractory solid tumour biopsy-amenable lesion study entry . Using start dose 10mg per week , accelerate dose titration escalation follow 3+3 design employ MTD recommend weekly dose determine . Following , expansion cohort 10 patient enrol establish safety recommended phase II dose . Additionally , also plan explore efficacy agent enrichment cohort approximately 10 metastatic NPC patient . One treatment cycle define period 28 day . Tumour biopsy perform baseline blood sample circulate biomarkers perform day 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 22 upon completion OPB-51602 dosing . Pharmacokinetic sample do Cycle 1 Days 1 , 8 22 . Safety assessment perform weekly till week 8 , bi-weekly till week 16 , monthly thereafter response assessment perform every 8 week . The number subject estimate participate study depend number cohort enrol . Part II This single-centre , open-label non-randomised phase II study evaluate OPB-51602 stage III-IVB NPC conduct window period prior definitive chemoradiotherapy . Eligible patient receive OPB-51602 weekly basis ( Day 1 , 8 , 15 ) recommend dose determined part I total 15 day prior definitive chemoradiotherapy . Response assessment perform OPB-51602 dosing day 15 use PET/CT scan clinical tumour measurement , radiologic assessment perform completion chemoradiotherapy . Safety assessment perform weekly interval day 22 toxicity relate study treatment resolve . Tumour biopsy perform baseline day 15 circulate biomarker study perform day 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 15 upon completion chemoradiotherapy . There mandated rest period administration study drug definitive chemoradiotherapy . The decision proceed chemoradiotherapy discretion individual investigator , provide subject recover recover significant toxicity study drug . Chemoradiotherapy accordance institutional standard induction chemotherapy permit . Proposed alternative treatment regimen must receive approval Principal Investigator .</detailed_description>
