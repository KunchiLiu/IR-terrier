	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . A male female , age 18 year old reach age legal consent , date inform consent sign . Written inform consent obtain subject . Subject receive ABO compatible allogeneic renal transplant . Subject receive maintenance immunosuppressive therapy prevention allograft rejection minimum one month ( 30 day ) prior first vaccination . Subject without episode allograft rejection previous three month ( 90 day ) prior first vaccination . Subject stable renal function , stability define : less 20 % variability last two creatinine measurement calculate GFR opinion investigator investigator review last two creatinine measurement calculate GFRs . Subject le 4 month ( 120 day ) 18 month ( 547 day ) allograft transplantation time first vaccination . Subjects multiple dialysis option ( peritoneal and/or one anatomical access site haemodialysis ) event acute chronic dialysis need . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day first vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception primary treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Any primary kidney disease high incidence recurrent primary kidney disease . Evidence recurrent primary kidney disease within current allograft . Previous allograft loss secondary recurrent primary kidney disease . Multiple kidney transplant allow reason previous allograft 's loss recurrent primary kidney disease . More one organ transplant ( i.e . kidneyliver , double kidney kidneyother organ ( ) transplant ) . History event , opinion investigator , may put subject increase risk chronic allograft dysfunction ( e.g . delay graft function , perioperative complication ) . Histologic report chronic allograft injury ( e.g . transplant glomerulopathy , arteriopathy , C4d deposition ) . Evidence significant proteinuria opinion investigator . Panel reactive antibody score ( PRA cPRA ) unknown time transplant . Any autoimmune potential immunemediated disease include primary kidney disease . Use antiCD20 Bcell monoclonal antibody agent ( e.g. , rituximab ) induction , maintenance and/or therapeutic immunosuppressive therapy prevention allograft rejection within 9 month ( 274 day ) first dose study vaccine/placebo . Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine/placebo , plan use study period . Concurrent plan participation another clinical study , time study period , expose expose subject investigational nonregistered product Administration plan administration live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose study vaccine end 30 day last dose study vaccine , , administration plan administration nonreplicating vaccine within 8 day prior within 14 day either dose study vaccine . Planned administration study varicella HZ vaccine study vaccine . Previous vaccination HZ varicella within 12 month precede first dose study vaccine/placebo . Occurrence varicella HZ per clinical history , within 12 month precede first dose study vaccine/placebo . Failure fully complete 7day prevaccination diary card distribute Prevaccination visit . Evidence high suspicion , opinion investigator , noncompliance nonadherence use induction and/or maintenance immunosuppressive therapy . Any confirm suspected HIV , primary immunodeficiency disease , disseminate untreated malignancy , systemic infection . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine study material equipment . Any condition , judgment investigator , would make intramuscular injection unsafe . Any condition , opinion investigator , might interfere evaluation require study . Acute disease and/or fever time vaccination . Fever define temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F oral route . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may enrol discretion investigator . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution ( childbearing potential ) Month 3 .</criteria>
