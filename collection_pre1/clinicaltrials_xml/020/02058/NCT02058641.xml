	<brief_summary>This exploratory , open-label , single sequence , two part study ( Part A optional Part B ) . The aim study ass whether systemic inhibition Lipoprotein associate phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) human , effect 11 day daily dose steady state 160 milligram ( mg ) enteric coat ( EC ) darapladib , specifically reduce number macrophage and/or result high proportion M2 macrophages skin blister induce cantharidin ( chemical agent cause blister ) . In Part A study , cohort 8 subject type 2 diabetes mellitus recruit . In Part B study , cohort 8 additional healthy subject match age ( +/- 24 month ) gender Part A may recruit .</brief_summary>

[ Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method list protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ] ; Childbearing potential abstinent ( abstinence penilevaginal intercourse must consistent preferred usual lifestyle subject ) agree use one contraception method list protocol appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point .

QTc interval Fridericia correction ( QTcF ) &lt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) subject , include bundle branch block screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Note initial QTc value prolong , ECG repeat two time ( least 5 minute ECG reading ) average 3 QTc value use determine eligibility . Additional Criteria Diabetic Subjects A diagnosis T2DM determine responsible physician base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , onset least 6 month prior screen stable treatment 3 month prior screen . Subjects recent change anticipation future change antihyperglycaemic therapy 3month period study respectively . Subjects good peripheral pulse peripheral sensory loss determine physical examination . Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level &lt; = 8.0 % screening . Additional Criteria Healthy Subjects ( recruit Part B ) Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , complete blood count clinical chemistry . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Exclusion Criteria subject : A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen Current chronic history liver disease know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Abnormal liver function test screen . For healthy subject : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; =1.5xupper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) screening . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test HIV antibody . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : For United Kingdom ( UK ) sit : average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 mL ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 90 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Unable refrain use prescription drug take intermittent ( need ) basis nonprescription drug ; include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior Day 1 session 1 continue final follow visit ( exception paracetamol ) . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History anaphylaxis , /or anaphylactoid ( resemble anaphylaxis ) reaction , severe allergic response . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Currently study investigational device . Pregnant female ( determine positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin test screen Day1 Session 1 , predose day 1 session 2 ) lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Subject mentally legally incapacitate . Unable refrain consumption grapefruit juice 7 day prior first dose study medication collection final sample session . Subjects parent Japanese , Chinese , Korean ancestry . Current smoker former regular smoker within 6 month screen visit . Previous exposure darapladib ( SB480848 ) . Presence either forearm tattoo , naevi , scar , keloid , hyper hypo pigmentation . Subjects fair skin , dark skin , excessive hair skin abnormality may , opinion Investigator , interfere study assessment . Subjects history keloid , skin allergy , hypersensitivity contact dermatitis , include previous reaction dressing use study , chronic skin disorder except isolated lesion ( e.g . wart ) remote intend site application cantharidin . Other issue opinion investigator would preclude participation study . Additional Criteria Diabetic Subjects : Abnormal liver function test screen . For T2DM subject : ALT AST &gt; =2.5 x ULN alkaline phosphatase total bilirubin &gt; =1.5 x ULN screen . Current regular use anticipate requirement antiinflammatory medication ( e.g . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [ NSAIDs ] include low dose aspirin , glucocorticoid ) immunemodulatory therapy study . Unable refrain use nonprescription drug ; include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior Day 1 session 1 continue final follow visit . Anticipated addition new therapy , change use chronically administer prescription drug , follow exception : doseadjustments antidiabetic medication , antihypertensive medication , change opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor interfere study procedure , outcome compromise subject safety . Poorly control hypertension despite lifestyle modification pharmacotherapy , high dose statin therapy ( e.g . equivalent atorvastatin &gt; 40 mg/daily ) , and/or change type dose antihypertensive statin medication 3month period anticipate study . Poorly control hypertension refers either systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110mmHg ( mean 3 measurement accord protocolspecified condition ) . Patients may enter study adjustment blood pressure medication result improve control hypertension Baseline visit ) .

Current severe heart failure ( New York Heart Association class III IV ) . Subjects currently suffer asthma ( basis exclude use corticosteroid , even inhale ) . Comorbid chronic inflammatory condition could influence measurement inflammation ( include , limited rheumatological disorder , e.g . systemic lupus erythematosus , inflammatory bowel disease ) . History peripheral arterial disease and/or current use warfarin anticoagulants/antiplatelet agent ( low dose aspirin / NSAIDs permit ) , opinion Investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor , interfere study procedure , outcome compromise subject safety . Subjects history lymphangitis and/or lymphoedema subject consider risk condition e.g . undergone surgery result loss tissue associate normal lymphoid drainage ( e.g . axillary lymph node dissection / excision relate breast surgery ) .</criteria>
