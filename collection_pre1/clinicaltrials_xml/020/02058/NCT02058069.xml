	<criteria>Male female subject may recruit Investigation . Age The subject must least 21 year age skeletally mature demonstrate radiographically complete closure distal femoral proximal tibial epiphysis . Subjects able give voluntary , write informed consent participate investigation consent obtain . Subjects , opinion Investigators Approved Study Staff , able understand Investigation cooperate Investigation procedures willing comply require postoperative followup . Subjects require total knee arthroplasty primary surgical management osteoarthritis , posttraumatic arthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , moderate deformity femoral condyle osteonecrosis define . Osteoarthritis : KellgrenLawrence Grade 3 high , clinical history absence major trauma joint ; symptom pain , stiffness , swell , and/or loss motion ; radiographic evidence joint space narrowing , subchondral sclerosis , peripheral osteophyte . PostTraumatic Arthritis : KellgrenLawrence Grade 3 high , clinical history trauma target knee subsequent pain , stiffness , swell loss motion ; radiographic evidence joint space narrowing , subchondral sclerosis , peripheral osteophyte . Rheumatoid Arthritis : American College Rheumatology classification score 6 high , clinical history demonstrate follow : morning stiffness least 1 hour present least 6 week , swell , loss motion , and/or serum rheumatoid factor ; radiographic finding narrow joint space , periarticular osteopenia , and/or perarticular erosion . Moderate Deformities : Moderate varus , valgus , flexion , posttraumatic deformity 15° assess radiographically . Moderate recurvatum 8° assess radiographically . Femoral Condyle Osteonecrosis : Loss blood supply femoral condyle characterize sudden onset pain , possibly trigger specific seemingly routine activity minor injury . Pain often increase activity night time may cause swell knee sensitivity touch pressure may result limited motion . Confirmed bone scan , MRI , and/or xray . Subjects whose anatomy appropriate available range implant size . Patients previous surgical procedure require implantation hardware operative side knee , hip , ankle would result metal artifact scatter CT scan . Patients fracture malunion distal femur proximal tibia within 12cm knee center , assess radiographically . Patients pregnant , may become pregnant course Investigation , currently lactate . Patients allergy suspect sensitivity patientcontacting component investigational device implant use study list : Femoral component : Cobalt Chromium alloy ( CoCr ) Tibial component : Titanium alloy ( Ti6Al4V ) Tibial insert patella component : Vitamin E infuse ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) Saw blade : 440C Stainless Steel Patients require bilateral total knee arthroplasty .
