	<brief_summary>The study comprise series pupillary measurement use infrared pupillometry patient undergo arthroscopic knee surgery type . Infrared pupillometry use assess whether painful stimulus result pupillary reflex dilation ( PRD ) . The extend PRD may indicator painful stimulus . This may help predict amount discomfort patient experience emergence general anesthesia . In addition measure pupillary reflex dilation , also measure oscillation pupil size indiction anesthesia , well recovery . These spontaneously occur oscillation pupil size , also call hippus , appear sensitive anesthetic opioids . However , effect drug hippus systematically address . The aim study 1. identify whether regional anesthesia technique femoral sciatic nerve block block PRD . This would allow assessment block success anesthetize patient . 2. correlate extent pupillary reflex dilation hippus anesthetize patient end surgery early postoperative pain score subsequent analgesia requirement . Such correlation would allow predict amount postoperative pain patient emerge general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infrared Pupillometry During General Anesthesia Predict Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plan study prospective cohort study . Patients undergo arthroscopic knee surgery type ( debridement , repair anterior ( ACL ) posterior cruciform ligament ( PCL ) , meniscectomy , medial ( MCL ) lateral collateral ligament ( LCL ) repair , well microfracture surgery enrol . During anesthesia , infrared pupillometry use assess whether painful stimulus result pupillary reflex dilation ( PRD ) . The extend PRD may indicator painful stimulus . The PRD measurable general anesthesia spite fact patient `` feel '' experience painful stimulus . The aim study 1. identify whether regional anesthesia technique femoral sciatic nerve block ( perform start anesthesia ) block PRD evoke painful stimulus electrical stimulation procedure start . This would allow assessment block success anesthetize patient . 2. correlate extent pupillary reflex dilation hippus anesthetize patient end surgery early postoperative pain score subsequent analgesia requirement . Such correlation would allow predict amount postoperative pain patient emerge general anesthesia . Knee arthroscopies routinely perform general anesthesia without regional anesthesia , depend anticipate extent surgery preference anesthesiologist surgeon . The assessment PRD and/or hipppus emergence would identify patient would benefit additional nerve block emergence achieve good pain control immediately postoperatively reduce demand postoperative analgesic . The planned investigation try achieve two novel finding . First , measurement PRD start surgery demonstrate whether nerve block successfully block initial surgical stimulus . There currently method available assess block success anesthetize patient . Secondly , measurement end surgery try predict amount pain follow emergence surgery . Pain may experience patient without nerve block well nerve block , latter may fail incomplete block , may extensive procedure completely cover block administer preoperatively . Identifying patient may allow treatment minimize discomfort follow emergence . Pupillary reflex dilation describe dilation pupil follow painful stimulus . The dilation last several second . Pupillometry use infrared pupillometer allow quantification reflex dilation . The PRD give numerical value reflect extent dilation . A recently publish study demonstrate correlation extend PRD pain score opioid requirement postoperatively . However , study do awake patient follow surgery . The aim study predict analgesia requirement patient still general anesthesia , experience postoperative pain . We expect infrared pupillometry general anesthesia predict pain follow surgery . Once establish , knowledge application would allow anesthesiologist initiate pain-relieving intervention additional nerve block administration analgesic emergence patient general anesthesia . In addition measure pupillary reflex dilation , also measure oscillation pupil size induction anesthesia , well recovery . These spontaneously occur oscillation pupil size , also call hippus , appear sensitive anesthetic opioids . However , effect drug hippus systematically address .</detailed_description>
