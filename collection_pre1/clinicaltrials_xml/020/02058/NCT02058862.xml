	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine home-based electrical stimulation ( ES ) program effective standard care ( SOC ) improve quadriceps function , functional outcome , patient report outcome , treatment compliance patient recover knee surgery . It hypothesize significantly well outcome compliance ES group compare SOC group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Home-based Electrical Stimulation Quadriceps Function After Knee Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation apply via knee sleeve strength , function , inhibition , patient report outcome . Strength evaluate via isometric knee extension , neuromuscular inhibition assess via superimpose burst technique , cortical excitability assess via transcranial magnetic stimulation . In addition , evaluate function single-leg hop task , star excursion balance test , step task . Patient report outcome assessed via : Veterans Rand 12 Item Health Survey ( VR-12 ) , Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score ( KOOS ) , International Cartilage Repair Society ( ICRS ) , International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form , Lysholm scale . Once participant identify eligible consent enroll study , allocate either intervention control group . The participant intervention group receive knee sleeve neuromuscular ES unit embed garment ( EMPI Phoenix , DJO Global , Vista , California ) addition SOC . A superimposed electrical signal ( maximal toleration ) utilize treatment order successfully overload muscle . During electrical stimulation participant instruct perform isometric contraction hold contraction length stimulation . Beginning one week post-operatively participant instruct perform NMES treatment 3 time day 20 minute 5 time week 12 week . The stimulation deliver frequency 75Hz duty cycle 4 second 10 second . The control group treat current SOC , perform home-based treatment volitional isometric contraction without addition neuromuscular electrical stimulation begin third day post-operatively . Participants perform 20 isometric contraction hold contraction 10 second 3 time day 5 time week 12 week . Participants instructed keep treatment log document session many exercise intensity perform .</detailed_description>
