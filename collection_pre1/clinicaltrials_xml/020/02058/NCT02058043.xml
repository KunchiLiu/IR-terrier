	<brief_summary>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED QUESTION Cognitive disorder frequently encounter present major public health problem give age population . There one , several neurodegenerative pathology individual differentiate . Particularly distinguish Alzheimer 's disease ( common ) , dementia lobar fronto-temporal associate semantic dementia ( disease particular tropism semantic memory anterior temporal lobe ) , dementia Lewy body . To differentiate pathology , clinician , major issue clinic may enough . The management current diagnostics atypical cognitive disorder , say , patient clinical symptom neuropsychological test result suggestive neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's disease , base largely data imaging . In first intention , conduct image MRI recommend HAS , particularly search treatable cause cognitive disorder ( tumor , intracranial hemorrhage particular ) also study distribution cerebral atrophy . The sequence use sequence 3D T1 , axial Flair , gradient echo axial T2 coronal T2 plane hippocampus also diffusion image . Research show interest study cerebral perfusion cognitive disorder . The HAS recommend inject contrast medium MRI context . The sequence perfusion tag arterial proton `` arterial spin labeling '' ( ASL ) use exogenous contrast medium . This available commercial product , CE mark , recent clinical MRI scanner . This non-invasive technique , require special precaution ( e.g . verification renal function ) use routine clinical practice University Hospital Rennes many center . In image patient dementia , widely use well 3D T1 sequence diffusion imaging ( International Initiative ADNI ) subject optimization harmonization use routine clinical practice European COST AID action . The second intention , isotope image FDG-PET study perfusion SPECT also perform . The interest isotopic image ( FDG-PET SPECT ) lie provision information metabolic nonexistent MRI , superiority FDG-PET compare SPECT . FDG-PET preferred examination carry CRLCC Eug√®ne Marquis de Rennes context . The aim study compare image TEPFDG , technique morphological , ASL , even study mode ( metabolism first perfusion second ) may depict consistent anomaly .</brief_summary>
