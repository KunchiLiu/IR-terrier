	<brief_summary>Compared child , disability additional challenge physically active . Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) genetic form childhood obesity characterize hypotonia , growth hormone deficiency , behavioral , cognitive disability . In child , low prevalence PWS ( 1 10,000 15,000 live birth ) make group-based physical activity ( PA ) intervention impossible . In contrast , home environment present natural venue establish PA routine population . The present high prevalence non-syndromal childhood obesity ( one four ) high physical inactivity rate , make alternative approach increase PA population area high interest . Therefore , develop 24-week home-based physical activity could suitable child adolescent age 8-15 PWS well obese child without PWS age 8-11 year . It hypothesize : 1 ) age-appropriate 24-week home-based PA intervention increase PA level youth PWS without syndrome obesity ; 2 ) motor proficiency , central sensory reception integration , body composition significantly improve youth without PWS follow completion home-based PA intervention 3 ) physical activity self-efficacy quality life increase significantly youth without PWS complete home-based PA intervention . The study participant 115 youth age 8-15 ( 45 PWS 70 without PWS categorize obese ) . The study utilizes parallel design wait-listed control group receive intervention serve control . Participants expect complete PA curriculum 4 day week six month include playground game 2 day week interactive console game 2 day week . Parents train baseline provide PA curriculum ( Active Play Home ) equipment guide implementation program home . Measurements child parent dyad assess baseline end ( week 24 ) intervention control period . Outcome measure include PA , body composition , motor proficiency , central sensory reception integration ( subsample child ) , quality life physical activity self-efficacy .

	<detailed_description>Compared child , disability additional challenge physically active . Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) genetic form childhood obesity characterize hypotonia , growth hormone deficiency , behavioral , cognitive disability . In child , low prevalence PWS ( 1 10,000 15,000 live birth ) make group-based physical activity ( PA ) intervention impossible . In contrast , home environment present natural venue establish PA routine population . The present high prevalence non-syndromal childhood obesity ( one four ) high physical inactivity rate , make alternative approach increase PA population area high interest . Specifically , approach involve family identify possible area research need . Therefore , develop 24-week home-based physical activity could suitable child adolescent age 8-15 PWS well obese child without PWS age 8-11 year .

Parents train baseline provide PA curriculum ( Active Play Home ) equipment guide implementation program home . Tips relate schedule cop barrier daily program implementation also include . Throughout , parent contact phone week ( week 1-4 ) every week provide support visit . Measurements child parent dyad assess baseline , 12-weeks receive intervention end ( week 24 ) intervention control period .
