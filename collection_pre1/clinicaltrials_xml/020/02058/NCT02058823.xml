	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare cardiovascular physiological adaptation intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) nonobese healthy subject . The exposure two period two week ( IH versus exposure `` placebo hypoxia '' ) . The investigator use pharmacological tool , peripheral vasodilator ( amlodipine ) specific blocker angiotensin receptor ( valsartan ) versus take placebo . The allocation tool exhibition randomize ( HI / placebo , valsartan / amlodipine ) . The outcome measure evaluate concern cardiovascular system , systemic inflammation tissular glucose metabolism . The investigator assume increase arterial resistance intermittent hypoxia compare control group , dependent sympathetic tone . The investigator hypothesize metabolic alteration observe experimental simulation ( IH fragmentation sleep 15 consecutive night ) less severe valsartan group amlodipine group comparison placebo group . A serum bank gene bank perform requirement subsequent study necessary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many physiological situation organism expose hypoxia , exercise altitude . In addition pathological situation also involve hypoxia , obesity , heart failure , respiratory failure sleep apnea syndrome . Hypoxia associate altitude frequently mark presence sleep periodic breathing induces particular pattern hypoxia call intermittent hypoxia . Also subject `` intolerant altitude '' develop specific pathology high altitude ( acute mountain evil , pulmonary edema ... ) . We recently demonstrate subject tolerate altitude intermittent hypoxia sleep simulated altitude . The protective role intermittent hypoxia mechanism occurrence intolerance altitude remain understood precisely . In fact intolerant altitude periodic breathe therefore intermittent hypoxia oxygen-deficient atmosphere . Conversely , sleep apnea syndrome ( SAS ) also characterize HI . It produce repeat episode airway obstruction sleep , produce sequence : respiratory effort , hypoxia / re-oxygenation sleep interruption . The HI associate well establish cardiovascular morbidity also cardioprotection . This relate cardiovascular morbidity rise blood pressure certainly promote development many year hypertension . On hand presence sleep apnea syndrome advance factor favor coronary collateral circulation therefore bring cardioprotective effect patient . Understanding mechanisms physiological adaptation intermittent hypoxia pass deleterious evolution protective HI therefore critical . Exposure altitude OSAS induce activation intermediary mechanism sympathetic activation , alter vascular reactivity , systemic inflammation low-grade oxidative stress . The direct involvement mechanism dependent mainly intermediate intermittent hypoxia . The shift equilibrium activator inhibitor factor evolve either protective mode ( adaptation altitude ) pathologic ( cardiovascular complication OSA ) . Sympathetic activation demonstrate patient OSAS , reversible effective treatment . The importance cardiovascular sympathetic activation elevate blood pressure intermittent hypoxia show animal model HI . We also find increase sympathetic activation reversible model HI healthy subject . The elevation sympathetic activity assume multifactorial . An increase tone also central potentiation thereof increase peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity ( sensitive hypoxia ) lack regulation arterial baroreflex . Moreover angiotensin system modulate central sympathetic tone peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity . These action complementary signal pathway particular interest exposure intermittent hypoxia .</detailed_description>
