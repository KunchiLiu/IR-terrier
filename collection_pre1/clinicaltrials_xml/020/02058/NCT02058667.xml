	<criteria>Pathologically proven diagnosis breast cancer clinical evidence recurrent disease chest wall follow treatment include radiotherapy , current standard care curative resection able perform Patients permit received prior therapy , must receive minimum 30 Gy chest wall minimal interval since completion radiation therapy equal great 6 month . Patients permit treated previous systemic chemotherapy . A minimal time interval since last dose cytotoxic chemotherapy must equal great 21 day , acute toxicity resolve less grade 2 , hematologic count meet study criterion . With regard toxicity , patient leave sided chest wall recurrences previously exceed 450 mg/m2 doxorubicin due expect cumulative cardiotoxicity . Prior taxane therapy allow , however , report anaphylactic reaction grade 3 high . Age ≥18 year ECOG performance status ≤2 Life expectancy great 3 month Normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients radiotherapy within 6 month prior enter study recover &lt; grade 2 adverse event due radiation Patients experience previous grade 3 4 anaphylactic reaction Paclitaxel . Patients grade &gt; 2 neuropathy attributable previous administration Taxane chemotherapy . Patients receive prior chemotherapy allow , provide systemic therapy 21 day acute toxicity resolve less grade 2 . Patients receive Paclitaxel within 3 month study entry develop document progressive disease despite therapy . Patients receive investigational agent Patients know brain metastasis brain metastasis treat prior enrollment protocol . Subjects may enroll trial completion whole brain radiation therapy and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery , provide clinically without evidence progressive brain metastasis . Patient actively receive cytotoxic antibiologic chemotherapy . For patient Her2/neu positive disease , Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) NOT ALLOWED study , withhold 8 week therapy , resume sooner 14 day follow completion protocol therapy Women confirm intrauterine pregnancy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study Paclitaxel antimicrotubule agent know potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Paclitaxel , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Paclitaxel HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible . Patients poor cardiac function define ejection fraction ( EF ) &lt; 40 % exclude .</criteria>
