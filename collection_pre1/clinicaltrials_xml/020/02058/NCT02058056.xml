	<brief_title>Early Hippocampal Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Patients With LD SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 15 % lung cancer small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . SCLC high-grade , neuroendocrine carcinoma lung . Limited disease ( LD ) SCLC confine hemithorax origin , mediastinum , supraclavicular node , encompass within tolerable radiation therapy port . About 30 % SCLC LD diagnosis . The median overall survival ( OS ) LD SCLC approximately 20 month , expect 5-year survival le 15 % . SCLC characterize rapid growth early dissemination . The standard treatment LD SCLC involve multimodality therapy concurrent thoracic radiotherapy ( tRT ) chemotherapy ( CHT ) cisplatin etoposide . Recurrence brain usually primary site treatment failure SCLC associate significant morbidity ; consequently often cause death . Occult early dissemination SCLC frequently occur prior time diagnosis . In patient brain metastasis two randomize trial show overall 5-year rate brain metastasis 59 % without prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) compare 43 % PCI . However rate brain metastasis PCI still high . About 50 % patient SCLC develop brain metastasis time course disease . Therefore PCI recommend case good response CHT tRT . PCI show improve overall survival patient LD achieve complete partial remission initial chemoradiotherapy . CHT might achieve insufficient drug level brain . Therefore , up-front PCI could treat occult brain metastasis preclinical state may increase permeability blood-brain barrier CHT product . When evaluate PCI important weigh reduce incidence brain metastases potential risk deficit result treatment , include deterioration neurocognitive function ( NCF ) quality life ( QoL ) . A possibility reduce long-term neurocognitive effect due PCI spar hippocampus . Recent technological advancement radiation oncology delivery enable avoidance hippocampus . A PCI hippocampus avoidance ( HA-PCI ) reduce memory loss due radiation . Prospective neurocognitive test increasingly use trial patient CNS tumor patient brain metastasis order determine risk versus benefit different treatment approach . For trial , choice NCF assessment follow recommendation provide Meyers Brown ( 2006 ) . This neurocognitive battery use multinational drug trial neurocognitive endpoint consist four standardized psychometric instrument , i.e . Hopkins Verbal Learning Test , Controlled Oral Word Association Test ( COWAT ) Trail Making Part A Part B ( TMT A/B ) . These test show sensitive neurotoxic effect cancer treatment clinical trial cover several cognitive function ( memory , verbal fluency , visual-motor speed , executive function ) . In addition , publish normative data available take account age , appropriate , education sex . To minimize effect repeat administration alternate form use test administration highly standardize . The battery test use trial conduct Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) ( e.g . Wolfson 2011 ) , one several three test apply study mention . Using test across trial important order able compare result different trial . It show perform cognitive test battery consist five cognitive test ( QoL assessment ) multi-site trial cooperative group set ( i.e . RTOG trial ) patient brain metastasis feasible . NCF affect number factor volume brain metastasis , disease progression , treatment ( e.g . surgery , chemo- endocrine therapy ) , medication psychological factor anxiety distress . These factor consider evaluate actual neurocognitive effect concomitant CHT , tRT PCI . Rationale perform trial PCI part standard treatment LD SCLC rate develop brain metastasis high PCI show increase overall survival . PCI give patient present good response CHT tRT . However overall 5-year rate brain metastasis PCI still high . As long safety data lack PCI administer concurrently CHT tRT , PCI give end CHT clinical practice . Therefore aim phase II trial evaluate extent early HA-PCI give concomitant CHT tRT impairs NCF whether neurotoxicity consider acceptable evaluate question phase III trial .</detailed_description>
