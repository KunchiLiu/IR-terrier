	<brief_summary>The overall goal study improve cardiovascular outcome transplant recipient . The current standard immunosuppressive regimen kidney transplant recipient depend high exposure Calcineurin Inhibitor ( CNI ) , often less optimal dosage mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) derivative . The premise study investigate effect reverse paradigm . More specifically , effect use maximum MPA dosage ( form enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium [ EC-MPS ] Myfortic® ) along judicious CNI exposure ( cyclosporine/Neoral® ) investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk Following Conversion Full Dose Myfortic® Neoral® Two-hour Post Level Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question : Will treat kidney transplant recipient maximum MPA dosage ( form EC-MPS Myfortic® ) along judicious CNI exposure ( cyclosporine/Neoral® ) lead improve cardiovascular outcome , measure Framingham Risk Score , 7-year major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) score cardiovascular risk inflammatory biomarker profile ? Primary Objectives : 1 . To improve Framingham Risk Score 7-year MACE score renal transplant recipient , estimate risk cardiovascular disease . 2 . To improve cardiovascular risk inflammatory biomarker profile . Hypothesis : The consistent drug exposure lower Cmax note monitor cyclosporine use 2h level ( C2 ) combine full dose Myfortic® decrease Framingham Risk Score , MACE score , well marker inflammation kidney transplant recipient : 1 . CNI minimization protocol widely accept strategy ameliorate allograft vascular injury . 2 . Chronic allograft injury vascular disease know inflammatory condition . 3 . The MPA derivative possess significant anti-inflammatory property .</detailed_description>
