	<criteria>Patient histologically and/or cytologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer Patient radiological objective evidence inoperable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer Patient HER2negative breast cancer ( base recently analyze tumor sample ) Patient ER positive and/or PgR positive breast cancer local laboratory test Patient premenopausal . Premenopausal status define either : 1. patient last menstrual period within last 12 month , OR 2. tamoxifen within past 3 month , plasma estradiol ≥10 pg/mL FSH ≤40 IU/l premenopausal range , accord local laboratory definition , OR 3. case chemotherapy induce amenorrhea , plasma estradiol ≥10 pg/mL ) and/or FSH ≤40 IU/l premenopausal range accord local laboratory definition . Patient previous history endocrine therapy metastatic setting . Note : Patients receive oral endocrine therapy duration le 3 week ≤1 injection LHRH agonist discontinue reason suspicious evidence disease progression eligible Adjuvant treatment tamoxifen monotherapy LHRH analogue monotherapy allow . Patients receive tamoxifen plus LHRH agonist/antagonist adjuvant set eligible provided start investigational treatment least 12 month last dose tamoxifen LHRH agonist/antagonist , whichever come later . Patients already establish bisphosphonate therapy may continue bisphosphonates . Patient receive ≤1 prior chemotherapy line MBC For patient receive prior systemic therapy , radiological objective evidence recurrence progression last systemic therapy need Patient must per RECIST 1.1 : measurable disease nonmeasurable lytic mixed ( lytic + blastic ) bone lesion absence measurable disease . Patient adequate bone marrow organ function define follow laboratory value : Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≦ 2 investigator believe stable time screen . Patient negative serum pregnancy test ( βhCG ) within 72 hr start study treatment . Exclusion criteria Patient postmenopausal . Patient receive previous endocrine treatment metastatic setting . Patient receive previous treatment PI3K inhibitor , AKT inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor Patient receive one chemotherapy line metastatic disease Patient symptomatic CNS metastases Patient receive wide field radiotherapy ≦ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≦ 2 week prior start study drug recover grade 1 well related side effect therapy ( exception alopecia alopecia ) Patient recover grade 1 better ( except alopecia ) relate side effect prior antineoplastic therapy Patient currently receive increase chronic treatment ( &gt; 5 day ) corticosteroids another immunosuppressive agent , chronic administration corticosteroid ( &gt; 5 day ) induce CYP3A4 Patient currently receive warfarin coumarin derive anticoagulant , treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , fondaparinux allow Patient currently receive treatment drug know moderate strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A . The patient must discontinue strong inducer least one week must discontinue strong inhibitor treatment phase initiate . Patient score ≧ 12 PHQ9 questionnaire Patient select response `` 1 , 2 3 '' question number 9 PHQ9 questionnaire regard potential suicidal thought ideation ( independent total score PHQ9 ) Patient GAD7 mood scale score ≧ 15 Patient medically document history active major depressive episode , bipolar disorder ( I II ) , obsessivecompulsive disorder , schizophrenia , history suicidal attempt ideation , homicidal ideation ( e.g . risk harm self others ) patient active severe personality disorder ( define accord DSM IV ) eligible . Patient ≧ Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 3 anxiety Patient active cardiac disease history cardiac dysfunction Patient Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determined Multiple Gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) Patient follow cardiac conduction abnormality 1 . Ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction 2 . Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia require pacemaker control medication 3 . Conduction abnormality require pacemaker 4 . Other cardiac arrhythmia control medication 5 . Patient QTcF &gt; 480 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) Patient currently receive treatment medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior treatment start . Patient chronic pulmonary disease include dyspnea rest cause interstitial lung disease .</criteria>
