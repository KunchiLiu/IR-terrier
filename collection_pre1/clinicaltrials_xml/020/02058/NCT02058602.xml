	<brief_summary>This clinical study characterise lung function , airway morphometry , pharyngometry inhalation profile patient mild severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) period 6 month . Inhalation profile record patient IPF inhale tidal breathing , follow two set instruction ( maximal effort 'long , steady deep ' inhalation ) , across range airflow resistance reflect typical inhaler use deliver medication lung . Mouth throat dimension measure use acoustic reflectance Pharyngometer . Measurements lung function make use conventional sprirometry , plethysmography diffusion , whilst Low Dose High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) use scan airway two lung volume ; functional residual capacity ( FRC ) total lung capacity ( TLC ) . Data HRCT use reconstruct airway morphometry , model inhale particle deposition within lung . Overall , study allows understand IPF patient population , use data assist development new inhale product disease . Following patient additional HRCT scan 3 6 month enable sensitivity CT base criterion disease progression compare lung function criterion . No investigational product use study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males/females age 40 year , time signing informed consent . A female patient eligible participate : Non childbearing potential , female postmenopausal , define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit per milliliter ( MlU/mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per mililiter ( pg/mL ) ( &lt; 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory . Perimenopausal premenopausal , negative pregnancy test determine serum urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test , confirm screening , subsequent clinic visit CT scanning conduct . BMI within range 18 32 kilogram per meter^2 ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Patients diagnosis IPF determine responsible experienced Respiratory physician base establish criterion define American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society : American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society International Multidisciplinary Consensus Classification Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias . Patient 's lung function measurement Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) Diffusing capacity Lung Carbon Monoxide ( DLCO ) screen must fall within category include study : FVC &gt; =40 % predict DLCO &gt; =30 % predict . Patients current Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) exacerbation . Patients know underlying cause pulmonary fibrosis . Patients IPF Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) require therapy intermittent bronchodilator long act muscarinic antagonist , Forced Expiratory Volume One Second ( FEV1 ) / Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.65 . Patients upper low respiratory tract infection within four week Visit 1 . Patients recognise coexist respiratory disorder usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) ( e.g . significant COPD , asthma , sarcoid , lung carcinoma ) opinion investigator would confound study outcome . Patients poorly control leave ventricular heart failure . Serious uncontrolled medical , surgical psychiatric disease opinion investigator would compromise patient safety confound study data ( e.g . congestive cardiac failure [ CCF ] , asthma , angina , neurological disease , liver dysfunction blood dyscrasia ) . Patients find clinically significant anaemia adequately treat . Patients history alcohol abuse . Patients currently take Pirfenidone IPF receive Pirfenidone within previous 30 day prior Visit 1 . Patients previous exposure ionise radiation &gt; 5 millieSievert ( mSv ) 3 year prior enrolment ( include ionise radiation use therapeutic diagnostic purpose purpose involve patient benefit ) . Patients history claustrophobia . As result medical history , physical examination screen investigation , physician responsible considers patient unfit study . The patient unable unwilling perform study assessment procedures correctly . The patient receive investigational drug IPF within 30 day start study . A requirement longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) define prescription oxygen use great equal 12 hour therapy per day . Note short burst oxygen therapy permit . Patient keep regulatory judicial order institution . Patient mentally legally incapacitate .</criteria>
