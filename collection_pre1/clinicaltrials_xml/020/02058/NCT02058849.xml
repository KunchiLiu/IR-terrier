	<brief_summary>The objective current proposal determine concentrate beet root could improve medical treatment compliance define completion radiotherapy 3 cycle chemoradiation without dose reduction , preserve fat-free mass , strength reduce mucositis . The investigator central hypothesis dietary nitrate supplementation head neck cancer patient receive aggressive medical care improve compliance medical treatment attenuate loss muscle mass strength reduce symptom ( mucositis ) associate treatment compare patient receive standard care placebo .</brief_summary>
