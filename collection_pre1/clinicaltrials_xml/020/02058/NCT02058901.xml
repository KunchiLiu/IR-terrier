	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) sunitinib administer weekly every two week . - To assess safety tolerability sunitinib weekly every two week dose schedule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study High-dose , Intermittent Sunitinib Patients With Solid Tumors .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis sunitinib , give high-dose , intermittent schedule may exhibit improved efficacy acceptable toxicity profile . In present phase I trial , aim determine maximum tolerate dose sunitinib administer high-dose , weekly every two week . Furthermore , acquire skin tumor biopsy , assess intratumoral concentration sunitinib , correlate skin plasma concentration gain insight biological effect drug . Additionally , aim preliminary ass efficacy sunitinib administer MTD level schedule . Known serum angiogenesis marker correlate efficacy endpoint .</detailed_description>
