	<brief_summary>In modern anesthesia practice , application cricoid pressure intubation infrequently use goal prevent gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration . The evidence support practice scarce , recently many report literature question safety cricoid pressure intubation . Therefore , goal study randomize risk microaspiration receive cricoid pressure versus cricoid pressure intubation . We specifically exclude patient think high risk aspiration ( consider standard care perform cricoid pressure intubation population ) . We include patient risk factor aspiration ( consider standard care apply cricoid pressure intubation population ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration induction anesthesia remain significant risk modern practice anesthesia . ( 1 ) Macroaspiration ( grossly visible aspiration ) clearly associate severe pulmonary injury . ( 1-4 ) More recently , microaspiration ( aspiration without grossly visible gastric material ) also associate significant morbidity . ( 2 ) Specifically , microaspiration associate acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) ( 5 ) , ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) ( 6 ) acute respiratory failure due bronchoconstriction ventilation-perfusion mismatching . Pepsin A show specific biochemical marker gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration . ( 7 ) In previous study , demonstrate rate microaspiration normal elective surgical patient without risk factor aspiration 4 % detect ELISA assay pepsin A . ( 8 ) This compare rate 12.5 % patient risk factor microaspiration include obesity , GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ) diabetes . One propose technique prevent gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration cricoid pressure . Recently , grow evidence call question effectiveness cricoid pressure . Radiologic study Smith et al yield indirect evidence suggest cricoid pressure may reliably occlude esophagus . ( 9,10 ) Currently , cricoid pressure patient risk factor microaspiration ( obesity , GERD diabetes ) use commonly inconsistently . ( 11 ) By use sample analysis technique employ previous microaspiration study , currently propose study provide sensitive specific assessment effectiveness cricoid pressure prevent aspiration elective induction anesthesia intubation . Our propose study would enroll patient risk factor microaspiration schedule undergo high-risk ( pulmonary complication ) elective surgery require endotracheal intubation . We exclude risk factor macroaspiration ( include bowel obstruction , non-fasting status esophageal pathology associate increase risk macroaspiration achalasia hiatal hernia ) , cricoid pressure remain standard care risk macroaspiration institution . Those patient enrol randomized receive cricoid pressure versus cricoid pressure . Immediately follow elective intubation , sample tracheal secretion patient obtain pepsin A concentration determine . The primary outcome rate microaspiration determine presence pepsin A trachea . Secondary outcomes interest rate postoperative pulmonary complication include acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) . The finding study provide direct evidence yet regard effectiveness cricoid pressure prevention gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration induction anesthesia endotracheal intubation . Ultimately , finding study improve patient safety provide accurate prospective evidence regard effectiveness safety cricoid pressure setting , explore clinical significance microaspiration .</detailed_description>
