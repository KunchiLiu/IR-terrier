	<brief_summary>Background Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) remain important cause morbidity mortality among patient hemato-oncological malignancy . Due crude mortality &gt; 90 % absence adequate treatment , timely diagnosis early start antifungal therapy key factor successful treatment IPA . Various study show early initiation antifungal therapy may improve IPA survival 70 % . Diagnosis IPA , however , remain difficult clinical sign symptom well radiological finding often unspecific conventional culture method lack sensitivity . In recent year antigen test therefore become one cornerstone IPA diagnostics . Brochoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) Galactomannan ( GM ) test currently promise approach early detection pulmonary infection fungus . However , limitation GM detection assay turn-around time , varies widely center ( less day several day ) , need appropriately equip laboratory routinely test antigen . These limitation overcome Aspergillus Lateral-Flow Device ( LFD ) , novel point-of-care ( POC ) test IPA diagnosis develop Dr Thornton University Exeter , UK . This simple , rapid ( 15 min ) , single-use test perform rudimentary facility use BAL specimen . In retrospective single centre study recently evaluate LFD test 39 BAL sample hematologic malignancy patient solid organ transplant recipient . Sensitivities specificities BAL LFD test probable IPA 100 % 81 % , respectively . Galactomannan level case negative LFD significantly low patient positive LFD ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . We conclude LFD test BAL specimens perform easily provide accurate rapidly available result . Therefore , new point-of-care test may promise diagnostic approach detect IPA BAL specimens haematological malignancy SOT patient . For routine clinical use , however , multicenter study large sample size also patient collective necessary . In multicenter study evaluate LFD test BAL sample . Study Objectives Primary Objectives To evaluate Lateral Flow Device test , rapid ( 15 min ) , point-of-care test IPA diagnosis use bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids patient risk IPA . Secondary Objective To evaluate potential BAL Lateral Flow Device test prognosis patient IPA . Study Design This prospective multi-center study conduct three center Austria ( Graz , Vienna Innsbruck ) one centre Germany ( Mannheim ) . In order meet objective estimate number 300 BAL sample patient risk IPA ( 50 100 per centre ) include study cohort . The Lateral Flow Device test perform prospectively BAL sample patient result compare GM result , PCR finding , clinical/radiological finding well conventional culture result . In addition , retrospective test BAL sample previously routinely test GM perform three participate center ( Graz , Innsbruck Mannheim ) ensure reach propose number 300 BAL sample . The treating clinician inform BAL Lateral Flow Device test result test therefore impact patient management / treatment decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Outlook Sensitive specific biomarkers early diagnosis IPA urgently need improve survival . In multicenter study evaluate potential novel Lateral Flow Device test early , bedside diagnosis IPA . A successful implementation study hypothesis require solid background field IPA . Considering I confident professional experience combine technical scientific expertise host institute associate laboratory generate highly competitive promising setting . The success propose research vitally depend collaboration . Over last four year I work extensively field IPA among patient hemato-oncological malignancy , allow establish necessary contact cooperation vital project 's success . The major strength multi-center study therefore cooperation three major center IPA diagnosis leadership three outstanding expert ( Prof. Lass-Flörl , Prof. Buchheidt Prof. Willinger ) publish extensively field IPA diagnosis recent years/decades . I certain result far-reaching implementation whole field IPA . Clearly , significantly advance understanding clinical performance novel point care application . The project expect big impact patient care . Establishment Lateral Flow Device test may lead rapidly , frankly bedside , available test result may therefore enable early initiation appropriate antifungal therapy may help save life . 1 . Background Invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) important cause morbidity mortality among patient haemato-oncological malignancy ( 1-3 ) . Invasive mould infection ( IMI ) , particular invasive aspergillosis ( IA ) lead cause IFI among patient , follow invasive Candida infection ( 2 , 4 ) . Due crude mortality 80-90 % absence adequate treatment , timely diagnosis early start antifungal therapy key factor successful treatment IFI . Various study show early initiation antifungal therapy may improve IFI survival 80 % ( 5 , 6 ) . Clinical sign symptom IFI well radiological finding , however , often unspecific . The inability consistently make early convincing diagnosis remain , therefore , one central problem . The European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group ( EORTC ) Mycoses Study Group National Institute Allergy Infectious Disease ( MSG ) success tackle problem establish consensus definition opportunistic IFI ( 7 ) . However , definition EORTC/MSG guideline base review literature , also expert opinion subsequent international consensus . The main reason study evaluate detail definition part simply available . In recent cohort study work group propose modification criterion ( 8 ) . When use EORTC/MSG criterion prevalence IFI strongly depend mycological evidence easy get . Culture-based diagnostic approach require invasive diagnostic procedure , often hinder severe medical condition patient risk IFI , also , fact , frequently result falsely negative . Antigen test rapidly available test result therefore become increasingly important produce realistic picture burden IFI enable early diagnosis treatment patient IFI ( 1 ) . Antigen test may facilitate early diagnosis may also prevent overtreatment become frequent . A recent study Azoulay colleague evaluate antifungal therapy one day multiple French hospital confirm fact patient receive antifungal fact IFI ( 9 ) . Overtreatment may increase cost significantly ( daily cost antifungal 600-1000€ ) may also lead development resistance ( 10 ) . The use highly sensitive specific rapidly available antigen tests/ biomarkers may guide clinician initiate antifungal therapy patient benefit treatment really IFI . Last least antigen test may also useful early response assessment , therapy monitoring treatment stratification include decision stop antifungal therapy patient IA ( 11-12 ) . One major limitation GM test time result varies centre ( less day several day ) , mainly depend number specimen test routine ( test perform plate cover 96 test ) , distance/duration transport clinical set laboratory test perform . These limitation overcome Lateral Flow Device Test , point care test IA develop Prof. Thornton University Exeter , United Kingdom . This single sample test easily perform every laboratory use BAL serum specimen time result approximately 20 minute . Recent study show immense potential test human BAL serum sample ( 13-15 ) . In recent study work group retrospectively evaluate LFD test use bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) sample patient haematological malignancy patient solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) . Thirty-nine BAL sample 37 patient include ( 29 sample haematological malignancy 10 sample SOT ; 12 probable IPA , 9 possible IPA , 16 IPA ) . Sensitivity specificity BAL LFD test probable IPA 100 % 81 % , respectively . GM level case negative LFD significantly low patient positive LFD ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . We conclude LFD test BAL specimens perform easily provide accurate rapidly available result . Therefore , new point-of-care test may promise diagnostic approach detect IPA BAL specimens haematological malignancy SOT patient ( 16 ) . Another recent study demonstrate neutropenic guinea pig model LFD assay reproducible different laboratory study ( 17 ) . Multi-center study need , however , evaluate test ( 16 ) . In propose study evaluate BAL Lateral Flow Device Test compare result routinely perform Galactomannan value well , culture PCR result . 2 . Study design method 2.1 .
