	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether intra- postoperative use cardioPAT® cell saver decrease need allogenic red blood cell transfusion patient , undergo open heart surgery ( cardiopulmonary bypass ) preoperatively increase risk bleeding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CardioPAT Project : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This scientific study conduct randomize control trial N = 146 , therefore n = 2 x 73 . Randomization carry simple 1:1 randomization follow group : 1 . Control group : undergo heart surgery blood conserve strategy currently standard routine Rigshospitalet . 2 . Interventional group : undergo heart surgery intra- postoperative use cardioPAT cell saver . The cardioPAT collect blood operative site chest tube , thereafter wash concentrate red blood cell . This blood return patient . Furthermore , group also receive blood conserve strategy control group . Randomization stratify inclusion criterion ensure two group amount woman , men hemoglobin 8 mmol/l men 75 year double procedure . All legally competent adult receive on-pump open heart surgery Department Cardiothoracic Surgery Rigshospitalet screen participation trial . Inclusion criterion : Patients increase risk bleeding , undergo open heart surgery , : - Women - Men hemoglobin &lt; 8mmol/L - Men &gt; 75 year age combine procedure , f.ex . combine CABG valve surgery , regardless preoperative hemoglobin level Exclusion criterion : - Re-operation within first 24 hour - Known clot disorder ( coagulopathy ) hematological diseases - Sepsis , f ex due Endocarditis - Patients already enrolled study , data study risk interfere - Jehovah 's witness - Acute surgery ( &lt; 24 hour ) The aim study investigate : - Whether requirement allogenic transfusion red blood cell ( SAG-M ) , platelets fresh frozen plasma patient , increase bleeding risk undergo open heart surgery , decrease intra- postoperative use cardioPAT® cell saver - Whether percentage patient receive transfusion ( 0 unit ) increase use cardioPAT® cell saver - The cost-effectiveness use cardioPAT® cell saver compare current standard treatment - Hemoglobin platelet count interventional group pre- postoperatively , well discharge compare control group - The composition quality cardioPAT® red blood cell product - The composition cardioPAT® waste product - The length stay ICU total hospitalization cardiac surgery - The impact different aspect coagulation - The extent renal impairment postoperative period - The inflammatory response postoperative period - Endothelial injury postoperative period Sample size calculation : The standard deviation , blood transfusion patient Department Cardiothoracic Surgery , Rigshospitalet , calculate ±0,32 . From clinical point view relevant reduction , would justify routine use CardioPAT® device , would somewhere 15-20 % . This reduction would result Department save every 1/7 1/5 unit blood . Therefore difference 15 % use power calculation . Sample size calculate mean `` Sample Size Calculator '' find online : http : //hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sample_size/size.html.This power analysis calculate total 146 patient need enter two-treatment parallel-design study . The probability ( power ) 80 % study detect treatment difference two-sided 0,05 significance level , base assumption standard deviation response variable 0,32 true difference treatment set 0,15 unit ( 15 % ) . An interim analysis conduct inclusion approximately 80 patient . If result relevant time , study stop inclusion present result .</detailed_description>
