	<detailed_description>Primary Objective replicate validate CEdG assay use human subject . A fully automate assay urinary CEdG develop . investigator validate observation make diabetic animal model human subject without type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Specifically , investigator investigate establish inter- intra-assay coefficient variability human subject . Secondary Objective determine correlation CEdG level hemoglobulin A1c ( HbA1c ) human subject T2DM response diabetic treatment define relationship CEdG diabetic complication . The investigator examine relationship CEdG glycemic control , base HbA1c , current gold standard , patient type 1 type 2 diabetes . The investigator also compare change CEdG Hb1Ac level response diabetic treatment diabetic patient . The relationship CEdG diabetic complication also investigate diabetic patient . Statistical consideration primary objective : Sample Size : Because many variable human subject , investigator calculate sample size base much conservative assumption investigator observe diabetic animal model . The investigator plan study continuous response variable independent control experimental subject 1 control per experimental subject . Based animal data , investigator expect result within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 0.3 . If true difference mean diabetic non-diabetic group 0.5 , investigator need study 9 diabetic 9 non-diabetic subject able reject null hypothesis population mean experimental control group equal probability ( power ) 0.9 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . To account possible attrition rate 30 % , investigator accrue 12 diabetic 12 non-diabetic subject study . Statistical Analysis : The effect diabetic status urinary CEdG level compare use Student 's t-test . Differences continuous variable group subject test either one-way ANOVA Student 's t-test appropriate . Differences proportion evaluate chi-square test . The continuous variable , fail Normality test , logarithmically transform analysis . To examine influence confound variable , stepwise regression analysis use . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . According NIH guideline validation analytical method biomarkers use drug development , small molecule , bioanalytical assay analytical run accept valid least 67 % ( 4/6 ) quality control fall within 15 % nominal value . The consistency 6 repeat run evaluate Grubbs test repeatability within subject . The overall consistency CEdG measure quantify proportion subject 1+ identified outlier among 6 repeat run . To obtain baseline estimate consistency CEdG assay , investigator take number six measurement fall within 15 % mean outcome measure . Definitive validation biomarker require definitive quantitative relative quantitative assay approach . Statistical consideration secondary objective : The investigator regress study participant ' value y-var ( HbA1c ) x-var ( CEdG ) . Prior data indicate standard deviation x-var 0.15 standard deviation regression error 0.15 . If true slope line obtain regress y-var x-var 0.3 , investigator need study 89 subject able reject null hypothesis slope equal zero probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . Therefore , 100 subject recruit study account potential attrition subject . Patient demographic clinic characteristic tabulate use statistic mean , standard deviation , median , range , number percentage appropriate . CEdG data analyze continuous transform variable measured expression level . The univariate correlation CEdG expression quantitative clinical measure evaluate use Pearson correlation 95 % confidence interval . The time trend longitudinal data possible interaction risk factor explore use boxplots , fit curve , generalize linear model , generalize estimate equation appropriate . Estimated correlation CEdG data clinical endpoint , possible time trend 12 month period provide valuable information choose primary endpoint sample size future large scale correlation study .</detailed_description>
