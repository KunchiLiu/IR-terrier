	<brief_summary>Irritable larynx syndrome ( ILS ) hyperkinetic laryngeal dysfunction characterize persistent cough , voice change , breathe difficulty , often trigger irritant . Diagnosis ILS difficult typically make via thorough review clinical history , occasionally , patient 's reaction odor-provocation test . Standard treatment ILS behavioural therapy speech language pathologist ( SLP ) , provide symptom improvement patient . However , currently , objective measure upper airway hyper-responsiveness condition assist diagnose monitor disease severity . Since cough irritant-based , anticipated patient ILS hypersensitivity irritant capsaicin . Capsaicin active component chili pepper make hot . The capsaicin cough challenge well recognize test involve inhale different concentration capsaicin solution determine cough reflex sensitivity . The purpose research study confirm ILS patient hypersensitivity capsaicin compare healthy volunteer . If hypersensitivity observe ILS patient , second objective study see behavioural therapy improve cough reflex sensitivity patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Capsaicin Sensitivity Testing Patients With Irritable Larynx Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study two purpose ; first utilize capsaicin cough challenge demonstrate increase efferent receptor sensitivity level ILS subject compare control group . The second determine objective change capsaicin cough challenge result behavioral therapy , whether correlate subjective improvement . Self-reporting measure include two validated cough quality life ( QoL ) questionnaires collect interval capsaicin test .</detailed_description>
