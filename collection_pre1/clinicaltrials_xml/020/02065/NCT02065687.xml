	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well paclitaxel , carboplatin , metformin hydrochloride work compare paclitaxel , carboplatin , placebo treat patient endometrial cancer stage III , IV , come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Metformin hydrochloride may help paclitaxel carboplatin work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . It yet know whether paclitaxel carboplatin effective without metformin hydrochloride treat endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin With Without Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage III , IV , Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) standard regimen carboplatin paclitaxel prolongs progression-free survival ( PFS ) woman advance recurrent endometrial cancer . ( Phase II ) II . To determine addition metformin standard regimen carboplatin paclitaxel prolongs overall survival ( OS ) population phase III study conduct . Both clinical trial ( Phase II III ) utilize OS primary endpoint phase III trial open . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient objective response ( response rate [ RR ] ) population patient measurable disease treatment . II . To estimate duration response population patient measurable disease respond treatment . III . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) relative hazard death treatment arm study stop phase II trial complete . If study continue phase III clinical trial , PFS secondary endpoint . IV . To determine nature , frequency degree toxicity assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) treatment arm . V. To estimate possible difference RR , PFS , OS , toxicity rate treatment regimens patient ' level obesity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether PIK3CA mutations/amplifications , PTEN mutation PIK3R1/PIK3R2 mutation low hazard progression death ( PFS endpoint ) among patient treat metformin . II . To test whether high expression MATE 2 associate low hazard progression death ( PFS endpoint ) among patient treat metformin . III . To explore association metabolic factor ( i.e . body mass index [ BMI ] , hip-to-waist ratio , diabetes status , hemoglobin A1c [ HgbA1C ] , fast insulin glucose level , homeostatic model assessment [ HOMA ] score ) treatment response metformin/paclitaxel/carboplatin , PFS , OS . IV . To test whether genomic profile ( i.e.PIK3CA mutations/amplifications , PTEN mutation PIK3R1/PIK3R2 mutation ) differ tumor obese non-obese endometrial cancer ( EC ) patient . V. To correlate expression key target insulin/IGF-1/mTOR signal pathway ( p-IGF1R , p-S6 p-4EBP-1 ) treatment response metformin/paclitaxel/carboplatin , PFS , OS obesity status . VI . To determine genetic variant metformin transporter correspond treatment response metformin/paclitaxel/carboplatin , PFS OS . VII . To estimate difference physical functioning , physical activity , fatigue treatment arm . VIII . To explore association metabolic factor ( i.e. , BMI , hip-to-waist ratio , diabetes status , HgbA1C , fast insulin glucose level , HOMA score ) physical functioning , physical activity , fatigue . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) ( approximately 10-12 hour apart ) day 1-21 ( daily [ QD ] course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise metformin hydrochloride PO BID day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV Arm I . Patients also receive placebo PO BID ( approximately 10-12 hour apart ) day 1-21 ( QD course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise placebo PO BID day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient achieve stable disease ( SD ) partial response ( PR ) still measurable disease completion course 6 may continue receive paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV ( metformin hydrochloride placebo ) additional 4 course discretion treat investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
