	<brief_title>Predictive Validity Acoustic Gastrointestinal Surveillance ( AGIS ) Post-Operative Feeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using advance low-cost sensor technology computer-aided analysis , investigator develop disposable , non-invasive device continuous monitor abdominal sound , call AGIS sensor ( Acoustic Gastro-Intestinal Surveillance ) . Following abdominal surgery , standard protocol employ hospital fee patient first post-operative day . However , one every four patient unable tolerate feeding delay recovery bowel function , condition call post-operative ileus ( POI ) . Following abdominal surgery , monitor POI typically limit incidental interaction attend physician staff , occur intermittently throughout day . The AGIS system specifically address postoperative digestion monitor offer continuous analysis GI signal , automate processing signal , immediate reporting patient 's progress caretaker . The AGIS system compact , rapidly deployable unit comfortable subject convenient application . The AGIS sensor include standard microelectronic microphone measurement abdominal vibration acoustic signal . The material contact subject standard 3M Tegaderm wound bandage adhesive material disposable , avoid need clean disinfection . The AGIS sensor include fine , flexible convenient cable connect AGIS Gateway , low voltage battery power device size approximately smartphone . The AGIS Gateway monitor AGIS sensor signal provide measurement intestinal motility report AGIS Feeding Index score . The score calculate use number acoustic event detect AGIS per minute . The investigator recently perform proof-of-concept , cross-sectional study test whether AGIS monitoring system could distinguish healthy control participant patient recover GI surgery . Seven healthy control participant feed breakfast monitor AGIS two hour follow meal , allow investigator obtain acoustic data calculate normal range AGIS score . The investigator also place sensor patient recover abdominal surgery . The investigator monitor patient two hour compare AGIS score healthy control use ANOVA post-hoc comparison . AGIS successfully discriminate among healthy control , patient tolerate food , patient POI . Although investigator ' pilot data indicate AGIS distinguish patient healthy control , distinguish patient POI vs. tolerate food , investigator yet know AGIS reliably predict patient fail tolerate postoperative feeding . The investigator propose test predictive validity AGIS system pragmatic , observational study patient schedule abdominal surgery . Hypothesis : Using AGIS signal record day abdominal surgery , AGIS predict patient fail tolerate postoperative feeding vs. safely feed ; AGIS achieve overall accuracy 80 % great . Study Design : The investigator place AGIS sensor GI patient 20 minute immediate pre-operative phase establish baseline AGIS motility rate . Following abdominal surgery , surgeon place AGIS sensor patient operating room , begin record 60 minute patient transfer recovers post-anesthesia care unit . AGIS recording collect continuously throughout remain patient 's hospital stay . As observational study , physician nurse make aware AGIS reading . Patients manage accord standard practice . The investigator ' goal determine accuracy AGIS predict post-operative feeding tolerance context usual care without `` Hawthorne effect '' potentially impact care decision . Investigators blind AGIS recording abstract data outcome .</detailed_description>
