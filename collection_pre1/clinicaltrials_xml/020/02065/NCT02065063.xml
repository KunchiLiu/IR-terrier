	<brief_summary>This dose-escalation , Phase I/II , open-label , three-part study . Part 1 design determine recommend dose schedule orally administer MEK inhibitor trametinib , give together CDK4/6 inhibitorpalbociclib subject solid tumor . Multiple dose level inhibitor test determine recommend dose schedule . Part 2 evaluate effect combination tumor biomarkers safety , anti-cancer activity subject cutaneous melanoma change BRAFV600 . Approximately 100-200 subject enrol . All subject receive trametinib and/or palbociclib disease progression , death , consent withdrawal unacceptable adverse event ( AE ) .</brief_summary>
