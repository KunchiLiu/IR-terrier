	<brief_summary>Patients nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . This study gene transfer research study use special immune cell . Most patient NPC show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell almost patient advanced stage NPC , suggest may play role cause disease . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . We want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train recognize kill special part EBV infect cell survive patient 's blood affect tumor . We already give EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell 30 patient active NPC see anti-tumor activity 14 30 patient . We try find improve treatment . First , want give T cell cell recognize least two four EBV protein express NPC cell . We call cell NPC-specific cytotoxic T cell . Second , find T cell work well add receptor T cell call DNR ( Dominant Negative Receptor ) . DNR make T cell resistant TGFbeta , factor secrete cancer cell help escape kill immune system . In study therefore place DNR gene NPC-specific T cell ( DNR.NPC-specific T cell ) . In clinical study use T cell , investigator find give chemotherapy T cell infusion improve amount time T cell stay body therefore effect T cell . Giving chemotherapy T cell infusion call lymphodepletion since chemotherapy specifically choose decrease number lymphocytes body . Decreasing number patient 's lymphocyte first allow T cell infuse expand stay longer body , potentially kill cancer cell effectively . The chemotherapy use lymphodepletion combination cyclophosphamide fludarabine . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine chemotherapy agent commonly use lymphodepletion immunotherapy clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood collect patient make LMP/BARF1/EBNA1 ( NPC ) -specific T cell . To grow NPC-specific T cell use special cell call antigen-presenting cell , train patient 's T cell NPC specific . Antigen present cell , call monocyte dendritic cell , grown/isolated patient 's blood . In addition , use cell line call K562 antigen-presenting cell gene put inside , encourage patient 's T cell grow . K562 cell cancer cell . As , inject could cause cancer . The cell treat radiation grow . These antigen-presenting cell coat specially produce mixture LMP , EBNA1 BARF protein fragment call peptide . These coat antigen-presenting cell use generate patient 's NPC-specific T cell presence growth factor . To get DNR attach surface NPC-specific T Cells , also insert DNR gene NPC-specific T cell ( DNR.NPC-specific T cell ) . This do virus call retrovirus make study . This virus carry DNR gene cell . Once make sufficient number DNR.NPC-specific T cell freeze cell test make sure recognize EBV protein present NPC . Patients get treated 1 ) either two dos DNR.NPC-specific T cell ( second dose give 2 week first dose ) 2 ) cyclophosphamide fludarabine 3 day receive DNR.NPC-specific T cell . The cyclophosphamide fludarabine give needle insert vein patient 's port-a-cath ) . The T cell thaw infused central line , vein patient 's arm 1 10 minute . Patients follow clinic infusion 1 4 hour . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . Medical test treatment : Before treat , patient receive series standard medical test : Physical exam Imaging Study Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function Measurements tumor routine image study . We use image study use follow patient 's tumor : Computer Tomogram ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET/CT ) Medical test treatment : The patient receive standard medical test get infusion : Physical exam Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function Imaging study 8 week 1st T-cell infusion ( patient receive DNR.NPC-specific T cell ) Imaging study 6 week T-cell infusion ( patient receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide DNR.NPC-specific T-cell infusion ) . To learn way DNR.NPC-specific T cell work long last body , extra 60ml 3ml/kg body weight blood ( whichever less ) take pre-chemotherapy ( patient receive chemotherapy ) , day T-cell infusion ( end T-cell infusion ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . 6 , 8 week ( last time point patient receive DNR.NPC-specific T-cells ) T-cell infusion every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , yearly total 15 year . One additional blood sample might draw 3 4 day post 1st T-cell infusion ; optional . This volume consider safe , may decrease patient anemic . In addition blood test , patient receive 2 image study state . During time point list , DNR.NPC-specific T cell find patient 's blood certain amount extra 5ml blood may need collect additional testing .</detailed_description>
