	<brief_summary>Most woman early breast cancer treat breast conserve therapy ( BCT ) , consist breast conserving surgery ( surgery remove cancer ) follow radiation breast . This treatment take time associate side effect profile . An innovative radiation technique call stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) deliver large dos radiation precisely tumour avoid critical organ , therefore destroy cancer avoid surgery altogether . SBRT successfully use number cancer propose could use eradicate breast cancer . This feasibility study investigate feasibility safety treatment use SBRT woman early stage breast cancer . Thirty-two woman age 70 year old early breast cancer treat SBRT ( 5 treatment ) follow breast conserve surgery hormonal therapy . An MRI breast conserving surgery perform 8-12 week radiation ass response treatment . The primary outcome study feasibility , mean ability deliver radiation treatment plan . Secondary outcome include treatment related toxicity pathological response . If study show SBRT use treat patient primarily , lead evaluation SBRT early breast cancer .</brief_summary>
