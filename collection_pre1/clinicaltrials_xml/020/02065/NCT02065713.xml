	<brief_summary>Dactylitis poor prognostic factor psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) patient . The efficacy synthetic biologic disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) dactylitis previously study randomize controlled trial primary endpoint . In investigator initiated clinical trial investigator aim test hypothesis combination therapy golimumab methotrexate ( MTX ) result significant improvement dactylitis comparison MTX monotherapy , MTX naïve psoriatic arthritis patient , week 24 . Similarly efficacy enthesitis , peripheral axial involvement , skin nail psoriasis , inflammation damage foot hand assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , composite index disease activity , remission , function quality life determine . This national multicentre , interventional , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , parallel design trial . 136 patient active dactylitis , refractory least two systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , optimal dosage , 3 month include centrally randomize golimumab combination MTX versus MTX monotherapy , 1:1 ratio . The study duration 24 week . The investigator expect result trial contribute good definition treatment algorithm PsA patient dactylitis .</brief_summary>
