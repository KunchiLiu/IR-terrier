	<brief_summary>1 . Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) inflammatory disease lung , commonly cause smoking . It characterize fully reversible airflow limitation , chronic cough dyspnoea . Being fourth lead cause death worldwide , COPD important public health challenge prevent treat . It estimate least 400,000 individual Switzerland affect COPD . This number may increase come year due increase nicotine consumption . In response rise trend , Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) establish new guideline global strategy diagnosis , management prevention COPD . Systematic diagnosis stratification crucial effective treatment measure . As COPD irreversible progressive disease , treatment aim early detection well management , lead prevent progression . Disease management program show patient understand exacerbation symptom benefit . Moreover , major goal improve health-related quality life reduce symptom decelerate disease progression . Spirometry golden standard diagnosis COPD , assess severity obstruction , guide optimal therapeutic measure . 2 . Aim study The objective project establish COPD cohort database allow high quality research diagnosis , treatment , complication progression COPD long-term course . Spirometry use consistently diagnosis monitoring development disease . Using collected information spirometric data , disease progression 's data therapeutic measure help improve management self-management patient . 3 . Methods 3.1 Study design We conduct prospective cohort study , base COPD patient northern western Switzerland , manage primary care set . Patients mild severe COPD ( GLOD stag I-IV ) enrol study . Currently , 67 General practitioner ( GPs ) participate Study . Each GP recruit 1-20 patient presume mild severe COPD accord criterion Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung disease [ GOLD ] . Patients ' follow-up-visits occurs 6-month interval ; history , symptom examination status record . Data enter online database either physician study team receiving collect data questionnaire facsimile . Data collection include demographic data , physical examination , spirometric parameter , medical treatment exacerbation history besides death . A spirometer ( EasyOne™ , ndd Medizintechnik AG , Zürich , Switzerland ) use assess lung function . All participate physician instruct usage spirometer complete spirometry accord guideline . For assessment severity COPD , use spirometric data provide GPs . The COPD severity interpret accord criterion GOLD committee . 3.2 Patient population Patients newly diagnose exist COPD , manage primary-care practice . 3.3 Inclusion criterion - Tiffenau ( FEV17FVC ) &lt; 70 without reversibility ( Increase FEV1 inhalation bronchodilator &lt; 200 ml &lt; 12 % ) . - Age : &gt; 40 year - Both gender - Smokers ex-smokers least 20 pack year . - Informed consent . 3.4 Archiving Data Retention All study-related record medical record , inform consent document , information regard participant discontinue , pertinent data maintain therefore retain long required applicable Swiss regulatory requirement ( 10 Years ) . 3.5 Data security The complete data study enter anonymously database . The data password-protected accessed investigator study member . 4 . Publication authorship 4.1 Publication policy Authorship credit base : 1 . Substantial contribution conception design , acquisition data , analysis interpretation data . 2 . Drafting article revise critically important intellectual content . 3 .
