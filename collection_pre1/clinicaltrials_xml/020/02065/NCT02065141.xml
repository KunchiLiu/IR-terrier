	<brief_summary>The aim present study validate new method healthy volunteer diagnose COPD CHF able measure protein digestion absorption simultaneously . This method use quantify digestion absorption patient suspect impaired digestion absorption result loss nutrients.Findings may use develop treatment strategy improve protein digestion absorption patient group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Method To Measure Protein Digestion &amp; Absorption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve 1 screen visit approximately 1-2 hour 1 test day approximately 8 hour . On study day protein digestion absorption measure use mixture amino acid make slightly heavy normal , call stable isotope . Subjects receive feed sip monitor change digestion absorption , pick stable isotope technology .</detailed_description>
