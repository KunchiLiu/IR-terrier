	<brief_title>Surveillance Antiviral Resistant Variants Chronic Hepatitis C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To analyse resistance-associated HCV variant DAA-naïve HCV patient use population ultra-deep pyrosequencing ( UDPS ) . Resistance associate variant analyse qualitative quantitative method pre-treatment on-treatment . 2 . To determine whether absence drug pressure variation prevalence naturally occur resistance associate variant . 3 . To correlate presence frequency baseline resistance-associated variant response therapy DAA-based triple therapy regimens HCV . 4 . To identify predictor emergent DAA resistance treatment failure therapy DAA-based combination strategy , include virological , clinical immunological factor . 5 . To characterize natural history HCV resistance associate variant select antiviral therapy withdrawal treatment . 6 . To establish cohort DAA-treatment failure patient suitable re-treatment study . 7 . To establish tissue repository serum PBMCs well-characterized patient treat DAA-based triple therapy allow future examination role variable may potentially impact outcome DAA base therapy development RAVs .</detailed_description>
