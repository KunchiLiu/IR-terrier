	<brief_summary>Over 600,000 hysterectomy perform year nationwide . Over 99 % accomplish laparoscopically investigator current surgical practice allow woman quicker recovery traditional large incision . Disposable laparoscopic device develop assist completion hysterectomy . These disposable energy source use , offer improve safety energy profile reliably control bleed little damage surround tissue potentially save time . Reusable energy instrument sterilize reused multiple case . Operating room time expensive . The investigator calculate 6.7 minute time save use disposable device , Ligasure ( Covidien ) , versus reusable Robi bipolar Storz Laparoscopic Shears , time saving could justify cost device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disposable Energy Sources Operating Room Time Laparoscopic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective study . The investigator study design would patient serve control . One side uterine attachment would transect use disposable device , Ligasure ( Covidien ) , use two reusable device ( Robi bipolar Storz laparoscpic shear ) . It investigators standard practice attend surgeon patient 's left side resident physician patient right . To eliminate bias surgical experience , investigator randomize energy source use side every case . Therefore , number case perform attend surgeon disposable reusable energy source , equal less experienced resident surgeon . The primary endpoint study would time difference cauterize one side uterine attachment , round ligament uterine artery one side , time detach tissue side . The vesico-uterine peritoneum `` bladder flap '' , always transect left consistency . Sealed , opaque envelope randomize determine side uterus get single disposable instrument , get 2 reusable instrument . A time save 6.7 minute total case also explain 3.35 minute time saving PER SIDE uterine attachment , give uterus two `` side '' . There pre-existing data time need coagulation cut vascular tissue . Based experience , investigator estimate take average 20 min total time vessel sealing , estimate variability approximately 70 % time , vessel seal do within 35 minute . Given estimate , use power 0.8 , sample size need 45 . The primary endpoint surgical time initially assess individual patient determine difference half laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure perform disposable device , specifically Ligasure ( Covidien ) half laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure perform two reusable device ( Robi Bipolar Storz laparoscopic shear ) determine mean difference score sum across patient differs significantly zero . Subsequent analysis examine surgical time attend physician resident separately use disposable device compare use two reusable device independent student test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test depend normality distribution . Parallel analyse perform secondary endpoint estimate blood loss . Secondary endpoint organ damage categorical intraoperative complication compare disposable reusable device group use chi-square Fisher 's Exact test .</detailed_description>
