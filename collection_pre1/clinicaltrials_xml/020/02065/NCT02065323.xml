	<brief_summary>This study evaluate add investigational drug Dovitinib standard androgen ablation therapy ( ADT ) beneficial prolonging time disease progression patient metastatic prostate cancer receive ADT first time . Dovitinib belong class drug know tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor . Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor show anti-tumor effect inhibit new blood vessel formation . New blood vessel development necessary growth spread certain tumor , prostate cancer . It think inhibit new blood vessel formation , exist new tumor may unable grow . Dovitinib target exist cancer cell also work stop formation new blood vessel . Patients randomly assign receive ADT alone ADT plus Dovitinib . ADT administer per standard care . Dovitinib take mouth daily 5 continuous day , follow 2 day Dovitinib . This schedule repeat continue disease progression removal treatment reason . Participants may start ADT prior enter study ; however , treatment Dovitinib must begin later 120 day start ADT . Participants ask donate blood sample research purpose ; optional part study . Research blood sample study circulate tumor cell certain biomarkers ( protein cell ) increase understand prostate cancer explore certain biomarkers help predict tumor react treatment . Samples exist tumor tissue also examine research purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Dovitinib With Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Receiving Primary ADT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2010 , estimate 217,730 new case prostate cancer occur 32,050 death United States America . Prostate cancer exhibit unique natural history function therapy render . Initially , disease treat androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) substantial regression disease vast majority patient . However , response short-lived , order 18-24 month , subsequent resumption cancer growth manifest increase PSA , radiographic disease progression , progressive symptom relate increase disease burden , call metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Almost prostate cancer death occur men metastatic castration-resistant disease ( CRPC ) . An appropriate therapeutic strategy would utilize agent combination ADT could serve extend sensitivity disease primary ADT . The hormonal sensitive state , tumor burden dramatically lower due therapeutic response , could represent optimal context introduce novel agent , lead cytoreduction and/or maintenance hormone-sensitive state . It demonstrate proangiogenic factor FGF-2 appear play central role angiogenesis hormone sensitive prostate cancer ( HSPC ) . Thus target FGF-2 conjunction primary ADT may represent novel therapeutic strategy initial treatment metastatic HSPC . Dovitinib broad-targeted-profiled RTK inhibitor active VEGF , FGF PDGF . Anti-tumor effect agent may , therefore , secondary anti-angiogenesis , anti-proliferative activity tumor cell , anti-stromal activity . The study enroll patient metastatic prostate disease receive initial ADT . Participants randomize receive ADT alone , combination Dovitinib . Participants stratify base ECOG PS , Prior ADT &gt; &lt; 30 day , disease location ( bone vs. ) . ADT administer per standard care treatment arm . Patients randomized combination arm receive ADT plus Dovitinib dose 500 mg/day give five-days-on-two-days-off schedule . One cycle equal 28 day . Dovitinib cycle repeat continuously disease progression , removal study reason . Patients must begin Dovitinib within 120 day start ADT . Thereafter , patient allow remain study unacceptable side effect ( ) occur , disease progression castration-resistance status . Quality life assess course study utilizing Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ( self administer FACT-P ) . Blood sample obtain specified time point collect research purpose participant provide consent . Biomarkers pertinent hypothesize mechanism action evaluate . Circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) enumerate baseline ( CellSearch™ ) , every 3 month thereafter . An additional citrate tube blood collect CTC-based ex-vivo culture analysis CTC draw . Samples archival prostate biopsy specimen also analyze specific protein related Dovitinib 's mechanism action .</detailed_description>

Patients may begin hormonal therapy , must do within 120 day study treatment . Patients must metastatic disease ( extensive limit ) . Scans ( CT chest , abdomen , pelvis ) bone scan must obtain within 4 week treatment . Written inform consent obtain accord local guideline Patients brain metastases Patients another primary malignancy within 3 year prior start study drug , exception adequately treat insitu carcinoma uterine cervix , skin cancer ( basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) Patients received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 year start study drug . Patients receive targeted therapy ( e.g. , sunitinib , sorafenib , pazopanib ) ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , recover side effect therapy . Patients radiotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , ≤ 2 week prior start study drug case localize radiotherapy ( e.g. , analgesic purpose lytic lesion risk fracture ) , recover radiotherapy toxicity . Patients undergone major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) , open biopsy significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , patient minor procedure , percutaneous biopsy placement vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior start study drug , recover side effect procedure injury . Patients follow concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition could compromise participation study : Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease Neurological compromise dysfunction due metastases Ureteral bladder outlet obstruction due metastases local invasion Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption dovitinib ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) Cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ( HIV test mandatory ) Patients currently receive anticoagulation treatment therapeutic dos warfarin Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g . active uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diabetes ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol Rising PSA meeting criterion progression CRPC Patients unwilling unable comply protocol</criteria>
