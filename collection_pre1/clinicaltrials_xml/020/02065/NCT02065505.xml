	<brief_title>Method Pilates X Pilates Water Postural Alignment Its Correlation With Respiratory Capacity With Hemiparesis Spastic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hemiparesis , correspond muscle weakness hemisphere contralateral injury , common disorder stroke Brain . The obvious implication postural asymmetry , direct relation respiratory pressure also reduce due muscle weakness , thus alter respiratory capacity individual . The Pilates Method gain prominence clinical scientific area , contribute restore good posture vertical alignment body . Therefore , study aim assess muscle electrical activity , respiratory capacity functionality spastic hemiparetic patient application Pilates Method , soil therapy pool . A randomized study 60 hemiparetic participate hold brachial predominance 30 healthy subject ( Control Group ) , sex , age 40 70 year . Individuals hemiparesis randomly assign lottery half hold 10 consecutive session Pilates soil rest protocol adapt therapy pool . The control group treat Pilates Method soil . The exercise aim lengthen musculature shorten due postural pattern pathology ; strengthen select muscle give support postural musculature important upper limb activity daily live . Participants undergo postural assessment , activity EMG , muscle strength , respiratory capacity analysis evaluation functionality upper limb first day treatment session . The Student 's test use , significance level 5 % compare result obtain treatment . After test , Pearson correlation also make data obtain soil therapy pool . Thus , expect Pilates improve postural alignment breathable hemiparetic strengthen specific muscle upper limb assist improve functionality daily activity .</detailed_description>
