	<brief_title>Three-level Injection Paravertebral Block v General Anesthesia Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple study show breast surgery associate significant postoperative pain , nausea , vomit , development chronic pain . General anaesthesia associate 50 % incidence nausea vomit among breast cancer surgery patient . The propose benefit regional anesthesia include paravertebral block compare general anaesthesia decrease stress response , improve postoperative pain control postoperative pulmonary function , decrease cancer recurrence , reduce thromboembolic event . However , debate benefit still controversial . Paravertebral block breast surgery , either alone additional general anaesthesia favor many investigator , due well postoperative analgesia shorter hospital stay . In elder investigation thermographic imaging use apply paravertebral block . After single injection 15 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine spine level Th9-Th10 mean distribution somatic block five sympathetic block eight dermatome without hemodynamic side effect . No bilateral spread find . The author contradict suggestion paravertebral block ineffective sometimes hazardous . However , patient chronic pain patient number six . Single-injection paravertebral block may sufficient cover relevant dermatome C6 - Th6 radical mastectomy axillary dissection , apply sole anesthetic technique . Some study group perform paravertebral block several injection . Four injection result sufficient anaesthesia 97 % patient , whereas one injection effective 11 % . Though limited publish evidence yet , single injection paravertebral block may insufficient extensive breast surgery , mastectomy include axillary evisceration . However , consider potential risk deep paravertebral puncture limitation puncture would preferable . Inserting paravertebral catheter far enough proper position offer opportunity apply anesthetic agent different site , move catheter backwards injection . The purpose study find injection via paravertebral catheter three different level advantageous efficient compare general anesthesia patient mastectomy axillary dissection . In addition , instead 4 cm catheter insertion inside paravertebral space ( PVS ) recommend , use ultrasound-guided PVB ( transverse view , plane technique ) , facilitate insertion catheter ( 8 cm ) PVS . A contrast agent use randomly select patient prove exact site insert catheter exclude/detect obstruction kink . Methods : This prospective clinical trial . Patients agree document write informed consent . Sixty woman , ASA I - III undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery axillary dissection , include radical lymph node removal sentinel node biopsy enrol . Patients randomly assign two group , 30 patient , use block four method . Group I patient receive paravertebral block spine level Th 4 via catheter injection three different level ; Group II patient general anesthesia . Anesthetic preparation : After arrival OR standard monitoring apply include ECG , noninvasive blood pressure pulse oxymetry . Midazolam 0.05 mg per kilogram bodyweight give intravenously patient achieve mild sedation . Paravertebral block ( Group I ) . Paravertebral block entirely perform one person ( first author ) patient prone position . The superior aspect Th4 spinous process mark . After skin disinfection 18-gauge Tuohy needle include attached saline fill syringe insert perpendicular skin Th3-Th4 interspace , use area 2.5 cm lateral T4 spinous process Landmark . Under ultrasound guidance , needle advanced plane technique , angle anteriorly contact transverse process , redirect either caudal cephalad parallel spine advanced loss resistance . After placement needle end-hole 20 gauge catheter insert advanced 8 cm beyond needlepoint paravertebral space . The catheter insertion score 'easy ' , 'difficult ' 'impossible ' . In randomly select patient catheter localization detect fluoroscopy injection 0.5 ml contrast agent . The catheter position , mixture 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5 % plus 20 ml lidocaine 2 % adrenaline 1:200,000 slowly inject sequentially 10 ml withdraw catheter 2 cm first 2 cm second injection . Then catheter remove . Patients return supine position remain least 30 minute preoperative area . Sensory blockade assess use pin-prick method . When analgesia adequate patient move operating room . Intraoperative sedation provide low dose IV midazolam , ketamine bolus continuous propofol use target-controlled infusion system allow spontaneous breathing . In case skin incision surgical approach tolerate , regional block grade insufficient , switch general anesthesia . General Anaesthesia ( Group II ) : Anesthesia induce intravenously propofol fentanyl . Atracurium use facilitate tracheal intubation . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane 50 % oxygen air . Additional Fentanyl administer discretion anesthesiologist . Data collection : Patients ' biometric data , detail clinical course , amount anesthetic use , operation time , surgical difficulty , hemodynamic instability ( ) similar record . At postoperative care unit ( PACU ) pain score use visual rating scale 0 ( pain ) 10 ( worst imaginable pain ) assess rest movement shoulder every 15 minute 60 minute . Analgesia provide IV morphine bolus 15-min dose interval maintain VRS - score &lt; 3 . Time first analgesic demand 24-hr analgesic consumption record . Postoperative nausea vomit assess use 3-point scale ; Ondansetron administer treat . Any complication record include related paravertebral block , Horner 's syndrome , epidural spreading , hypotension relate another reason , pneumothorax adverse effect local anesthetic . Patients check 6 , 12 , 24hr postoperatively adverse effect , pain score , satisfaction score . During hospital stay , patient receive one tablet Ultracet ( tramadol plus acetaminophen ) Celebrex 200 mg two time day pain relief oral lorazepam bedtime . Residents nurse postoperative care station surgical ward blind treatment group . Sample size estimation : According data previous study paravertebral block compare general anesthesia reduce postoperative analgesia requirement ( opioids + non-steroidal analgesic ) 80 % . Taking 5 % significance level basis 30 patient per group adequate . Statistical analysis : Parametric data express mean analyzed use Student 's T test . The non-parametric data express median ( range ) analyze use Mann-Whitney U Test . Repeated analysis variance use compare VAS group . The association technique incidence complication evaluate chi-square Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS v20.0 Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) . All test two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 accept statistically significant .</detailed_description>
