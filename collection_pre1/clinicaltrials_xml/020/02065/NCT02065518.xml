	<brief_summary>The purpose project compare three treatment regimen knee injury standard rehabilitation protocol : 1 ) NMES , 2 ) graduate strength walking ( via weight vest ) , 3 ) NMES combine graduate strength walking . Each treatment arm supplement standard care compare group receive standard rehabilitation . The Study compare effect NMES , Strength Walking combine NMES/ Strength Walking strength , mobility , symptomatology , Quality Life ( QOL ) military member knee injury standard rehabilitation protocol program . All group participate standard rehabilitation protocol . The group assess 18 week compare main interactive effect time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence knee injury show striking increase &gt; 24 % last 5 year , affect work performance , limit mobility , impact military deployment health . This increase reflect current high op-tempo frequent deployment nation war include activity related military operation , physical fitness , demand training . We show neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) improve quadriceps muscle strength . We also show pedometer-based protocol improve fitness . The overall objective project compare three treatment regimen knee injury standard rehabilitation protocol potential treatment improve strength , work efficiency , mobility active duty military personnel knee injury . Our central hypothesis combination NMES walk wear weighted vest demonstrate great improvement muscle strength , work efficiency , mobility , compare usual care alone . The rationale NMES combine graduated strength walking could produce marked improvement muscle strength thereby enhance work performance , readiness fitness , decrease physical symptom faster return duty . NMES graduate strength walking , simulate current uniform theatre operation ( body armor ) .The specific aim compare effectiveness three treatment regimens usual care improving : ( 1 ) muscle strength , ( 2 ) work efficiency , ( 3 ) mobility , ( 4 ) symptoms/pain , ( 5 ) quality life . After baseline testing , propose randomly assign male female subject ( n=132 ) age 18 50 year knee injury one 4 group : 1 ) NMES , 2 ) strength walking , 3 ) NMES strength walking , 4 ) usual care . All group receive 12-weeks intervention 6-weeks follow-up . Generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) method use build regression model statistical analysis longitudinal data . If intervention effective respect parameter strength , mobility , work performance , symptom , recommendation future treatment make . This hugely important , give rise rate knee injury possibility provider-managed care would critical assist warrior rapid recovery return duty .</detailed_description>
