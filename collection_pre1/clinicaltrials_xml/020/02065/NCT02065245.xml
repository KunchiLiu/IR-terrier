	<detailed_description>A Pilot Phase perform test safety dose volume escalation cell administer via peripheral intravenous infusion . The randomized portion study conduct full review safety data Pilot Phase data safety monitor board . PILOT STUDY At pilot subject one year phone call visit , fifteen ( 15 ) pilot subject provide option four additional infusion allogeneic hMSCs . RANDOMIZATION STUDY This Phase I/II , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled study design evaluate safety tolerability allogenic human mesenchymal stem cell patient Frailty explore potential efficacy 4 week . Approximately fifteen ( 15 ) subject enrol pilot phase thirty ( 30 ) subject enrol randomized phase Frailty enrol . Subjects enrol randomized 1:1:1 active arm placebo . If subject receive placebo , randomize phase may eligible / option receive one infusion allogeneic hMSCs . An additional twenty ( 20 ) subject enrol safety trial antibiotic free cell . Eligible subject must diagnosis symptom frailty define Canadian Study Health &amp; Aging . Following informed consent screen visit , diagnosis FRAILTY confirm investigator review medical history .</detailed_description>
