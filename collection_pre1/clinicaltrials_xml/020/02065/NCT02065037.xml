	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer second common cancer world second leading cause cancer-related mortality . Colorectal cancer arise precursor adenomatous polyp well characterize adenoma carcinoma progression . The removal precursor lesion reduce colorectal cancer mortality 30 50 % . Colonoscopy use detection neoplastic polyp significant miss rate lesion report . Methods reduce spasm colon investigated increase adenoma detection rate include use warm water irrigation hyoscine butyl bromide . Carbon dioxide warm body temperature postulate spasmolytic effect . Administration warm carbon dioxide colonoscopy may improve polyp detection . Objective : In study , colonoscopy use warmed carbon dioxide insufflation compare standard room temperature air insufflation see great detection polyp per patient . Methods : Patients undergo colonoscopy screen surveillance indication include randomize receive either room temperature room air warm carbon dioxide ( 37 degree Celsius ) . Endoscopists patient blind intervention . Data indication , preparation , sedation , withdrawal time record . Polyp detection rate primary outcome . Secondary outcome include adenoma detection rate advance lesion detection rate .</brief_summary>
