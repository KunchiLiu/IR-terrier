	<brief_summary>The purpose study test ability advance external Physiologic Insulin Delivery ( ePID ) algorithm ( step step process use develop solution problem ) get acceptable meal response range gain . Gain defined much insulin give response change patient 's glucose level . This study also examine effectiveness external Physiologic Insulin Delivery ( ePID ) closed-loop insulin delivery computer software . The investigator would like ass whether fast target level achieve closed-loop gain increase decrease , evaluate system 's ability produce acceptable breakfast meal response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There significant advance diabetes management technology , include sophisticated insulin pump accurate real-time continuous glucose monitor . The next technological development widely think introduction algorithm link pump sensor form closed-loop insulin delivery system . The algorithm use purpose need robust change individual 's insulin sensitivity , sensor 's sensitivity glucose . Insulin sensitivity ( much patient 's glucose level change response change insulin delivery ) algorithm gain ( much insulin deliver response change glucose ) determine system overall closed-loop gain . Ideally , overall gain set achieve low possible peak postprandial glucose response without postprandial hypoglycemia . However , algorithm 's gain set fix value subject 's insulin sensitivity change , overall-gain change . Some degradation closed-loop performance might acceptable period whenever subject 's insulin sensitivity low ( i.e. , subject insulin resistant ) risk hypoglycemia may actually reduce . However , subject becomes sensitive system may become less stable risk postprandial hypoglycemia may increase . In addition change insulin sensitivity , glucose sensor sometimes over- under-read blood glucose sensor sensitivity increase decrease . This result change closed-loop algorithm 's effective target . The purpose study evaluate ability advance Physiologic Insulin Delivery algorithm achieve acceptable breakfast response gain effective target glucose level change . Specifically : 1. ass fast glucose level achieve overall closed-loop gain effective target increase decreased , 2. determine system 's ability produce acceptable breakfast meal response condition</detailed_description>
