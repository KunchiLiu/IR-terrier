	<brief_title>Comprehensive Intervention Evaluate Outcomes AND Cost Hospitalized Surgical Patients With Diabetes Mellitus ( DM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient plan elective surgery hospital see pre-operative center day admission . The diabetes management team become involve care patient HbA1c &gt; 8.0 % time . Once patient admit hospital , diabetes management team continue follow ready discharge . At point discharge , patient randomize one two arms- usual care group expand diabetes management service ( eDMS ) . The eDMS group follow closely 1 year discharge investigator make sure receive appropriate care diabetes . Aims study : 1 . To evaluate whether patient receive eDMS low re-hospitalization rate 1 month compare patient receive traditional ( current ) DMS . Investigators hypothesize eDMS program lower re-hospitalization rate 1 month . 2 . To evaluate whether patient receive eDMS low HbA1c level 1 year compare patient receive traditional DMS . Investigators hypothesize patient eDMS program lower HbA1c level improve diabetes-related health outcome 1 year program .</detailed_description>
