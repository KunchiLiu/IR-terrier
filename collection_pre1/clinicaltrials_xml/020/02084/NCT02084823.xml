	<brief_summary>Most study cancer stem cell ( CSC ) involve inoculation cell human tumor immunosuppressed mouse , prevent assessment immunologic interaction effect CSCs . In study , investigator examine vaccination effect produce CSC-enriched population histologically distinct murine tumor inoculation different syngeneic immunocompetent host . Enriched CSCs immunogenic effective antigen source unselected tumor cell induce protective antitumor immunity.Immune sera CSC-vaccinated host contain high level IgG bound CSCs , result CSC lysis presence complement.CTLs generate peripheral blood mononuclear cell splenocytes harvest CSC-vaccinated host capable kill CSCs vitro . Mechanistic investigation establish CSC-primed antibody T cell capable selective target CSCs confer antitumor immunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To assess feasibility generate CSC-loaded DC vaccine clinical use , investigator harvest peripheral blood tumor specimen patient Lung Cancer . The investigator purify T , B cell generate DCs PBMCs Lung cancer patient.On hand , investigator isolate ALDHhigh ALDHlow tumor cell tumor specimen Lung cancer patient use similar protocol investigator report . Aim 1 : To demonstrate , vitro , relative cellular anti-Lung cancer CSC immunity induce Lung cancer CSC-DC prim cytotoxic T cell . Aim 2 : To determine , vitro , specific bind lysis Lung cancer CSCs antibody produce purified B cell PBMCs stimulate Lung cancer CSC-DC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma lung.The site primary lesion confirm radiologically , surgically lung . 2 . Patients must deem unresectable due involvement critical vasculature , adjacent organ invasion , presence metastasis , medical condition make surgical resection unfavorable . 3 . Patients must primary metastatic lesion measurable least one dimension RECIST criterion within 4 week prior entry study . 4 . More 4 week must elapse time major surgery completion last dose chemotherapy , radiation therapy , investigational therapy patient must adequately recover effect . 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 6 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % . 7 . The patient show normal organ function accord follow parameter ( measure within six week prior treatment allocation ) : Hemoglobin : Within normal range accord institutional standard ; Absolute leukocyte count : Within normal range accord institutional standard ; Absolute lymphocyte count : Within normal range accord institutional standard ; Platelet count : Within normal range accord institutional standard ; Alanine aminotransferase : ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; Aspartate aminotransferase : ≤ 2.5 x ULN ; Total bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN . In case know Gilbert 's syndrome ≤ 2 x ULN ; Serum creatinine : 1.5 x ULN ; Calculated creatinine clearance : &gt; 50 mL/min . 8 . Age &gt; 18 year . 9 . No history autoimmune disease . 10 . Ability understand study protocol willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients receive anticoagulation therapy . 2 . Patients receive prior gemcitabine radiation therapy lung bed 3 . Patients receive investigational agent . 4 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse effect . 5 . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Patients test positive Hepatitis B virus , Hepatitis C virus HIV . 7. level 3 hypertension ; 8. severe coronary disease ; 9. myelosuppression ; 10. respiratory disease ; 11. brain metastasis ; 12. chronic infection</criteria>
