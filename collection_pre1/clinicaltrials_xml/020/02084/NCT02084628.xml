	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center study involve baby 0-2 month age liver problem ( pathology ) need liver possibly , bile duct image use magnetic resonance image injection contrast agent ( dye ) . This agent call Eovist . It market since 2004 use many country world . The baby blood test image do make sure unexpected finding image . Also 3 blood sample 8 hour injection obtain order measure much dye blood . The baby intravenous line use blood sample need stick blood sample . Several radiologist evaluate image . The family doctor contact find diagnosis treatment result MRI know . Six month study , parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) contact make sure baby problem , especially skin , joint eye .</brief_summary>
