	<brief_summary>The investigator plan study inflammation brain ( neuroinflammation ) human patient epilepsy use novel , non-invasive technique proven successful human neuroinflammatory disease . This technique use ferumoxytol , drug minimal side effect FDA-approved treatment iron deficiency anemia , contrast agent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The study recruit epilepsy patient admit Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ( DHMC ) video-electroencephalography ( video-EEG ) monitoring order evaluate candidacy curative brain surgery . During hospital stay inform consent , patient receive standard-dose intravenous injection ferumoxytol , undergo one session MRI 24-48 hour injection . The patient also undergo separate `` baseline '' MRI session ( already do DHMC ) admission four week injection brain surgery . Brain region preferentially uptake ferumoxytol localized subtract post-injection MRI session `` baseline '' MRI session . The investigator investigate whether region overlap epileptogenic focus , namely region generates epilepsy localize video-EEG diagnostic measure . Lastly , patient participant thereafter undergo brain surgery , DHMC neuropathologists use special stain detect quantify neuroinflammation brain tissue remove , result serve reference investigator measure sensitivity specificity ferumoxytol-based MRI detect neuroinflammation .</brief_summary>
