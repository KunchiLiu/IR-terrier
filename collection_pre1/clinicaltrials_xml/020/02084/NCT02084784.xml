	<brief_title>Application Surgical Navigation System Sentinel Lymph Node Breast Cancer Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) patient early stage breast cancer vital select appropriate surgical approach . However , exist method , include methylene blue nuclides , possess low efficiency effectiveness mapping SLNs , certain extent exert side effect application . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) , fluorescent dye , prove reliable usage SLN detection several group . In paper , introduce novel surgical navigation system detect SLN ICG . This system contain two charge-coupled device ( CCD ) simultaneously capture real-time color fluorescent video image two different band . During surgery , surgeon need follow fluorescence display . In addition , system save data automatically surgery enable surgeon find registration point easily accord image recognition algorithms . We aim show usage surgical navigation system ICG detect SLNs breast cancer patient technically feasible .</detailed_description>
