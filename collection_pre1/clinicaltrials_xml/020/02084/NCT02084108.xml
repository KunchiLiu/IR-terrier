	<detailed_description>Background Since second half twentieth century , major prolongation life expectancy lead rapid increase number old adult Switzerland , high prevalence multiple chronic disease , functional incapacity cognitive deficit . In general , care frail elderly characterize fragmentation discontinuity within sector , result frequent inappropriate hospitalization premature nurse home placement increase health care cost . Furthermore , many old patient progressive chronic disease prefer die home , 50 percent hospital , multiple hospitalization final year . This mostly related availability health resource community . Care-giver burden increase morbidity population often hidden consequence care dependent old adult . A study perform 2003 University Hospital Geneva emergency room5 show among 255 patient ( mean age 79 year ) evaluate three-month period inability stay home , 59 percent acute medical problem rather breakdown informal support system . Ninety per cent frail dependent , 85 percent evaluate primary care physician previous arrival emergency room . This study suggest many need disability frail elderly identify lack coordination different actor community primary health care system enable patient stay home . Consequently , increase interest ability integrate model care improve health outcome shift service utilization institutional set community . Integrated model care vary greatly among country depend local health policy , financing , well professional sociocultural value . Broadly , three different level integration describe - linkage , coordination full integration - depend level integration different actor administrative , financial service sector continuum degree collaboration , range informal structure service include single roof . The first level linkage organizational model best applies Geneva . Patient care take place primary care physician exist structure depend patient need . Communication professional involve encouraged order promote continuity care . However structure function legal , financial operational environment cost shift structure . No distinct model integrate care frail elderly place Canton Geneva , collaboration depend informal linkage actor community . This study evaluate implementation second level integration coordinate exist community resource improve care frail elderly patient present complex medical psychosocial issue real-life clinical setting . Design A prospective randomized control cluster trial two intervention arm two control arm conduct . Each arm correspond nurse team one two home nursing service health care center ( Onex Bernex ) . Because difficulty randomize frail complex patient individually , patient randomize nursing team . The nursing personnel center divide two team similar size ( nine nurse per team Onex six nurse per team Bernex ) composition . Each team responsible follow patient predetermine sector , patient address . The research team initially begin recruitment July 2009 Onex home nursing service health center . The Bernex center add June 2011 order reach recruitment target . Two nursing team identify center . Patients assign nurse team depend place residence . The allocation nursing team intervention control arm perform use random number generator . Each nursing team designate number ( 1 4 ) first four random number generate , allocate corresponding team . It decide process high number site would allocate control arm intervention arm . Once patient attribute team , remain entire follow-up period transfer patient team . The recruitment patient influence health status , since eligibility determine patient attribute one group another . The control arm consist two cluster patient 60 year age follow primary care physician routinely evaluate home nursing service resident assessment instrument-home care ( RAI-HC ) identify frail pre-defined clinical criterion . The intervention arm consist two cluster patient 60 year age follow primary care physician routinely evaluate home nursing service RAI-HC identify frail predefined clinical criterion receive addition in-home multidimensional geriatric assessment , access 24 hour day , 7 day week call service provide Community Geriatrics Unit coordinate long-term follow-up . Because real-life clinical setting , blind feasible . Target population The target population patient 60 year age follow primary care physician prescribe home intervention home nursing service . These patient , routinely evaluate Resident assessment instrument-Home care ( RAI-HC ) , identify frail fulfill predefined clinical criterion ( see inclusion criterion ) . Home nursing service evaluation prescribe primary care physician usually acute event ( fall ) decompensation physical psychological illness . The target population already present variable degree frailty dependency require in-home intervention home nursing service Community Geriatrics Unit may request primary care physician evaluate complex situation . This , however , usual practice . Patients identify previously know Community Geriatrics Unit . Geographical set The Canton Geneva population 466,918 inhabitant , 16 percent 65 . Most elderly population live home , 14 percent live nursing home . This study carry two 45 commune Canton Geneva : Onex Ã  population 17,942 Bernex , population 9,772 inhabitant . These commune choose size geographical proximity Community Geriatrics Unit site Loex good collaboration primary care physicians region . Each commune home nursing service health center . The socioeconomic status similar homogeneous population present confound factor . Follow-up intervention group - Each patient routinely administer RAI-HC assign home care nurse . If inclusion criterion present , nurse present protocol orally write patient and/or caregiver . It clearly specify write information patient incur extra out-of-pocket expense since in-home geriatric assessment reimburse health insurance . The visit 90 % reimbursed patient health insurance ( private obligatory ) . The remain 10 percent deductible waive Community Geriatrics Unit . - If consent obtain , patient information transmit research nurse CHIP score calculation base RAI-HC data inclusion study . - The Community Geriatrics Unit doctor inform primary care physician patient 's inclusion study . - The Community Geriatrics Unit doctor contact patient schedule in-home multidimensional geriatric assessment . If necessary , evaluation perform another member Community Geriatrics Unit team , physical therapist , occupational therapist , psychologist , dietician social worker . - The result recommendation evaluation transmit primary care physician home care nurse . - Coordinated follow-up primary care physician , home nursing service nurse Community Geriatrics Unit establish . - Patients receive write instruction ( information available home log book ) contact case acute health problem : - The first person contact primary care physician ; - If available , home nursing service nurse ( imad ) contact ; - The nurse patient contact call service Community Geriatrics Unit available 24 hour day , 7 day week , urgent intervention carry telephone and/or home visit ; - Team meeting primary care physician , home nursing service Community Geriatrics Unit schedule need discus complex situation . Follow-up control group During period , patient follow nursing team assign control arm administer RAI-HC . If frailty criterion detect , patient information transmit research nurse CHIP score calculation inclusion study . Patients continue receive usual care follow-up primary care physician home nursing service . Sample size The plan sample size 300 ( 150 per arm ) calculate base 5 percent alpha error ( two-sided ) power 80 percent detect difference hospitalization 12 percent . This difference base previous meta-analysis control study utilized comprehensive geriatric assessment.24 The expected hospitalization rate frail elder approximately 30 percent . In addition , 150 patient recruit sequentially , randomize cluster arm . Calendar Recruitment begin July 2009 . The study initially program 18 month . Nevertheless , due circumstance relate real-life clinical setting , many challenge . Recruitment delayed 2010 five-month maternity leave research nurse , difficult replace . Furthermore also 2010 , home nursing service health care center Onex move office , cause recruitment delay . Finally 2011 , Bernex home nursing service team deal period transition computerize record system , new research nurse hire . The recruitment target reach July 1 , 2012 follow outcome December 15 , 2012 . Data analysis manuscript redaction carry 2013-2014 . Ethical consideration The study approve Ethics Committee Departments Internal Medicine Community Medicine University Hospital Geneva August 26 , 2008 ( Protocol No . 08-128 ) well Ethics Committee Geneva Medical Association clinical ambulatory research October 24 , 2008 ( Protocol number : 08-06 ) . Signed consent obtain allocation intervention group , since integrate care routinely part usual care . Consent control group waive ethic committee , give patient already follow home nursing service routinely obtain consent use collect data . Measures intervention efficacy Primary outcome : - Hospitalizations : rate first hospitalization , number , cause length stay Secondary outcome : - Emergency room visit : rate first visit , number cause - Institutionalization : number patient - Mortality : rate number deaths place death ( home versus hospital ) Data collection In group , research nurse collect data patient ' computerized hospital record , computerize home nursing service record record Community Geriatrics Unit . Data collect patient include follow : - Alarms ; - Demographic data ; - Medical diagnosis ; - Medications ; - Number consultation home acute problem ( telephone home visit ) Community Geriatrics Unit physician , primary care physician emergency service . Statistical analysis Descriptive result report count percentage mean standard deviation . Characteristics group compare use exact Mann-Whitney , Chi-squared Fisher test . The main secondary outcome compare intention treat intervention control group use survival analysis . For mortality , Kaplan-Meier survival estimator , log-rank test Cox regression model use . As death compete event outcome ( institutionalization , first hospitalization first emergency room visit ) , compete risk model use . The cumulated incidence hazard ratio obtain package cmprsk R version 3.0.1 . All report hazard ratio adjust health care center test comparison cumulate incidence follow-up period stratify health care center . Cumulated incidence one , two three year compare use Wald test . Two-sided p-values less 0.05 consider significant . All analysis perform use S-Plus 8.0 Windows R version 3.0.1 . Funding Funding swiss franc 94,500 ( $ 104,241 ) obtain Quality Bureau University Hospital Geneva December 2008 . This amount use hire part-time ( 50 percent ) research nurse assistant coordinate study , collect data manage database July 2009 . Additional funding swiss franc 66,000 ( $ 72,800 ) obtain Edmond J. Safra Fund order continue study October 2011 . Discussion Care frail dependent elderly usually characterize frequent unnecessary hospitalization , emergency room visit institutionalization . Most patient express desire die home hospital , many case due either absence caregiver lack coordinate care . The investigator postulate outcome achieve implement integrate care network , close coordination different actor well access specialize community geriatrics unit include round-the-clock call service . The author study also seek demonstrate establishment network feasible provide effective efficient health care population . If result positive , hop political decision-makers health care sector encourage implement support program .</detailed_description>
