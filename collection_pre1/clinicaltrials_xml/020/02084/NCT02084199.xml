	<brief_title>Study Evaluate GLPG0634 Subjects With Renal Impairment Compared Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide two part . In Part 1 , 3 subject severe renal impairment end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) yet require dialysis ( Group 1 ) recruit first . Thereafter , 3 subject normal renal function ( Group 2 ) recruit . If substantial effect PK renal impaired subject observe Day 10 , sponsor may elect stop Part 1 study without enrol complete set subject Part 2 initiate . In case substantial effect PK observe , 3 subject Group 1 2 recruit analyse . If substantial effect PK observe , study proceed Part 2 . Part 2 study conduct , Part 1 substantial difference PK see . In Part 2 , Group 3 ( mild renal impairment ) Group 4 ( moderate renal impairment ) recruit first . After completion mild moderate impairment group , Group 5 ( normal renal function ) recruit .</detailed_description>
