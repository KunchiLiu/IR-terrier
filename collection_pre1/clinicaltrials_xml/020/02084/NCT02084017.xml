	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate current standard wound care follow vascular operation compare negative pressure wound therapy ( vacuum dress ) rate surgical site infection ( SSIs ) patient undergo surgery restore blood flow low limb ( ) . Negative pressure wound therapy consist close , seal system produce negative pressure ( vacuum ) wind surface . The device consist open-cell foam seal occlusive adhesive dressing ( cover stick incision ) suction maintain connect suction tube vacuum pump waste collector . The investigator objectives determine whether reduction surgical site infection potential reduction influence length hospital stay , emergency room visit , antibiotic use need re-operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Prevention Surgical Site Infection Following Lower Limb Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study non-blinded randomize control trial . The study examines effect wound heal surgical site infection use negative pressure wound therapy compare standard dress high-risk patient ( BMI &gt; 30 , previous femoral cut-down ) . The investigator expect find low surgical site infection rate patient use NPWT device . Patients give informed consent randomize receive either NPWT standard wound therapy follow tier lower-limb revascularization operative . Both applied sterile condition immediately post-operatively . The intervention leave 4-7 day depend discharge date standard dress remove post-operative day two . The data analyze intention treat analysis .</detailed_description>
