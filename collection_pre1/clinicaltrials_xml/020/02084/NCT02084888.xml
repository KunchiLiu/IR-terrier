	<detailed_description>The SCAAR registry The SCAAR registry establish 1999 part national SWEDEHEART registry . The registry gather data consecutive patient hospital perform coronary angiography PCI Sweden . The information clinical characteristic procedural detail enter registry immediately procedure PCI physician review clinical information . SCAAR independent commercial funding sponsor Swedish Health Authorities . The technology develop administer Uppsala Clinical Research Center , Uppsala , Sweden . Since 2001 , web-based case-report platform automatic data surveillance . Study population The study population consist consecutive patient underwent coronary angiography PCI Sweden register 2005 2012 Swedish Coronary Angiography Angioplasty Registry ( SCAAR ) . Definitions The investigator define CTO 100 % luminal diameter stenosis absence antegrade flow know assumed ≥3 month duration . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) define luminal narrowing ≥50 % angiography . Procedural success PCI treatment coronary lesion define residual stenosis &lt; 50 % , decrease grade stenosis intervention least 20 % , TIMI flow ≥ II serious complication . Study cohort The study base patient underwent diagnostic coronary angiography register SCAAR period 2005 January 2012 . Only patient diagnose significant coronary artery disease include analysis . A CTO patient identify base available information percentage luminal stenosis level coronary segment introduced 2005 . From date onwards , information derive diagnostic coronary angiogram also use determine coronary segment totally occlude . In order differentiate acute chronic occlusion , exclude patient underwent procedure ACS 100 % occlusion locate coronary artery culprit vessel . Furthermore , exclude patient underwent procedure vessel within previous 3 month . The patient previous coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery exclude analysis patency graft could determine . Validation Validation CTO definition perform subgroup 955 patient one university hospital ( Sahlgrenska University Hospital ) three county hospital ( Norra Älvsborgs Hospital , Borås Hospital , Skövde Hospital ) . This subgroup represent 5.7 % identified CTO patient SCAAR study period . The patient randomly select mean random number generator . The validation procedure conduct panel consist five experienced interventional cardiologist . The panelist examine individual coronary angiogram accord monitoring plan define advance . Each angiogram evaluate regard whether patient previous CABG , whether treat occlusion ≥3 month old whether 100 % segmental stenosis angiogram occlusion ≥3 month old . The result validation procedure compare data enter SCAAR . Statistical analysis Differences baseline characteristic group test χ2 test categorical variable Mann-Whitney U test Kruskal-Wallis test use comparison continuous non-normally distributed variable . Shapiro-Wilks test use test normal distribution . Statistical significance define P-value &lt; 0.05 . The primary outcome all-cause mortality . Unadjusted survival examine use Kaplan-Meier survival curve log-rank test . To evaluate association presence CTO mortality , multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) calculate use Cox proportional-hazards regression model . All test two-sided . The potential confounders ; age , gender , diabete , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , smoke status , previous PCI , previous MI , extent CAD , indication , puncture site , complication , primary treatment decision , enter model . We prespecified six subgroup analysis follow patient category : indication angiography PCI ( stable angina , UA/non-STEMI , STEMI ) severity CAD ( one- , two- , three-vessel leave main disease ) age , gender , diabetes calendar year . The possible effect modification CTO risk die subgroup analyze mean interaction test . Age examine interaction CTO continuous well factorial variable consist four different age group namely &lt; 59 , 60-69 , 70-79 &gt; 80 year . The assumption proportional hazard covariate review separately mean log-minus-log survival plot formal test base scale Schoenfeld residual . Possible multicollinearity variable model assessed calculation variance inflation factor . The database scrutinize miss data . A number variable list associated miss data . In addition complete case analysis , apply multiple imputation method estimate miss data perform Cox proportional hazard regression impute data set assumption miss data miss random . The imputation protocol consist chain-equation method predictive-mean matching algorithm use covariates main analysis 20 imputed data set addition cumulative hazard event indicator . Cumulative hazard estimate Nelson-Aalen 's test . Due hierarchical structure SCAAR clustering patient within hospital cause violation assumption independency patient , apply multilevel model share frailty Cox proportional-hazards regression adjust cluster effect . This primary model . The secondary model base complete-case analysis . All analysis perform use Stata software ( version 13.1 , StataCorp , College Station , Texas , USA ) . The imputation procedure subsequent Cox proportional hazard regression estimation perform accord Rubin 's protocol .</detailed_description>
