Five village randomly select catchment area intervention health centre one VHT purposively select village . Intervention arm receive VHTs equip mobile phone make four schedule home visit woman control arm receive standard care prenatal immediate newborn education .

	<detailed_description>Study design This pragmatic community randomize trial . A mixed method data collection use . Randomization Health centre offer antenatal delivery care eligible randomization . Sixteen health centre , exclude main hospital , identify randomly allocate intervention ( eight health centre ) control ( eight health centre ) arm study . To allow equitable representation district , proportionate number health centre select Masindi ( ten health centre ) Kiryandongo ( six health centre ) . In intervention health centre five village randomly select participate study . In village one member VHT select participate study . VHTs select basis active participation relate project . Active VHTs consider appropriate since largely voluntary intervention minimal financial material benefit . In arm pregnant woman make first antenatal consultation eligible participate study regardless gravidity status . Those woman present twenty eight week amenorrhea less palpation qualify inclusion . The investigator develop criterion exclusion study . Blinding necessary since randomization do level health centre . Pre-intervention data assessment routine health management information system show 80 % pregnant woman region make first antenatal consultation twenty eight week amenorrhea . Also , average , village expect 25 delivery year ( consider population 500 inhabitant ) . Therefore , health centre five village select , investigator expect 125 delivery per year . But , 80 % make first antenatal visit within twenty eight week ( inclusion criterion ) investigator expect recruit 100 woman per health centre entire study period bring total 800 woman per arm . Intervention The investigator use pragmatic approach intervention whereby investigator consider implementation intervention normal environment without modification context , restriction selection study participant long qualify health staff allow implement intervention normal care delivery health centre without creation parallel structure [ 23-25 ] . However , investigator develop simple standard operate procedure health worker VHTs ensure standardize approach help inadvertently forget certain aspect intervention . Selected VHTs train base manual educational information offer pregnant woman publish 'mother 's passport ' widely available training material Uganda . The mother 's passport booklet locally design pictorial use health facility Ugandan context . It elaborate step step information require pregnant woman pregnancy care practice newborn care . Trainers adopt interactive participative approach aim develop group facilitation skills among VHTs . The training last five consecutive day . To maintain enthusiasm among trainee training-day last 9.00 2.00 pm . The first day training dedicate problem newborn care important invest time effort improve health newborn baby . On second day , VHTs take mother 's passport use pictorial conduct educational session family . On third fourth day role-plays conduct pre-test real life situation use field-based practicum conduct . On fifth day , VHTs initiate actual study protocol use simplified standard operate procedure . This training do together health worker select health centre . The practicum session critique fellow VHTs improvement suggest . Participant recruitment intervention control arm do passively . Typically , pregnant woman recruit make first antenatal consultation health centre gestation age twenty eight week less come one select village . After explain purpose study write consent secure , health worker enroll program opening personal file include entry bio-data woman address relevant contact like telephone village , name spouse since many woman easier locate use name spouses local council chairperson council . Previous current obstetric history record personal file . The pregnant woman issue counter-referral form deliver responsible VHT . At stage health worker notifies VHT consent woman call post-paid mobile phone . Upon receive telephone notification , VHT locate pregnant woman family make appointment . A suitable date time select agree upon VHT woman . Three home visit expect , two pregnancy one soon delivery . The first home visit conduct soon health centre referral second make four week first . The third visit schedule within three day delivery baby . During first visit VHT hold discussion two main topic general care ( usefulness IPT , folic acid , consistent use bed net , maternal diet , antenatal consultation institutionalize delivery ) ; danger sign pregnancy ( Vaginal bleeding , Convulsions , fever , Water loss , Abdominal pain , Severe headaches , Blurred vision , Swelling limb , Absent diminish fetal movement ) . The second visit require VHT discuss birth preparation ( Identifying place delivery , Identify skilled birth attendant , Organizing transport , Setting money aside , Planning emergency , Planning family member ) item need delivery ( Clean plastic cloth delivery , Clean dry towel mother baby , New razorblade , Clean thread , Pairs gloves ) care newborn baby address three core area : cord care , initiation breast feeding within first hour birth , avoid pre-lacteal feed delay bath least three day . A dialogue approach , oppose top-down instruction offer health worker , consider superior approach behavior change . Delivery intervention-dialogue session A dialogue session consider appropriate deliver need information pregnant woman spouses relative consider important decision make offer respectful engagement family [ 26 ] . This required VHT make prior appointment woman make visit . The dialogue session mean mitigate problem top-down directive commonly adopt health worker deliver educational information woman follow without give opportunity react . The dialogue session adopt group discussion approach VHT become facilitator discussion towards path least resistance rather provider knowledge per se . The session conduct manner foster discussion issue already outline section intervention . This dialogue also premise fact information already know woman deliver health worker . Therefore , dialogue session mean reinforce woman already know demystify wrong perception presence family member include spouse . The VHT together family member woman sit shade home family visit . The VHT already know member village need introduction . He/she introduce subject matter create environment discussion . Usually , session start ask woman member learn health centre member family expect give view . The VHT use guide offer initial train steer debate . This guide also help VHT exhaust relevant topic meant visit . More time emphasis place topic consider controversial like buy necessary item need delivery , care cord delay birth baby . The VHT encourage member participate ask question would provide response . In event feel competent respond , call health worker mobile phone clarity make . The session conclude VHT make recap discussion highlight important area family 's attention .</detailed_description>
