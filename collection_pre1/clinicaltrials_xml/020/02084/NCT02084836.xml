The limited success treatment prevention intervention may due incomplete understanding process increase risk obesity . Recent data suggest obese adult show abnormalities reward food intake anticipate food intake relative lean adult , precise nature abnormality unclear establish whether abnormality predate obesity onset consequence . It vital elucidate risk factor obesity onset advance understand etiological process determine content prevention treatment program . The goal study ( 1 ) determine whether adolescent high-risk obesity , virtue two obese parent , show abnormality reward food intake ( consummatory food reward ) anticipate reward food intake ( anticipatory food reward ) compare adolescent low-risk obesity , ( 2 ) determine whether abnormality consummatory anticipatory food reward increase risk weight gain obesity onset , ( 3 ) examine moderator may amplify relation consummatory anticipatory food reward unhealthy weight gain , ( 4 ) examine change consummatory anticipatory food reward participant show obesity onset relative showing obesity onset .</brief_summary>
