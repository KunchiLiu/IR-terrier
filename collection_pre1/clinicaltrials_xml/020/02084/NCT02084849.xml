	<brief_summary>The purpose study find radiology test kidneys opposed glomerular filtration ( GFR ) test ( GFR test - lab test measure kidney function ) follow progression polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) best . PKD patient risk progression renal failure ( dialysis transplantation ) identify include diagnosed high blood pressure early , presence PKD1 gene ( inherited abnormality responsible majority PKD ) , men oppose woman , episode visible blood increase protein urine , woman experience three pregnancy . Individuals diagnose PKD first year life utero ( birth ) also high risk progression renal failure . This study also facilitate understanding human disease cellular molecular level . We identify genetic factor may influence severity polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) . You ask provide sample blood purpose DNA biochemical analysis .</brief_summary>
