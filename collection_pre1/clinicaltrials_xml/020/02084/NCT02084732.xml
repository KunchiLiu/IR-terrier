	<brief_summary>Differentiated thyroid cancer include papillary , follicular , Hurthle cell , C-cell/medullary carcinoma . Even though incidence relatively low ( 1 % neoplasm ) , rise disease record country ( The Atlas Cancer Mortality Colombia , 2010 ) . Although disease low rate attributable mortality , cost arise treatment , monitoring , disability among affected patient family high health system . The therapeutic approach differentiate thyroid cancer start progress limit ; truly favorable treatment option patient advanced thyroid cancer : available option include surgery , radiotherapy , radioactive iodine therapy . Molecular biology allow identification effect mutation alteration protein participate cell signal account dedifferentiation , invasiveness , progression neoplastic cell . VEGFR ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ) one main molecule address targeted molecular therapy . Its increased expression differentiate thyroid cancer demonstrate associate increased growth , invasiveness , short recurrence-free survival . Different agent effective tyrosine kinase receptor ; nevertheless , take account solely responsible tumor progression , accord clinical study result , reasonable use non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib motesanib . These inhibitor already test phase II study . Results recent phase II research study use emerge treatment option show important effect therapeutic approach solid neoplasms . Information safety type treatment limit ; need information regard use new therapeutic approach Colombia one contribution National Institute Cancer make country study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Sorafenib Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer : Phase II Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Determine clinical efficacy safety profile sorafenib treatment patient advance thyroid cancer ( metastatic recurrent ) 24 month follow period . Analysis plan The analysis plan include description clinical epidemiological characteristic recruit patient end first year comparison clinical response accord RECIST criterion . At end first second follow-up year , analyse perform . In , response patient outcomes interest measure specific monitoring time evaluate . Parametric non-parametric descriptive statistic use necessary ; comparison variable baseline measurement follow-up predetermine cut-offs perform take account lack independence observation . Analysis qualitative variable perform use McNemar 's Test analysis quantitative variable use Paired Student 's t-Test Wilcoxon Test depend normality distribution Descriptive statistic use time event , survival curve progression-free time median state . Correlation study indicator , clinical variable , observe outcomes use parametric non-parametric coefficient perform . Interobserver agreement evaluate read diagnostic image use Kappa coefficient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Older 18 year . Confirmed histological diagnosis differentiate thyroid cancer , whether metastatic unresectable , conventional curative palliative therapeutic option exist effective . It include patient lesion visible image , uptake therapeutic dos iodine , patient iodine avid lesion , keep progress therapeutic dos ( great 100 mCi ) . Also comprise patient persistent local disease progression amenable surgical management radiation therapy management . The time pass since last treatment inclusion must least six ( 6 ) month . There must least 1 lesion adequately measure accord RECIST ( v.1.1 ) criterion [ See Appendix 1 ] . Neck lung lesion , surgery declare unresectable . Patients must ECOG score less 2 life expectancy great 3 month . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function define follow laboratory parameter , take 7 day consent signing : white blood cell count , &gt; 3,000/uL ; absolute neutrophil count , &gt; 1,500/mm3 ; platelet , &gt; 100,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin , 9 g/dl ; serum creatinine , &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance urine 24 hour &gt; 75 cc/min ; total serum bilirubin , &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) , &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; serium alkaline phosphatase , &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; prothrombin time ( PTINR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) , &lt; 1.5 time ULN . The patient must physically , intellectually , emotionally able take oral medicine . Patient must candidate surgery radiotherapy curative intent Women childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Postmenopausal woman ( least one year menstruation ) surgically sterilize woman require pregnancy test . Women also men childbearing potential agree use adequate contraceptive method Significant medical condition include uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg ) Significant Hemorrhage bleed event , CTCAE grade 3 high , within 12 week randomization . arterial venous thrombotic embolic event within past 6 month ( include cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism arterial thrombosis ) . Recent major surgery open biopsy procedure ( within 4 week study entry ) Bone lesion exclude , susceptibility radiotherapy bisphosphonates management . Wounds , ulcer bone fracture non heal Pregnancy lactation . A personal history second neoplasm exception squamouscell basalcell skin cancer suitably treat , situ cervical cancer , previously treat cancer one stay free disease 5 year . Prior use ( 4 week admittance study ) chemotherapy cancer immunotherapy . Prior use tyrosine kinase inhibitor target agent , monoclonal antibody target VEGF VEGF receptor . Known suspect allergy hypersensitivity sorafenib Having receive radiotherapy 4 week precede admittance study . Any condition accord judgment treating physician could jeopardize patient 's safety compliance study . All patient admit study must voluntarily consent participation must record write informed consent form .</criteria>
