	<brief_summary>During transsphenoidal resection pituitary tumor cyst , surgery perform neurosurgeon ear nose throat surgeon . The pituitary tumor cyst reach make small hole back nose bottom skull . The surgeon able see pituitary tumor endoscope remove tumor hole . Surgery pituitary cause disruption secretion ACTH cause adrenal failure ( lack cortisol secretion ) cause nausea , vomit , low blood pressure , rarely fatal . There consensus among endocrinologist neurosurgeon use perioperative steroid pituitary patient . Traditionally , patient undergo pituitary surgery give steroid , , surgery assumption would compromise amount ACTH release pituitary result surgical trauma . Studies fail show , however , ACTH secretion fact compromise transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery . As result , center routinely give perioperative steroid patient undergo pituitary surgery center routinely give perioperative steroid . There several retrospective prospective study address issue show withhold perioperative steroid safe , never prospective study compare two approach . Objectives : The goal study prospectively compare two approach perioperative management patient undergo transsphenoidal resection pituitary tumor cyst . One protocol include routine use perioperative steroid . The investigator hypothesis , base previous study , patient adrenally sufficient routinely need treat perioperative steroid . The investigator also hypothesize use perioperative steroid may associate high rate adverse outcome</brief_summary>
