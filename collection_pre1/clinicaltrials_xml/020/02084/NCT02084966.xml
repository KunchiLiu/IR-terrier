	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) rapidly emerge image modality function type `` optical biopsy '' , provide non-invasive cross-sectional image tissue architectural morphology situ real-time . This proposal demonstrate OCT ability provide novel valuable histopathological information regard donor kidney use predict post-transplant renal function . These investigation result major breakthrough increase number healthy kidney available transplantation make efficient use available donor kidney , eliminate possible use bad donor kidney , provide accurate measure expect post-transplant renal function , allow good distinction post-transplant immunological rejection ischemic-induced acute renal failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>What assess : Kidney pathology assess . Specifically , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) use observe pathology kidney uriniferous tubule . The proximal convoluted tubule make kidney uriniferous tubule parenchyma outer cortex kidney ( i.e. , portion kidney subjacent outer kidney capsule ) sensitive indicator damage kidney . When damage due ischemia ( i.e. , lack blood flow ) , tubules swell cellular debris release lumens tubule . Why data important : Damage kidney proximal tubule , know acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) , common cause poor post-transplant kidney function follow transplant . It show determine extent ATN good indicator post-transplant renal function . How data collect : The histopathology describe ( i.e. , pathology kidney tubule ) collect use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . OCT rapidly emerge image modality function type `` optical biopsy '' , provide non-invasive cross-sectional image tissue architectural pathology situ real-time . OCT similar ultrasound , use light wave instead sound wave obtain high-resolution imaging . The ability OCT obtain high-resolution image necessary order observe pathological change describe ( i.e. , damage kidney tubule ) . Algorithms develop result investigation order assist prediction ATN post-transplant kidney function . What factor measure determine post-transplant kidney function : The factor use measure post-transplant renal function include serum creatinine , BUN glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . This data collect examine surgical laboratory report patient . The data collect daily first two week follow transplant biweekly next six month follow transplant . Six month follow transplant , data collect every 3 month conclusion study ( i.e. , 4 year ) . The patient data store password-protected file password-protected computer . The data available principal investigator co-investigators study . A nephrologist fellow report directly principal investigator collect data . The principal investigator verify data accuracy protocol compliance . A biostatistician blind patient identity independently analyze data . If data publish , parameter list related post-transplant renal function report . No names associate publication collect kidney transplant data . The principal investigator biostatistician monitor data indication potential harm patient report immediately Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) .</detailed_description>
