	<brief_title>Oral Salt Water Prevent Contrast Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Intravenous saline accept prophylactic measure prevention contrast-induced acute kidney injury . However , trial contrast nephropathy prevention set arterial contrast , cardiac catheterization , venous contrast , compute tomography ( CT ) . There insufficient data effective prophylactic strategy prevent acute kidney injury ( AKI ) follow contrast-enhanced CT scan . Objective : The primary aim pilot trial determine safety feasibility use oral salt water load compare intravenous saline prevention contrast-induced acute kidney injury patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) receive contrast-enhanced CT scan chest abdomen . The result pilot trial help u plan carry definitive efficacy trial compare two intervention . Design : A randomized control trial two parallel arm . Study Population : 50 patient chronic kidney disease ( eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2 ) undergo contrast-enhanced CT scan . Intervention : Participants randomly allocate receive either intravenous saline oral salt water load . All participant administer intravenous low-osmolar contrast medium per recommend guideline . Relevance : The result pilot trial provide critical information plan definitive trial test efficacy volume load regimen prevent acute kidney injury contrast-enhanced CT scan . The current standard care chronic kidney disease patient contrast-enhanced CT scan intravenous saline . This regimen require significant health care resource require same-day hospital stay , nursing time well patient inconvenience . If result study show oral salt load effective standard intravenous saline , would result significant reduction use resource . Given large volume CT scan perform Canada worldwide , result substantial cost saving healthcare system . We establish network acute kidney injury researcher four large academic health organization across Canada preparation definitive trial .</detailed_description>
