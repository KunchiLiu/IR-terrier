	<brief_summary>The purpose compare efficacy intraosseous anaesthesia use computerized system ( QuickSleeper ) conventional infiltration anesthesia . Our hypothesis anesthesia via QuickSleeper system reduce pain anesthesia obtain rapid local anesthesia compare anesthesia via conventional technique infiltration . Design : split-mouth design AND parallel-arm design</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Intraosseous Anaesthesia Using Computerized System ( QuickSleeper ) Conventional Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local anesthesia commonly use oral health care intra-mucosal infiltration anesthesia commonly use practitioner . Anesthesia may cause child great deal anxiety fear injection . The latter painful product deliver quickly mucosa . Recent development techniques anesthesia system allow reduce pain injection . In particular , computerized system ( electronically assist local anesthesia ) allow slow injection limit pressure . Moreover , system look like pen prevents negative impression image related syringe metal . The intraosseous electronically-assisted anesthesia could interest alternative conventional infiltration anesthesia make act less stressful also less painful child .</detailed_description>
