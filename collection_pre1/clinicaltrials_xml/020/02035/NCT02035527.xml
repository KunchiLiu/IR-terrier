	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sorafenib tosylate docetaxel give together cisplatin see well work treat patient recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sorafenib tosylate may also help cisplatin docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving sorafenib tosylate , cisplatin , docetaxel may effective treatment squamous cell carcinoma head neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate , Cisplatin , Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define progression-free survival patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma treat cisplatin/docetaxel/sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) ( CDS ) combination chemotherapy . ( Phase II ) II . To determine optimal dos cisplatin/docetaxel/sorafenib use phase II portion trial . ( Phase I ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival , response rate , conduct biomarker study , toxicity . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate docetaxel follow phase II study . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 course 0 . Beginning course 1 , patient receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID day 1-21 , docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
