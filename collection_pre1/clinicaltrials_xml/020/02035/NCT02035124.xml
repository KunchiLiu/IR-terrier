	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel BKM120 Patients With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) Previously Treated With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct two part . In lead-in cohort , feasibility safety administer BKM120 standard dose cabazitaxel assess . If safety confirm , subsequent Phase II portion ass activity combination patient mCRPC previously treat docetaxel . The treatment consist 3-week ( 21-day ) cycle . The ultimate purpose study determine progression-free survival , response rate , disease control rate overall survival patient treat combination regimen compare outcomes historical result single-agent cabazitaxel .</detailed_description>
