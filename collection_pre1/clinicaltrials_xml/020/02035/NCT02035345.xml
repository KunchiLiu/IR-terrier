	<brief_title>Slowed Carboplatin Infusion Ovarian Cancer Patients Receiving Carboplatin Re-Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For woman recurrent ovarian cancer , re-treatment carboplatin frequently recommend . However , carboplatin re-treatment result allergic allergic-like reaction call hypersensitivity reaction . Symptoms hypersensitivity reaction include , limited itching , rash , swell lip , tongue , throat , chest pain , chest tightness , shortness breath , wheeze , abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , palpitation , dizziness , confusion , low pressure . Hypersensitivity reaction occur 20-40 % woman recurrent ovarian cancer re-treated carboplatin . At least half hypersensitivity reaction describe moderately severe symptom generalize rash , wheezing , facial swelling , difficulty breathing/shortness breath , hypotension ( low blood pressure ) . Patients suffer hypersensitivity reaction receive carboplatin require additional therapy may receive future carboplatin infusion utilize `` desensitization '' technique . A desensitization carboplatin administer slowly increase amount inpatient direction department Allergy Immunology Massachusetts General Hospital . A desensitization allow patient safely receive carboplatin , require inpatient hospitalization , may significant inconvenience patient . As part study , participant continue receive carboplatin part standard therapy . The change would instead carboplatin administered 30 minute period , carboplatin administer intravenously accord follow schedule : - First hour - Administer 1 percent total dose - Second hour - Administer 9 percent - Third hour - Administer 90 percent Standard pre-medications administer immediately prior carboplatin infusion include 20 mg dexamethasone , 50mg diphenhydramine , famotidine 20 mg . The participant 's medical record also review evaluate whether age , cancer stage/grade , number previous carboplatin cycle , accompany agent , and/or medical condition effect hypersensitivity reaction . The participant also ask fill short optional form regard race ethnicity evaluate whether factor contribute hypersensitivity reaction . If participant experience hypersensitivity reaction , study protocol discontinue . A standard blood draw tryptase ( blood test allergic reaction ) obtain time reaction along discretionary laboratory recommend oncologist . The participant refer Allergy Immunology Department carboplatin determine necessary future treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm ovarian cancer carboplatin acceptable treatment option . In addition , participant must candidate systemic chemotherapy determine treat physician . Participants must receive carboplatincontaining regimen initial diagnosis . Retreatment permit second great line carboplatinbased chemotherapy . Age â‰¥ 18 year age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &lt; 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior initiate chemotherapy trial must agree practice effective method birth control , intrauterine device , tubal ligation , oral contraceptive , study six month last treatment . Women breastfeed study Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients must willing comply study design requirement participate study . Laboratory Criteria eligibility The following laboratory criterion baseline absolute neutrophil count , platelet count , creatinine inclusion study . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition carboplatin . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
