	<detailed_description>Purpose The human microbiome , also know microflora , comprise bacterial colony body . Although bacteria commonly associate illness , good bacteria know probiotic bacteria grow naturally microbiome human gut . Probiotic bacteria live microorganism consist approximately 400 different bacterial strain support life host organism . The gut microbiome , also know intestinal flora , play role normal human development , digestion , body weight , nutrition , immune system regulation , addition influence various neurological function . It find environmental factor include antibiotic , illness , stress , diet alter individual 's microbiome effect probiotic bacteria situate gut microflora . Although probiotic bacteria grow naturally human gut , acquisition gut microbiome varies individual depend various factor , include birth method early diet . Research suggest newborn ' first exposure bacteria acquisition first component microbiome take place birth . Infants acquire mother ' bacteria pass vaginal canal childbirth . Research indicate , reason , child bear cesarean section less diverse microbiome ( Dominguez-Bello , Costello , Contreras , Magris , Hidalgo , Fierer , &amp; Knight , 2010 ) . Research also suggest follow birth , infant continue acquire gut microbiome first two year life influence dietary nutrition . For example , study six breast-fed six formula feed infant , consume specially enriched formula contain prebiotics ( substance fee probiotic ) variety probiotic bacteria much diverse intestinal flora receive breast milk ( Harmsen , Wildeboer-Veloo , Raangs , Wagendorp , Klijn , Bindels , &amp; Welling , 2000 ) . Please note study negate benefit breast milk intend assess effect heighten prebiotic probiotic concentration baby formula chemically similar breast milk . Because probiotic bacteria acquire naturally environmental source addition grow normally human body , safe human consume probiotic . Furthermore , Health Canada label probiotic natural health product ( NHP ) safe human consumption . Common food eat day contain probiotic bacteria enrich intestinal flora . For example , yogurt cheese contain probiotic bacteria . There recent upsurge interest probiotic amongst researcher positive effect probiotic gut microbiome recognition great therapeutic potential wide variety condition increase . The Microbiome Physical Health Research show probiotic bacterial strain , Bifidobacteria Lactobacilli , aid treatment Irritable Bowel Syndrome gastrointestinal bowel disease inhibit colonization growth bacteria cause disease . In addition , gut microbiome believe play integral role regulate healthy immune system function . Immune system function maintain homeostatic relationship microbiome , turn plays role development lymphoid tissue immune system ( Hooper , Littman , &amp; Macpherson , 2012 ) . Imbalances gut microflora associate impaired immune response . The Microbiome Mental Health The microbiome associate variety mental health condition . Researchers dub connection `` gut-brain axis '' ( Forsythe , Sudo , Dinan , Taylor , &amp; Bienenstock , 2010 ) . Bacteria gut find produce GABA serotonin , although exact mechanism gastrointestinally produce neurotransmitter influence brain function unknown time . However , disruption microbiome associate autism , well anxiety depressive disorder . Imbalances intestinal flora result early antibiotic use , example , also implicate development autism . Probiotics show aid treatment autistic symptom promote growth beneficial bacteria inhibit growth harmful bacteria . Researchers identify overgrowth certain strain Clostridia produce propionic acid gut autistic child . Propionic acid neurotoxin cross blood-brain barrier could disrupt normal brain development early childhood ( Parracho , Gibson , Knott , Bosscher , Kleerebezem , &amp; McCartney , 2010 ) . Disruptions development normal microflora also associate alteration stress reactivity continue later life . For example , various metabolic pathway , involve bile acid steroid hormone synthesizer , necessary bodily function depend healthy microbiome ( Antunes , Han , Ferreira , Lolic , Borchers , &amp; Finlay , 2011 ) . Research show antibiotic use early life lead reduction intestinal flora diversity may involve cause physiological state alert , akin trait know `` anxiety sensitivity '' . Anxiety sensitivity refers tendency individual monitor physiological state continuously misinterpret normal fluctuation homeostasis life threaten event . In animal study , consumption probiotic lead reduction anxiety-related behaviour well alteration GABA receptor mediate stress-related hormone ( Bravo , Forsythe , Chew , Escaravage , Savignac , Dinan , Bienenstock , &amp; Cryan , 2011 ) . The beneficial effect gut microbiota stress anxiety also evidence compare germ-free mouse ( i.e. , mouse microbiome ) mouse rich intestinal microflora . Mice rich intestinal microflora show less stress reactivity germ-free mouse . Current Proposal The propose project investigate effect probiotic anxiety associate psychological physiological factor human . The therapeutic potential probiotic reduce anxiety factor associate disrupted microbiome assess double-blind placebo-crossover design . Based research finding date , hypothesize probiotic reduce anxiety depressive symptom . Methodology Seventy-five male female participant age 18 year recruit advertisement post various location around Wolfville area , well local newspaper social medium site Facebook . Online advertisement include link website contain information study eligibility requirement ( http : //www.probioticstudy.com ) post Facebook group various organization Wolfville , include Inner Sun Yoga Center , Wolfville Farmer 's Market , EOS Fine Foods community board , well local newspaper Grapevine Advertiser ( see Appendix A ) . Information brochure distribute Valley Regional Hospital , Eastern Kings Memorial Health Centre , Mud Creek Medical Co-op Ltd. display wait room ( see Appendix B ) . Advertisement poster also post Wolfville area ( include Acadia Athletic Complex community board , Wolfville Shopper 's Drug Mart , Wolfville Post Office community board ) pull-tabs contain website URL study information page ( see Appendix C ) . An all-staff email also send Acadia University staff target non-academic occupation recruitment ( see Appendix D ) . Because limited research participant age 18 , participant must least 18 year age . Participants must also live within drive distance Wolfville , Nova Scotia , able come Wolfville appointment researcher , valid email address . Exclusionary criterion participation include academic-related occupation , include University/College professor student ( avoid cohort effect relate specific fluctuation condition associate high stress academic term ) ; HIV/AIDS ; currently undergo chemotherapy ; diagnose serious metabolic , immune , digestive problem , include cancer , Crone 's disease ulcerative colitis , multiple sclerosis , lupus , Addison 's disease form adrenal insufficiency ; currently use medication anxiety ; take probiotic capsule ; take antibiotic ; serious medical illness . Once potential participant review information study website indicate wish participate , direct informed consent page . By check box click `` Submit '' online inform consent page , indicate consent participate direct demographic questionnaire ( see Appendix E ) . The questionnaire contain question participant ' health , medical history , food consume . All data collect online study house Canadian server avoid Patriot Act issue associate data house U.S. server . The researcher schedule appointment participant give online consent participate . The study carry 22-week period , participant consume oral probiotic 10 week placebo ( inert substance therapeutic effect ) 10 week , two-week washout period . Participants receive either probiotic placebo first ten week second 10 week . Neither participant researcher administer probiotic placebo aware one participant taking . Because double-blind design , supervisor , Dr. Susan Potter , privy experimental condition participant . The supervisor randomly assign participant either placebo probiotic condition . The probiotic use study Organic Probiotics 7 Strains 20 Billion per gram purchase Prescribed For Life . This natural organic probiotic powder include Acidophilus , Bifidum , Casei , Rhamnosus strain probiotic bacteria , 400mg per capsule . Placebo capsule contain 400mg rice flour . Each participant receive two pill bottle - one 70 probiotic capsule ten week another 70 placebo capsule ten week . These capsule consume orally , one capsule per day . The researcher supervisor schedule meeting participant provide detail instruction study obtain informed consent participant 's continuation study ( see Appendix F Appendix G ) . At initial appointment , ten-week appointment , final twenty-week appointment , participant complete Depression Anxiety Stress scale ( DASS ) Anxiety Sensitivity Index ( ASI ) . Participants complete measure three time study period order researcher measure change anxiety depression symptom across three time point . At meeting participant also give bottle either probiotic capsule placebo capsule take 10-week period . At ten-week appointment , participant also give copy DASS ASI complete end study ( see Appendix H ) . At third final appointment , participant bring complete questionnaire give opportunity ask question may study , well complete ballot prize draw . If wish know phase receive probiotic placebo capsule , tell information email study complete . Participants contact researcher third sixth day phase ( probiotic placebo ) via email check answer question may ( see Appendix I ) . Participants ask complete brief questionnaire every two week study period , take long 5 minute complete ( see Appendix J Appendix K ) , chart change anxiety and/or physical health , well keep line communication open question arise . Consent Participants complete two consent form , one online prior collection demographic identify information one prior commence probiotic phase study ( see Appendix E , Appendix G , respectively ) . Deception Debriefing Although technically deception , participant receive either placebo probiotic ten-week interval study period tell two receiving , although inform told . Upon completion study , participant wish know tell two ( probiotic placebo ) receive ten-week period . Participants also give opportunity question answer researcher wish receive copy result send via email study complete . Risks Benefits Probiotics good bacteria grow naturally human gut . To date , publish risk associate probiotic consumption . Nevertheless , participant contact twice first week phase ( probiotic placebo ) ensure experience adverse side effect . In addition , participant submit updates physical mental health every two week throughout study addition encourage contact researcher concern study period . It possible participant may make aware anxious depressive symptom experience participation research project , result increase attending , may experience increase emotional distress . To address concern , participant provide specific contact information mental health service provider Wolfville area . Although direct benefit participant uncertain point , possible may experience reduction anxiety and/or depressive symptom , quite likely experience reduction physiological bowel-related symptom , result take probiotic . However , impossible determine improvement symptoms attributable probiotic intervention study complete . Confidentiality Confidentiality maintain time . Once enrolled study , participant assign unique code number use questionnaire data . Participants ' name appear conjunction data except initial online questionnaire . Once potential participant contact participation intervention phase study , online questionnaire data remove server names replaced code number . A master list code number names keep password-protected file separate folder researcher 's password-protected computer . Data Security : All paper questionnaire store locked filing cabinet lock office . All electronic data file store password-protected computer . Because area research relatively new , data keep indefinitely may help guide future study .</detailed_description>
