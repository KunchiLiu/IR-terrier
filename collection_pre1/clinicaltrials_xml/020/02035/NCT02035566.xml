	<brief_summary>People live rural area increase risk poor health outcome due : long distance health care facility , less available health care resource primary care specialty service , transportation problem , high elderly population , poverty , high uninsured rate lack timely access new technology . Called Telehome Care ( THC ) , form equipment home , may provide innovative potentially cost-effective solution enhance chronic disease management service use technology may influence reduction emergency department ( ED ) visit hospitalization rural area . However , telehealth research still infancy , well understood , often do without overarch scientific framework . The provision home health monitoring health education also may potential population base health research tool chronically ill patient . Demonstration possible benefit , patient acceptance satisfaction THC require scientific approach use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telehome Monitoring Chronic Disease Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While nation 's overall health status improve past decade , disparity persist among racial/ethnic minority , low-income white , medically under-served , rural resident . The disparity disease morbidity mortality compel crisis elimination disparities national priority . With age population , change demographic increase disease burden attributable chronic disease . The broad goal project evaluate potential value use THC technology chronically ill patient rural Maryland , within broad context social determinant health . This build upon complete pilot research study Garrett County small scale THC program rural Garrett County Maryland fund Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund ( CRF ) support Other Tobacco Related Diseases ( OTRD grant ) ( CBaquet PI ) collaboration division cardiology department family medicine . This research study look whether THC equipment home 60 day make difference health patient get unit home compare patient receive unit 60 day . And look whether technology support patient monitoring home . The use technology evaluate determine whether patient monitoring use THC equipment influence hospitalization rate emergency department visit patient . Evaluation influence THC equipment medical resource utilization rural medically underserved community study . Telehome care ( THC ) may provide augmentation current face face monitoring home visit ( usual method Center Medicaid Medicare Services ( CMS ) billable home health service ) chronically ill patient may provide innovative potentially cost-effective solution improve patient ' outcome health care resource utilization rural area . THC support coordination care assess monitoring patient home give health care provider appropriate feedback assure patient compliance discharge instruction medication , home care aspect recommend treatment regimen . Further , THC may improve service coordination discharge provide ongoing monitoring/engagement patient , consider essential prevent re-hospitalizations emergency department visit . Demonstration potential benefit care pathway , patient provider acceptance satisfaction technology require systematic large scale scientifically rigorous study . Purpose The project 's broad goal evaluate effect telehome care ( THC ) , form remote patient home monitoring , ( within broad context social determinant health ) chronic disease management among rural reside minority , low-income white , medically underserved patient : ( ) provide innovative telehome care ( THC ) capacity infrastructure two Maryland rural medically underserved community ; ( b ) use THC infrastructure generate scientifically rigorous high quality evidence whether THC technology improve patient monitoring , influence clinical outcome , impact medical resource utilization . [ NOTE : THC use telecommunication technology enable home health agency clinical staff rural home health agency monitor patient home . ] The major aim study : 1 ) To evaluate impact 60-day home THC monitoring medical resource utilization ( emergency department visit ; re-hospitalization rate ) Quality Life relate management Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) , Chronic Heart Failure ( CHF ) , Hypertension ( HTN ) , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) compare patient receive educational pamphlet . Secondary aim hop support patient education enhance acceptability , patient independence satisfaction . In study , remote in-home patient monitoring use THC system VitelNet ( telehealth equipment vendor ) provide patient monitoring remotely non billable service experimental study arm project addition routine billable home health service . This project substitute billable in-home monitoring patient prerequisite enrollment study ( conventional home health service ) provide remote monitoring study arm addition conventional/billable service deliver . Patients randomize either THC use 60 day 60 , 90 day follow `` usual care '' 60 , 90 day follow . In addition , new knowledge generate study method conduct health disparity research train non-research clinical personnel community base data collection research ethic .</detailed_description>
