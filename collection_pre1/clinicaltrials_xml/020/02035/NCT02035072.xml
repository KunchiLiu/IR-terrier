	<brief_summary>Title : Phase II study hypofractionated radio-chemotherapy gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin unresectable nonmetastatic locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Protocol code : IRST157.01 Phase : II Study Design : monocentric , prospective , open-label randomized trial . Description Study Treatment : radio-chemotherapy schedule - GEMOX : Gemcitabine ( GEM ) 1000 mg/m2 , day 1 , Oxaliplatin ( OX ) 100 mg/m2 , day 2 , every 2 week 4 cycle . - Hypofractionated radiotherapy ( 35 Gy 7 fraction 9 consecutive day , one session per day exclude Saturday Sunday ) administer 15 day 4th chemotherapy cycle . - Further 4 cycle GEMOX , start 7-15 day end radiotherapy . Objectives : Step A : primary objective = evaluate safety radiotherapy treatment . Secondary objective = control IM ( internal margin ) intra-fraction . Step B : primary objective = evaluate proportion resectable patient radio-chemotherapy . Secondary objective = overall Response Rate ( ORR ) ; safety profile combinated treatment ; overall survival ( OS ) ; local progression free survival ( LPFS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) . Statistical Considerations : Step A : Assuming probability observe toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation new treatment le 20 % , 11 patient evaluated toxicity . If toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation observe 11 patient , treatment consider safe probability &gt; 90 % . If 1 toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation observe , 7 patient needs recruit . If toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation occur , treatment could consider safe probability ≥ 90 % . If 2 toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation 11 patient 2 toxicity involve radiotherapy treatment discontinuation 18 patient observe , study stop safe another kind radiotherapy schedule must design . Step B : If radiotherapy treatment consider toxic , study continue Step B : goal phase II study increase proportion resectable patient least 15 % new radio-chemotherapeutic treatment . By use single-stage design ( Gehan EA , J Chron Dis 1961 ) total 40 patient require recruit 2 year , one-year period follow-up request . If least 7 patient 40 enrol resectable , hypothesis proportion resectable patient less equal P1 ( P1=the proportion resectable patient new radio-chemotherapeutic treatment ) refuse treatment could consider active .</brief_summary>
