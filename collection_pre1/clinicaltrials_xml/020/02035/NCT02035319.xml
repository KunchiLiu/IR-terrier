	<brief_summary>In research study investigator want learn capillary malformation also know port wine stain . Investigators ask child capillary malformation ( port wine stain ) research , investigator good idea expect current treatment malformation . These malformation treat laser clinically indicate standardized method assess improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Laser Treatment Capillary Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capillary malformation , specifically port wine stain , occur one every 12,000 live birth ( 0.3 % newborn ) 90 % face neck . Pulsed dye laser therapy target hemoglobin ( i.e. , 585 nm Â± 5 nm ) commonly use lessen visual coloration increase skin lightness . Presently , outcomes laser treatment difficult predict , part due difficulty quantify tissue change visual inspection method . Quantitative skin image method currently apply measure feature response treatment infantile hemangioma . The current study propose apply method treatment capillary malformation , e.g. , port wine stain . The purpose determine ( 1 ) effect laser treatment capillary malformation ( use quantitative skin image method standard clinical assessment ( 2 ) relationship image outcome immediately treatment heal . In within-subject design aim measure color , temperature , blood concentration tissue mechanical property capillary malformation relative un-involved site baseline ( prior treatment ) , immediately follow laser surgery time . Imaging output compare standard clinical evaluation 100 patient Hemangioma Vascular Malformation Center ( HVMC ) regular interval determine change time . Skin sit image color ( size , erythema , blue color , lightness , excess erythema , uniformity ) , thermography , blood concentration tissue mechanical property ( e.g. , elasticity ) . Skin characteristic examine baseline , prior surgery , immediately follow laser treatment , prior discharge 2 4-6 week follow treatment . For subject receive multiple laser treatment , procedure repeat surgery . Enrollment occur 2 year . Patients evaluate period 6 month follow last surgery . We expect research provide objective measure clarify effectiveness laser treatment permit effective measurement tumor response therapeutic protocol .</detailed_description>
