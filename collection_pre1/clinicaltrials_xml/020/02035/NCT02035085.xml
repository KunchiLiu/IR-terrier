	<brief_summary>Six female patient ( &gt; 18 year age , pre-menopausal ) loco-regional ( lumpectomy radiation ) therapy breast carcinoma least one-year disease free undergo liposuction , autologous SVF cell fraction isolate labeled CS-1000 operating room without enter cell culture , return patient site breast grafting . Patients receive pre-screening MRI . Patients MRI scan period 1 month Johns Hopkins . Follow-up MRIs 6,12 , 18 month also perform . Only Johns Hopkins fluorine do part investigational study . By perform fluorine MRI quantification 19F signal , hypothesize engraftment transplanted cell track way possible , use total fluorine signal surrogate marker cell persistence survival . We expect clinically successful outcome ( maintenance breast contour volume ) positively correlate cell survival . The outcome study may pave way use 19F MRI cell track new tool stem cell therapy variety clinical application .</brief_summary>
