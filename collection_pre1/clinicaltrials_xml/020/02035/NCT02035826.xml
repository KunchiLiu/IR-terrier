	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States . Despite strong evidence reduce low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) statins successfully lower CVD risk , physicians under-prescribe statin , physician fail intensify treatment indicated , 50 % patient stop take statin within one year Ô¨Årst prescription though therapy typically life-long . In study , test effectiveness different financial incentive increase statin use reduce LDL cholesterol among patient poor cholesterol control high risk CVD . The application conceptual approach behavioral economics offer considerable promise advance health health care . We test approach among patient high risk CVD Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates . Using 4-arm , cluster-randomized control trial , aim answer question : [ 1 ] How provision patient incentive compare incentive ? [ 2 ] Is success patient incentive improve increase financial amount ? [ 3 ] Are result sustained incentive intervention withdrawn ? Study Objectives Hypothesis Aim 1 : To evaluate effectiveness vary patient incentive improvement LDL cholesterol relative usual care 3-month intervention among patient high risk CVD . H1 : Each incentive effective usual care reduce LDL cholesterol . Aim 2 : To evaluate relative effectiveness intervention arm superior control reduce LDL cholesterol . H2 : Higher incentive amount patient effective low incentive amount . Aim 3 : To evaluate impact effective intervention sustain adherence reduce LDL 3-month intervention period . Aim 4 : To conduct rigorous process evaluation examine incentive effective others address factor relevant broad implementation .</brief_summary>
