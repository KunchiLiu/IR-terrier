	<detailed_description>Main Aim To study impact peer support child HIV antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) relation adherence , virological treatment failure , HIV drug resistance development well physical development use randomise control trial ( RCT ) design compare enhance treatment support ( ETS ) conventional treatment ( CT ) . Specific Aims 1 . To assess rate risk factor virological treatment failure among child ART 6 month use HIV viral load blood relation clinical socioeconomic indicator . 2 . To recruit 520 HIV+ child 0-12 year age ART randomize either enhance treatment support ( ETS ) conventional treatment ( CT ) . 3 . To monitor ART adherence , CD4+ T-cell count , HIV viral load , clinical status , physical cognitive development AIDS-associated event and/or mortality every 6 month 36 month follow period . 4 . To assess effect ETS compare CT respect primary endpoint , virological treatment failure specific ART mutation well secondary endpoint , immunological failure , ART adherence , physical cognitive development , mortality and/or AIDS event . 5 . To conduct cost effectiveness assessment compare ETS CT . This multi center study include National Pediatric Hospital Hanoi two major pediatric hospital Ho Chi Minh City . A study population 520 HIV+ child receive ARTs recruit hospital . The reason select child ART see treatment support initiate successfully initiation ART . Each HIV+ patient examine accord WHO guideline . HIV+ child receive complete physical examination include clinical staging HIV infection , opportunistic infection evidence tuberculosis . Laboratory test include full blood count , CD4+ T-cell count ( child five year age CD4 % ) , viral load use ExaVirR viral load liver enzymes . If indicate ( e.g . prolonged cough and/or fever ) chest X-ray , sputum microscopy AFB do . Opportunistic infection HIV+ patient treat accord national guideline . HIV+ child caregiver receive counsel clinical follow ups . Tuberculosis ( TB ) manage collaboration National Tuberculosis Program . Inclusion exclusion criterion 's described . The patient recruit stratified accord age , sex identify risk factor , randomise two different treatment strategy ) Enhanced treatment support ( ETS ) strategy ( describe ) Conventional treatment ( CT ) . The patient treat two strategy compare respect : ( ) virological treatment failure , ( ii ) patient 's adherence treatment strategy , ( iii ) physical development , ( iv ) mortality AIDS event . First drug regimen patient include stavudine AZT , lamivudine , nevirapine efavirens . All procedure , treatment , follow adverse effect do accord national guideline . The health care worker train regular monitoring patient implementation optimal treatment strategy . All procedure treatment follow national guideline . Follow visit include physical examination , adherence evaluation laboratory test do every 3 month . The test include full blood count liver enzymes well indicated test . Viral load CD4+ T-cell count monitor every 6 month . The number patient need arm experiment estimate assume absolute 2-year risk treatment failure 15 % control arm . Assuming proportional hazard absolute 2-year risk failure peer-support group 7 % . Requiring power 80 % significance level 5 % approximately 480 patient require . In order account loss follow-up deviation assumption , recruit total 260 patient arm . In ETC strategy caretaker child HIV ART support achieve good adherence peer support group begin treatment phone follow-up later , option home visit return support group later necessary . The activity organize peer supporter , caregiver HIV-infected child select peer , undergo series training , include medication adherence counsel skill . They ideally assign patient live community proximity patient intervention group . Peer group meeting 7-10 caretaker child organize monthly accord age group , e.g . 0-3 year , 4-6 year , 7-12 year , location . In meeting caretaker discuss problem relate adherence receive new information peer supporter . Simultaneously , child 3 year age receive age relevant information disease treatment another supporter well game play enhance group bound . The supporter also weekly telephone contact caretaker , need , assess condition child . To make particular meeting answer phone home visit ( consent give ) make . Follow phone call make case manager identifies need support . As child differ much depending age intervention adjust age group order provide best possible support accord standardized procedure replicate . For child poor adherence individual support caretaker patient arrange condition child reason poor adherence assess , case complication peer supporter provide advice need refer child medical checkup . In CT control group treatment support accord treatment guideline . Both group receive treatment counseling follow regular clinical check-up , drug provide pre-packed dosage form easy remember counting pill . The patient follow 36 month monitor six month viral load plasma use ExaVir Load® , CD4+ T-cell count , adherence , clinical examination include physical development . Viral load assess use new ELISA base technique ExaVir Load® detect HIV reverse transcriptase 1 fg/ml blood-plasma correspond 200 HIV RNA copies/ml . Adherence assess every three month use questionnaire design specifically age group . For infant young child Pediatric International Adherence Questionnaire ( PIAQ ) may use , old child Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) Adherence Instruments use . The questionnaire interview conduct health personnel Out Patient Clinics Pediatric HIV . Adherence also measure pill count , patient bring remain drug back clinic follow-up , enable calculation proportion drug remain total amount prescribe drug well pharmacy record patient collect drug accurately . Assessment side effect do accord WHO suggest monitoring management ARV drug together clinical examination three month . The primary endpoint virological treatment failure define viral load correspond 1000 copies/ml . This could also express loss virological response take death Loss Follow Up account . The secondary endpoint immunological treatment failure ( rise CD4+ T-cell count 1 year decrease 50 % compare high value CD4+ T-cell count 100 ) , clinical treatment failure define new AIDS-defining illness death due HIV/AIDS ( include TB opportunistic infection ) start treatment , physiological development . Costing two different strategy carry collect monetary data expense drug , test , allowance expense perspective HIV/AIDS treatment provider ART . The investigator follow basic principle activity-based cost identify activites necessary provide ETS CT calculate cost carry activity . Costs activity comprise recurrent capital cost , direct indirect cost . Recurrent cost routine cost resource consume within year , i.e. , non-capital item labor medical supply . Capital cost represent annual portion cost durable HIV Sida DOTARV asset . Effectiveness measure percentage patient virological treatment failure define Viral Load &gt; 400 copise/ml . The statistical analysis mainly consist comparison two group respect define primary secondary endpoint relation semi-quantitative assessment adherence . Standard statistical method use . Hazard/Survival analysis conduct include death/loss follow 'failure ' analysis . Intention treat use analysis . Regression model outcome dependent variable group indicator together patient characteristic independent variable main approach . For binary outcome , logistic regression use . Attention pay particular , often skew , distribution variable like CD4+ T-cell count viral load . Transformations use non-parametric approach likely necessary measure dichotomize use linear regression . The correlation drug resistance adherence statistically analyze order study whether basic mechanism selective drug pressure result concave bell-shaped resistance - adherence relationship , drug ETS CT low-income setting . The odds ratio baseline drug resistance mutation detect population deep ( single allele PCR ) sequence drug resistance development clinical outcome treatment independent treatment adherence evaluate . Stratified analysis conduct compare outcome among treatment group . The investigator strictly comply widely recognize international text code practice include Helsinki agreement . In project one patient cohort receive ETS CT . However group encourage proceed regularly drug treatment present difficulty may encounter . For project period , project meet cost ART cohort . Patients ' biological sample collect used write consent child 's caretaker . All specimen cod protect identity patient ensure confidentiality . Patients recruit consecutive manner without regard race exclusion consideration . Confidentiality assure use code patient identification , confidentially law strictly observe process human clinical information . No patient identify information publish available requisite clinical data collect , consent obtain use data tissue . Data accessible member coordinator tissue procurement facility research team , approve guideline .</detailed_description>
