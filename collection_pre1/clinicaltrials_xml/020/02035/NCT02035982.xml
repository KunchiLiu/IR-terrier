	<brief_summary>There pharmacological treatment available Alzheimer 's disease , include drug call cholinesterase inhibitor : donepezil , galantamine , rivastigmine . In research trial , cholinesterase inhibitor show improve memory problem behaviour people mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease . However , benefit may extend real-world take account nursing home health care cost . There less information use cholinesterase inhibitor people severe Alzheimer 's disease . In Canada , donepezil recommend treatment severe Alzheimer 's disease . However , information whether benefit donepezil provide people severe Alzheimer 's disease sustain long term . Moreover , tolerability cholinesterase inhibitor generally acceptable , use completely harmless . Common side effect include nausea , diarrhea , insomnia , vomit , muscle cramping , fatigue loss appetite . In Ontario , cholinesterase inhibitor user tend remain medication two year often death . The current cholinesterase inhibitor guideline provide detail medication use , start monitor , less clarity safe appropriate stop treatment . The cessation cholinesterase inhibitor patient longer appear display clear benefit may help low risk unpleasant side effect , low use multiple medication , reduce cost care individual Alzheimer 's disease . However , cessation cholinesterase inhibitor therapy may run risk deterioration memory , worsen development behavioural symptom placement additional demand professional unpaid caregiver . There clear need guideline stop cholinesterase inhibitor treatment , especially patient benefit medication outweigh risk . The purpose study address issue collect data may helpful predict type patient may benefit stop cholinesterase inhibitor treatment . Understanding , , appropriate stop cholinesterase inhibitor treatment influence field pharmacology treatment Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>
