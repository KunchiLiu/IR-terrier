	<brief_summary>Immunomodulatory therapy treat relapsing-remitting phase multiple sclerosis ( MS ) design ameliorate inflammatory process mediate damage central nervous system ( CNS ) delay progression disease . To date , effective mean stop progression disease induce remyelination . Adult stem cell therapy show great promise rapidly develop alternative therapeutic strategy . We propose use bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal ( BM-MSC ) Stem Cells transplantation treat patient relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) , despite immunomodulatory therapy . Taking advantage potential MSC posse strong immunomodulatory property think play role maintenance peripheral tolerance control autoimmunity may stimulate repair regeneration lesion , plan trial single injection autologous BM-MSC eight patient . First , aim ass feasibility , safety tolerability autologous MSC therapy RRMS . Second , plan evaluate effect BM-MSC transplantation MS disease activity clinical , neurophysiological , immunological imaging assessment . Autologous MSC obtain bone marrow aspirate , purified culture characterize surface antigen expression . A single dose autologous BM-MSC inject intravenously . Clinical , neurological immunological assessment schedule baseline ( BM-MSC transplantation ) 1 , 3 , 6 month transplant . The imaging perform 3 6 month transplant . Proposed trial enable u ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation feasible safe procedure , whether BM-MSC establish environment immune tolerance local production neurotrophic/growth factor , might induce neuroprotection improvement CNS function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Clinical Trial With Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , demyelinate disease CNS . Onset typically occur early adulthood . Patients present intermittent symptom partially reversible ; form term relapsing-remitting ( RRMS ) . Over time , patient develop secondary-progressive MS ( SPMS ) manifest irreversible gradual neurological impairment often progress without acute relapse . Beta-interferons glatiramer acetate represent first line therapeutic option RRMS . Clinical trial confirm show partial efficacy , though prevent onset secondary progression . SPMS , consequence axonal loss neurodegeneration current therapy effective . Stem cell therapy show great promise rapidly develop alternative therapeutic strategy . Clinical indication adult stem cell , safely harvest normally behave well without formation tumour , rapidly increase . The majority human stem cell trial focus clinical application haematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) , , easily obtain clinically sufficient number peripheral blood , bone marrow , adipose tissue , umbilical cord blood placenta . MSC readily isolate small sample bone marrow rapidly expand generate large number cell autologous therapy . When administer intravenously immune suppressive effect ameliorate animal autoimmune disease . MSC transplantation significantly improve clinical outcome experimental allergic encephalitis ( EAE ) , animal model MS . When intravenously inject , MSC may migrate inflammatory brain lesion promote survival brain-resident cell . Several disease model demonstrate axonal neuroprotection follow MSC therapy , evidence potentially mediate production neurotrophic/growth factor , and/or immunomodulatory effect MSC . For reason , MSC become focus research potential cell therapy induce neuroprotection human neurodegenerative disease MS. A grow body literature confirm therapeutic MSC biological property , provide plausible mechanism action guide clinical trial design number phase I/II trial MS patient underway . Experimental clinical trial MS consider recently initiate several research group , test therapeutic potential different source MSC . Learning previous clinical study , take advantage potential adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair remyelination , plan clinical trial patient inflammatory MS seem reasonable . We propose safety trial single intravenous injection autologous bone marrow-derived MSC 8 subject RRMS . The trial propose enable u ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation safe procedure , whether BM-MSC therapy relapsing-remitting phase MS establish immunomodulatory regenerative microenvironment reverse neurological disability RRMS patient .</detailed_description>
