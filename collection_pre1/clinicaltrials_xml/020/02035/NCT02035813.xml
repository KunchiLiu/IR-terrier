	<brief_summary>Several study indicate determine prevalence number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) various time point treatment may effective tool assess treatment efficacy metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . However , even prognostic value CTCs MBC well understood , role CTC prevalence CTC phenotype predict treatment response need investigation . DETECT IV prospective , multicenter , open-label , phase II study patient HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer persist HER2-negative circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . Additional research CTC dynamic characteristic provide good understanding prognostic predictive value CTCs one step personalize therapy MBC .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>In General study cohorts 1 . Metastatic breast cancer , cure surgery radiotherapy . The primary tumor and/or biopsy must confirm cancer histolopathology . 2 . HER2 status ( investigated primary tumor tissue and/or biopsy metastatic site loco regional recurrence ) must negative . HER2negativity define ( i.e . : immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) score 01+ 2+ fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) negative FISH negative , whichever perform ) tissue sample . 3 . Evidence CTCs . At least one CTC detect 7.5 ml patient blood mean CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit ( Veridex LLC , Raritan , USA ) . 4 . HER2 negativity detect CTCs . HER2negativity define stain &lt; HER2 3+ . 5 . Adequate organ function within 7 day date recruitment , evidence follow laboratory result : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/µL platelet count ≥ 100000/µL hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN creatinine ≤ 2.0 × ULN . 6 . Written inform consent study participation . 7 . Undergoing rebiopsy prior inclusion tissue accessible , safely biopsied , otional desirable . 8 . Tumor evaluation perform within 6 week date recruitment result available . 9 . Patients must least one previously irradiate lesion evaluate accord RECIST version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) . Patients measurable nonmeasurable disease eligible . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . 10 . Age ≥ 18 year . 11 . ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 . For Everolimus : Indication endocrine therapy ( Histological confirmation estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) and/or progesterone receptor positive ( PgR+ ) breast cancer ) . Up two line previous cytostatic treatment MBC . Any endocrine therapy history allow . Cholesterol ≤ 2.0 × ULN . Disease progression follow prior treatment endocrine therapy ( endocrine therapy last therapy inclusion trial ) . Postmenopausal woman . The investigator must confirm postmenopausal status Postmenopausal status define either Age ≥ 55 year one year amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 year one year amenorrhea postmenopausal level FSH LH Prior hysterectomy postmenopausal level FSH LH Surgical menopause bilateral oophorectomy For Eribulin : Either hormonereceptor negative MBC hormonereceptor positive MBC indication chemotherapy Up three previous chemotherapy treatment line metastatic disease In case patient child bear potential : Negative pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 7 day prior recruitment Contraception mean reliable method ( i.e . nonhormonal contraception , IUD , double barrier method , vasectomy sexual partner , complete sexual abstinence ) . Patient must consent maintain contraception 3 month completion study treatment In General study cohort : 1 . Treatment investigational agent type anticancer therapy trial , within 2 week prior start treatment . 2 . Adverse event due prior anticancer therapy &gt; Grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE ) therapeutically relevant time treatment start . 3 . Known HIV infection . 4 . Current active hepatitis B C , cliniclally relevant know liver dysfunction , e.g . accord Child Pugh Classification class B C , biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic nonviral liver disease per investigator assessment ) . 5 . Concurrent disease condition might interfere adequate assessment evaluation study data , medical disorder would make patient 's participation unreasonably hazardous . 6 . Other malignant disease within last 3 year ( apart carcinoma situ cervix nonmelanoma skin cancer ) 7 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric social condition would prohibit understanding rendering inform consent might interfere patient 's adherence protocol . 8 . Life expectancy &lt; 3 month . 9 . Male gender . For Everolimus : Known hypersensitivity everolimus mTOR inhibitor , e.g . Sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , give drug . Disease condition , might restrain ability take resorb oral medication . This include malabsorption syndrome , requirement intravenous ( IV ) alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption ( example resection small bowel stomach ) , uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) diseases significantly affect gastrointestinal function well inability swallow retain oral medication reason . For Eribulin : History hypersensitivity reaction attribute eribulin . Preexisting neuropathy grade 3 high . Severe Congenital long QT syndrome . Pregnancy nursing .</criteria>
