	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/MAIN OBJECTIVE : The main purpose study assess effect lifestyle intervention combine weight control , diet physical activity risk recurrence among breast cancer patient non-metastatic tumour . As secondary objective aim ass whether propose intervention able improve overall survival disease-free survival , well quality life breast cancer patient . METHODOLOGY : This multicentric randomized control trial aim include 2108 woman ( 1054 per arm ) , age 75 year , diagnose non-metastatic breast cancer ( stage I , II , IIIA ) participate centre , whose standard treatment complete within last 3 month . Participants assign either intervention control group , follow five year . Patients assign control arm continue usual care , include standard guideline weight control apply centre . Patients intervention group involved lifestyle program two component . The dietary part aim achieve calorie reduction maintain nutritional quality ; physical activity part include supervised session moderate intensity . Data analyze intention treat basis use time-toevent analysis . HYPOTHESES : We expect significant reduction 5-year cumulative incidence recurrence ( primary outcome ) intervention group . Furthermore , secondary outcome , expect significant increase overall survival improvement quality life patient include intervention arm .</detailed_description>
