	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Study Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , despite best clinical effort surgical intervention chemotherapy many patient high grade advance stage renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) progress die disease . In United States approximately 13,000 individual die RCC year . The primary cause failure microscopic spread tumor prior complete surgical extirpation detectable disease heterogenous nature metastatic cell . These cell resistant form therapy include chemotherapy , radiation , escape immune surveillance variety mechanism . This result low 5-year survival rate ( approximately 10 % ) patient metastasis . Novel immunotherapeutic strategy provide hope circumvent drug resistant RCC improve survival patient undergoing surgery . RCC , like melanoma one immunogenic tumor partial success achieve variety immunotherapeutic strategy show partial success . Although vaccine highlight clinical trial since mid-1970s subcutaneous autologous irradiate tumor cell study patient advanced disease . These approach result rare clinically relevant benefit patient . However , new vaccine cancer show response equivalent chemotherapy minimal toxicity [ 1 ] . The use immune adjuvant strategy increase therapeutic immune response tumor vaccine enhance proportion patient therapeutic response vaccination 10 % -15 % average . Only last decade become clear failure immune system respond tumor vaccine main obstacle limit efficacy vaccine base immunotherapy . The precise reason failure immune system cancer complex particularly relates ( 1 ) escape grow metastasize tumor immune surveillance [ 2-4 ] ( 2 ) low immunogenicity autoantigens associate malignant neoplasm . This human clinical trial investigate dose limit toxicity polyvalent immune enhance vaccine first step towards develop multipronged approach trigger immune system attack destroy micrometastatic disease . Investigators hypothesize allogeneic RCC cell genetically modify express α ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase ( enzyme responsible produce strong xenoantigen cell surface cellular immunotherapy ) augment efficacy cellular immunotherapy thereby improve patient outcome . In Phase 1 Trial investigator plan establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Hyperacute®-Renal ( HAR ) immunotherapy subject clinically metastatic renal cell carcinoma .</detailed_description>
