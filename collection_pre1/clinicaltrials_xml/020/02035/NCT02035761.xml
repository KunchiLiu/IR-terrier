	<brief_summary>Multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) disorder nervous system unclear cause . In MSA degeneration ( progressive loss ) nerve cell several brain spinal cord region . The result variety symptom , physical ( parkinsonism , ataxia , incoordination , fall , slowness ) autonomic ( fainting , bladder incontinence , sexual dysfunction ) sleep problem ( dream enactment , sleep apnea ) . This research aim help u good understand pattern time nerve degeneration relatively early disease , affect symptoms progression . For instance : 1 . Does MSA affect certain nerve stimulate heart pumping ? If , severity loss heart nerve affect disease progression survival ? 2 . It think MSA affect memory think much , unlike disease ( Parkinson 's ) . Is accurate ? Is loss nerve transmit acetylcholine ( neurochemical important mental functioning ) ? 3 . What learn mood sleep MSA , visualize serotonin system brain ? How relate symptom subject report often underappreciated area ? To answer question , investigator take image specific nerve brain heart use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan . Such image give u information obtain MRIs CT scan . We measure level several nerve cell type : serotonin , acetylcholine , norepinephrine . Subjects also many standardized assessment include quality-of-life symptom assessment , neurological examination , autonomic assessment , neuropsychological assessment , coordination test , even assessment vision sense smell . By pool result many MSA patient , compare disease ( Parkinson 's disease ) hope gain good understand happen early MSA . Such knowledge could valuable future effort develop good therapy rare disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image involve injection radioactive tracer ( small amount biologically active molecule radioactive atom attach ) scan body see tracer localize , intensely `` stick '' . The tracer use small amount affect brain body function . The amount radioactivity use also small disappears quickly . Overall radiation exposure participant low well within accept safety level human body .</detailed_description>
