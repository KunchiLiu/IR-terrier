	<brief_title>IVAC MUTANOME Phase I Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IVAC MUTANOME poly-neo-epitopic cod RNA vaccine target unique mutation signature individual patient . It engineer demand , provide two patient-specific RNA drug product administer individual treatment . RBL001/RBL002 IVAC MUTANOME naked ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) base recombinant vaccine optimize induce antigen-specific CD8+ CD4+ T cell response melanoma associate target antigen . The two antigen well characterize antigen melanoma previously utilized excellent safety proven immunogenicity vaccine target number independent clinical trial . The overall rationale study determine safety novel RNA-based vaccine strategy determine number function vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune-responses early biomarkers clinical mode action . The IVAC MUTANOME vaccine approach base target multiple immunogenic tumour mutation unique give patient 's tumour use poly-epitopic RNA-based vaccine manufacture use single patient . Parallel target discovery process demand manufacture IVAC MUTANOME vaccine patient RBL001 and/ RBL002 positive-tumours receive RBL001/RBL002 vaccine . Patients tumours RBL001 RBL002 negative also include clinical study receive RBL001/RBL002 prior IVAC MUTANOME . Applying approach RBL001/RBL002 vaccine IVAC MUTANOME vaccine administration expect lead several effect contribute immunological ( therapeutic ) effect .</detailed_description>
