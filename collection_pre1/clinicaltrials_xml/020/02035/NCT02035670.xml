	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether two-step method diagnostic strategy effective diagnosis treatment fever unknown origin ( FUO ) . ( TSMD research , pilot study ) Fever unknown origin ( FUO ) fever excess 38.3◦C continue 3 week , cause could identify test hospitalization 1 week [ 1 ] . As diagnostic technique image technology clinical test develop outpatient access diagnostic test improve , FUO define shortened period cause could reveal despite diagnostic test three visit outpatient department 3 day hospitalization [ 2 ] . FUO cause many disease , cause vary depend region time period . FUO first report medical literature 80 year ago . Since , causative disease greatly change change social environment widespread use diagnostic imaging . The cause FUO , accord traditional diagnosis treatment , could divide four principal group : infection , non-infectious inflammatory disease ( NIID , include rheumatic disease vasculitic disease ) , neoplasms , disease . Despite development various diagnostic technique , 34-51 % FUO patient remain undiagnosed [ 3,4 ] . In China , over-reliance antibiotic disease therapy infection prevention common phenomena traditional treatment FUO [ 5 ] . Two-step method diagnostic strategy method diagnose FUO disease . First step differentiate FUO accord onset disease invasive pathogen . Second step differentiate FUO accord trend disease inflammation score . The diagnosis FUO difficult patient physician . Depending experience qualification treat physician , time reach diagnosis vary . Two-step method diagnostic strategy would afford standard method physician diagnose FUO . So many report FUO also publish China , limited single-facility limited-region study ; nationwide study yet conduct . Moreover , assessment test use diagnostic evaluation FUO report . In particular , study assess clinical usefulness test serum procalcitonin positron emission tomography ( PET ) China , although test frequently use . We therefore conduct multicenter collaborative retrospective prospective （randomized control ）study patient FUO hospital affiliate China 's Ministry Health . This first nationwide study China diseases cause FUO diagnostic workup , identify disease consider evaluate FUO China . In addition , investigate rate perform various test current diagnostic workup FUO . Classical FUO diagnose base definition Durack et al [ 6 ] patient meet criteria 1-4 . 1 . Fever axillary temperature ≥38°C least twice ≥3-week period . 2 . Unknown cause three outpatient visit 3 day hospitalization . 3 . Not diagnosed immunodeficiency fever onset . 4 . No confirmed HIV infection fever onset . The data describe collect . No additional testing perform study due insufficient data . 1 . Patient characteristic : sex , age , concomitant disease , medical history medication history . 2 . Clinical finding : subjective symptom objective physical finding . 3 . Blood test : blood count , biochemical examination inflammatory marker ( C reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , procalcitonin , etc. ) . 4 . Results blood culture perform . 5 . Results image study endoscopy perform . 6 . Results cytology , histology , genetic test autopsy finding perform . 7 . Final diagnosis , day diagnosis outcome . This study safety drug involve determine effectiveness two-step method diagnostic strategy diagnosis treatment fever unknown origin .</brief_summary>
