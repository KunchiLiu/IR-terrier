	<brief_title>Imetelstat Sodium Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate , define partial response well , imetelstat ( imetelstat sodium ) child relapse refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity associate imetelstat child recurrent/refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression follow treatment imetelstat child relapse refractory solid tumor . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure tumor telomere length archival sample , correlate telomere length clinical outcome study . OUTLINE : Patients receive imetelstat sodium intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 36 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
