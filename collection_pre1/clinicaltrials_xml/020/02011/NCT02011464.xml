	<brief_summary>Pain control knee replacement require analgesia top ( anterior ) bottom ( posterior ) portion knee . Presently use nerve block anterior portion . The investigator want examine give Exparel posterior portion give good pain relief . Hypothesis : There difference , use analgesic length quality analgesia decrease time able accomplish simple complex knee movement use Exparel infiltration compare control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Exparel Delivered Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Is assess efficacy pain control Exparel vs. control inject posterior capsular space total knee arthroplasty 2 . Asses opioid use Exparel vs. control 3 . Asses time simple complex knee movement ambulation . 4 . The safety Exparel assess occurrence postsurgical adverse event serious adverse event Day 30 . Methods : After institutional review board ( IRB ) approval , 20 subject consent participate study . The study include subject undergoing total knee arthroplasty either general spinal anesthesia . This study include men woman ( 18 - 75 year ) American Society Anesthesiologist physical classification status 1 - 3 underwent total knee arthroplasty . Subjects divide two group , Group A ( control ) receive 20ml saline Group B ( study ) receive 20ml liposomal bupivacaine posterior capsular space total knee arthroplasty . Patients group receive femoral nerve block catheter placement continuous infusion local anesthetic . All subject access rescue analgesic surgery . Multimodal analgesia supplement pain per standard care anesthesia team . Tylenol Orally 1g three time daily ( exceed 4g 24hrs ) , oxycontin 10mg orally , twice/day , Celebrex 200 mg orally day Percocet 5/325 prn serve multimodal approach . The time , day number request break ( additional ) analgesia note anesthesia team primary care team . Pain score assess use 0 - 10 numeric scale . Pain assess follow interval : hospital arrival , PACU arrival , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , hour later hospital discharge 10 +/- 5 day block . Pain inquiry assess posterior anterior aspect knee . Pain rest simple leg movement ( knee extension , straight leg raise ) fully ambulatory note . These assessment make conjunction rehabilitation physical therapy specialist .</detailed_description>
