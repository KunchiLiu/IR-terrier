	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine frequency atrial fibrillation patient transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . Patients suffer TIA heart rhythm extensively monitor 72-hour Holter-monitoring implantable loop-recorder . Furthermore , patient examine echocardiography , coronary calcium-score biomarkers purpose predict subject risk develop atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection Of Atrial Fibrillation In Patients With Transient Ischemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause death survivor often leave severe disability . Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) episode neurological dysfunction , unlike stroke , neurological deficit resolve completely within 24 hour . TIA stroke share common underlying cause , patient TIA high risk develop subsequent stroke . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia recognize cause around 25 % stroke . The prevalence AF rise age , estimate , approximately 5-10 % subject age 80 year either persistent paroxysmal AF . Regardless AF subtype risk stroke , oral anticoagulation therapy recognize superior treatment AF relate stroke/TIA . The goal project extend normal workup patient TIA thorough heart monitoring program . This include 72-hours ambulatory electrocardiogram insertion implantable loop recorder ( ILR ) . The ILR small device implant subcutaneous tissue leave thoracic region . The device continuously monitor arrhythmias period 3 year . The 150 patient enrol also receive ultrasound examination heart arteries neck compute tomography scan heart . Lastly , biomarkers know suspected association stroke AF measure . The primary goal study determine , whether extend heart monitor program ILR identify patient AF underlie cause TIA . This enormous advantage patient , treatment oral anticoagulation therapy reduces risk subsequent stroke approximately 40 % compare conventional antiplatelet therapy . Secondly , study mean identify patient high risk develop AF assess ultrasound , compute tomography novel biomarkers .</detailed_description>
