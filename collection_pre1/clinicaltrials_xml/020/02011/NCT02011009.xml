	<brief_summary>Bacterial resistance antibiotic major public health problem . The epidemiology enteric bacteria include E. coli change rapidly global spread resistance mechanism type beta-lactamase extend spectrum ( ESBL ) , responsible resistance almost penicillins cephalosporin . The resistance 75 % Quinolones , 67 % Cotrimoxazole 30-50 % Aminoglycosides . The main phenomenon cause problem : - The selection pressure antibiotic , use human animal - The hand transmission via digestive reservoir ( faeces ) - Easy spread resistance mechanism Enterobacteriaceae due transferable genetic support ( plasmid ) In context , decide implement cross-border study improve accelerate management , diagnosis treatment patient ESBL close collaboration medical paramedical staff hospital , laboratory private medical office . The objective study standardize diagnostic therapeutic measure allow well rapid treatment patient thus prevent appearence ESBL bacteria PACA region Liguria provide tool : The `` Kit ESBL '' . The `` ESBL ToolKIT '' ( also translate Italian ) include : - Information epidemiological data - A checklist edit extra-hospital use ( private practitioner , health care unit hospital ) - A checklist edit hospital use - A leaflet BMR patient explain problematic well hygiene measure - Therapeutical protocol hospital use extra hospital use - An sample letter attend physician The objective prospective multicenter cohort study evaluate use kit , measure impact : - The prescription appropriate antibiotic - The measure take prevent man man transmission - The quality information provide patient In context also perform multicentre prospective interventional cohort HIV+ patient search possible sexual transmission factor ESBL ( extended-spectrum ÃŸ-lacatamase-producing bacteria ) carrier . We also try determine sexually transmitted infection associate ( syphilis , gonorrhea chlamydia ) contribute factor ESBL carriage . So far data document ESBL-carriage population HIV-positive patient .</brief_summary>
