	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics single 4 mg/kg intravenous ( IV ) dose sugammadex participant moderate severe renal insufficiency compare participant normal renal function . The study consist two part . In Part 1 , participant renal insufficiency healthy participant administer study drug IV bolus injection peripheral vein . In Part 2 , participant renal insufficiency healthy participant administer study drug IV bolus peripheral vein , IV catheter connect IV tube injection port . Subjects participate Part 1 study may enrol Part 2 , would reduce overall number participant enrol study .</brief_summary>
