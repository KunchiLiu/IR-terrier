	<brief_summary>We propose collect data vital sign anesthesia medication administer subcategory patient come anesthesia upper GI endoscopy . This data analyze see relation preoperative risk factor , procedure , type anesthesia airway intervention . The adverse event automatically record later analyze number apnea episode ( describe respiration least 30 second ) duration apnea , number duration desaturation event ( oxygen saturation measure pulse oximeter ) . A pulse oximeter saturation le 93 percent last 30 second consider desaturation event . The airway intervention record anything consider routine . This include LMA insertion , endotracheal intubation need withdraw gastroscope facilitate face mask ventilation . We also propose monitor awareness/depth sedation/depth anesthesia level . This do use monitor analysis brain wave give idea sleep ( anesthesia ) depth . We see correlation unwanted event sleep depth .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient consider high risk ( see ) undergo advanced upper GI procedure ( see ) include . This prospective analysis data collect stored monitor . We use massimo Pulse oximeter , masimo acoustic respiratory monitor Masimo SED line Brain function monitor allow electronic storage retrieval information . Postprocedure analysis data influence patient care . Any patient give valid consent exclude Children Pregnant woman Fetuses and/or Neonates Prisoners</criteria>
