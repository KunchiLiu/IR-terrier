	<brief_summary>Coronary calcium hamper accurate evaluation coronary artery coronary compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) . A novel approach potentially overcome limitation coronary calcium subtraction . The primary hypothesis study : - Coronary calcium subtraction CCTA improve diagnostic accuracy compare conventional CCTA per-patient basis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Coronary Calcium Subtraction Improve Diagnostic Accuracy Coronary CT Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CCTA important clinical method clinical evaluation patient chest pain potential cardiac ischemic origin . However Coronary calcification and/or previously implant coronary stent may limit diagnostic accuracy CCTA . A novel approach - coronary calcium subtraction - develop potentially overcome limitation . - Study Objective : To assess diagnostic accuracy use coronary calcium subtraction coronary CT angiography ( CCTA ) compare conventional CCTA . - Material Methods : A total 200 patient suspect known coronary artery disease ( CAD ) refer invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) prior ICA undergo additional research CCTA newly develop coronary calcium subtraction protocol . Based coronary calcium scan ( CS ) , coronary calcium score calculate accord Agatston score . Conventional contrast enhance CCTA study analyze image quality presence extent coronary stenosis . Using dedicated algorithm , subtraction perform datasets obtain CCTA subtraction image . Subtracted image analyze similar conventional CCTA image . ICA serve gold standard . Image quality compare conventional subtracted CCTA . In addition , diagnostic accuracy evaluation coronary stenosis determine ICA compare . Finally , factor influence performance coronary calcium subtraction evaluate .</detailed_description>
