	<brief_title>Bioelectrical Impedance Phase Angle Predicting Treatment Outcome Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association phase angle ( PA ) measurement progression-free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association PA measurement treatment-related outcome treatment response , adverse treatment event , overall survival ( OS ) . II . To determine feasibility obtain PA measurement single time point patient undergoing evaluation thoracic oncology clinic . OUTLINE : Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement day 1 treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month two year .</detailed_description>
