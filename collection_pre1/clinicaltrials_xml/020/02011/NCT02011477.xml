	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate immediate mechanical hypoalgesic effect neural mobilization asymptomatic subject . We also compare neural glide versus neural stretch see produce great hypoalgesic effect asymptomatic subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoalgesic Effects Neural Mobilization Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asymptomatic subject randomly allocate three group : neural glide group ; neural stretch group ; placebo group . Each subject receive one treatment session . Outcome measure include bilateral pressure pain threshold measure trigeminal , cervical , tibialis anterior point , assess pre-treatment immediately post-treatment blind assessor . Three-way repeat measure analysis variance use evaluate change pressure pain threshold , group ( experimental control ) between-subjects variable time ( pre- , post-treatment ) side ( dominant , nondominant ) within-subjects variable .</detailed_description>
