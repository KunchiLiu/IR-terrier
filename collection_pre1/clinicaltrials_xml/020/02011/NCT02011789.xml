	<brief_summary>Limonoids compound find citrus juice , seed peel . Some research show reduce blood cholesterol also reduce incidence several form cancer . Although compound part natural human diet , dose require provide health benefit risk associate intake high dos human study . This study examine metabolism , safety , lipid-lowering anti-inflammatory effect limonoids . The dose limonoids study equivalent find six 8 oz glass orange juice per day . The investigator hypothesize limonin glucoside supplementation reduce total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , ratio LDL HDL cholesterol , number LDL particle , serum marker inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 127-day study cross-over design , divide three metabolic period ( P1 , P2 , P3 ) . For first 14 day ( P1 ) , subject receive two placebo beverage ask consume one breakfast dinner . Then metabolic period 2 ( P2 ) , subject randomly assign one two group ( Group 1 Group 2 ) . For next 56 day , Group 1 continue consume two placebo beverage per day , Group 2 consume two beverage contain limonoids ( 250 mg/beverage ) . During final 56 day ( P3 ) , beverages provide Group 1 contain limonoids , beverage provide Group 2 placebo . Both placebo limonoid beverages 12-oz buffered , sterile , orange flavor , artificially sweeten beverage , contain 60 mg vitamin C , 11 mg riboflavin zero calorie . Subjects instruct must drink beverage provide day . Beverages contain biomarker ( riboflavin ) , biomarker assay urine sample collect every 2 week beverage pickup appointment monitor compliance . The subject inform monitor compliance . Limonin glucoside obtain citrus waste material utilize chromatographic method employ food grade approve medium solvent . The final pure limonin glucoside fractionally crystallize concentrated water solution chromatographically purify extract . The crystalline material separate mother liquor , dry subjected mass spectral nuclear magnetic resonance assessment . The spectral data compare data acquire pure limonin glucoside standard establish final purity well 95 % . Blood sample ( approximately 70 ml , less five tablespoon ) draw 12 hour overnight fast study day 1 , 15 , 71 127 venipuncture . These blood sample use determine serum limonoids , complete blood cell count ( CBC ) , comprehensive chemistry panel ( CCP ) , serum lipid , marker inflammation , lymphocyte monocyte function . In addition fast blood draw day 15 ( Group 2 ) day 71 ( Group 1 ) , repeat blood sample ( 5 ml time , approximately one teaspoon ) drawn 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 hr take two 12-oz limonoid beverage ( total limonoids 500mg ) determine absorption metabolism limonoids . The investigator note blood sample draw 24-h limonoid intake study day 16 Group 2 day 72 Group 1 . The total amount blood drawn le 500 ml ( 2 cup ) 127 day . A spot urine sample collect visit fast blood draw , every two week beverage pickup appointment . Repeated blood draw 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hr limonoid supplement accompany collection urine sample . No food allow 8 hr ; water intake monitor restrict one liter . Subjects serve two standardized meal time , represent 35 % daily caloric intake , one 0 hr blood draw 8 hr blood draw . Subjects instructed change diet , exercise lifestyle course study . They also instruct consume citrus fruit/juice ( orange , grape fruit ) throughout study . Three 24-hour dietary recall collect telephone last week metabolic period ( P1 , P2 , P3 ) . A standardized diet serve three meal day prior blood draw .</detailed_description>
