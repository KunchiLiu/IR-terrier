	<brief_summary>Few obesity prevention program produce weight gain prevention effect persist long-term follow-up extremely lengthy , average 52 hr duration , make implementation difficult costly . The 2010 US Preventative Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) recommendation treat child &amp; adolescent obesity state program ≥ 25 hr comprehensive treatment include dietary , physical activity behavioral counseling , program &lt; 25 hr usually produce improvement . The implication , center provide level service ( ) , worth provide kind treatment . In extreme exception , intensive 3-hr non-restrictive obesity prevention program involve participant-driven healthy lifestyle improvement plan design bring caloric intake output balance ( Healthy Weight ) find significantly reduce increase BMI obesity onset relative alternative intervention assessment-only control 3-yr follow-up . We propose test extend 6-hr version Healthy Weight intervention sample primarily low SES , minority adolescent young adult overweight report body dissatisfaction subthreshold eat disorder symptom , prevalent risk factor obesity . We test hypothesis participant assign Healthy Weight vs. control intervention significantly low BMI % body fat follow-up . Secondary outcome include body dissatisfaction , depressive symptom , eat disorder symptom . 300 adolescent young adult high risk future weight gain virtue age , BMI percentile , body dissatisfaction eat disorder symptomatology randomize Healthy Weight weight control educational video . Participants complete assessment BMI , body composition , potential mediator , outcomes pretest , posttest 6 -- mo follow-up ( yr 1 ) . Thus , refute USPSTF recommendation statement , propose show 6-hr intervention lead graduate student produce significant reduction risk obesity eat disorder , suggest inexpensive brief intervention could roll nationwide . Primary Aim : To test hypothesis Healthy Weight significantly reduce increase BMI , % body fat , risk onset obesity follow-up . Secondary Aim : To test hypothesis Healthy Weight significantly reduce body dissatisfaction , depressive symptom , eat disorder symptom .

	<detailed_description>Obesity associate increase risk mortality , atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease , coronary heart disease , colorectal cancer death cause ( Flegal et al. , 2005 ) , credit 111,000 death annually US ( Flegal et al. , 2005 ) , shorten lifespan 5-20 year ( Fontaine et al. , 2003 ) result $ 150 billion annual health-related expenditure ( Finkelstein et al. , 2009 ) . Despite alarm increase adult childhood obesity recent decade , obesity rate adolescents grown even faster rate ( Ogden et al. , 2012 ; NCHS , 2012 ) . Adolescent obesity triple past 30 year continue rise ( Ogden et al. , 2012 ; NCHS , 2012 ) . Obese adolescent likely high cholesterol high blood pressure , prediabetes , bone/joint problem , sleep apnea , social psychological problem stigmatization poor self-esteem ( DHHS , 2010 ; CDC , 2011 ) . Unfortunately , virtually obesity treatment result transient weight loss ( Turk et al. , 2009 ) . Evidence suggest nearly impossible individual maintain behavioral weight loss obese extend period time ( Ochner et al. , 2013 ) . Although bariatric surgery result persistent weight loss , invasive procedure contraindicate numerous individual , particularly child ( Martin et al. , 2010 ) . Thus , press public health priority develop simple effective obesity prevention program . In 2010 , U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) issue recommendation screen treat childhood adolescent obesity . They endorse comprehensive moderate-to high intensity program include counsel weight loss , healthy diet , physical activity well instruction support use behavioral management technique include self-monitoring , stimulus control , eat management , contingency management , cognitive behavioral therapy technique . The USPSTF define moderate- high-intensity program &gt; 25 hr contact state `` intervention would feasible implementation primary care set . '' ( USPSTF , 2010 , p. 365 ) . Further , assert less intensive ( &lt; 25 contact hour ) program produce significant improvement . `` Low-intensity intervention , define &lt; 25 contact hour 6-month period , result significant improvement weight status '' ( USPSTF , 2010 , p. 364 ) . The implication , since center provide level service , worthwhile adolescent health center provide kind obesity intervention . According USPSTF 's website , `` recommendation consider gold standard clinical preventive service . '' Such recommendation could discourage test implementation brief intervention design prevent obesity . Thus , refute USPSTF statement , propose show 6-hr intervention lead graduate student produce significant reduction risk obesity eat disorder , suggest brief inexpensive intervention could roll nationwide .</detailed_description>
