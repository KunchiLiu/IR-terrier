	<brief_summary>One five patient undergo open abdominal surgery develop abdominal wall defect ( incisional hernia ) late complication . A fraction `` giant '' hernia fascial defect beyond 10 cm . These patient physically severely impaired , surgical treatment complex . Correction giant incisional hernia include relatively new minimally invasive technique , ( endoscopic component separation ) offer promising result . This procedure allow abdominal muscle join centrally restore integrity abdominal wall . The treatment patient giant hernia centralize Bispebjerg Hospital allow joint study surgeon , pulmonologists , sport medicine researcher define functional biophysical outcome hernia repair . We hypothesize abdominal muscle function significantly optimize restoration abdominal wall use technique , muscular function crucial postoperative quality life . Moreover , want assess whether operation specifically optimize function protein synthesis abdominal wall muscle , exert beneficial effect lung function . Finally , investigate patient giant incisional hernia may identify altered composition connective tissue compare patient develop incisional hernia . This prospective study two patient group : 1 ) Patients giant incisional hernia 2 ) control undergo open surgery indication . Assessment do pre- perioperatively 1 year include muscular function , lung function , abdominal wall anatomy provide CT-scan , quality life . Specified biopsies muscle connective tissue examine muscle fiber size/type structure various method , include electron microscopy atomic force microscopy . Lung function monitor blood gas concentration , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test questionnaire , regular spirometry analysis . The study carry Ph.D. student Kristian Kiim Jensen , supervise professor surgery Lars Nannestad Jørgensen , professor sport medicine Michael Kjær professor pulmonary medicine Vibeke Backer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Giant Ventral Incisional Hernia : Abdominal Wall Function , Respiratory Performance Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall project aim The present study examines abdominal skeletal muscle connective tissue patient giant ventral incisional hernia ( VIH ) , evaluate effect new endoscopic component separation technique ( CST ) abdominal muscle replacement upon muscular function abdominal wall quality life patient . The study rely follow hypothesis : 1 . Collagen characteristic organization alter patient incisional hernia compare patient develop incisional hernia . 2 . Reconstruction linea alba endoscopic CST medialization abdominal rectus muscle patient giant VIH lead improvement daily function , respiratory performance quality life . 3 . Abdominal wall reconstruction include CST re-positioning rectus abdominis musculature increase abdominal muscle mass strength along high protein synthesis rectus muscle reduction fibrotic skeletal muscle phenotype . A total 20 patient electively admit repair giant midline VIH , 20 patient without hernia electively operate indication include . Exclusion criterion pregnancy , severe heart- lung disease , significant musculoskeletal disease , chemo- radiotherapy within three month prior examination , systemic corticosteroid medication . Oral write informed consent obtain participate patient . Strength measurement m. rectus abdominis vastus lateralis quadriceps femoris muscle do use Good Strength muscle test system , static dynamic . The measurement undertake preoperatively 1 year surgery . A CT scan abdomen thigh do 1 month 1 year surgery provide detail description hernia dimension , distance abdominal rectus muscle , determine cross sectional area rectus abdominis vastus lateralis muscle . Lung function determine arterial blood gas , venous oxygen saturation , force expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) , forced- vital capacity ( FVC , VC ) include B2-receptor agonist reversal test , maximum inspiratory- expiratory pressure ( MIP/MEP ) preoperatively 1 year postoperatively . Daily arterial blood gas measure postoperative admission . Lung function determine 1-month follow-up . Quality Life assess use questionnaire . SF 36 use obtain mental physical health score . The St. George respiratory questionnaire MRC use determine level daily lung impairment . Further , Carolina Comfort Scale assess level pain , movement limitation , mesh sensation . Protein turnover abdominal thigh skeletal muscle assess use flood-primed continuous infusion ring-13C6- phenylalanine . This infused four hour surgery , period 2-3 blood sample draw verify stabilization isotope enrichment level prior biopsy sample . Muscle biopsy material divide fraction cover myofibrillar , sarcoplasmic connective tissue protein analyze use mass spectrometry allow calculation protein synthesis contractile muscle protein muscle collagen . These procedure repeat one year post surgery . During surgery , biopsy linea alba , abdominal rectus muscle vastus lateralis muscle take use needle-biopsy equipment ( Bergstrøm needle ) . One year surgery abdominal rectus muscle vastus lateralis muscle undergo biopsy procedure use similar technique , time perform per-cutaneously ultrasonographic guidance . The biopsy examine histologically individual muscle fiber size type ( ATPase stain ) well connective tissue muscle structure ( immunohistological examination collagen I , III IV , laminin , desmin , tenascin-C ) . A section biopsy use mRNA expression RT-PCR COL1 , COL3 Tenascin-C . The content collagen enzymatic non-enzymatic cross-link ( HP , LP pentosidine ) determine HPLC . The linea alba connective tissue biopsy take perioperative investigated electron microscopy quantification collagen fibril diameter , atomic force microscopy investigate fibril mechanic 3-D structure connective tissue . The change abdominal flexor function respiratory performance secondary surgery describe paired design group patient . Quality Life SF 36 Carolina Comfort Scale compare two group patient unpaired design within patient group pair design ass change induce surgery . Differences patient group change induce surgery assessed analysis harvest biopsy material .</detailed_description>
