	<brief_summary>Previous study show contraction jaw-closing masseter muscle ( MAS ) often occur shortly respiratory event sleep obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient . Although hypothesized non-specific motor activation may contribute restoration compromise upper airway respiratory event , proper physiological understanding MAS contraction patient OSA lack . MAS contraction usually associate termination respiratory event , contraction always occur respiratory event . Therefore , above-stated hypothesis `` non-specific motor activation jaw-closing masseter muscle ( MAS ) may contribute restoration compromise upper airway respiratory event '' accept yet . Further , Kato et al . conclude recent study MAS contraction orofacial manifestation general motor reaction arousal occur sleep OSA patient . This suggest MAS contraction respiratory event dependent arousal response rather respiratory event per se .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA patient invited participation study fulfil predetermine inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . The number OSA patient include study 25 base power analysis power 80 % significance level 5 % ( two-sided ) . Informed consent obtain signing form approve ethic board Université de Montréal . The patient instruct wear mandibular advancement appliance ( MAA ) every night upon delivery . After habituation period three six month patient undergo two follow-up polysomnographic ( PSG ) recording ( see ) . The study randomize control crossover design , two experimental condition ( MAA situ versus without MAA situ ) compare random order . A washout period one week use MAA therapy.The study consist three PSG recording per patient : baseline record inclusion/exclusion patient , two follow-up recording . The first second follow-up night use establish , random order , baseline masseter muscle activity arousal , effect MAA parameter . The two follow-up recording perform within one week . The ambulatory follow-up PSG recording obtain home . The mounting perform trained sleep technician . PSG recording make use surface electrode accord standard technical protocol use previous OSA study laboratory . The PSG recording score manually 30-s epoch , standard sleep respiratory outcome variable obtain . All data analysis perform blind condition PSG recording ( without MAA situ ) one technician .</detailed_description>
