	<brief_summary>Background : Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) chronic often progress kidney failure , heart disease premature death . Unfortunately , best medical therapy available DKD today ultimately unable prevent progression , especially obese patients.Surgical rerouting food within gut gastric bypass operation ( RYGB ) , improve diabetes complication . The investigator propose investigate whether RYGB combination best medical therapy patient DKD obesity prevent deterioration kidney function 3 year follow period . Study design : This international collaboration lead centre Sweden Switzerland which100 obese type 2 diabetic patient establish DKD volunteer randomly assign receive best medical therapy RYGB best medical therapy without surgery . Participants 18-65 year type 2 diabetes impaired kidney function . Yearly measurement kidney function do period 3 year primary outcome determine whether difference DKD detectable . The study also examine compare ) safety intervention , b ) health economic impact direct healthcare cost Quality Life patient well c ) value new marker DKD determine patient likely benefit surgery . Overall study strengthen evidence base guide clinical decision usefulness RYGB add therapy best medical therapy stop progressive DKD patient obesity diabetes .</brief_summary>
