	<brief_summary>Burn injury common presentation A &amp; E UK ( 175,000 per year ) 13,000 require hospital admission . Treatment single burn cost £63,000 , ultimately dependent depth . Most burn assess experienced clinician within day injury . Accurate evaluation burn depth difficult naked eye . Inaccuracy lead long hospital stay , bad scar great financial cost NHS . Where burn depth ( degree damage underlie blood supply skin ) clear visual inspection , adjunct may use aid clinical decision-making . Currently , `` gold standard '' method assess skin blood flow order help burn specialist assessment burn depth Laser Doppler Imaging ( LDI ) . However , LDI machine large , slow collect image , single imaging unit cost roughly £50,000 . Consequently use restrict assessment small burn compliant patient treated specialist unit . Thermal imaging ( thermography ) evolve rapidly useful diagnostic tool many medical discipline . Previous study show significant change skin physiology ( temperature pigmentation ) depend depth burn . Portable , high-resolution thermal camera affordable , easy use provide numerical result second . Similarly , measurement skin pigment level achieve use portable device Spectrophotometric Intracutaneous analysis scope ( SIAscope ) . The aim study determine alternative measure thermography SIAscope useful assessment adult burn LDI currently . If study demonstrate result inform study would investigate alternative image method diagnostic prognostic tool management burn adult also child present non-specialised unit A &amp; E .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult acute burn injury currently `` read '' experienced clinician 2-3 day post injury order determine necessary treatment likely clinical outcome . Adjuncts process aim inform clinician structural damage sub dermal vasculature . The current gold standard investigation laser doppler imaging ( LDI ) dermal blood flow . However , due time resource constraint , technique often apply dermal burn indeterminate thickness . Thermography SIAscope potential offer quicker , quantitative analysis equipment currently routine medical use clinical discipline . To validate use current gold standard ( LDI ) burn variable thickness need assess compare clinical outcome . Consequently , study , patient superficial burn would usually require LDI include comparison . All patient reassure thermography , SIAscope LDI non-invasive , non-harmful , quick affect burn management way .
