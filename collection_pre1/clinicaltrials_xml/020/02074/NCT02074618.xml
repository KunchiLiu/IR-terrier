	<detailed_description>This quasi-experimental study , repeat measure design , hold ambulatory physical therapy , public hospital , serve 15 city South Southeast state Pará ( Brazil ) structure hemodialysis , outpatient , ward intensive care unit . For inclusion study , patient age 18 year , make part hospital 's hemodialysis program , receive medical prescription practice physical activity , sign inform consent . The present study carry accordance National Health Council Resolution nº 196/96 Brazilian Ministry Health , approve Research Ethics Committee Tropical Medicine Foundation Tocantins ( protocol No . 023/2011 ) . Contraindications physical activity practice consider exclusion criterion : recent myocardial infarction ; uncontrolled arrhythmia ; uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 200mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 120mmHg ) ; unstable angina ; severe decompensate diabetes ( blood glucose &gt; 300 mg/dL ) ; leave ventricle dysfunction ; presence neurological motor dysfunction impeditive implementation protocol physical activity . Other exclusion criterion : tumor ; pregnancy ; stop treatment first 6 week 3 consecutive session . At begin exercise session , patient symptom prevent exercise performance , cancel . After start session , break criterion consider : account intense physical tiredness , chest pain , dizziness , paleness , syncope , pre-syncope , dyspnea disproportionate intensity effort , arrhythmia hypotension hypertensive response . When symptom detect , patient transfer hemodialysis service medical evaluation . The data analyze program Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 20.0 Windows express mean ± standard deviation . The Wilcoxon test use comparison average value obtain begin program reevaluation six week . In analysis , statistical significance level 0.05 consider . Initially , interview conduct patient , collect data previous current history , co-morbidities , medication , postural change , vital sign . In initial contact six week , addition anthropometric data , follow evaluation carry order ass effect exercise protocol : - Six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) : measurement functional capacity , carry follow recommendation American Thoracic Society . This test already use patient chronic kidney disease different study find literature ; Reboredo et al . find strong correlation distance obtain 6MWT peak oxygen consumption , suggest test simple inexpensive alternative assess functional capacity patient chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis treatment . - Sit-to-stand test : test initially describe measure strength low extremity , currently also consider balance test already validate patient chronic kidney disease . - Quality life assessment : generic questionnaire Short-form 36 ( SF36 ) , translate Portuguese use evaluation life quality . Johansen et al . consider physical component SF36 valid assess physical performance patient chronic kidney disease hemodialysis . Other author Bohlke et al . Arenas et al . use test patient chronic kidney disease . In session follow measurement perform : body weight blood pressure , heart rate peripheral oxygen saturation pre , post session . The exercise : heating stretch 5 minute , follow aerobic physical exercise treadmill and/or bike ( 30 minute ) , muscle strengthening exercise ( 15 20 minute ) , cool stretching ( 5 minute ) . The time aerobic strengthen varied accord tolerance patient . The resistance exercise conduct major muscle group low limb . All activity perform supervision guidance physiotherapist responsible research . The session total duration 60 minute - 5 minute daily assessment patient , 55 minute remain divide among exercise . The program resistance aerobic training initiate low intensity slow progress accord patient 's tolerance . In aerobic exercise , great effectiveness training , literature recommend moderate intensity , correspond 50 70 % maximum heart rate score Borg scale around . These criterion consider study . Patients instructed keep constant possible speed exercise treadmill cycle ergometer . For muscle strengthening exercise , number repetition vary 1 4 set 10 15 repetition . The exercise hold three time week alternate day hemodialysis session . According literature , recommend least three weekly session 45 90 minute supervise exercise . The equipment carry exercise evaluation blood pressure device , stethoscope , pulse oximeter , treadmill , cycle ergometry , mat , pillow , lingbar , dumbbell , elastic band ( Theraband ® ) , shin pad , therapeutic ball , chair , two step stair . Data collection perform one physiotherapist . After end period data collection , patient remain rehabilitation service continue practice physical activity .</detailed_description>
