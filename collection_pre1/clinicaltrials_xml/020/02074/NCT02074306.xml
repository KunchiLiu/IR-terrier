	<brief_title>Does UROSHIELD® Influence Bacterial Growth On Endotracheal Tubes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilator Associated Pneumonia ( VAP ) common complication patient treat mechanical ventilation , supposedly related development bacterial colonization endotracheal tube . Therefore many device design address issue . NanovibronixTM Company develop `` UROSHIELD® '' device generates low energy ultrasound wave nanometer range , delivers wave actuator connect externally urinary catheter . It show use UROSHIELD® , reduction development bacterial colony , low rate resistance bacteria antibiotic . Aim study : To examine effect UROSHIELD® development bacterial colony endotracheal tube , patient receive mechanical ventilation , determine whether device lower rate bacterial resistance antibiotic . Methods : Consecutive patient , newly begin mechanical ventilation , connect UROSHIELD® within 48 hour . Endotracheal secretion collect culture antibiotic sensitivity every 3 day 15 consecutive day disconnection mechanical ventilation . Half device active study group ; half sham control . The device externally look identical serial number remain secret . Primary end point : The time convert sputum culture negative positive . Secondary end point : The number positive culture virulent bacteria rate development resistance antibiotic also compare . By statistical analysis investigator conclude enrollment 33 patient group allow significant result detect . Should study group show long time convert positive bacterial culture and/or lower antibiotic resistance , use UROSHIELD® , examine large study , reduction VAP primary end point .</detailed_description>
