	<brief_summary>Recent study show aerobic exercise dual-task train effective improve overall cognitive function patient cognitive impairment dementia . However , biological mechanism unknown human . It also remain unclear regard whether carry APOEε4 genotype would influence effect . Therefore , three main purpose study : ( 1 ) investigate effect 3-month aerobic exercise combine dual-task training memory executive cognitive function patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ; ( 2 ) compare difference train effect patient carry APOEε4 genotype carry genotype ; ( 3 ) investigate biological mechanism exercise train effect memory executive cognitive function patient . The biological mechanism interest include blood Aβ1-40 Aβ1-42 level , insulin , fast glucose , cytokine , integrity brain fiber tract , cerebral blood flow . We conduct randomize controlled clinical trial . A total 70 patient MCI AD recruit . The participant randomly assign experimental group control group . Both group receive three 90-minute exercise session per week 12 week . For experimental group , exercise program include moderate intensity aerobic exercise dual-task training ; whereas control group , train program include gentle stretching exercise . Both group receive examination outcome variable , include blood Aβ1-40 Aβ1-42 level , insulin , fast glucose , cytokine , integrity brain fiber tract , cerebral blood flow , cognitive function , dual task performance baseline , post-training , 3-month follow-up period . Differences aforementioned outcomes bring 12-week training program compare experimental control group . Exercise effect patient carry APOEε4 genotype also examine . Results study provide relevant clinical evidence effect aerobic exercise combine dual-task training patient MCI mild AD ; provide understand mechanism mediate effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study show moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise effective improve overall cognitive function patient cognitive impairment dementia . Dual-task training program also show positive effect enhance executive function patient cognitive impairment . However , biological mechanism train effect mediate remain largely unknown human . It also remain unclear regard whether carry APOEε4 genotype would influence effect aerobic exercise dual-task training cognitive function patient . Therefore , three main purpose study : 1. investigate effect 3-month aerobic exercise combine dual-task training memory executive cognitive function patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ; 2. compare difference train effect patient carry APOEε4 genotype carry genotype ; 3. investigate biological mechanism exercise train effect memory executive cognitive function patient . The biological mechanism interest include blood Aβ1-40 Aβ1-42 level , insulin , fast glucose , cytokine ( TNF-α , Interleukin ( IL ) -Iβ , IL-6 , CRP ) , integrity brain fiber tract , cerebral blood flow . We conduct single-blind ( assessor blind ) randomize control clinical trial . A total 70 patient MCI AD recruit . The participant randomly assign experimental group control group use stratify randomization match patient 's diagnosis . Both group receive one health education session three 90-minute exercise session per week 12 week . For experimental group , exercise program include moderate intensity aerobic exercise dual-task training ; whereas control group , train program include gentle stretching exercise activity sit mild intensity . Both group receive examination outcome variable , include blood Aβ1-40 Aβ1-42 level , insulin , fast glucose , cytokine ( TNF-α , IL-Iβ , IL-6 , CRP ) , integrity brain fiber tract , cerebral blood flow , cognitive function , dual task performance baseline , post-training , 3-month follow-up period . Differences aforementioned outcomes bring 12-week training program compare experimental control group use two-way ( group x time ) repeat measure ANOVA . Intercorrelations among change outcomes analyze explore possible biological mechanism mediate training effect . Exercise effect patient carry APOEε4 genotype also examine . Results study provide relevant clinical evidence effect aerobic exercise combine dual-task training patient MCI mild AD ; provide understand mechanism mediate effect .</detailed_description>
