	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-centre cohort study aim investigate association know genetic Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) risk variant amount leave atrial fibrosis find patient undergo clinically indicate AF catheter ablation procedure . Left atrial fibrosis increasingly recognize fundamental part pathomorphological substrate create electrophysiological environment need electrical conduction heterogeneity . Such identification treatment leave atrial fibrosis already enter routine clinical use RF catheter ablation attempt develop individualized tailor treatment strategy . Today , unclear impact development , extent localization leave atrial fibrosis different patient . A number genetic risk variant describe confer risk AF widely replicate . This indicate genetic variant contribute risk individual develop AF throughout life . However , mechanism genetic variant impact development clinical arrhythmia yet well understood . We hypothesize genetic influence lead tissue change may play role development arrhythmia substrate AF . This likely especially true relatively brief history AF modest clinical disease burden . Therefore , plan investigate association know genetic AF variant detailed disease phenotype obtain individual leave atrial voltage mapping .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient refer radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation procedure AF clinical indication . All patient undergoing procedure fulfil inclusion criterion exclusion criterion invite participate study . After write informed consent , patient subject study protocol AF ablation . Detailed clinical information obtain addition data image study . For genetic test blood sample EDTA ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic ) vacutainers collect study participant perform deCODE genetics Reykjavik , Iceland . Samples frozen -20Â°C ship deCODE ( deCODE genetics , Sturlugata 8 , IS-101 Reykjavik , Iceland ) batch ice . All sample handling , DNA isolation , genotyping deCODE perform Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) College American Pathologists ( CAP ) accredit laboratory . The blood sample collect labelled use sticker encrypt identifier provide deCODE . The key linking encrypt identifier patient names stored secure location primary investigator Dresden , Germany . The clinical data send deCODE encrypt manner . Neither participant third party ( e.g . health care insurance company ) access genetic information collect . Genotyping AF associated variant : DNA isolate deCODE 's CLIA CAP accredit diagnostics laboratory blood sample use Chemagen method ( Perkin Elmer ) . The SNPs ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) outline Table 1 genotyped use Centaurus ( Epoch Biosciences ) platform . The genotyping marker analytically validate deCODE use comprehensive validate LIMS ( Laboratory Information Management System ) system track every step process registration final test report . Genotyping result study participant store deCODE database encrypt identifier . Prior ablation procedure , transesophageal echocardiography perform exclude thrombus formation within LA ( left atrium ) . Electrophysiological study go perform post-absorptive state deep sedation use midazolam propofol . All antiarrhythmic medication discontinue least five half-lives study , except amiodarone . Conventional 12-lead surface ECG ( filter 0.05-100 Hz ) bipolar intracardiac electrogram recording ( filter 30-500 Hz ) amplify displayed Bard Laboratory System , ( Bard Electrophysiology , Billerica , MA ) . A quadripolar decapolar catheter introduce via left femoral vein right ventricular apex coronary sinus ( CS ) proximal pole CS ostium respectively . If atrial fibrillation ( AF ) present beginning , electric cardioversion ( 3 time ) perform obtain sinus rhythm ( SR ) . A single transseptal puncture fluoroscopic guidance provide access LA . Repeated dos heparin use maintain activate clotting time 250 350 second throughout whole procedure . Mapping ablation procedure guide 3D electroanatomical mapping system ( CARTO 3 , Biosense Webster , Inc. , Diamond Bar , CA , USA Ensite-Velocity , Endocardial Solutions , Inc. , St. Paul , Minnesota , USA ) patient . To quantify amount leave atrial fibrosis , bipolar voltage map carry simultaneously CT-based 3D reconstruction leave atrium . All point take sinus rhythm . Radiofrequency alternate current deliver unipolar mode irrigated-tip electrode ablation catheter ( Surround Flow , Biosense Webster IBI Therapy CoolFlex , St. Jude Medical ) external back plate electrode . The standard ablation setting include preselected power 40 W , flow rate 15 17 ml/min ( 15 ml/min Surround Flow , 17 ml/min CoolFlex ) . A temperature probe esophagus level LA use tag esophageal location provide intraesophageal temperature feedback procedure . For ablation procedure ablation protocol complete . The following procedure data record : - Procedure date - Initial rhythm : sinus rhythm , atrial fibrillation , atrial tachycardia - Procedure time - Fluoroscopy time dose - Ablation duration - Ablation energy - Isolation pulmonary vein - Adverse event / procedure-related event : tamponade , stroke , myocardial infarction , pulmonary embolism , pulmonary edema The primary end point reach detailed endocardial voltage mapping perform correlate suggested genetic AF marker .</detailed_description>
