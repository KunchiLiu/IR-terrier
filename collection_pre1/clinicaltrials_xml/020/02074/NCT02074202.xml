	<brief_summary>Liver cancer major cause death among patient east southeast asian descent , well population group , notably central west Africa . Diagnosis liver cancer require combination several image technique biopsy . Despite , diagnosis remain inconclusive difficult establish patient risk liver cancer . The purpose multi-center trial evaluate novel image method develop diagnose common form liver cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma . We propose use novel imaging probe report bind liver cancer benign liver lesion confuse liver cancer . Two image probe evaluate . 2- [ 18F ] -fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose , call [ 18F ] FDG , radioactive sugar widely use cancer image device call positron emission tomography , PET scan . We already know [ 18F ] FDG detect liver cancer slow grow . [ 18F ] Fluorocholine ( [ 18F ] FCH ) , another molecule , recently report highly effective detect liver cancer . In 2010 , French researcher report 80-90 % detection rate use [ 18F ] FCH alone combination [ 18F ] FDG . We compare [ 18F ] FCH [ 18F ] FDG evaluate 150 patient period two year . The result correlate biopsy clinical follow-up . This study provide valuable data whether image agent successfully differentiate malignant liver lesion benign one . It also provide information whether image agent successfully assess whether cancer spread outside liver . It provide data allow physician determine optimal image protocol properly diagnose liver cancer .</brief_summary>
