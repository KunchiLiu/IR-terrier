	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess status brain-derived neurotrophic factor brain ( BDNF ) brain behaves response skill acquisition . Specifically investigate relationship status BDNF cortical excitability change learn occur motor training paradigm . We aim 1 ) determine cortical excitability change use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) training ; 2 ) determine finger track accuracy training ; 3 ) determine presence BDNF polymorphism participant . We test healthy adult study , eventually would like apply person neurologic disorder stroke dystonia . By apply magnetic field outside head , electrical current produce within brain stimulate brain tissue . Using TMS , brain study gain great understanding mechanism associate cortical excitability healthy patient population . There limited knowledge influence genetic biomarkers BDNF cortical excitability change within cortex follow learning . Studies indicate people without certain gene less likely show change brain excitability TMS motor learn people gene</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects Design : A pretest/posttest design use . A convenience sample healthy college student study undergo initial screen PI Co-Investigators consist medical history neurologic disorder review ass safety qualification participate . Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria : Inclusion criterion include age 18-45 year past history psychiatric neurologic disease . Exclusion criterion include subject neuromuscular disorder impairs upper extremity motion seizure history . Subjects pregnant indwell metal medical device incompatible TMS testing . With subject seat supportive chair , subject 's skin clean surround first doral interoseus belly dorsum hand . Next small surface electromyographic ( EMG ) electrodes attached muscle belly tendon . A ground electrode place dorsum hand wrist . Next , threshold TMS activation target muscle determine . To find optimal position activate first dorsal interosseous muscle , use 70-mm figure-eight TMS coil connect Magstim rapid magnetic stimulator . The coil handheld scalp approximate area primary motor cortex ( M1 ) contralateral hemisphere record electrode , move systematically find optimal position . Single-pulse magnetic stimulus deliver manually approximately 0.1 Hz start intensity 50 % stimulator maximum . This level adjust systematically rest motor threshold find , define minimum intensity require elicit motor evoke potential ( MEP ) &gt; 50 ÂµV peak-to-peak least 5 10 trial target muscle rest . Various cortical excitability measure collect last approximately 20 minute . Finger tracking/training provide 30 minute supervision PI Co-I . Subjects wear finger electrogoniometer index finger metacarpophalangeal ( MP ) joint . Subjects use flexion/extension movement respective joint track waveform computer screen . The training would consist 30 block track trial . Each block consist 3 trial . The protocol parameter different block differ waveform , amplitude , frequency , trial duration , joint position . For example , square wave would involve different movement pattern execution oppose triangular wave . The waveform may also differ forearm position create `` stimulus-response compatible '' `` stimulus-response incompatible '' condition . For example , stimulus-response incompatible joint position would involve extend flex joint ( finger MP elbow ) horizontal plane produce cursor movement vertical plane . All factor challenge individual 's capability problem solve achieve optimum learning . Following train accuracy testing , cortical excitability measure collect last approximately 20 minute . Lastly , saliva sample collect genetic screening brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) polymorphism . We collect approximately 2 ml ( less one-half teaspoon ) saliva ask subject spit tube . It may take 30 minute provide saliva sample , however , people typically require less time ( approximately 5 minute ) .</detailed_description>
