	<brief_summary>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , characterize inattention , hyperactivity impulsivity , early onset , highly heritable , clinically heterogeneous , long-term impair disorder tremendous impact individual , family , society . It affect 5-10 % school-aged child worldwide ( 7.5 % Taiwan ) 2-4 % adult . Although efficacy medication ADHD well demonstrate clinical trial , substantial number patient fail remain therapy , tremendous variability tolerability treatment acceptance . It great interest identify biomarkers relate medication response ADHD . However , procedure obtain central marker PET scan invasive expensive . Previous study find mRNA expression neurochemical marker circulate blood reflect neurochemical level brain . Further study identify peripheral biomarkers related medication response ADHD warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1. examine relationship peripheral mRNA expression level dopamine marker ( DAT1 , DRD1 , DRD2 , DRD3 , DRD4 , DRD5 ) symptomatology ADHD ; 2. examine relationship peripheral mRNA expression level dopamine marker neurocognitive endophenotypes ADHD ; 3. identify specific dopamine marker methylphenidate effect symptomatology ADHD ; 4. identify specific dopamine marker methylphenidate effect neurocognitive endophenotypes ADHD . Subjects Methods : We recruit 120 drug-naïve ADHD patient , age 7-18 3-year project . The patient receive methylphenidate , medication response assess regularly within 12-week treatment period ( Week 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 ) . The primary efficacy measure ADHDRS CGI-ADHD-S . The secondary measure include SNAP-IV , CBCL , CGI-ADHD-I , SAICA , Family APGAR . Neuropsychological testing , include WISC-III , CPT , CANTAB , perform . The blood sample collect , mRNA expression level dopamine marker ( DAT1 , DRD1 , DRD2 , DRD3 , DRD4 , DRD5 ) hypothesize influence medication effect risk ADHD analyze . Anticipated Results : Our study identify peripheral dopamine biomarkers predict individual variability symptomatology neurocognitive function follow treatment methylphenidate . The ability peripheral biomarkers predict response methylphenidate administration important implication personalize treatment ADHD , allow clinician predict patient receive great benefit dopaminergic medication . The use mRNA screen dose provide model future drug development , outcome variability assess subgroup peripheral dopamine marker merely basis treatment assignment . In addition , finding approach identify peripheral biomarkers drug response study help u extend understanding pathophysiological mechanism ADHD .</detailed_description>
