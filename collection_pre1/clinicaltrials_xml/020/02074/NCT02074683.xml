	<brief_summary>The etiology plantar fat pad atrophy may age-related , due abnormal foot mechanic , steroid use , collagen vascular disease . Displacement atrophy fat pad lead osseous prominence forefoot may see painful skin lesion . Disease state , diabetes , may loss soft tissue integrity . Fat pad atrophy , regardless etiology , may result significant pain , epidermal lesion , metatarsalgia . In sensate patient , pain lead emotional physical pain , lead productivity financial loss . It well document plantar pressure directly correlate plantar tissue thickness , loss plantar fat fundamental mechanism pressure related foot disorders.Autologous fat graft area plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce plantar pressure , thus serve treatment metatarsalgia , corn callus prevention , possibly ulcer prevention diabetic . Plastic surgeon , significant skill fat grafting , make significant contribution . Current treatment modality fat pad atrophy include silicone injection , fat injection , temporary filler ; however , objective study use autologous fat perform . Approximately 30 adult experience pain fat pad atrophy , option participate . Through randomize , control , cross-over study , patient receive autologous fat grafting , receive standard care podiatric treatment , cross-over fat grafting treatment year . Through pedobarograph ultrasound assessment , focal pedal pressure tissue thickness follow treatment document two year . We hypothesize fat graft area increase pedal pressure well-controlled diabetic help decrease foot pressure gait increase soft tissue thickness foot pad , ultimately reduce pain . We also hope demonstrate use autologous fat evidence-based fat transfer technique , result may durable . This pilot study help build new collaborative effort Foot Ankle Surgery , Podiatry Plastic Surgery , combine expertise foot biomechanics reconstructive fat grafting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize one two group visit schema group delineate . The group determination subject receive either standard care treatment fat grafting procedure determine use GraphSoft random number generator function . Subjects randomize group assignment ( Either YEAR A PATHWAY fat graft procedure year one YEAR B PATHWAY observational visit 6 12 month fat grafting procedure year 2 ) . YEAR A PATHWAY - occur screen visit upon eligibility determination YEAR B PATHWAY - occur screen visit upon eligibility determination . Pre- Operative research visit occur month 6 12 concurrent subject 's standard care treatment . Visits month 6 12 perform podiatrist standard care .</detailed_description>
