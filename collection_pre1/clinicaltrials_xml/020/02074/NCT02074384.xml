	<detailed_description>Patient participation diabetes treatment rely upon episodic self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) . SMBG assist patient clinician adjustment insulin , identification hypoglycemia , nutritional intake activity order optimize diabetes control . SMBG however subject bias dependent upon test frequency timing . In contrast , continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) system capture continuous 24-hour glucose data uninterrupted unbiased . It provide valuable information daily/nightly alteration glucose pattern . Unfortunately SMBG , CGM insulin pump device proprietary software unique data standard , acquisition method , report , graphic display . These difference make evaluation comparison SMBG CGM data difficult clinician patient . IDC create Ambulatory Glucose Profile ( AGP ) report reduce challenge device specific report standardize report produce device streamline graphic display glucose trend . The phase 1 project ( 2012 ) , gather expert stakeholder ( clinical , research , industry , patient ) validate data standard recommend change CGM-AGP report . These change integrate secure cloud-based infrastructure AGP reporting . Phase 2 project usability preference study glucose report system . It include depth study 6 T1D Ex clinical site . The T1D Exchange Clinic Network form support development large registry adult child type 1 diabetes purpose conduct multiple study propose T1D Exchange investigator , researcher , patient , company . The 6 site select in-depth study utilize middleware data collection service ( Diasend SweetSpot ) facilitate efficient collection data diverse device . These middleware solution integrate captÅ«rAGP system automatically produce AGP report . These site test feasibility AGP cloud report collect patient clinician opinion report preference . All 6 site participate phase 2 collect patient clinician preference measure . Two study site undergo time motion ( TIM ) measurement workflow map current process . This TIM sub-study include workflow map current cloud-based process utilize Toyota Lean ( Kaizen ) methodology . Sites 3 - 6 receive enhance design adaptive trial method learning apply sit 1 2 . A key deliverable study patient clinician insight utilization CGM reporting technology . Recognizing adoption technology often stymie time constraint , report reliability ease interpretation , variable examine . The goal phase 2 analyze viability standard report evaluate preference ( patient clinician ) perceive value different type glucose pattern report ( AGP vs. device ) include clinical practice time save .</detailed_description>
