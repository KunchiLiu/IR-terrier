	<brief_summary>STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Patients hematological malignancy ( blood-related cancer ) often develop thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) , make bad cancer treatment . Preventive ( prophylactic ) platelet transfusion remain standard care thrombocytopenic patient . However , bleed remains significant problem patient , affect approximately 20 % patient acute myeloid leukemia 34-58 % hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient . Platelet transfusion refractoriness , repeat failure obtain satisfactory response platelet transfusion , common problem . Alternatives platelet transfusion desperately need patient . Epsilon aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) block process call fibrinolysis essential step bleed process . EACA approve FDA treatment severe bleeding-related disease complication . A small study show EACA well tolerate associate low risk bleeding patient hematological malignancy . This study compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion prevention bleed thrombocytopenic patient hematological malignancy . STUDY DESCRIPTION : This Phase II study compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion prevent bleed thrombocytopenic patient hematological malignancy . Patients eligible take part must give write agreement enrol . The study enroll 100 patient assign randomly take EACA twice daily undergo standard prophylactic platelet transfusion . Patients follow bleed event , need platelet transfusion , side effect experience . Patients complete questionnaire assess quality life study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Treatments : Epsilon aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) vs. standard prophylactic platelet transfusion . Study Title : Randomized Trial Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid versus Platelet Transfusions Prevention Bleeding Thrombocytopenic Patients Hematological Malignancies . ( PROBLEMA trial : PRevention Of BLeeding hEmatological Malignancies Antifibrinolytic agent ( epsilon aminocaproic acid ) . Phase : Randomized Phase 2 Eligible Population : Adult patient acute chronic thrombocytopenia set hematological malignancy . Summary Study Rationale : Compare EACA standard prophylactic platelet transfusion prevention bleed thrombocytopenic patient hematological malignancy . Study Design : prospective , randomize , control trial . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint compare proportion patient develop major ( grades 3-4 ) bleeding arm . Diagnosis Main Inclusion Criteria : Age &gt; 18 hematological malignancy . Acute chronic thrombocytopenia platelet count &lt; 20 x 10⁹/L . Number Patients : 100 patient , 50 patient arm Duration Patient Participation : 6 month Approximate Duration Study : 3 year Dosage Administration:1,000 mg twice day orally Prohibited Medications/Treatment : Procoagulant agent include DDAVP , recombinant Factor VII prothrombin complex concentrate prohibit patient receive EACA . Safety Evaluations : Clinical assessment weekly first 30 day monthly 6 month , complete blood count bleed score twice weekly first 30 day , accord standard care discretion treat physician . Statistical Analysis - Population Analysis - Intention treat ( ITT ) population : The ITT population include patient randomize study . Patients stratify analyzed accord treatment assign . - Safety Population : The safety population include patient receive least 1 dose EACA . Patients include safety population analyze accord treatment receive . - Per-protocol Population : The per-protocol population include patient randomize , receive least one dose study drug , major protocol violation could expect impact response data . - Study Endpoints - Primary Endpoint : compare end study , proportion patient major bleed study period among patient randomize receive either EACA standard care prophylactic platelet transfusion . - Secondary Endpoints include : - Proportion patient bleed study period arm - The total number unit platelet transfuse arm end study - Quality life measure arm study end study - Safety arm - Sample Size : This randomize , open-label phase II study design compare proportion patient major bleed ever note study . Patients assign receive prophylactic EACA ( experimental arm ) prophylactic platelet ( standard care ) 1:1 fashion . Previous study suggest proportion patient major bleed expect 8 % 30 % experimental arm standard care arm , respectively . With one side Fisher 's exact test , sample size 45 patient arm achieve power 80 % significance level 5 % test whether prophylactic EACA prevent major bleed well standard care . After adjust 10 % drop rate , actual require sample size 50 patient per arm . Therefore , total sample size study 100 patient . - Efficacy Analysis - Primary Endpoint Analysis perform use one-sided Fisher 's exact test compare proportion patient major bleed whole study two arm . The significance level set 0.05 . This primary analysis base ITT population . - Secondary Endpoint Analysis : one-sided t-test use compare total number bleed episode note study two arm . Two-sided t-test employ compare total number unit platelet transfuse end study two arm . Appropriate statistical test ( Chi-square test , t-test , Wilcoxon 's rank sum test , etc . ) conduct compare score quality life two arm study end study , respectively . The change score quality life study end study also compare two arm . The safety arm also compare Fisher 's exact test . The analysis secondary endpoint perform ITT population significance level keep 0.05 test . - Safety Analysis : All patient receive least 1 dose study drug consider evaluable safety . Patients analyze safety accord treatment receive . Listings laboratory test result also generate , descriptive statistic summarize change laboratory test time present . Exposure study drug time also summarize . The adverse event incidence rate , well frequency occurrence overall toxicity , categorize toxicity grade ( severity ) describe treatment arm compare two arm use two-sided Chi-square test t-test . - Quality Life Analysis : Quality life health outcome measure collect use EuroQoL instrument study end study . Means medians raw score questionnaires summarized treatment group domain compare two arm t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test . - Interim Analysis : An interim analysis plan 25 patient arm randomize result obtain . This interim analysis focus primary endpoint , proportion patient major bleed ever note study . To maintain overall Type I error rate 0.05 ( 1-sided ) , O'Brien Fleming approach use require 1-sided p-value &lt; 0.001 interim ( 50 % total sample size ) . If boundary cross interim analysis , study continue final primary analysis conduct end study 1-sided significance level 0.049 . If enrollment sufficiently fast , time result 50 % treated patient obtain last patient project randomized less 90 day , interim analysis perform final primary analysis use 0.05 one-sided significance level .</detailed_description>
