	<brief_title>Measurement Arch Motion After Bunion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Device/fluoroscopy measurement arch motion questionnaire data acquire 10 woman undergo surgery bunion , 10 control . Surgery implant hardware fuse ( stabilize ) arch . Methods evaluate patient 's problem associate bunion satisfaction surgery , ass effectiveness surgery reduce motion arch . The hypothesis patient treat surgery demonstrate improvement function , surgery reduce motion arch postoperatively ( posttest measure acquire 6 month surgery ) , comparison measure take control group . The data collect come comprehensive examination . Methods include measurement arch motion make examiner use device fluoroscopic gait examination procedure , completion two medical questionnaire . The fluoroscopic acquisition digital image analyze across specified time dimension gait cycle . Device fluoroscopy measure arch motion make 2 time point patient enrol study : presurgery ( baseline ) 6 month postsurgery . The questionnaire measurements self-reported pain function make 4 time point : presurgery ( baseline ) 3 month , 6 month , 12 month postsurgery . Outcome measurement collect control subject one time point , day enrollment study . Prospective study characterize outcomes patient receive type surgical fusion part corrective treatment bunion . Results potential improve surgical treatment outcome , improve upon current method fluoroscopic motion analysis .</detailed_description>
