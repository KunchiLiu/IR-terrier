	<brief_summary>Background : Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) early onset , highly heritable , clinically heterogeneous , long-term impair disorder tremendous impact individual , family , society . It affect 7.5 % school-aged child Taiwan . Emerging evidence suggest patient ADHD may present deficit attention , alertness sleep disturbance . Since attention , alertness , sleep disturbance may significantly increase functional impairment ADHD , gain insight pathophysiology well treatment relevance provide good clinical management patient suffer ADHD . The orexin system , locate hypothalamus , take important role homeostatic function , attention , alertness , sleep-wake cycle , feed . To best knowledge , function orexin system never investigate patient ADHD . Given involvement orexin system control alertness reward seek , present study aim examine whether plasma orexin mRNA expression level pre-pro-orexin gene associate symptom neurocognitive deficit ADHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Orexin A mRNA Expression Levels Pre-pro-orexin Gene Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To evaluate correlation plasma level orexin A symptoms ADHD . 2 . To evaluate correlation mRNA expression level pre-pro-orexin gene symptom ADHD . 3 . To evaluate correlation plasma level orexin A neurocognitive dysfunction ADHD . 4 . To evaluate correlation mRNA expression level pre-pro-orexin gene neurocognitive dysfunction ADHD . Subjects Methods : Subjects study recruit Children 's Mental Health Center , Department Psychiatry , National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) . The sample consist 50 ADHD probands ( age 6 18 year ) 50 age- sex- match healthy control . The phenotype measure include ( 1 ) interview psychopathology ( K-SADS-E ) social functioning ( SAICA ) , ( 2 ) self-administered questionnaire measure ADHD symptom ( SNAP-IV ) , comorbid condition ( YSR , CBCL ) , family support ( Family APGAR ) , ( 3 ) Neuropsychological test : CPT , WISC-III , CANTAB . Plasma orexin A mRNA expression level pre-pro-orexin gene measure participant . Anticipated Results : We anticipate identification potential relationship plasma orexin A , mRNA expression symptom ADHD . In addition , study determine association plasma orexin A mRNA expression neurocognitive deficit ADHD . We hope study elucidate pathogenesis ADHD , orexin A possible biomarker disorder . In addition , data orexin A mRNA expression pre-pro-orexin gene ADHD provide insight develop specific effective treatment ADHD .</detailed_description>
