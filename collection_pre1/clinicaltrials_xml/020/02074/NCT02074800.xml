The purpose Part 2 study access pharmacokinetics ( body study medication ) comparability 1.4 mg/kg dose CHO-derived CNTO 328 Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Pharmacokinetics Single Intravenous Administration CNTO 328 Derived From 2 Different Cell Lines Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-dose randomized ( study medication assign chance ) study . This study conduct 2 part ( Part 1 Part 2 ) . Approximately 144 participant enrol study ( 24 participant Part 1 120 participant Part 2 ) . Part 1 double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) stagger parallel ( clinical study compare response two group participant receive different treatment ) part study . Participants Part 1 receive either 1.4 2.8 mg/kg either Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328 CHO-derived CNTO 328 placebo . Part 2 open-label ( people know identity intervention ) part study . Participants Part 2 receive 1.4 mg/kg either Sp2/0-derived CHO-derived CNTO 328 . Safety evaluate assessment adverse event , vital sign , physical examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory test monitor throughout study . The total duration study participation participant approximately 199 day include screen phase ( within 30 day first study medication administration ) treatment phase ( inpatient [ hospitalization period ] 12 day outpatient [ follow-up ] visit 169 day ) .</detailed_description>
