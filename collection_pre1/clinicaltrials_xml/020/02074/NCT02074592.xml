	<brief_summary>To improve quality fetal ultrasound image , self assessment less resource consume assessment expert reviewer , may effective . To test hypothesis , randomize volunteer experienced ultrasonographers two group . One group ass image ( self assessment ) . The group image assess expert . Images audit via internet standardize procedure generate feedback recommendation change . Three 6 month later , participant audit .

	<brief_title>Self Assessment Fetal Ultrasound Images</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Audit feedback base image score expert improve ultrasound image quality , time consume . Self assessment ultrasound still image might alternative assessment expert . Objective . To compare image quality improvement follow self assessment fetal biometry image versus audit feedback expert . Methods . Study design : prospective blind randomise control trial . Inclusions Doctors midwifes experienced field fetal ultrasound , solicit email enrol . Volunteers upload first set 30 biometry image ( 10 cephalic , 10 abdominal 10 femoral ) obtain 10 consecutive screening scan perform second third trimester pregnancy . Abnormal scan exclude . Randomization : After upload first set image , ultrasonographers randomise 1:1 ratio * Arm 1 : Ultrasonographers assess image online accord standardized procedure . They receive automatically generate report detailed recommendation change . Their image also audit expert , result audit remain concealed ultrasonographer * Arm 2 : Ultrasonographers assess image . Their image assess expert accord standardized online procedure . They receive automatically generate report detailed recommendation change . Follow Three 6 month later , ultrasonographers ask upload second set 30 biometry image . Images audit expert reviewer use standardized online procedure first set . Online image score procedure : The procedure whether reviewer ultrasonographer expert . Uploaded image present reviewer automatic black contour conceal identity patient ultrasonographer . Images present left hand side screen . Buttons right hand side click accord presence absence quality criterion . Online help provide specific criterion , together typical image . Scoring criterion derive L. J. SALOMON , et al Ultrasound Obstetric Gynecology 2006 ; 27 : 34-40 ) . For set image send give ultrasonographer , image quality evaluate base : - percentage image meet criterion ( IMAC ) - mean score base attribute one point per criterion present give image . Feed back recommendation change A feedback adapt score result generate automatically . It provide ultrasonographer percentage IMAC , mean score , overall type image . Whenever criterion meet , pop window show correspond image short document display , recommendation change . Data collect : - Gestational age - Demographic characteristic professional enrol : age , gender , experience fetal ultrasound ( year ) , medical doctor vs. midwife , fetal ultrasound practice ( screen , vs. screen plus referral ultrasound ) , medical practice fetal ultrasound , continuous medical education field fetal biometry , membership French College fetal ultrasonography . - For set type image : - percentage IMAC - mean score Main outcome : Improvement mean percentage IMAC first second set image Secondary outcome : Improvement mean percentage IMAC first second series cephalic image Improvement mean percentage IMAC first second series abdomen image Improvement mean percentage IMAC first second series femur image Difference mean score , overall image type , first second set image . Subgroup analysis may perform base ultrasonographers characteristic . The agreement self assessment audit expert reviewer analyse Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis data do . An equivalence test quantitative data do study main secondary outcome . Subgroups analysis make image type . Agreement self assessment expert audit evaluate intraclass correlation coefficient method . For test , value P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Number participant include The mean increase percentage IMAC ultrasonographer ( Δ % IMAC ) main outcome . The equivalence Δ % IMAC two arm test . We choose follow equivalence margin : ± 6.67 % ( i.e . difference 2 IMAC set 30 image ) . The standard deviation Δ % IMAC observe previous study 20 . This study show Δ % IMAC 15 % audit feedback ( i.e . 4 5 image improve ) . For two side alpha 5 % power 80 % , 156 ultrasonographers need group . We thus expect enrol 320 ultrasonographers study . Expected result . Equivalence improvement image quality self assessment expert audit group . This would suggest online self assessment may effective audit expert improve ultrasound image quality .</detailed_description>
