	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Platelet Rich Plasma Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) make blood take sample venous blood , place special tube , spin blood centrifuge piece equipment use separate component blood . Blood make red blood cell , white blood cell platelet , plasma , liquid component predominantly water also contain clot factor , protein , glucose . Platelets small , disk shape clear cell fragment natural source growth factor . They circulate blood involve hemostasis process cause bleed stop , lead formation blood clot . So-called `` Platelet-rich plasma '' represent patient 's plasma mechanically centrifuge increase concentration platelet compare whole blood . The basic idea behind PRP injection deliver high concentration growth factor scalp , hope stimulate hair regrowth . PRP innovative therapy use since 1987 help promote heal orthopedic surgery , dental surgery dermatology . Recently , report support use PRP treatment hair loss . Androgenetic alopecia ( AGA ) common cause hair loss . It limit treatment modality include minoxidil , 5-alpha reductase inhibitor hair transplantation . Each option side effect range hypertrichosis excessive hair growth , possible birth defect give woman child bear age , decrease libido possibility prolong impotence . To best knowledge , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety PRP injection treat AGA . A placebo simulate otherwise medically ineffectual treatment disease medical condition intend deceive recipient . The investigator plan conduct clinical trial ass effect safety PRP AGA . The investigator also plan identify presence various growth factor PRP correlation hair regrowth .</detailed_description>
