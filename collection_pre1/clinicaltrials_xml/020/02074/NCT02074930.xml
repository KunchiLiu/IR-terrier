	<brief_summary>It open-label physiological investigation allergic skin reactivity epicutaneous allergen exposition 20 allergic patient two different skin condition . The focus study skin preparation/condition specific allergen allergy , reason homogeneity single allergic disease , birch pollen allergy choose basis test . In order evaluate effect two different skin preparation technique intraindividual comparison skin reactivity term immediate phase I reaction serial dilution birch pollen extract choose . The serial dilution approach allow dose dependent effect evaluation comparison sensitivity . The difference explain mainly two different skin preparation allow quantitative comparison technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Objective determination allergic skin reactivity epicutaneoulsy apply birch pollen allergen extract skin preparation ( microporation P.L.E.A.S.E . Professional ) standard skin prick test . By use standard prick test stratum corneum overcome single puncture ( 1 mm ) . Micropores induce P.L.E.A.S.E . Professional penetrate stratum corneum less deep high density ( five pore ) . It therefore suggest skin preparation micropores P.L.E.A.S.E . Professional previously allergen contact may lead high sensitivity . Less allergen might still elicit skin reaction ? see conventional prick skin test . Whereas skin prick test may lead true-negative ( patient show allergic reaction prick skin test allergy sufferer clinic ) , IgE-determination may lead false-positives ( patient determine allergy sufferer clinical symptom ) . So sensitivity micropores skin preparation P.L.E.A.S.E . Professional could good compromise . The preparation skin P.L.E.A.S.E . Professional lead well understanding influence different type skin injury pattern allergic skin reactivity . Namely , important role expose area , depth injury keratinocyte activation . This checked late phase reaction evaluation .</detailed_description>
