	<brief_summary>The grow evidence show OSA heritable complex genetic disease genetic basis contribute development OSA sequel . The phenotyping OSA include high level intermediate level . The former indicates AHI , later include craniofacial morphology , ventilator control , obesity , sleepiness vulnerability . Many study try determine association candidate gene OSA association study . However , result conflict . We identify 37 candidate gene involve six biologic pathway OSA report previous literature , include oxidative phosphorylation , cell signaling , apoptosis , cellular adhesion motility , cell cycle , cytokine/chemokine . To investigate association phenotype genotype OSA , conduct cross-sectional study recruit patient moderate-severe OSA ( index proband ) first second-degree family member , friend family member ( control family ) use candidate gene report literature whole genome SNP array genotype approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Phenotyping Genotyping Taiwanese Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterize recurrent collapse upper airway sleep result hypoxia sleep fragmentation . Patients OSA might symptom like snore , non-restorative sleep , witness apnea , excessive daytime sleepiness . Currently , polysomnography gold standard diagnose OSA apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) parameter indicate severity OSA . However , AHI poorly correlate clinical severity OSA , symptoms patient identical AHI could vary minimal striking . The sequels OSA include cardiovascular disease , metabolic disorder , neurocognitive dysfunction . Till , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) standard treatment OSA effectively improve daytime sleepiness , blood pressure , metabolic abnormality , quality life , especially patient daytime sleepiness . The grow evidence show OSA heritable complex genetic disease genetic basis contribute development OSA sequel . The phenotyping OSA include high level intermediate level . The former indicates AHI , later include craniofacial morphology , ventilator control , obesity , sleepiness vulnerability . Many study try determine association candidate gene OSA association study . However , result conflict . To clarify influence genotyping phenotyping , report Chinese family congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) clinical spectrum range newborn fatality adulthood . Genetic analysis use confirm presence PHOX2B expansion mutation . Moreover , clarify association ACE I/D polymorphism OSA , undertook meta-analysis study publish area . It demonstrate association ACE I/D polymorphism OSA susceptibility irrespective ethnicity , population sample presence/absence co-morbid hypertension . Nowadays , couple study try genome-wide profiled candidate gene involve biologic pathway OSA . The whole genome scan identify chromosome 2p Âèä19p chromosome 8q associate AHI Caucasian African American , respectively , independent BMI . Also , whole genome SNP array identify candidate gene associate OSA C-reactive protein ( C-RP ) glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) European Americans rs9526240 within serotonin receptor 2a ( HTR2A ) African Americans . We identify 37 candidate gene involve six biologic pathway OSA include oxidative phosphorylation , cell signaling , apoptosis , cellular adhesion motility , cell cycle , cytokine/chemokine . Furthermore , three model construct predict sequel response 4-week 12-week CPAP treatment , respectively . Since presentation OSA different among race , hence database Taiwanese patient OSA urgently need clarify molecular mechanism . Through recruit patient moderate-severe OSA ( index proband ) first second-degree family member , friend family member ( control family ) via candidate gene report literature whole genome SNP array , project aim achieves follow goal ( 1 ) Investigating phenotyping familial aggregation OSA ( 2 ) Investigating association genotyping phenotyping OSA ( 3 ) Investigating candidate gene involve biologic pathway OSA . The anticipated contribution result include ( 1 ) Highlighting promise patient-tailored management ( 2 ) Establishing invaluable database phenotyping genotyping OSA future research ( 3 ) Promoting production biotechnology patent business .</detailed_description>
