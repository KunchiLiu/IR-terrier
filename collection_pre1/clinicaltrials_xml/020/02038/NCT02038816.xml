	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome common blood disorder affect many one 1000 Canadians age 65 . They characterize low blood count require frequent blood transfusion . The development iron overload patient inevitable . The iron deposit vital organ heart liver lead organ dysfunction . Deferasirox well-studied drug help remove iron body . Most people disorder die due progression disease acute leukemia multiple mechanism . Iron overload patient myelodysplastic syndrome show associated shorter survival , potentially high chance leukemia . In certain subgroup high risk patient , drug azacitidine show decrease chance progression leukemia death . Thus , presently standard care patient . However , 50 % high risk patient still unresponsive medication , leave large group patient treatment option emergently need . Given large proportion high risk MDS patient fail respond azacitidine , evidence iron deposition may lead increased leukemic transformation , would like study whether iron removal body deferasirox potentiate azacitidine effect overall survival , well chance leukemia transformation . This question need addressed randomized control trial , first step preliminary study determine combination azacitidine deferasirox biologic effect . This study determine whether combination lead blood count improvement azacitidine alone . If drug combination ultimately prove useful azacitidine alone respect survival , potential impact care large proportion patient myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
