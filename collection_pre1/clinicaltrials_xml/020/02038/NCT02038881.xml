	<brief_summary>The main purpose clinical trial generate additional safety data highly immunocompromised population . HIV-infected person consider excellent candidate represent highly immunocompromised population enrolment trial . Additionally , immune system 's response ( protection smallpox measure amount antibody produce ) follow injection MVA-BN® smallpox vaccine evaluate . All participant trial randomly evenly assign one three group receive two , three four injection . Group 1 receive standard regime consist one dose vaccination time point , Group 2 receive two dos vaccination time point Group 3 receive booster vaccination 12 week first dose standard vaccination schedule MVA-BN® smallpox vaccine . Participation trial schedule last 48 week .</brief_summary>
