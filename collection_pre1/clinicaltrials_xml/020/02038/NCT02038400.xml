	<brief_summary>Otitis medium consequence bacterial infection . They characterize middle ear inflammation collection fluid behind eardrum . The effusion stagnate middle ear , increase acute infection induce tympanic membrane inner ear damage . Delay language learn observe affected child well hear problem e.g . constant hearing loss . The two main form chronic otitis otitis medium effusion ( OME ) atelectasis without retraction pocket . To date , insertion tympanic ventilation tube ( tympanostomy ) effective treatment otitis medium effusion fail respond conservative drug treatment ; delay progression serious atelectasis . When first tube allow complete recovery , recurrence observe insertion new tube need . The repeated tube insertion increase risk link general anesthesia increase rate sequelae/complications , tympanic membrane perforation . Kinetube® CE-marked medical device , market France Europe since April 2002 . This device improve neuronal control mechanism pharyngotympanic ( Eustachian ) tube , regulate middle ear pressure . This could alternative patient recurrence need repeat tube insertion , study show Kinetube® improve open Eustachian tube patient otitis medium effusion ( OME ) atelectasis . These previous clinical study show feasibility use Kinetube® clinical practice . A large clinical study high level evidence must perform show therapeutic efficacy Kinetube® chronic otitis compare ventilation tube insertion .</brief_summary>
