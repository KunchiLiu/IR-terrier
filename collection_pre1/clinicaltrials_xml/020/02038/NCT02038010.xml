	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether combination two different drug - trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 ( T-DM1 ) BYL719 safe , might effective treat metastatic breast cancer . T-DM1 type drug contains antibody ( trastuzumab ) link chemotherapy . The antibody T-DM1 target marker breast cancer cell call HER2 , allow drug go directly cancer cell . The use T-DM1 study consider standard treatment type cancer study . Participants study already treat trastuzumab chemotherapy past , cancer gotten bad spite treatment . BYL719 oral drug ( take mouth ) researcher think may help T-DM1 work well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BYL719 + T-DM1 HER2 ( + ) Metastatic Breast Cancer Pts Who Progress Prior Trastuzumab &amp; Taxane Tx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , tolerability , feasibility , maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-escalating BYL719 combination ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) patient HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) progression trastuzumab taxane-based therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) BYL719 administer combination T-DM1 . II . Assess preliminary evidence efficacy BYL719 T-DM1 combination patient HER2-positive MBC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore efficacy patient whose tumor alteration ( mutation amplification ) PIK3CA gene decrease phosphatase tensin homolog gene ( PTEN ) expression . ( Optional ) II . Examine v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) /mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) downstream marker immunohistochemistry . ( Optional ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BYL719 . Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BYL719 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
