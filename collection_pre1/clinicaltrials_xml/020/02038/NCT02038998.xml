	<brief_summary>Stroke one lead cause death disability worldwide . More 85 % stroke due blood vessel occlusion result partial destruction brain parenchyma . Current protocols try re-establish blood circulation soon possible chemical and/or mechanical intervention new strategy need . Periodic acceleration ( pGz ) non-invasive method consist application rock movement patient ultimately induce release beneficial chemical vascular endothelium ( cell line inside blood vessel ) . Application pGz animal model stroke result dramatic reduction associate brain damage . This trial investigate whether stroke patient expose pGz experiment significantly high recovery patient remain static treatment .</brief_summary>
