	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) characterize spectrum pathological condition range early stage inflammation fibrosis advance disease condition , hepatocellular carcinoma . The prevalence NAFLD 10 25 % population , large difference age ethnic group , well know HCV infection major cause chronic liver disease Western country . For disease progression liver damage close correlation lifestyle patient ( eg. , nutrition , physical activity , ingestion alcohol , etc. ) . In fact , show feeding imbalance may implications alter normal immune function subject , suggest metabolic immune system closely related . Although well know negative role obesity progression NAFLD HCV liver disease , pathogenic mechanism underlie alteration relate immune response yet fully understood . Insulin resistance , alter lipid metabolism , lipid peroxidation , oxidative stress mitochondrial alteration pathogenic mechanism induce liver damage progression , NAFLD HCV infection . Recent study suggest evolution viral infection chronic inflammation NAFLD deeply influence CD4+ T helper cell express IL-17 , define T helper 17 ( Th17 ) cell . Broadening knowledge role diet course NAFLD HCV infection activation Th17 cell alteration function , allow shed light pathogenic mechanism underlie progression immune-mediated disease . Moreover , investigation allow understand whether Th17 cell may role diminish response therapy patient high cholesterol level . If result confirm hypothesis , study provide useful information clinical management patient steatosis chronic HCV infection . The data obtain also use development new therapeutic strategy direct modulate antiviral immune response . All patient undergo clinical instrumental assessment depend type pathology . Patients require follow normocaloric low cholesterol diet period 30 day . The prospective clinical study present form additional risk patient conduct accordance principle establish Declaration Helsinki standard Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) . The study require additional cost .</brief_summary>
