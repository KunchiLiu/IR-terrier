	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Alisertib ( MLN8237 ) Combination With Paclitaxel Versus Placebo Combination With Paclitaxel Second Line Therapy Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call alisertib . Alisertib test treat people Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) . This study determine safety efficacy alisertib give twice day along paclitaxel . This open label study enrol 178 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one four treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Alisertib 40 mg - Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 - Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient All participant receive treatment disease progress experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity . This multi-center trial conduct world-wide . The overall time participate study approximately 22 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone every month 6 month end treatment ( EOT ) follow-up assessment progression free survival overall survival every 2 month death , study closure , 14 month randomization last participant .</detailed_description>
