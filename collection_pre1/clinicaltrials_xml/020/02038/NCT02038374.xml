Airway epithelial cell continuously expose injured environmental irritant , virus pollutant , ideally situate orchestrate airway function response stimulus . Severe difficult-to-treat asthma child complicate disorder characterize ongoing symptom persistent airway inflammation oxidant stress despite corticosteroid treatment . Although severe asthma likely heterogeneous disorder , affect child similar clinical feature , include gas trapping , bronchial hyperresponsiveness , aeroallergen sensitization . However , molecular cellular pattern inflammation child severe asthma uniform : investigator find increase eosinophil TH2 derive cytokine , others note noneosinophilic pattern neutrophil activation . Given heterogeneity inflammatory response child severe asthma , additional method distinguish severe asthma need .</brief_summary>
