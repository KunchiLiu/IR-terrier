	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate use fluorescence image + Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) dye ( `` Firefly '' ) , compare standard white light image 2D 3D , accurate visual diagnosis endometriosis da Vinci robotically guide endometriosis resection procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorescence Imaging + ICG Dye Use Visual Diagnosis Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluorescence image use visualization tissue perfusion colorectal surgery , detection pathologic primary metastatic tumor , measurement graft patency cardiovascular surgery . The da VinciÂ® Firefly Imaging System , use fluorescence imaging , allow surgeon view high-resolution near infrared image blood flow tissue perfusion real-time robotic-assisted surgical procedure , robotic-assisted endometriosis resection . Using standard white light imaging , endometriotic lesion appear red vascular , white scar , black , brown , yellow , almost color ; atypical implant clear seem like normal tissue . However , publish report demonstrate lesion endometriosis hypervascular may visualize radiographically basis pathologic feature . Because individual lesion endometriosis vary significantly appearance standard white light , use hypervascular characteristic disease along Firefly technology may provide consistency intraoperative visual diagnosis , thus may aid detection resection endometriosis . The ability accurately visualize lesion endometriosis , typical atypical appearance , thus facilitate complete resection disease , may significant impact symptomatic relief disease recurrence . The Firefly Imaging System fluorescence image + ICG dye may allow accurate visual diagnosis endometriosis robotic-assisted endometriosis resection procedure , therefore may positive impact patient disease . This prospective , comparison , single-center , observational study evaluate fluorescence image + ICG dye ( Firefly ) , compare standard white light image 2D 3D , accurate visual diagnosis endometriosis da Vinci endometriosis resection procedure .</detailed_description>
