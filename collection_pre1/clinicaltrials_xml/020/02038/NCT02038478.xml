	<brief_summary>The design study incorporate follow feature : 1 . This phase II study determine safety therapeutic potential new transplant approach ( disease-free survival , graft versus myeloma effect ) evaluate toxicity profile ( immediate toxicity , graft-versus-host disease , graft rejection , mortality ) patient population severe congenital anemia . 2 . The patient cohort study : Those patient severe sickle cell disease thalassemia risk factor high mortality morbidity relate disease 3 . Transplant Conditioning Regimen - Immunosuppression without myeloablation : Patients receive condition sufficient allow donor lympho-hematopoietic engraftment without complete marrow ablation . If graft reject , patient reconstitute autologous marrow function . We use combination low dose irradiation , Alemtuzumab ( Campath® ) , sirolimus . 4 . Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell ( PBPC ) transplant : An unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell collection filgrastim ( G-CSF ) stimulate HLA-matched donor improve chance engraftment high stem cell dose ( 5 x 106/kg CD34+ cell ) presence donor lymphocytes . To reduce risk GVHD , patient receive sirolimus transplant . The sirolimus taper necessary minimize graft versus host disease still maintain adequate chimerism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A human lymphocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling donor receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) 10 to16 µg/kg/d subcutaneously intravenously 6 day apheresis collection PBPC day 5 ( day 6 require ) . The product collect leukophoresis goal ≥ 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg , minimum 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg . The patient receive preparative regimen Alemtuzumab infuse day -7 -3 , follow 300 cGy TBI give single dose day -2 . Sirolimus dose 5mg/day maintain trough level 10-15ng/ml start day -1 . The PBPC graft target deliver 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ( minimum , 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ) infuse day 0 On day +14 , +30 , +60 +100 chimeric status patient assess microsatellite analysis peripheral blood . More frequent monitoring may require . Sickle cell patient pulmonary hypertension meet Pulmonary Medicine Consult determine appropriate management prior SCT . Patients fever suspect minor infection await resolution symptom start condition regimen . Iron chelation must discontinue &gt; 48 hour initiate condition regimen . Hydroxyurea must discontinue one day prior initiate condition regimen .</detailed_description>
