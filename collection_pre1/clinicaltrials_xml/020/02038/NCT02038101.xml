	<detailed_description>This study international , prospective , multi-centred , investigator blind , randomize control trial educational feedback-based intervention vs. usual care study proportion inappropriate TTEs order clinician ambulatory care . Increased inappropriate TTE utilization represent burden health budget cost rise increased utilization , patient burden unnecessary procedure adversely affect quality care . Rising utilization environment limit supply also create barrier access increase wait time patient community await necessary TTEs . In move balance concern regard rise utilization still ensure physician autonomy access order cardiac test procedure , American College Cardiology collaborate American Society Echocardiography develop Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) Echocardiography 2007 , updated 2011 . AUC create use modify RAND appropriateness method . Studies apply AUC TTE order single centre US find inappropriate TTE rate ambulatory ( outpatient ) care range 35 % . We successfully create innovative education feedback-based intervention hypothesize reduce proportion inappropriate TTEs order clinical practice , save healthcare dollar improve quality care access echocardiography . Our objective prospectively study follow intervention multicentre , randomize control trial format determine intervention reduce inappropriate TTEs number TTEs order practice . The study take place multiple hospital Canada United States . Participants include cardiologist primary care provider ( general internal medicine family practice ) provide ambulatory care . Only provider see patient ambulatory care clinic include . Pediatric cardiologist physician specialize primarily adult congenital heart disease exclude study . Physicians approach require provide write consent prior participation study . Once cardiologists primary care physician recruit study , randomize one two arm : 1 ) Intervention group , 2 ) Control group . Randomization occur time site ensure study start date consistent across site . Collection TTE order information TTE order classification : A physician 's TTE order information ascertain review individual TTE order review patient 's medical record . This may review Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) paper chart , depend individual site . Trained research coordinator site review TTE order indication review patient record ascertain clinical circumstance regard TTE order . The individual research coordinator review information use 2011 AUC classify TTE Appropriate ( A ) , Inappropriate ( I ) Uncertain ( U ) , assign TTE order appropriate indication number accordingly . TTE order correspond indication number designate unclassifiable . Research Coordinators blind physician intervention control group . This system TTE classification previously pilot publish group two recently publish study , rate successful classification great 98 % . Dissemination TTE monthly feedback report : Research Coordinators site responsible individual physician ' TTE order classification blind study group . Once monthly TTE order classify collate , information transmit central research laboratory , research coordinator collate result transmit monthly feedback report individual physician . This process ensure local site coordinator study investigator blind result study , still enable creation dissemination physician relate feedback report intervention group . The control group order TTEs usual practice .</detailed_description>
