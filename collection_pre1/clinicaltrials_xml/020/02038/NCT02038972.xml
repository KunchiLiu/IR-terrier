	<brief_title>Safety Autologous Stem Cell Infusion Children With Acquired Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There currently treatment available repair/reverse acquire sensorineural hearing loss . Recent experiment use human umbilical cord blood treatment mouse guinea pig model demonstrate hair cell re-growth follow acquire sensorineural loss well partial restoration ABR . Autologous human umbilical cord blood therapy , use twenty year , excellent safety record . This study determine autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion child hear loss safe feasible , improve inner ear function , audition , language development . The patient umbilical cord stem cell collect birth store Cord Blood Registry use infusion .</detailed_description>
