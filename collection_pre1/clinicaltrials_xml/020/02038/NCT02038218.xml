	<brief_summary>DM-CHOC-PEN polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryl carbonate demonstrate antineoplastic activity patient advance cancer - melanoma , lung , breast glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) involve CNS Phase I study . These finding support preclinical response see mouse bear intracerebrally implant human breast GBM tumor xenograft . Toxicity acceptable - hyperbilirubinemia ( patient liver disease and/or liver metastasis ) . No hematological , renal , cardiovascular , behavioral cognitive impairment/neurotoxicities note Phase I human trial previous pre-clinical study . The drug available use soy bean oil/egg yolk lecithin/glycerin water emulsion ; latter continue chemically biologically stable safe . Patients advance lung , breast melanoma cancer spread CNS primary CNS malignancy eligible enrollment treatment , provide require blood eligibility requirement meet . The trial 2-tiered - patient liver involvement vs. non-liver involvement treat different dos drug . The trial open patient currently enrol treat protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DM-CHOC-PEN select Phase II intravenous study treatment patient advanced malignancy central nervous system measurable disease base improve PFS objective response see patient treated Phase I DTI-021 trial manageable toxicity note . Melanoma , breast lung cancer involve CNS respond DM-CHOC-PEN Phase I study , thus basis choice tumor treat Phase II trial . Currently , opinion drug penetrate blood brain barrier ( BBB ) attach rbc release intracerebrally tumor mass situ . The trial carefully monitor , cancer type &gt; 3 confirmed responder first 18 evaluable patient ( Stage -1 enrollment ) ; accrual expand tumor type goal 7/43 achieve 80 % power 5 % level significance ( Stage-2 enrollment ) unacceptable response rate ( P0 ) 0.1 desirable response rate ( P1 ) 0.25 . Thus , arm 2-stage design . This allow resource direct promise area - selection 1 2 tumor type develop via additional trial study . A desirable response rate 25 % well . The tumor type - lung , breast , melanoma GBM . In summary , tumor type treatment sub-group , response rate &lt; 15 % rate `` possibly treatment-related Gr-3/4 toxicity '' &gt; 25 % consider unacceptable enrollment respective tumor type category discontinue .</detailed_description>
