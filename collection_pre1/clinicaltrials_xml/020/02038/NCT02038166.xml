	<brief_title>Nasal Potential Difference ( NPD ) Protocol Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal Potential Difference ( NPD ) measurement conduct participant . The NPD measurement , bioelectric assay CFTR-dependent ion transport use variety protocol design detect CFTR function . A 4-Step protocol utilize . The nasal cavity perfuse step-wise fashion follow solution : 1 ) Ringer 's solution , 2 ) Ringer 's solution + amiloride 100μM , 3 ) Low-Cl -- contain solution , 4 ) Low-Cl- + isoproterenol ( 10 µM ) . The potential difference monitor nasal epithelium comparison agar fill reference butterfly electrode place volar aspect forearm , connect via calomel cell high impedance voltmeter . Following placement subcutaneous reference bridge , nasal probe secure 1-3 cm within inferior meatus secure position polarize position . Each nare sequentially perfuse Ringer solution . All nasal potential difference tracing score independently single reviewer . The investigator internal committee comprise Gregory Fleming James Associate Scientists oversee safety study . Our internal committee multidisciplinary group consist physician subspecialists , collectively , experience treatment patient cystic fibrosis airway disease conduct randomize clinical trial . The primary responsibility committee protect safety welfare subject consent investigator 's procurement remnant tissue endoscopic sinus procedure . Members responsible review procedural conduct , include acquisition consent material , protect patient well-being . An interim data safety review conduct yearly basis . The committee consist least 3 member clinical trial experience airway disease . During annual review , issue relate safety process acquire human tissue review . Summary report annual meeting prepared address concern procurement tissue information deem pertinent review .</detailed_description>
