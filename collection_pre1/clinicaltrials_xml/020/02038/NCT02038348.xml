	<brief_summary>Melanoma incidence increase developed country . At metastatic stage , prognosis usually poor . Major advance obtain last 3 year development therapy target MAP kinases pathway . Vemurafenib ( zelborafÂ® ) approve France since 2012 first treatment metastatic melanoma carry B-RAF mutation . For growth , tumor need adequate supply nutrient allow synthesis macromolecule contribution carbon element ensure production energy . The nutrition demand meet great availability nutrient via tumor angiogenesis increase intracellular penetration nutrient via specific upregulation transport system metabolic pathway . Scanner image method commonly use evaluation therapeutic response . Such method give morphological indication evaluate metabolic response . With development functional imaging technique advent positron emission tomography ( PET ) , possible obtain assessment metabolic activity tumor . The use 18F-FDG ass therapeutic response target therapy fairly recent . The advantage approach well documented GIST non-small cell lung cancer . In melanoma , metabolic response 18F-FDG much fast response TAP scanner . 18F-FDG tracer target glucose metabolism , sensitive functional imaging melanoma , hinder development tracer 18F-FDOPA 18F-FLT . The 18F-FDG TEP thus use initial stag follow-up disease , situation replace TAP scanner , additional brain image remain necessary . The use metabolic image study response target therapy melanoma subject one publication . There trend toward improved progression-free survival patient high metabolic response day J15 . For melanoma , diagnostic sensitivity PET 18F-FDOPA low 18F-FDG ( 64 % versus 95 % ) . In contrast , 18F-FDOPA tracer advantage allow brain assessment , critical melanoma give frequent metastasis central nervous system . There never evaluation metabolic response target therapy BRAF inhibitor PET 18F-FDOPA . The investigator propose conduct monocentric prospective preliminary study explore potential usefulness metabolic PET image 18F-FDOPA evaluation metabolic response B-RAF mutate metastatic melanoma treat vemurafenib .</brief_summary>
