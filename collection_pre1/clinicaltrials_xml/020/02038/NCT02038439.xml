	<brief_title>Multifaceted Online Interventions Increase Clinicians Searching Current Best Evidence Answer Clinical Questions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale &amp; Objectives One main barrier achieve evidence-informed care clinician lack quick easy identification , appraisal synthesis current best evidence . Clinicians ' information need considerable - 3000 article publish Medline every day . Numerous evidence-based resource develop filter process evidence , although increasingly use clinician , offer fragment scattered view information , none provide comprehensive topic coverage satisfactory updating . To address thesis problem , McMaster 's Health Information Research Unit ( Hamilton , Ontario , Canada ) develop implement `` McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service Federated Search ( MPFS ) '' , online search engine provide unique 1-stop search organize access current best evidence daily practice . MPFS provide alert user new research choose discipline , novel federate search function , particular feature organize information accord `` pyramid evidence-based resource '' , clinically applicable evidence top . Thus MPFS simultaneously retrieve evidence Studies ( `` Medline '' , filter unfiltered , bottom ) , Systematic review ; Synopses study systematic review ( select methodological rigor clinical relevance ) , , top level , online widely use Summaries ( e.g . `` Best Practice '' ) . Combining feature current best evidence-based resource enough increase access use current best evidence , show relatively low utilization search feature among hundred clinician currently register McMaster University use alert system . Additional well-known barrier need overcome include logistical barrier ( time constraint , forgotten question , simplicity use one single albeit limit resource ) , well educational barrier ( eg , lack awareness `` architecture '' evidence limit single resource , lack knowledge experience federate search offer , limited search skill , lack reference standard among peer find best evidence ) . 2 . Hypothesis This trial seek test 3 innovative online intervention among clinician register MPFS overcome barrier increase quantity quality search current best evidence answer clinical question . These intervention build effective model teach clinical skill point care , clinician facilitate use search engine clinical tool , perceive evidence retrieval skill true clinical skill . 3 . Methods 1 . Study design : Randomized Factorial Controlled Trial . 2 . Setting Participants : The trial conduct among postgraduate faculty MD register MPFS work teach hospital clinic McMaster University ( see eligibility criterion ) 3 . Participating clinician randomize 3 online intervention ( see description ) factorial design ( A x B x C ) , whose permutation result 8 allocation arm ( A+B+C , A+B , A+C , B+C , A , B , C , intervention , see detail ) 4 . Randomization : computer-generated , stratified training level ( post-graduate MD , faculty MD ) , baseline frequency search evidence MPFS . Registrants randomly allocate study arm . Allocation conceal research staff . 5 . Blinding control group : Although participant blind intervention , tell different feature offer , receive usual searching feature MPFS . 6 . Primary secondary outcome ( see ) .</detailed_description>
