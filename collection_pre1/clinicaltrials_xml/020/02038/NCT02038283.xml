	<brief_summary>Introduction : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second common cancer among Chinese Hong Kong second leading cause cancer death population . Several screen strategy associate improved survival may affect patient ' health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . HRQOL impact use adjust survival term quality adjust life year ( QALY ) evaluation cost-effectiveness intervention include screen . Objectives : determine HRQOL health preference patient different stage colorectal neoplasm , determine cost-effective CRC screening strategy increase QALYs . Design Subjects : A longitudinal survey collect data HRQOL associate colorectal neoplasm Markov model cost-effectiveness CRC screening . A stratified sample 420 patient colorectal polyps different stage CRC recruit colorectal clinic Queen Mary Hospital health preference HRQOL assessment . The HRQOL time measure baseline , 6 12 month later . Health preference data integrate cost effectiveness data obtain literature determine cost-effectiveness currently recommend CRC screen strategy Markov modeling . Main outcome measure : The primary outcome measure SF-6D health preference value QALYs . Secondary outcome SF-12v2 FACT-C score . The outcome compare patient different stage colorectal neoplasm . Markov model study estimate expect QALYs gain incremental cost-effectiveness ratio CRC screening strategy . Results : The study provide information HRQOL patient colorectal neoplasm guide health service . The Markov Model identify cost-effective CRC screening strategy Hong Kong Chinese , inform policy maker public prevention CRC population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim determine HRQOL health preference ( utility ) different stage colorectal neoplasm order evaluate cost-effectiveness different CRC screening strategy Chinese population Hong Kong . The specific objective : 1 . To determine HRQOL preference value patient different stage colorectal neoplasm order estimate quality life adjustment applicable stage colorectal neoplasm . 2 . To evaluate HRQOL patient colorectal neoplasm order find concern need . 3 . To find whether HRQOL preference people colorectal neoplasm change time . 4 . To determine expect life year gain reduction incidence mortality rate CRC CRC screen strategy base literature review . 5 . To determine QALY gain CRC strategy combine preference value life year gain . 6 . To identify cost-effective CRC screening strategy determine incremental cost per additional QALY gain compare screening , Markov modelling . The study hypotheses : 1 . Patients colorectal neoplasm include polyp low HRQOL general population . 2 . There gradient reduction HRQOL preference among patient different stage colorectal neoplasm polyp metastatic cancer . 3 . HRQOL preference patient colorectal neoplasm stable change disease stage . 4 . Annual I-FOBT cost-effective CRC screening strategy Chinese population Hong Kong .</detailed_description>
