	<detailed_description>The project advertise direct contact relevant organization anaesthesia pain management . Any center willing participate provide document receive local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval , 'local responsible ' ( LR ) nominate co-ordinate project responsible data collection locally . Centers receive IRB approval collect data different type procedure ( adult major minor surgery , pediatric surgery , obstetric anesthesia , pain management ) . Data collect specifically design form , every center quarterly send promoter centre report include general data specific report every occurred complication . Eligibility criteria Investigators collect total number intervention number regional anesthesia ( RA ) technique perform . Patients record `` case '' `` control '' sign specifical informed consent . For pediatric patient patient able sign reason , specific form include document , sign parent legally-established tutor , require every clinical procedure scientific trial country . General data Total number intervention , number central neuraxial block ( CNBs ) , peripheral nerve block ( PNBs ) continuous PNBs ( CPNBs ) perform . CNBs classify epidural , combine spinal-epidurals ( CSEs ) , subarachnoid . PNBs cPNBs divide ultrasound-guided , nerve stimulation-guided blind technique . Specific data - report complication For complication specific report send data analysis , include data concern case ( patient complication ) control ( two follow patient undergo type loco-regional technique ) . Reports slightly different CNBs ( c ) PNBs . For every patient , investigator register demographic data ( age , ASA-American Society Anesthesiologists- status , height weight ) , data regard surgical technique ( type surgery , open/video-laparoscopic/robotic approach , election/emergency surgery ) data regard anti-thromboembolic therapy ( drug , time suspension before/after blockade ) . A second part report strictly dedicate technique type complication occur ( , hence , different central peripheral block ) . Statistical analysis Study population estimate base previous study major complication CNBs , indicate incidence major adverse effect 4.2 100.000 patient . Estimating incidence 1:25.000 , number 25.000 procedure calculate need study , confidence interval 95 % . The primary endpoint ass cumulative incidence adverse effect , follow case-control analysis perform identify possible risk factor .</detailed_description>
