	<brief_summary>ONC201 new potential drug kill cancer cell normal cell laboratory study . This clinical trial first evaluation ONC201 human enroll patient advanced cancer . This trial include phase I portion evaluate safety ONC201 recommend dose phase II portion . The phase II portion evaluate initial efficacy profile ONC201 select type cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-in-man Phase I/II Study Oral ONC201 Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ONC201 ( TIC10 ) first-in-class small molecule inactivates Ras effector target kinase , Akt ERK , selectively tumor , normal , cell safely trigger cancer cell death . The dual inactivation Akt ERK ONC201 result broad-spectrum cytotoxic activity include activation TRAIL-mediated apoptotic downstream antitumor effect produce potent antitumor response . The safety margin ( ratio therapeutic dose low dose mild adverse event ) ONC201 least 10-fold rat dog GLP toxicology . The efficacy ONC201 consistently demonstrate multiple vitro , ex vivo , vivo preclinical cancer model . Favorable attribute ONC201 observe preclinical model include antitumor efficacy infrequent administration , broad-spectrum activity independent mutation tumor type , orally active , high safety margin , synergistic activity many approve therapy , highly stable , highly water soluble , ability penetrate blood-brain barrier . In phase I portion trial , hypothesis ONC201 exhibit acceptable safety profile patient advance cancer . In phase II portion trial , hypothesis ONC201 show preliminary sign efficacy patient advance cancer define endpoint include progression-free survival , response rate , biomarkers , overall survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm glioblastoma multiforme , triplenegative breast cancer , colorectal cancer , nonsmall cell lung cancer patient advance disease limit therapeutic option . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . For lymph node consider measurable , short axis must ≥15 mm assess CT scan . All lesion ( site disease ) , include small lesion ( long diameter &lt; 10 mm pathological lymph node ≥10 &lt; 15 mm short axis ) , consider nonmeasurable disease . Bone lesion , leptomeningeal disease , ascites , pleural/pericardial effusion , lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis , inflammatory breast disease , abdominal mass ( follow CT MRI ) , consider nonmeasurable . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . 3 . Patients eligible enrollment prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , anticancer therapy , investigational agent within 28 day prior first dose ( Week 1 , Day 1 ) ; 42 day week case alkylating agent . Patients eligible enrollment surgery within 6 week prior first dose . Any number prior therapy allowable . 4 . All adverse event Grade &gt; 1 relate prior therapy ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or surgery ) must resolve , except alopecia . 5 . Age ≥18 year . 6 . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % , see Appendix A ) . 7 . Life expectancy great 10 week . 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × upper limit normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level normal . 9 . The effect ONC201 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Tumor specimen ( paraffinembedded block frozen tissue ) prior resection biopsy available sufficient perform pharmacodynamic assay ( &gt; 3 slide IHC ) 11 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients receive bevacizumab therapy . 2 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude phase I portion study . In phase II portion , patient know CNS metastasis limit 20 % patient population accrue proportionately . Patients CNS metastasis must stable therapy CNS metastasis ( surgery , radiotherapy stereotactic radiosurgery ) &gt; 3 month must steroid treatment prior study enrollment must life expectancy 3 month great eligible . 3 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ONC201 excipients . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 5 . Pregnant woman exclude study ONC201 novel agent unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ONC201 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ONC201 . 6 . Patients know HIVpositive test combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible initial firstinman trial potential pharmacokinetic interaction ONC201 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 7 . Patients known history cardiac arrhythmia include atrial fibrillation , tachyarrhythmias bradycardia exclude . Patients receive therapeutic agent know prolong QT interval exclude . Patients history CHF , MI stroke last 3 month exclude . Patients history seizure exclude form initial trial ONC201 cross bloodbrain barrier may affect antiseizure therapy . 8 . Active drug use alcoholism .</criteria>
