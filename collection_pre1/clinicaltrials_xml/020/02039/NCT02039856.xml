Lack gender-sensitive , comprehensive care woman also associate measurable decrement woman 's rating VA access , continuity coordination , well measure technical quality . The investigator aim assess effectiveness evidence-based quality improvement ( EBQI ) method develop WH PACT model use cluster randomize trial design ( Aim # 1 ) ; examine impact receipt WH-PACT concordant care woman Veterans ' outcome ( Aim # 2 ) ; evaluate process EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation ( Aim # 3 ) ; develop implementation evaluation tool use EBQI-supported WH-PACT model adaptation , implementation , sustainability spread additional VA facility ( Aim # 4 ) . EBQI systematic approach develop multi-level research-clinical partnership approach engage local organizational senior leader quality improvement team adapt implement new care model context prior evidence , local practice context , provider behavior change method , researcher provide technical support practice facilitation . In cluster randomize trial , investigator evaluate WH-PACT model achievement use patient , provider practice survey . The investigator examine intermediate change provider , staff team knowledge attitude . Using analysis secondary administrative performance data , investigator also explore impact receipt WH-PACT care quality chronic disease care prevention , health status , utilization cost . Using mixed method , investigator assess pre-post EBQI practice context ; document WH-PACT implementation ; examine barriers/facilitators EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation combination semi-structured interview monthly formative progress narrative administrative data review .</detailed_description>
