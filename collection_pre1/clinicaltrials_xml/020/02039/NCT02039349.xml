	<brief_summary>Background : - Hormones naturally occur chemical body . Ghrelin hormone mainly produce stomach stimulates appetite . Some study suggest may stimulate alcohol craving use . Drugs develop block ghrelin . Researchers want know people tolerate particular drug block ghrelin . It give two dose level , combine alcohol . Objective : - To determine drug may decrease alcohol consumption give along alcohol safe tolerable . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 21 65 year old 14 ( woman ) 21 ( men ) drink week . - No one childbearing potential participate . Design : - Participants 3 inpatient clinic visit ; last 4 day . - They physical exam blood urine test . - They breath test alcohol smoking . - They answer health mood question . - Researchers measure reaction smell alcohol taste sweet drink . - They eat food provide clinic . They keep food diary 1 day stay . - They randomly assign take study drug placebo 5 time stay . - On Day 3 , drink alcohol take drug . They give many blood sample day tube insert skin . - Smokers take smoke break . Once , smoke cigarette device . - One week last stay , participant follow-up visit answer question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Ghrelin 28-aminoacid peptide stimulate appetite food intake . It endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHSR1a ) . Preclinical study suggest ghrelin modulates alcohol reward processing . Furthermore , finding translational human lab study Brown University ( PI : Leggio ) indicate intravenous ( IV ) ghrelin administration , compare placebo , result acute increase crave alcohol cue-reactivity experiment alcoholic individual . Therefore , orally bioavailable , ghrelin receptor antagonist , pas blood brain barrier hold particular promise AD treatment . This project recently fund NCATS . The goal protocol generate preliminary evidence safety efficacy ghrelin receptor antagonist ( GHSR1a antagonist ) , PF-05190457 , exist molecule available NIH-Industry Pilot Program NCATS . Study population : Non-treatment seek heavy drinker ( n =20 ) . The study conduct Inpatient Unit NIAAA Intramural Clinical Program . Study Design : Single-blind dose-escalating placebo-controlled inpatient study use PF-05190457 , non-treatment seek heavy drinking subject . This Phase 1b study within-subject design . Outcome measure : Primary objective determine : 1 ) number adverse event ( AEs ) experience , compare three PF-05190457 dose category ( 0mg placebo , 50mg , 100mg b.i.d . ) ; 2 ) total concentration drug , compare two non-placebo drug dos ( 50mg 100mg b.i.d . ) , co-administered alcohol . We hypothesize dos PF-05190457 , compare placebo , result increase number AEs . As secondary objective , determine whether PF-05190457 dose-dependently affect subjective effect alcohol crave . We include pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) investigation conduct University Rhode Island ( URI ; Associate Investigator : Akhlaghi ) . The PK/PD component include ( ) measure total , unbound tissue concentration drug use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) evaluation biomarkers effect ( ii ) estimation PK PD parameter use conventional semi-mechanistic modeling approach assist identify optimal dose regimen drug AD .</detailed_description>
