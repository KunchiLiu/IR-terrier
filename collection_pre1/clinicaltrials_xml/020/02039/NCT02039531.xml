	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS : The application plasma rich growth factor ( PRGF ) improve quality life functional capacity patient diagnose knee osteoarthritis , provide well functional result conventional treatment viscosupplementation . OPERATING ASSUMPTIONS Following initial administration three dos PRGF intersperse every 15 day , applied via intraarticular , patient present improvement functional test ( WOMAC Lequesne scale ) 15 % 6 12 month compare control group patient treat hyaluronic acid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The overall objective study assess effectiveness treatment PRGF osteoarthritis knee . Main objective : - To show effectiveness 6 month treatment PRGF , improvement reference test ( WOMAC Lequesne ) 15 % compare treatment hyaluronic acid patient osteoarthritis knee . Secondary objective : - To assess effectiveness 12 month treatment PRGF compare treatment hyaluronic acid . - To assess effectiveness 12 month two cycle re-treatment PRGF ( second phase study ) , compare effect single cycle PRGF ( first phase study ) . - Quantifying platelet growth factor blood concentration patient treat PRGF correlation intraarticular effect . METHODOLOGY.STUDY DESIGN : First Phase : A randomized , single-blind , clinical trial perform compare effectiveness 2 different treatment strategy ( PRGF hyaluronic acid ) patient knee osteoarthritis . Patients divide two homogeneous group use randomization procedure permute block system . The first group ( experimental ) receive treatment PRGF ; one cycle three intraarticular dos every 15 day . The control group , receive viscosupplementation wih hyaluronic acid high molecular weight ( Durolane® ) . Its administration perform one cycle single intraarticular dose . Second phase : An interim analysis main objective first phase 6 month perform . If clinical data indicate PRGF effective hyaluronic acid serious adverse event describe , investigator carry second phase extension , exploratory , open label , non randomize , starting-up 12 month finish first phase ( order wash effect treatment first phase ) . Patients treat hyaluronic acid first phase offer treat PRGF two cycle administration ( first one begin second one 6 month ) order know whether two-cycles-based-treatment improves result single-cycle-based-treatment . STUDY VARIABLES Within study investigator analyze different variable : Predicting Variables : - sex - age - BMI , - Grade chondropathy classification Kellgren Lawrence scale - laterality - employment status ( Working , unemployed retire ) - presence complication . - quantification platelet blood concentration patient study group . Outcome Variables : The investigator use specific test evaluate Osteoarthritis knee : - WOMAC scale ( Western Ontario McMaster Universities ) . - Severity index Lequesne knee osteoarthritis . Both test internationally validate clinical functional health assessment patient osteoarthritis knee . All translate spanish validate scientific community use clinical research . - Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) SF-363 Health Questionnaire . The result study questionnaire measure 3 , 6 12 month phase . The WOMAC questionnaire assess pain intensity 5 different situation , joint stiffness 2 different situation functional capacity 17 everyday situation . Each item score 0 ( `` pain , without stiffness difficulty '' ) 4 ( `` Very much `` ) . The total score range follow : Pain 0-20 , stiffness 0-8 Functional Capacity 0-68 . The severity index Lequesne knee osteoarthritis quantifies severity disability severity osteoarthritis . The pain measure 3 item , maximum distance walk activity daily live measure 4 situation . Scores range 1-4 ( mild inability ) &gt; 14 ( failure extremely serious ) . The SF -36 health questionnaire . It use medical research . It provide overview state health person . Contains 36 question address different aspect daily life person . COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS . At baseline patient receive first infiltration , regardless study group , must complete test describe earlier . Then , 3 , 6 12 month patient perform test . Analysis : - Description variable : qualitative variable summarize absolute relative frequency . Quantitative variable mean standard deviation , alternatively , median interquartile range , case follow normal distribution . - Comparison mean two group Student t-test , alternatively U Mann - Whitney , case follow normal distribution . - Qualitative variable analyze use chi2 test calculation relative risk ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval . - Linear regression correlation blood concentration platelet PRGF obtain inject . These test also conduct correlate plasma concentration outcome variable . - Level statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . - The analysis carry intention treat . ETHICS All patient must sign informed consent inclusion . The study approve ethic committee Principe de Asturias University Hospital . The investigator responsible ensure confidentiality patient 's data , act accord Spanish Law Protection Personal Data ( LO 15/ 1999 ) . STUDY LIMITATIONS . Limitations study include lack control group treat placebo . In study placebo-controlled group ethically acceptable , patient must undergo invasive procedure associate risk discomfort involve . Therefore , case use control group patient treat hyaluronic acid , consider alternative surgical treatment osteoarthritis knee . Another bias may occur loss patient different reason . To prevent problem , contact every month patient telephone remind appointment 3,6 12 month . In second phase patient complete first phase control group possibility treatment two cycle PRGF . Because consider unlikely remain residual effect hyaluronic acid 12 month receive first infiltration , homogeneity achieve randomization first phase expect maintain second phase . It consider 12 month relatively short time interval longstanding chronic disease osteoarthritis knee . Just case , comparative analysis baseline characteristic perform adjusted difference may find . Finally , due sample size estimate detect difference one cycle treatment PRGF hyaluronic acid first phase , possible could insufficient comparison second phase . Thus , second phase consider exploratory .</detailed_description>
