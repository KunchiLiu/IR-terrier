	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndrome define myocardial infarction ischemia evidence significant coronary artery disease cardiac catheterization/revascularization reversible defect see stress test . Each year approximately 8-10 million patient undergo emergency department evaluation possible acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) United States Up 8 % patient myocardial infarction ( MI ) inadvertently discharge . Unnecessary admission presume myocardial disease result health care cost estimate exceed 5 billion dollar annually Currently , cardiac biomarkers troponin Creatine phosphokinase ( CPK-MB ) , conjunction ECG change use evaluate patient routinely ACS . However , test limitation identify patient ACS rapid fashion . Purine molecules inosine hypoxanthine show also biomarkers acute MI . High pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) traditional method analysis purine . The HPLC method however require hour assess biomarkers , traditionally use troponin CK-MB method . Recently , investigator develop rapid chemo luminescence method detect purine biomarkers . This modality provide expeditious ( require less 4 minute complete analysis ) , bedside method analysis ACS routinely acquire blood sample . In study investigator compare result chemo luminescence method gold standard HPLC method , result traditional cardiac marker troponin Creatine phosphokinase ( CK-MB ) patient undergo evaluation ACS . Details noninvasive invasive cardiac assessment perform part routine evaluation clinician myocardial assessment intervention conjunction biomarker assessment obtain . The investigator hypothesize rapid chemo luminescence biomarker assessment identify patient ACS faster traditional diagnostic method . The goal study assess role rapid assessment purine biomarkers identify patient may ACS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty patient present evaluation ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ) hospital emergency department ( ED ) study 50 control subject without know cardiac disease age ± 5years sex match . Pregnant woman , child prisoner well individual hemoglobin less 9 g/dL exclude . Blood drawn analyze biomarkers inosine , hypoxanthine time standard care biomarker troponin sample . The level biomarkers inosine hypoxanthine measure research laboratory , use LC/mass spectrometry ( MS ) luminescence methodology . Troponin level measure standard care routine fashion hospital laboratory ( CLIA accredit ) Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center . Demographic clinical information obtain clinical course follow . EKG data , cardiac angiography cardiac assessment data ( e.g . ECHO , rest stress myocardial perfusion image ) perform part standard care evaluation collect evaluate . A maximum ( 6 ) 10 ml blood sample ( heparin anticoagulant ) analysis draw throughout hospitalization . Twenty Five patient present ACS require immediate ( PCI ) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention : sample draw 0 , 3 6 hour vascular access acquire . Blood sample analysis standard care troponin 0 , 3 6 hour . Twenty Five patient present ACS require immediate PCI Percutaneous Coronary Intervention blood sample draw time 0 , immediately intervention , 1 , 3 6 hour . Troponin sample acquire analyzed per routine practice ( time 0 , 3 , 6 hour ) ( 2 ) additional troponin sample collect ( reperfusion 1 hour ) . The analytical cost ( 2 ) sample charge department Nephrology . Fifty age ± 5years sex match control subject without know cardiac disease time blood sample draw 0 , 3 6 hour . These sample analyze troponin , inosine hypoxanthine . These patient sample serve control group . Control subject recruit Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems . Due acute nature patient present chest pain , 10 ml sample blood drawn time first routine blood draw clinical purpose sample reserve patient consent discuss . If patient consent participate sample retain add study sample . If declined sample discard . Hypoxanthine Inosine level measure LC/MS ( mass spectrometry ) method . Luminescence technology use utilizing Lumistar Optima Microplate Reader . Analysis sample complete batch throughout study .</detailed_description>
