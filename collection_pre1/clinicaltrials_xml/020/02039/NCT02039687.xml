	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether ARA 290 , new class compound , effective treatment neuropathic symptom sarcoidosis . Brief interaction ARA 290 innate repair receptor result anti-apoptotic anti-inflammatory activity myriad cell , tissue organ throughout body activate repair mechanism accelerate healing , include nerve damage associate sarcoidosis . In study , subject sarcoidosis symptom small fiber neuropathy administer ARA 290 placebo subcutaneous injection daily 28 day . In addition monitoring safety treatment , symptoms subject assess several questionnaire , function test , measurement nerve fiber cornea skin ( via non-invasive test biopsy , respectively ) . The total participation time patient 16 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>â€¢ Established diagnosis sarcoidosis follow two criterion : 1 . Score 4 great Brief Pain Inventory `` pain '' `` average pain '' question ( BPI ; 0 ( least discomfort ) 10 ( bad discomfort ) ) 2 . Discomfort define distal pain/discomfort plus one following : 1 ) dysesthesia , 2 ) burning/painful foot worsen night , 3 ) intolerance sheet clothe touch legs foot AND either follow two criterion 1 . Corneal nerve fiber density reduce compare normal ( i.e. , great 1 standard deviation less mean normative population ) 2 . A previous skin biopsy ( obtain within prior 2 year ) show reduce intraepidermal nerve fiber density ( ( i.e. , great 1 standard deviation less mean normal age gender relevant population ) In addition , subject must : Be able read understand write consent form , complete studyrelated procedure , communicate study staff Be willing comply study restriction Be willing check study center via telephone Between 18 70 year age ( inclusive ) Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &lt; 40 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) If female childbearing potential , negative urine pregnancy test screen acceptable contraception maintain screen dose period 1 month beyond . Acceptable contraception consist hormonal method oral , implantable , injectable , transdermal contraceptive minimum 1 full cycle ( base subject 's usual menstrual cycle period ) study entry , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , double barrier method ( condom , sponge , diaphragm , vaginal ring spermicidal jelly cream ) . Able complete selfadministered questionnaire ( RAND36 , SFNSL , BPI , FAS , NPSI ) Refrigerator freezer home storage study medication . Clinically relevant abnormal history physical mental health condition related sarcoidosis , determine medical history taking ( judged investigator ) Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory result , vital sign , physical finding condition related sarcoidosis could interfere conduct 6minute walk assessment ( judged investigator ) Other medical condition know associate small nerve fiber loss , except diabetes good control ( judged investigator ) Known clinically relevant abnormality ECG ( judge investigator ) Illicit drug abuse excessive alcohol consumption ( judged investigator ) History serious malignancy within last 5 year basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin remove History severe allergy , anaphylactic reaction significant intolerability prescription nonprescription drug food ( judged investigator ) AntiTNF therapy , biological antiinflammatory agent , immunoglobulin administer within 3 month prior screen . Use erythropoiesis stimulate agent within two month prior screen trial Participation investigational drug trial 3 month prior administration initial dose study drug 4 time calendar year precede study enrollment Inadequate venous accessibility judge clinician ( physician nurse ) Inability unwillingness selfadminister ARA 290 via subcutaneous injection ( access home health care assistance administration ) If female , pregnant breastfeed Any condition opinion investigator would complicate compromise study , wellbeing subject</criteria>
