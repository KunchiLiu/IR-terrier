	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Toxicity Induced Antitumoral Drugs : Risk Assessment Early Diagnosis . CARDIOTOX Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular toxicity produce antitumoral drug considerable impact life wellness prognosis cancer patient , imply suspension desire antitumoral treatment even risk patient´s life . The development risk score patient , well specific methodology early detection cardiotoxicity would therefore great outcome trigger new strategy monitor patient . Currently lack clinical score predict cardiotoxicity risk . Therefore , urgent need identify new myocardial injury biomarkers novel image parameter measure ventricular function would increase sensitivity traditional method use early detection cardiotoxicity . The objective present study follow : - Identify factor related cardiotoxicity risk produce antitumoral drug . - Assess utility clinical , biological functional parameter early detection cardiotoxicity produce antitumoral drug . The study multicenter one , observational ambispective . We include patient assessed Oncology Haematology Departments participant hospital initiate undergoing chemotherapy drug specify study protocol . Patients monitorized treatment , undergo echocardiography study blood sample collection clinical timepoint . All parameter hopefully shed light development clinical risk score well identify new early biomarkers cardiotoxicity . The initial follow-up phase study 2 year</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients &gt; 18 year indicate antitumor chemotherapy . Estimated survival ≥ 6 month No oxygen dependence No contraindication take study target antitumor agent . No exclusion patient risk factor previous heart disease . No exclusion patient previous cancer , previous antitumor treatment , current antitumor treatment , previous current radiotherapy . No exclusion patient previous cardiovascular toxicity No exclusion criterion .</criteria>
