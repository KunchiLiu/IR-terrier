	<brief_summary>Despite commonplace use respiratory medicine mechanism whereby inhalation challenge variety mild acid aerosol produce dose relate predictable cough unknown . In proposal investigator wish use establish cough challenge methodology explore mechanism action agent provoke cough health disease . The hypothesis test include : - Intracellular change pH , rather extracellular change , key activation TRP receptor , main sensor provoke cough . - ATP act P2X channel mechanism increase nerve excitability underlying cough hypersensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Into Mechanism Inhalation Cough Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator previously demonstrate mild acid , citric , tartaric phosphoric acid produce highly reliable cough challenge sensitivity complex individual acid correlate within population study inferring common mechanism action.In contrast correlation common cough challenge methodology , capsaicin infer least two different mechanism produce cough aerosols man . Over past 10 year establish capsaicin work specific irritant receptor know TRPV1 . A second receptor , TRPA1 recently discover first group demonstrate inhalation agonist receptor form extract cinnamon ( cinnamaldehyde ) produce cough man . TRPA1 attractive candidate main cough receptor since activate many common irritant , smoke , perfume strong smell know provoke cough patient . The investigator clone human TRP receptor express cell line . This vitro work allow u investigate molecular action TRP receptor . Recently , investigator others show weak acid activate TRPA1 , previously think stimulate external surface cell alter intracellular pH . This would explain weak strong acid well produce cough , since weak acid ( technically high pKa ) exist solution form able cross cell membrane render change intracellular pH , turn activates TRPA1 inside cell . In first study investigator wish simply alter pH nebulised solution provoke cough alter balance salt solution , carry standard cough challenge protocol . In second study investigator wish examine effect number know agonist TRPA1 commonly use perfume foodstuffs order understand rank order potency compound tussive agent . This compare rank order potency compound cause intracellular pH change vitro cell culture system , order test strength hypothesis variety different agonist . Finally , recent work show blockade neuronal ion channel know P2X3 dramatically reduce cough . P2X3 respond substance adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , previously use cough challenge solution man . If hypothesis cough hypersensitivity see patient due activation P2X3 correct patient cough much low dos ATP normal volunteer . We wish ass value ATP , related substance AMP adenosine cough challenge protocol . Studying cough produce naturally occur compound may allow u distinguish patient cough hypersensitivity cough due cause , also lead methodology important future drug development The great understanding cough reflex study would yield would important clinical application point way novel therapeutic avenue , well enhance fundamental understanding genesis cough .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients require demonstrate significant cough symptom score great 20/70 Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire . All patient must current nonsmoker . Patients must stable medication least one month . Patients must able attend trial unit least 3 occasion . Patients must normal lung function patient must able give informed consent Subjects pregnant , pacemaker situ exclude study . Those serious comorbid condition cancer , severe COPD , heart failure exclude . Those nonEnglish speaker special group ( i.e . mentally ill , child 16 year age , suffer dementia ) exclude . No test perform subject acute worsen asthma upper airway infection . If subject upper airway infection last three week offer another appointment . If subject take counter ( OTC ) cough mixture within last twelve hour : If subject willing come back another time challenge testing , another appointment make . If subject food drink product contain caffeine menthol within last hour . If subject unwilling wait 1 hour start test , subject return another time . If subject unwilling return another time , test proceed medication use record . If participant currently involve research , within 3 month participation type research , exclude study .</criteria>
