Mean body weight within ±10 kg 2 . Mean age within ±5 year 3 . Similar gender ratio Severe Renal Impaired Subjects : Screening creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) &lt; 30 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation Supine blood pressure ≤170/110 mmHg Documented renal impairment indicate reduced creatinine clearance within 12 month screen longer Stable renal function evidence ≤30 % difference two measurement creatinine clearance two separate occasion separate least 28 day one measurement value screen .
