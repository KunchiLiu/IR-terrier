	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study Repeated Intravenous E6011 Administration Japanese Subjects With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist Screening Phase , Observation Phase , Treatment Phase , Extension Phase , Follow-up Phase . Screening assessment perform 42 2 day study drug administration . Observation Phase assessment perform day day initial administration confirm eligibility subject . The eligible subject receive repeat intravenous administration E6011 . E6011 dissolve physiological saline ( nearly 100 mL ) approximately 30-minute infusion . During Treatment Phase , first second cohort , E6011 administer every 2 week Week 10 , total 6 time ( double dose Week 0 ) . For third fourth cohort , E6011 administer Weeks 0 , 1 2 , every 2 week Week 10 , total 7 time . Under safety concern , Crohn 's Disease Activity ( CDAI ) less 150 decrease CDAI Observation Phase great 70 subject intend continue administration , subject receive total 20 subsequent biweekly administration ( 40 week ) stable dose ( Extension Phase ) . Subjects hospitalized 24 hour initial second administration postdose monitor out-patient monitoring 12 week initial administration . If hospitalization difficult second administration , subject hold hospital 6 hour allow go home confirmation safety . Subjects roll onto Extension Phase continue monitor 52 week initial administration . When subject complete ( Week 12 Week 52 ) discontinue study , undergo on-site follow-up 28 day study completion discontinuation off-site follow-up telephone interview 70 day final administration . The investigator conduct full assessment subject safety next day second administration ( 24 hour second administration ) confirm presence absence study-related manifestation may affect study drug administration next cohort . When sponsor inform investigator 's judgment sixth subject cohort , appropriateness next cohort judge base safety data available include judgment individual investigator next day second administration .</detailed_description>
