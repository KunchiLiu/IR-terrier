	<brief_summary>The purpose study find people non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) change investigator see microscope ( call confocal endomicroscopy ) use endoscopy ( camera scope evaluation inside stomach swallow tube ) . Traditionally investigator use trial acid block medication ( PPIs ) , endoscopy measurement acid swallow tube ( esophagus ) determine investigator think acid cause troublesome symptom . The medical community believe symptom due increase space cell make swallow tube . The investigator directly see space new microscope investigator pass camera scope . Participants assign take one two medication omeprazole sucralfate ( approved medication stomach symptom ) treat symptom record well treatment work . The investigator look see microscope predict medication work best patient future . The investigator also plan measure acid level swallow tube camera evaluation swallow tube stomach standard patient symptom . The investigator compare result study microscope finding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study entry criterion : The investigator plan collaborate three center ensure data derive study generalizable academic center whole also expedite patient recruitment . The center participate Virginia Commonwealth University , Ochsner Health System Medical University South Carolina . Patients age 18 presenting clinic symptom typical reflux disease screen determine wish participate study . The site principal investigator directly contact potential patient see wish participate . If elect participate provide copy inform consent 24 hour first contact study personnel allow time review determine wish participate . All participant sign write informed consent . Patients wish enter study sign informed consent complete reflux disease questionnaire ( RDQ ) . This questionnaire consist 12 item assess various aspect reflux disease . A score 12 require study entry . Individual score less 12 participate study . Standard care patient gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) responsive proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) confirmatory test esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) evaluate erosive esophagitis ( EE ) test acid exposure lower esophagus pH testing . For purpose study investigator perform pH test acid suppress medication . This standard test determine patient acid exposure esophagus . Typically patient place twice daily ( BID ) PPI sucralfate test reveals significant acid exposure . Erosive esophagitis differentiate NERD endoscopic finding aid FICE ( NBI/iScan ) magnification technique investigator standardly employ clinical practice . Patients find EE participate study treat appropriately illness increase acid suppression . Patients without EE time endoscopy enrol study presume case NERD refractory PPI treatment . After endoscopic confirmation NERD , probe base confocal endomicroscopy catheter insert ( CellVisio ) . The probe place 5cm gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) define top gastric fold . Subsequently , 2.5cc 10 % fluorescein inject . The investigator initiate video record microscopic image start injection fluorescein continue video 3 minute . This video review late time 2 blinded endoscopists train confocal endomicroscopy interpretation . The goal see time see fluorescein intracellular space correlate response therapy . The investigator record time first visualization intrapapillary loop intracellular gap , time visualization intrapapillary loop visualization intracellular gap entirety space loop . The investigator also measurement general overall appearance . Having record microscopic image allow centralize reading time event accurate timing video stop review slow motion . The investigator perform endomicroscopic assessment four quadrant 2cm , 5cm 10cm gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) . This represent single image acquisition video measurement 4 separate view include . Computer analysis microscopic image determine average cell cell junction distance , number intrapapillary capillary loop , size intrapapillary capillary loop overall saturation fluorescein . Biopsies esophagus correspond endomicroscopy site collect microscopic analysis . Following endoscopy patient receive 48h Bravo capsule 24h impedance pH probe quantitate acid non-acid reflux event ( 24h probe use ) . Standard calibration insertion technique provide manufacturer use . Standard symptom event record heartburn , regurgitation non-cardiac chest pain use duration pH impedance monitoring . A blinded investigator interpret impedance pH record . The primary outcome average Demeester Score . For histopathology specimen fix 10 % formalin , embed paraffin section per standard clinical protocol . An expert pathologist review pathology specimen histological change , specifically elongation papilla , proliferation basal cell , eosinophilic infiltration dilate intercellular space . Following endoscopic evaluation , patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either twice daily proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy 8 week sucralfate slurry 1g four time day 8 week . The patient blind treatment receive . The patient contact phone ass symptom , medication compliance tolerance complete RDQ SF-36 week 4 . They see clinic 8 week follow-up visit study wrap . The 8 week visit standard care long investigator typically follow patient reflux symptom . The investigator also assess disease activity RDQ SF-36 visit well . Patients without adequate response medication offer cross alternative medication 4 week phone assessment 8 week clinic visit describe . The investigator plan enroll 40 patient site ( total 120 patient ) plan interim analysis first 30 patient complete protocol .</detailed_description>
