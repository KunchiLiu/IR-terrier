	<brief_summary>There preliminary study suggest radiation therapy area brain contain cancer stem cell ( addition area tumor surgically treat ) may help patient high-grade brain tumor live longer . The purpose study determine whether addition stem-cell radiation therapy standard chemoradiation improve outcome . The investigator collect information patient 's clinical status , disease control , neurocognitive effect , quality life follow-up department . The purpose study improve overall survival patient newly diagnose malignant brain tumor treat stem cell radiation therapy chemotherapy . The investigator also measure patient treat novel method radiation therapy time term disease control , potential neurocognitive side effect , overall function , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Radiotherapy Temozolomide Newly Diagnosed High-grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even optimal standard treatment , outcome patient suffer glioblastoma ( GB ) currently dismal , temozolomide add modest survival benefit high monetary cost accompany considerable toxicity . A possible explanation failure radiotherapy cure GB observation glioma cell migrate widely healthy bilateral brain tissue one focus origin . These isolated cell detect current radiological technique even image therefore usually include target volume radiotherapy . In present study investigator would like test hypothesis dose prescribe normal tissue stem cell niche adult brain influence effectiveness radiotherapy patient suffer HGG/GB niche may serve harbor radioresistant glioma stem cell , cell HGG believe able repopulate tumor . The hypothesis base previous report show adult normal tissue stem cell reside lateral periventricular region lateral ventricle animal study report transformation normal tissue stem cell differentiate cell lead tumor formation . This unique anatomical pattern brain clearly separate stem cell niche potential pool cancer stem cell ( CSC 's ) differentiate tissue make ideal model system study impact radiation dose give stem cell niche . Therefore , prospective , randomized clinical trial need address efficacy toxicity include CSC-containing subventricular region additional target volume treatment plan patient suffer HGG/GB . This intervention could dramatically improve outcome patient suffer progressive , relapse disease despite best effort currently .</detailed_description>
