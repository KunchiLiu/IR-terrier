	<brief_title>Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion vs. Usual Care Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Severe Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open , randomize , control , multicenter clinical investigation . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) patient within 14 day Enrolment Visit . Patients randomized oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) receive standard care ( SOC ) vitamin K antagonist treatment throughout 24 month clinical investigation period , manage primary care physician , goal achieve maintain INR 2-3 ( INR monitoring primary care physician every two week throughout study period ) . Patients randomized WATCHMAN device undergo device implantation within 48 hour screen TEE confirmation INR ≤ 1.7 catheterization laboratory subsequent hospitalization 24-48 hour . Concomitant treatment Aspirin/Clopidogrel ( manage patient 's primary care physician ) initiate day prior device implantation , continue 6 month procedure , time Clopidogrel discontinue ; administration Aspirin continue indefinitely . Follow-up visits patient take place Day 45 , Month 6 , Month 12 Month 24 ( End Study ) . Routine safety efficacy assessment visit patient regardless treatment group . Follow-up- visit day 45 , month 6 , 12 24 . Patients randomized WATCHMAN device additional TEE imaging perform Day 45 Month 6 visit . An independent Data Monitoring Committee monitor safety . A blinded independent Endpoint Committee evaluate end-points throughout entire study period .</detailed_description>
