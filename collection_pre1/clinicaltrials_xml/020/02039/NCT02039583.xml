	<detailed_description>Primary research question Has change number baby bear low birth weight die perinatal infant period follow 1 July 2007 introduction ban smoke public place England ? Study design Retrospective cohort study ( use prospective routinely collect health care data ) Study population All singleton birth England 1 January 1995 31 December 2011 . Intervention The intervention study ban smoke enclose public place workplace implement England overnight 1 July 2007 . Inclusion exclusion criterion We include registered singleton birth England occur 1 January 1995 31 December 2011 . This maximum time period surround ban 's introduction require birth data available data source . Data originally extract 1 January 1993 31 December 2011 . However , postcode record 1993-1994 , lead miss value Index Multiple Deprivation ( IMD ) quintile , region , urbanisation level period . As variable consider key potential confounders primary analysis , decision make restrict modelling time period 1 January 1995-31 December 2011. International Classification Disease ( ICD ) cod change version 9 10 January 2001 , lead important drop record SIDS case . Therefore , analyse SIDS restrict time period 2001-2011 . Babies chromosomal anomaly exclude . Outcome The primary outcome : - Low birth weight ( birth weight &lt; 2500 gram ) - Stillbirth ( intrauterine death 24+0 week gestation ) - Neonatal mortality ( death within first 28 day life ) - Sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ; death within first year life mention death certificate ICD-10-U code R95 , R99 specification ) To assess whether smoke-free legislation selective impact certain subgroup outcomes furthermore identified number secondary outcome : - Very low birth weight ( birth weight &lt; 1500 gram ) - Early neonatal mortality ( death within first week life ) - Late neonatal mortality ( death 7 28 day life ) - Post-neonatal mortality ( death 28 day 1 year life ) - Infant mortality ( death within first year life ) Data source Data obtain via Office National Statistics ( ONS ) . All register stillbirth livebirths occur England 1 January 1995 31 December 2011 include . These link death certificate death occur first birthday . Data extraction handle Individual perinatal mortality data link ONS single database include follow individual-level covariates : month birth , year birth , month death , year death , age death , sex , birth weight , maternal age , maternal marital status , parity , IMD , region , urbanisation level . The following covariates categorise information governance reason : - Age death : early neonatal , late neonatal , post-neonatal - Birth weight : &lt; 1000 gram , 1000-1499 gram , 1500-2499 gram , 2500-3999 gram , ≥4000 gram - Maternal age : &lt; 20 year , 20-24 year , 25-29 year , 30-34 year , 35-39 year , &gt; 40 year - Parity : 0 , 1 , 2 , ≥3 - IMD : quintiles - Region : 10 region - Urbanisation level : urban , rural Sample size Sample size calculation time-oriented analysis complicate give complexity model . We use national data current study , - best knowledge - large evaluation impact smoke-free legislation perinatal health , regard population size time span . As use maximum time span population available , sample size calculation way consider redundant . We aware one publish study smoke-free legislation early-life mortality ( reference 1 ) . Due design issue possible involve data study comparison current study . A number study previously assess impact smoke-free legislation low birth weight . Our propose approach best comparable perform earlier Scotland ( reference 2 ) . Using Scottish data 757,795 delivery occur 1996 2009 , show immediate -9.9 % ( 95 % CI -14.2 ; -5.2 ) drop low-birth-weight-babies . Given long study period ( 1993-2011 ) much large population size ( n &gt; 10 million ) study expect sufficient power detect similar reduction low-birth-weight-babies England , present . Statistical analysis Relevant population characteristic describe . Logistic regression analysis perform investigate association introduction smoke-free legislation sudden ( 'step ' ) and/or gradual ( 'slope ' ) change ( appropriate ) odds develop outcome . Analyses adjust birth weight , sex , maternal age , maternal marital status , parity ( secondary analysis , see ) , IMD quintile , region , urbanisation level . Seasonal pattern non-linearity underlying time trend account appropriate . Final model selection base Akaike 's Bayesian information criterion ( AIC BIC ) . The denominator analyse differ accord various outcome : - stillbirth : birth dataset - low birth weight , low birth weight , neonatal mortality , early neonatal mortality , infant mortality : livebirths dataset - late neonatal mortality : livebirths dataset survive early neonatal period - post-neonatal mortality : livebirths dataset survive neonatal period The primary analysis perform case complete data covariates . Parity variable &gt; 10 % miss data ( approximately 40-50 % ) , record married woman . As parity expect key confounder , perform primary analysis without involve parity model order maximise population size . Sensitivity analyse To assess possible confounding parity , sensitivity analysis perform include parity model . In second set sensitivity analysis , imputation perform investigate robustness finding miss data . In order minimise issue regard multiple testing , sensitivity analysis perform primary outcome . All analysis perform use Stata 12.0 .</detailed_description>
