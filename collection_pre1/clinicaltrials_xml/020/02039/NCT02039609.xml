	<brief_summary>In post-genomic era , major challenge health research understand complex interaction among genetic , environmental lifestyle factor include dietary intake . Unfortunately , initiative hamper lack accurate dietary intake assessment method large study . The newly emerge field metabolomics offer unique possibility characterize individual food intake , dietary pattern effect dietary intervention large study . The investigator propose develop platform detect broad metabolomic response food intake control trial well use target metabolomics approach characterize dietary intake longitudinal study . Our laboratory long history develop methodology assess nutritional status effect diet metabolism . Here , investigator team Sahlgrenska Academy Core Facility Swedish NMR Centre University Gothenburg , offer modern metabolomics equipment competence bioinformatics , use context nutrition research . To knowledge , investigator among first group country develop skill metabolomics assess dietary intake effect nutrition metabolism , probably first use two complementary platform mass-spectrometry nuclear magnetic spectroscopy . Hence , methodological result useful nutritional scientist nationally well internationally .</brief_summary>
