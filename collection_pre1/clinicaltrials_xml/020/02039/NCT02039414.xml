	<detailed_description>Exercise pregnancy associate delivery leaner , light , healthy infant ( Clapp 1990 , Clapp 2000 ) . Subsequently , high infant adiposity birth weight strong predictor childhood obesity adult adiposity ( Catalano 2006 , Danielzk 2002 ) . Therefore , maternal physical inactivity pregnancy may significant ramification child , effect may extend well adulthood . Exercise pregnancy also play important role health mother . Active pregnant woman tend gain less weight pregnancy ( Clapp 1995 ) retain less weight follow pregnancy ( O'Toole , 2003 ) . With excessive gestational weight gain strong risk factor maternal overweight obesity postpartum , well associate many adverse maternal neonatal metabolic outcome adiposity insulin resistance ( Heerwagen 2010 ) , impact exercise maternal neonatal outcome could substantial . The mechanisms underlying change poorly understood study strive expose critical . Habitual physical activity non-gravid individual show positively alter lipid metabolism increase fatty acid oxidation ( Martin 1996 ) , effect physical activity maternal lipid metabolism pregnancy study . Due previous research suggest alter intrauterine metabolic environment may play significant role fetal programming ( Heerwagen 2010 ) , reasonable believe improvement maternal lipid metabolism may contribute improved neonatal metabolic outcome exercise pregnant woman . Preliminary data group find obese lean pregnant woman , lipid oxidation rate significantly correlate offspring birth weight ; suggest maternal lipid metabolism may contribute neonatal metabolic outcome . In inactive pregnant woman , impaired lipid oxidative capacity conjunction know increase physiologic adipose tissue lipolysis occur pregnancy obesity would result excess un-oxidized plasma fatty acid likely re-esterified adipose tissue and/or deliver fetus . This series event may contribute increase maternal neonatal adiposity . In addition , generation excess reactive oxygen specie , know byproduct lipid metabolism , may contribute altered/abnormal oxidative stress profile obese pregnant woman . Reactive oxygen specie up-regulated physiologic pregnancy well non-gravid obesity , research suggest oxidative stress may relate poor neonatal outcome ( Heerwagen 2010 ) . In non-gravid individual , long-term physical activity show improve oxidative stress profile ( Fisher-Wellman 2009 ) . Therefore , woman exercise pregnancy may also high antioxidant capacity low marker oxidative stress ; may contribute favorable neonatal outcome . However , yet study . Obesity also believe adversely influence lipid metabolism , oxidative stress , neonatal outcomes pregnancy . Therefore , plan compare parameter obese active obese inactive pregnant woman . This study design allow u compare group order determine unfavorable maternal lipid metabolism oxidative stress profile , neonatal metabolic outcome ( adiposity insulin resistance ) attributable physical inactivity obesity . Previous research non-gravid adult suggest presence comorbidity correlate physical activity level body weight ( Blair 1989 , 1999 , Sui 2007 ) . This find contrary much previous literature pregnancy suggest `` obesity may common health risk develop fetus '' ( Heerwagen 2010 ) . Knowledge maternal lipid metabolism oxidative stress profile relationship neonatal outcomes active inactive pregnant woman guide lifestyle medical intervention design target factor may contribute poor outcome obese pregnancy . Currently , collect data lean , inactive pregnant woman use comparison end data collection . This first study examine relationship physical activity , lipid metabolism oxidative stress obese pregnancy . We anticipate result propose study demonstrate importance physically active lifestyle pregnancy ( irrespective body weight ) order maximize short long-term health neonate . In addition , hope result encourage obese overweight woman childbearing age remain become physically active demonstrate physical inactivity great effect poor neonatal outcome obesity . These finding unique much current literature focus negative impact maternal obesity neonatal outcome . Blair et al . consistently demonstrate non-gravid population physical inactivity strong predictor all-cause mortality obesity ( Blair 1989 , 1999 ) . Similarly , believe physical activity pregnancy important simply maintain healthy body weight improve neonatal outcomes . This idea novel innovative previously unexplored pregnancy pregnancy outcomes . In addition determine effect regular physical activity neonatal outcome , measure maternal lipid metabolism oxidative stress profile provide valuable knowledge mechanisms responsible improve outcome physically active pregnant woman . Also , measure maternal lipid metabolism oxidative stress profile exercise novel clinically insightful . This paradigm hold potential reveal alteration maternal metabolism and/or oxidative stress profile may detect measure factor rest . Additionally , measure metabolism oxidative stress exercise clinically useful provide information maternal metabolism activity mimic daily lifestyle task childcare , household chore , etc . ( ~3-5 METS ) . Thus , study design provide u valuable insight enhance understanding maternal lipid metabolism oxidative stress profile everyday lifestyle activity . METHODS Subjects : All woman seek pre-natal care Women 's Health Clinic Barnes Jewish Hospital/Washington University screen inclusion BMI history clinic . Subjects recruit late 2nd trim woman 's health clinic ask exercise habit . All patient meet criterion on-going pregnancy approach enrollment study . This study compare 2 group pregnant woman 30 35 week gestation . The first group inactive obese woman active obese woman . We recruit ~15 subject per group ( N=30 ) . Groups race-matched . Sample Size Calculation Data Pomeroy et al.in 2012 state use accelerometer measure physical activity air displacement plethysmography measure neonatal body composition ( measurement propose use ) , Spearman correlation coefficient show association maternal physical activity level neonatal fat free mass r=0.5226 . Using R-value alpha 0.05 , 30 total participant ( 15 per group ) need adequately power study .85 ( beta=.15 ) . Study Procedures : All study procedure perform Washington University School Medicine ( WUSM ) Institute Clinical Translational Sciences Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) . CRU Visit # 1 2 : Body composition Fitness Assessment ( 32-37 week gestation ) : Maternal Body Composition : A skin fold measurement perform determine maternal body composition ( % body fat ) . This do pressing fold skin 7 site caliper record thickness previously describe ( Jackson Pollock 1980 ) . Maternal Physical Fitness Levels : Maternal fitness level assess use submaximal cycle test recumbent bicycle . Subjects sit comfortably bicycle pedal properly adjust slight bend knee leg extend . They complete YMCA submaximal multistage cycle ergometer test accord ACSM 's guideline exercise test prescription ( Thompson 2010 ) . Sady colleague conclude VO2-Heart Rate extrapolation method precise way predict VO2max pregnancy ( 1985 ) . , YMCA test utilizes method . A 3-lead ECG apply monitor heart rate exercise test . Maternal Physical Activity Levels : Daily maternal physical activity assess week follow test use ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer ( ActiGraph LLC , Pensacola , FL ) order objectively measure daily physical activity level . ActiGraph data collect seven consecutive day non-dominant wrist 30 Hertz . Time spent sedentary active ( light , lifestyle , moderate , vigorous , vigorous ) activity calculate use algorithms Freedson colleague use ActiGraph software ( Freedson 1998 ) . We also measurement maternal physical activity level subjectively use Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire ( PPAQ ) . The PPAQ valid reliable instrument measure physical activity level pregnancy ( Chasan-Taber 2011 ) . Not PPAQ provide u additional detail activity level , allow u account activity actigraph may unable detect ( i.e . rid stationary bicycle ) . Dietary Intake Composition : In order account difference diet , subject complete National Institutes Health 's Dietary History Questionnaire II . This dietary assessment rigorously validate ( Subar 2001 ) widely use among many different population . Previous literature also demonstrate dietary history questionnaire valid reproducible among pregnant population ( Vioque 2013 ) . CRU Visit # 2 2 : Lipid metabolism exercise study ( 32-37 week gestation ) : After obtain height , weight , vitals , catheter ( IV ) place hand vein heat warm box prior blood draw . Participants rest approximately 30 minute prior measure lipid oxidation rate use indirect calorimetry ( True One 2400 , Parvo Medics , Sandy , UT ) . Participants lay supine hood device place head 15 minute measure oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production order determine lipid oxidation rate34 . After initial indirect calorimetry measurement take , basal blood collection obtain . Basal insulin glucose level use calculate maternal insulin resistance via homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) . After blood draw , participant exercise approximately 50 % predict VO2max ( base YMCA submaximal cycle test ) 30 minute recumbent cycle ergometer ( Lode Corvial , InMed , New South Wales , Australia ) . Blood collect various time point exercise . Indirect calorimetry ( use mouthpiece , nose clip , exercise version software ) also perform 2 minute time measure lipid oxidation total body oxygen consumption low-level exercise . After exercise termination , participant return supine position . Recovery blood draw take indirect calorimetry perform . Blood drawn different time point use measure glucose , insulin , free fatty acid , reactive oxygen specie ( F2- isoprostanes mass spectrometry ( also refer 8-iso-PGF2α ) ( Milne 2007 ) ) , total antioxidant capacity ( Total Antioxidant Capacity Assay ( TAC ) , Cell Biolabs , Inc. , San Diego , CA ) . All measurement help u good understand insulin resistance , oxidative stress , mechanism could contribute either condition . Parturition : At parturition , maternal weight measure gestational weight gain determine . Neonatal weight , length , head circumference also obtain . Infant HOMA-IR fatty acid delivery fetus determine measure umbilical cord plasma glucose , insulin , fatty acid concentration parturition . Within 48 hour delivery , neonatal body composition ( fat lean mass ) measure skin fold thickness measurement air displacement plethysmography ( Pea Pod , Life Measurement , Inc. , Concord , CA ) CRU WUSM . Statistical Analysis : Repeated measure ANOVA ( group x time ) use compare lipid oxidation rate oxidative stress profile 2 group pregnancy , , exercise . Pearson product moment correlation coefficient normally distribute variable Spearmen 's rank order coefficient non-normally distribute variable use examine relationship maternal lipid oxidation rate , plasma oxidative stress marker , neonatal metabolic outcome . We may also use regression analysis examine relationship maternal physical activity level obese woman neonatal body composition and/or insulin resistance ( similar do normal weight pregnant woman Pomeroy et al . 2012 ) .</detailed_description>
