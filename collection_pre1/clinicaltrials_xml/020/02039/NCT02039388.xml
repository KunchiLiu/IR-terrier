	<brief_title>Lavage Uterine Cavity Diagnosis Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term `` high grade serous carcinoma '' ( HGSC ) describe group ovarian , tubal peritoneal cancer aggressive biological behavior . HGSC lead cause death gynecologic malignancy western civilized country . Women affect , usually advanced stage disease metastatic spread throughout abdominal cavity time diagnosis . Five-year survival rate range 10 30 percent . The specificity current diagnostic tool ( CA-125 transvaginal ultrasonography ) low ineffective detecting HGSC early enough improve clinical outcome . Definitive diagnosis HGSC mostly rely surgical confirmation . These finding underline need effective test early detection HGSC . In general population , lifetime risk 1.5 percent . Women germ line mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene strong family history epithelial ovarian cancer carry high risk breast cancer and/or HGSC development . Familial inherit syndrome account approximately 13 percent case invasive epithelial ovarian fallopian tube cancer . The lifetime risk ovarian cancer 35 46 percent woman BRCA1 gene mutation 13 23 percent BRCA2 mutation . Again , even population high-risk HGSC , specificity CA-125 transvaginal ultrasonography still low ineffective improve clinical outcome . Over last year , increase scientific evidence conglomerate large proportion familial HGSC develop primarily line fallopian tube , resemble MÃ¼llerian epithelium . These precursor lesion call `` serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma '' ( STICs ) characterize p53 overexpression immunohistochemistry high Ki-67 labelling index indicate high proliferation index . In 90 percent , STICs carry mutation TP53 tumor suppressor gene . As today , risk reduce bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( rrBSO ) effective approach reduce risk HGSC high risk woman . Among woman increase risk HGSC ( BRCA mutation ) underwent rrBSO , 4 17 percent find STIC even invasive neoplasm , approximately 80 percent neoplasm ampullar part fallopian tube . Recent finding highlight malignant potential STICs . On histopathological specimen , intraluminal shed tumor cell STICs frequently demonstrate fallopian tube . This shed tumor cell STICs appear risk factor early transperitoneal metastasis frequently find HGSC . There strong clinical need screen STICs , since precursor lesion HGSC . These fact underline importance effective - non-invasive - test early detection STICs . The ovarian surface , fallopian tube , uterine cavity peritoneal cavity together form communicate compartment . The physiological function ciliated line tube transport egg uterine cavity ovulation thus make likely exfoliated cell STICs find uterine cavity . A promising approach detection STICs establish Paul Speiser Robert Zeillinger ( Molecular Oncology Group , Department General Gynaecology Gynaecologic Oncology , Medical University Vienna , Austria ) . This approach call ALPINE technique ( Austrian Lavage Procedure Detection tubal Intraepithelial Neoplasms ) ( manuscript preparation ) . To facilitate quick easy lavge uterine cavity proximal tube , special catheter develop ( MEDICOPLAST , MF 13005 , cathter uterine tubal lavage ) . The ALPINE technique include lavage uterine cavity proximal fallopian tube subsequent analysis lavage fluid presence pre-malignant malignant cell . For proof principle tumor cell ovarian cancer shed find lavage uterine cavity , uterine lavage collect surgical intervention suspect ovarian malignancy institution Catholic University Leuven , Division Gynaecological Oncology , Belgium . After malignancy confirm , genetic change TP53 KRAS gene determine tumor tissue . In set 9 epithelial ovarian cancer patient ( EOC ) 1 ovarian metastasis signet ring carcinoma , presence genetic change examine lavage sample , use digital droplet PCR ( ddPCR ) . 10 genetic change identify tumor tissue patient 9/10 ( 90 % ) change detect corresponding lavage specimen . Furthermore , filter approach , follow p53 immunofluorescence stain establish , confirm presence tumor cell lavage sample one additional patient . In next step , lavage sample 23 ovarian carcinoma patient , applicable correspond tumor tissue , analyse deep sequencing group Bert Vogelstein ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , USA ) . The presence genetic change , indicative ovarian cancer , could confirm 18/23 ( 78.3 % ) lavage specimen include , early advanced stage . These result proof ovarian cancer cell shed fallopian tube uterine cavity , collect ALPINE technique . The fact ovarian cancer cell detect high sensitivity lavage uterine cavity proximal tube show approach potential early diagnosis . Therefore , investigator confident method could apply detection premalignant change high risk patient , well . Aim study : The current study aim answer scientific question , whether exfoliated cell STICs get transport uterine cavity via fallopian tube , whether possible detect cell lavage fluid uterine cavity proximal fallopian tube . Methods : To address question , investigator study 20 lavage sample 20 correspond STIC-positive tissue sample woman opt rrBSO increase risk HGSC ( mostly carry BRCA mutation ) , without history tubal occlusion sterilization . Women opt fallopian tube remove ovary preserve eligible study , woman opt rrBSO plus hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
