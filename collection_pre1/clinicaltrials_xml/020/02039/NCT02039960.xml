	<detailed_description>There two primary objective study , follow : 1 ) examine number bupropion report time within DAWN database describe number DAWN report prescription drug 2 ) examine number report bupropion , stratify demographic , route administration , disposition patient . If sample size permit , evaluation disposition patient expose bupropion time Emergency Department ( ED ) visit conduct . DAWN public health surveillance system report drug-related visit hospital Emergency Departments ( ED ) . DAWN use monitor trend drug misuse abuse , identify emergence new substance drug combination , assess health hazard associate drug use abuse , estimate impact drug use , misuse , abuse United States ' health care system . DAWN 's target sample frame consist non-Federal , short-stay , general medical surgical hospital United States one EDs open 24 hour day . DAWN employ multistage sample design selection EDs analysis . Stratified simple random sample oversampling select metropolitan area use select hospital . A DAWN case ED visit involve recent drug use . DAWN case identify review ED medical record participate hospital . DAWN capture ED visit directly cause drug drug contribute factor direct cause ED visit . These criterion encompass type drug-related event , include accidental ingestion adverse reaction , well drug misuse abuse .

The study population include patient age present emergency department drug-related cause . The DAWN visit eligibility criterion intend broad inclusive exception . They take account fact documentation medical record varies clarity completeness across hospital among clinician within hospital . The criterion design minimize potential DAWN Reporter judgment could cause data vary systematically unexpectedly across different data collector hospital . In addition , criterion allow capture diverse set drug-related visit aggregate disaggregated serve variety analytical purpose interest multiple audience . There variable within DAWN dataset . For analysis , variables interest group follow category : year visit , age , sex , race , reason presentation emergency department , case type , drug , route administration , toxicology confirm , result treatment ED .
