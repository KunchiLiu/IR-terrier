	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether vigorous exercise training 4-5 days/week 2 year sedentary middle age men woman ( age 45-64 ) improve cardiac vascular compliance degree equivalent life-long exerciser sedentary young . Sedentary age associate impaired diastolic function , lead heart failure . However , exercise training implement early enough life cardiovascular plasticity still exist , functional capacity maintain , prevent heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Chronic physical inactivity contributes deaths nearly 1 10 Americans . In senior , single common life-threatening disease congestive heart failure patient , abnormality diastolic function play critical role pathophysiology disease . The primary investigator 's previous research demonstrate : ) healthy sedentary age lead atrophy stiffen heart reduce myocardial chamber compliance ; b ) contrast , highly competitive senior athlete cardiac compliance indistinguishable healthy young individual suggest lifelong exercise training prevent stiffening ; c ) even prolong intense exercise training start age 65 fail reverse age-related cardiac vascular stiffening ; ) cardiac stiffen begin middle age ( 45-64 ) substantially prevent train 4-5 days/wk . The primary objective project , therefore identify sedentary individual age 45-64 , initiate exercise program carefully design maximize effect cardiovascular compliance function . After aim accomplish , establish novel , practical exercise training strategy design prevent cardiovascular stiffen aging , improve functional capacity age population , ultimately prevent Heart failure preserve Ejection Fraction . Such determination would enormous public health significance since condition quite difficult treat establish . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize exercise training implement 4-5 times/week 2 yr sedentary middle age men woman ( 45-64yr ) improve cardiac vascular compliance degree equivalent life-long exerciser ( sedentary young ) . The investigator perform invasive non-invasive assessment cardiovascular structure function exercise program involve high intensity aerobic interval , low intensity endurance ( `` base training '' ) , strength training . Specific Aim : To test hypothesis , two group previously sedentary subject , age 45-64 2 year , follow intervention : 1 ) subject undergo prolonged endurance/interval/strength exercise training ; 2 ) yoga/balance control . A comprehensive set `` Baseline Testing '' ( prior two year intervention ) `` Follow-up Testing '' ( two year intervention ) take place assess effect intervention . This test include submaximal maximal exercise test well comprehensive invasive ( right heart catheterization ) non-invasive ( ultrasound ) measure cardiac mechanic , relaxation morphology . From data , follow index diastolic systolic function generate : Starling pressure/volume curve ; calculation leave ventricle wall stress strain ; measurement flow propagation velocity , ejection fraction relaxation velocity .</detailed_description>
