	<brief_summary>In multicenter project , introduce AWARE ( electronic interface ) Using cloud-based technology . The goal project improve compliance best practice use new acute care interface built-in tool error prevention , practice surveillance reporting ( ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based Electronic System : Ambient Warning Response Evaluation ) .The goal project develop test novel acute care interface built-in tool error prevention , practice surveillance , decision support reporting ( ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based Electronic System : Ambient Warning Response Evaluation ) . In preliminary study , novel informatics support build advanced understanding cognitive organizational ergonomics , significantly decrease cognitive load bedside provider reduce medical error . Using cloud-based technology , AWARE uniformly available either mobile fix compute device apply standardized manner medical surgical ICUs five geographically diverse acute care hospital predominantly serve Medicare Medicaid patient . The impact ProCCESs AWARE process care outcome study ICUs ; expect enroll 10,000 critically ill patient study period .</brief_summary>
