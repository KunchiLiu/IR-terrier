	<brief_summary>Recent research show classify patient low back pain treatment subgroup result well improvement treat patient low back pain . However , physical therapist may use different type information determine classify patient . One method use patient characteristic show research predict good result certain type treatment . Another method use specific impairment physical therapist identifies clinical exam determine treatment provide . It currently know one method well . The purpose study determine research-based classification impairment-based treatment effective treat patient low back pain last less 90 day term improvement pain disability . The result study may help reduce high financial cost associate low back pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Different Methods Physical Therapy Treat Acute Subacute Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose study describe multimodal impairment-based clinical model treatment low back pain utilizing concept Regional Interdependence ( Wainner et al 2007 ) determine relative effectiveness model versus classification-based therapy use Treatment-Based Classification System acute subacute low back pain ( Delitto et al 1995 , Fritz et al 2006 , Fritz et al 2007 ) term improvement pain disability 4 week 6 month . BACKGROUND : Recent study show subclassifying patient low back pain treatment group result well outcomes treat patient low back pain homogenous group . ( Fritz et al 2003 ) However , study directly compare efficacy impairment-based versus classification-based physical therapy patient acute subacute low back pain . HYPOTHESIS : We suspect method treatment effective , uncertain one effective . Therefore , null hypothesis method equally effective . METHODS : 1 . Patients refer physical therapy Hendricks Regional Health Plainfield , IN screen eligibility . Eligible participant offer opportunity voluntarily participate research study . Those patient eligible interested receive inform consent form approve Hendricks Regional Health Institutional Review Board . 2 . All subject complete standard intake form self-report measure . The principal investigator obtain subjective history patient perform standardize baseline physical examination . 3 . After baseline examination , subject randomize block 4 , 6 , 8 use conceal , computer-generated randomization sequence access electronically Microsoft Excel spreadsheet use VLOOKUP function return group assignment subject number enter . 4 . All subject group treat principal investigator two time per week two week follow per week two week ( total 6 visit ) regardless treatment group assignment . All subject receive standardize education well additional individualize education deem appropriate treating clinician . Subjects give home exercise program consisting exercise perform physical therapy ask perform exercise twice per day . 5 . Patients impairment-based group treat use multi-modal treatment approach utilize manual therapy thoracolumbosacral spine hip well motor control exercise . Patients classification-based group categorize subgroup accord previously describe Treatment-Based Classification ( TBC ) Algorithm treat accordingly . 6 . After completion 6 visit , intend discharge patient home exercise program . However , patient require few visit still include intention-to-treat analysis . Patients encourage perform home exercise least 3 time per week 6 month follow . 7 . Primary secondary outcome measure collect 4 week 6 month baseline . DATA ANALYSIS : Study data analyze use SPSS Statistical Software ( IBM , Armonk , NY ) . 1 . Baseline characteristic examine group difference . 2 . Primary outcome analyze use repeat measure analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) examine group x time interaction pain disability baseline , 4 week , 6 month control baseline covariates Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire physical activity subscale score ( FABQpa ) , duration symptom , prior history low back pain . Median range value calculate Global Rating Change 4 week 6 month . Primary outcome measure also dichotomize combined order determine overall treatment success 4 week 6 month follow ups . 3 . Intention-to-treat analysis use multiple imputation account miss value use analysis . A secondary per-protocol analysis perform patient complete exactly 6 visit , perform home exercise program least 6 time per week , complete outcome time point .</detailed_description>
