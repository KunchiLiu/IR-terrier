	<brief_summary>This current study use new treatment approach base patient 's tumor genomic profiling consist whole genome sequencing , exome analysis , RNA sequence well predictive modeling . This new treatment strategy show promising result adult patient solid tumor . The current study test feasibility specialize Tumor Board assign treatment plan within 35 calendar day obtain tumor tissue . The treatment plan take consideration patient 's tumor molecular profile predictive modeling well prior history treatment ( ) , medical condition patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Testing Feasibility Molecular Profiling Recurrent/Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recurrent glioblastoma candidate surgery clinical management tumor tissue take time surgery . Tissue sample obtain contrast edge well infiltrate margin . Circulating tumor DNA also take blood sample , surgery every 2 month . Genomic profile tumor tissue perform Molecular Tumor Board review profile within 28 35 day surgery . If specific potential target amenable treatment , treatment recommendation make . Up 4 drug could suggest treat physician . The patient treat physician may may choose use recommendation . Any drug US Pharmacopeia may choose . If treatment suggest give , patient follow toxicity efficacy , include progression survival . If treatment give , patient follow progression survival .</detailed_description>
