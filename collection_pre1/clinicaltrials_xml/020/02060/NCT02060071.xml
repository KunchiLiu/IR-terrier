	<brief_title>Endothelial Progenitors Aortic Stenosis : Association With Aortic Stenosis Progression Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Degenerative aortic valve ( AV ) stenosis ( AS ) common valvular disease increase prevalence age . Severe aortic valve stenosis account considerable disease death , especially old patient . Aortic valve stenosis primary indication valve replacement western country , number increase elderly people grow subpopulation . Measures identify AV disease earlier , identify factor influence disease progression treat AV disease pharmacologically less invasive approach would significant improvement current standard care . These advance possible well understanding mechanism underlie valve development disease . Preliminary data suggest novel pathophysiological concept impair valvular endothelial cell regeneration , lead progression age-associated calcific AV disease potential treatment target disrupt endothelial cell layer valve leaflet . The research objectives : 1 . To assess number function endothelial progenitor cell apoptotic endothelial progenitor cell patient mild , moderate severe aortic stenosis . 2 . To study association aortic stenosis progression , severity , symptom leave ventricular function number function circulate endothelia progenitor cell . By understand correlation valve severity , leave ventricular longitudinal function endothelial progenitor cell indentify high risk patient population need early intervention . We hope add new information pathogenesis aortic stenosis indentify factor predict disease progression .</detailed_description>
