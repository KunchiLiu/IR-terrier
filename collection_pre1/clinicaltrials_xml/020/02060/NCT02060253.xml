	<brief_title>Ganetespib , Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab Pertuzumab Metastatic Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ganetespib give paclitaxel , trastuzumab , pertuzumab treat patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive ( HER2+ ) breast cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advance ) return period improvement ( metastatic ) . HER2+ describe cancer cell much protein call HER2 surface . In normal cell , HER2 help control cell growth . When make large normal amount cancer cell , cell may grow quickly likely spread part body . Ganetespib may stop growth tumor cell block protein need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab pertuzumab , bind HER2+ cancer cell may kill . Giving ganetespib paclitaxel , trastuzumab , pertuzumab may better treatment patient HER2+ breast cancer . This phase I study two part . During first part study , patient HER2+ MBC receive trastuzumab combination ganetespib paclitaxel evaluate safety , toxicity maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) triplet regimen . There dose escalation ganetespib . Paclitaxel trastuzumab administer standard dos without escalation . Part 1 ongoing . During second part study , pertuzumab standard dose add triplet regimen ganetespib , paclitaxel trastuzumab , use MTD ganetespib determine part one . The MTD ganetespib safety four-drug regimen evaluate . The MTD ganetespib combination paclitaxel trastuzumab 150 mg/m2 .</detailed_description>
