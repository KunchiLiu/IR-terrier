	<brief_summary>Background : Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) reduce pain inflammation inhibit cyclooxygenase , enzyme pathway formation prostaglandins thromboxane . Prior study prove role ibuprofen ( NSAID ) modulate lung injury decrease pulmonary damage cystic fibrosis . While intense effort scientific community define best treatment strategy tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( TB-IRIS ) , knowledge available study evaluate preventive strategy use anti-inflammatory agent TB-IRIS , highly morbid complication HIV-infected TB patient initiate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Design Methods : We propose conduct single center double-blind placebo-controlled randomize trial investigate efficacy daily self-administered Meloxicam ( NSAID ) versus placebo prevention Tuberculosis associate Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome ( TB-IRIS ) . A total 150 HIV-infected adult treat Tuberculosis least 2 week initiate HIV treatment Brewelskloof Hospital , Worcester , Tygerberg Teaching Hospital , Cape Town , randomize one follow treatment : Meloxicam 7.5 mg tablet once-a-day , experimental arm , versus Placebo tablet once-a-day , control arm , 8 week . All patient follow 12 month . Primary efficacy outcome : The decrease incidence paradoxical TB IRIS least 20 % ; Primary safety outcome : The proportion patient temporarily permanently discontinue Meloxicam due adverse event ( e.g . dyspepsia gastro-intestinal upset ) . Secondary outcome : 1 ) proportion patient arm following indicator TB-IRIS severity/quality life ( QOL ) ( degree pain discomfort &gt; III , presence local disseminate suppuration/abscess site , unscheduled clinic visit , hospitalization , miss day work , etc ; 2 ) The incidence type IRIS ( e.g . Kaposi Sarcoma cryptococcal meningitis ) . This study provide important novel data feasibility efficacy use cheap , widely available NSAID use developed develop country , preventive intervention TB-IRIS could quickly put practice proven effective</brief_summary>
