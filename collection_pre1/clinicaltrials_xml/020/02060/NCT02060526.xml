	<brief_summary>Sanfilippo syndrome Type A , Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) IIIA , rare lysosomal storage disease cause deficiency enzyme heparan N-sulfatase ( sulfamidase ) . In absence enzyme , accumulation glycosaminoglycan , heparan sulfate , result progressive neurodegeneration . Symptoms usually first note 1st 2nd year life , although definitive diagnosis often delay , average age diagnosis 4.5 year . The disease characterize developmental delay initially , follow neurological developmental arrest , regression . These developmental deficit typically associate severe behavioral disturbance . Patients significantly reduce lifespan , survive beyond 2nd 3rd decade . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy recombinant human heparan-N-sulfatase ( rhHNS ) pediatric patient Early Stage Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III A Disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Controlled , Open-label , Multicenter , Safety Efficacy Study rhHNS Administration Via IDDD Pediatric Patients With Early Stage MPS IIIA Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No effective , disease-modifying therapy currently approve treatment devastate disable disease . Shire Human Genetic Therapies ( Shire HGT ) develop enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) recombinant human heparan-N-sulfatase ( rhHNS ) patient MPS IIIA . rhHNS administer cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device ( IDDD ) , administer intravenously ( IV ) cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . This study evaluate effect 48 week rhHNS treatment clinical course MPS IIIA , use cognitive function primary outcome measure . The trial evaluate 2 dosing regimen rhHNS administer via IDDD comparison treatment control group . Patients randomize 1:1:1 either treatment group treatment group . Treatment administer open-label manner . The safety tolerability profile rhHNS continue evaluate study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient must meet follow criterion enrol study . 1 . Documented MPS IIIA diagnosis 2 . Age ≥12 month ≤48 month 3 . The patient DQ score ≥60 % 4 . The patient medically stable , opinion Investigator , able accommodate protocol requirement , include travel , assessment , IDDD surgery , without place undue burden patient/patient 's family 5 . The patient 's parent ( ) legally authorize representative ( ) must voluntarily sign dated Independent Ethics Committeeapproved inform consent form relevant aspect study explain discussed patient 's parent ( ) , legally authorize representative ( ) . Consent patient 's parent ( ) legally authorize representative ( ) must obtain prior start study procedure . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study . 1 . The presence significant nonMPS IIIA relate CNS impairment behavioral disturbance would confound scientific integrity interpretation study assessment , determine Investigator . 2 . The presence least one S298P mutation SGSH , associate attenuated disease OR documentation S298P mutation sibling affected MPS IIIA , provide parental consent obtain use information . 3 . The presence relatively attenuate MPS IIIA disease old sibling , define preservation speech beyond age 10 year . 4 . Visual hearing impairment sufficient , clinical judgment investigator , preclude cooperation neurodevelopmental testing . Use hearing aid permit . 5 . In opinion Investigator , patient assess unacceptably high risk anesthesia due airway compromise , drug hypersensitivity , condition ( neuroleptic malignant syndrome , malignant hyperthermia , anesthesiarelated concern ) . 6 . The patient history poorly control seizure disorder . 7 . The patient currently receive psychotropic medication , Investigator 's opinion would likely substantially confound test result . 8 . The patient history bleed disorder unable abstain medication , opinion investigator , place risk bleed follow surgery LP . 9 . The patient participate clinical trial another investigational medicinal product , within 30 day prior study ( within 5 elimination half live investigational product ) , currently enrol another study involve investigational drug device . NOTE : Nutritional supplement , include genistein permit take administered outside context formal investigation . 10 . The patient receive hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplant , gene therapy . 11 . The patient condition contraindicate described SOPHAPORT Mini SIDDD 12 . The patient 's parent ( ) patient 's legally authorize representative ( ) is/are unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study , do/does agree comply protocol define schedule assessment . 13 . The patient unable comply protocol ( eg , clinically relevant medical condition make implementation protocol difficult , unstable social situation , otherwise unlikely complete study ) , opinion Investigator , otherwise unsuited study . 14 . The patient item ( brace , tattoo , etc . ) would exclude patient able undergo MRI accord local Institutional Policy , patient situation would exclude patient undergoing procedure require study .</criteria>
