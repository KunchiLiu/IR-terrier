	<brief_summary>In experience , woman severe pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) frequently bothersome nocturia . The International Continence Society ( ICS ) define nocturia `` wake night one time void . '' Though nocturia may secondary obstruct bladder emptying , investigator hypothesize woman compression bilateral ureter due prolapse pelvic organ day subsequent relief prolapse patient lay supine overnight result nighttime post-obstructive diuresis ( inability concentrate urine ) resultant large nighttime urine volume nocturia . Previous case report propose vaginal uterine vault prolapse cause obstruction due descent bladder floor lead compression bilateral ureter uterus border genital opening . No large prospective study , however , evaluate possible impact phenomenon patient possible post-operative change follow surgical correction POP . Using Nocturnal Enuresis , Sleep interruption Questionnaire ( NNES-Q ) , void diary , urine study , investigator aim evaluate pre-operative post-operative voiding habit urinary parameter woman severe pelvic organ prolapse bothersome nocturia undergo colpocleisis . Colpocleisis procedure surgically obliterate vaginal lumen treat severe POP properly counsel patient &gt; 90 % satisfaction rate . Other treatment offer woman , laparoscopic open sacrocolpopexy , uterosacral ligament suspension , sacrospinous ligament suspension , also offer high rate success . The investigator aim determine whether surgical correction severe pelvic organ prolapse , define either colpocleisis , laparoscopic open sacrocolpopexy , uterosacral ligament suspension , sacrospinous ligament suspension , result improvement and/or resolution nocturia post-obstructive diuresis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Severe Pelvic Organ Prolapse Post-Obstructive Diuresis ( SOPPO ) Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Significance Clinical Relevance Project : Numerous woman undergo pelvic organ prolapse surgery every year . The common reason surgical management POP include symptom immediately related prolapsing organ , pelvic pressure , vaginal bulge sensation , vaginal mucosal irritation , well defecatory dysfunction , limitation sexual intercourse , aesthetic dissatisfaction . When counsel patient possible surgical management POP , clinician would remiss address potential quality life improvement surgery may provide urinary standpoint , well possible decrease risk renal failure . Stress urge incontinence urinary urgency frequently alleviate restoration pelvic floor support , however , nocturia may treat well . 2 . Relevant Research Others : Several case report exist describe urinary obstruction , bilateral hydronephrosis , acute chronic renal failure occur severe pelvic organ prolapse . No large scale prospective descriptive study exist , however , demonstrate urinary symptom pathophysiology behind urinary tract obstruction may accompany pelvic organ prolapse . Also , prospective study exist evaluate improvement symptom relief physiologic obstruction surgical correction pelvic organ prolapse . 3 . Methods/Materials : Women refer urogynecology clinic management apical Stage III-IV POP bothersome nocturia note initial urogynecologic evaluation opt surgical management identify inclusion study . In addition routine urogynecologic pre-operative work-up , consent study , ask complete pre- post-operative Nocturia , Nocturnal Enuresis , Sleep interruption Questionnaires ( NNES-Q ) ( appendix ) , void diary ( appendix ) , awake asleep renal nocturia urine panel . Women serve pre- post-operative control subject . Enrolled patient educate perform void diary awake asleep renal nocturia urine panel . The void diary require patient measure date , time , void urine amount ( use urine hat place toilet ) , degree incontinence ( dry , moist , soak ) , presence absence urge urinate , activity immediately prior urination episode , fluid intake three non-consecutive twenty-four hour period . The awake asleep renal nocturia urine panel require patient collect urine output two laboratory provide basins one twenty-four hour period . The `` renal nocturia , awake '' urine panel obtain urine collect 0600-1800 . The `` renal nocturia , asleep '' urine panel obtain urine collect 1800-0600 , ie follow day . Six thirteen week post-operatively , enrol patient ask repeat NNES-Q questionnaire , void diary , awake asleep renal nocturia urine panel describe . Patients complete aforementioned questionnaire study reimburse $ 25 check . This compensation disclose potential study candidate prior enrollment study . The data obtain de-identified entered SPSS v. 20 software statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
