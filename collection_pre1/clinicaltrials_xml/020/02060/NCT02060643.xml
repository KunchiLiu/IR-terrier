	<brief_summary>Some patient head neck cancer benign tumour head neck receive radiotherapy neck part treatment . The carotid artery often include radiotherapy collateral structure . There evidence show radiotherapy blood vessel result thicken artery wall year treatment increase risk stroke TIA future . Current research aim towards detect radiotherapy-related change carotid artery earlier stage towards use new radiotherapy technique avoid treat blood vessel possible . The question whether use preventive medicine like aspirin cholesterol-lowering tablet help reverse process currently unanswered . The aim study measure thickness ( intima-medial thickness ) irradiate carotid artery wall compare unirradiated artery . There many cause thicken artery ( high blood pressure , high cholesterol level diabetes ) may affect ability measure effect radiotherapy change artery wall . In order address , ideal look process patient one side neck treat use side comparison . The study also look earlier sign radiotherapy-related change , stiffen artery wall , inflammation artery wall ( early sign radiotherapy-related change ) marker blood may indicate process take place . The null hypothesis study : - In irradiated carotid artery , mean intimal-medial thickness compare unirradiated artery . - Serum biomarkers elevate radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis . - Development radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis affect risk factor modulation ( Aspirin , HMGCoA reductase inhibitor , smoke cessation ) . - There difference carotid arterial wall strain irradiate carotid artery versus unirradiated carotid artery . - Microbubble ultrasound able detect Inflammation carotid artery early marker atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>
