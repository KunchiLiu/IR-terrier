	<brief_summary>Urinary urgency key symptom overactive bladder ( OAB ) . A critical barrier understand OAB lack method separate urgency derive directly bladder filling term `` tension sensor output '' urgency derive abnormal brain interpretation . The central hypothesis measureable biomechanical parameter directly affect output ( urgency ) detrusor tension sensor . The development novel cystometric test improve diagnosis treatment OAB potential identification novel mechanistic target pathophysiology OAB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . Validate Urgency Meter quantify urgency-volume relationship . Test hypothesis tension sensor output urinary urgency objectively measure reflect input filling volume . Aim 2 . Quantify bladder geometry-urgency relationship . Test hypothesis bladder geometry ( wall thickness , surface area , shape ) affect load detrusor tension sensor reflect objective change output urgency . Aim 3 . Quantify dynamic compliance-urgency relationship . Test hypothesis dynamic compliance ( strain-history activation-history dependent compliance ) affect load detrusor tension sensor reflect objective change output urgency . Aim 4 . Quantify spontaneous rhythmic contraction-urgency relationship . Test hypothesis spontaneous rhythmic contraction affect load detrusor tension sensor reflect objective change output urgency . Urinary urgency key symptom Overactive Bladder ( OAB ) occur fill phase micturition , increase detrusor wall tension think critical factor pathophysiology OAB . However , pressure increase little bladder fill reflect change detrusor wall tension , true fill phase physiology evaluate clinical cystometrics . Thus , objective assessment OAB use standard clinical cystometric test difficult impossible . Furthermore , evaluation OAB use verbal sensory threshold recommend International Continence Society subjective poorly define . Thus , press need mechanistically relevant diagnostic test OAB incorporate objective metric direct evaluation detrusor wall tension . Using system model fill phase micturition , detrusor smooth muscle in-series tension sensitive afferent nerve represent tension sensor definable input ( volume ) , objectively measurable output ( urgency ) , objectively measurable biomechanical parameter affect load tension sensor . Based previous investigation work others , identify follow biomechanical parameter directly affect load detrusor tension sensor filling : bladder geometry , dynamic compliance , spontaneous rhythmic contraction . In current proposal , develop novel cystometric test assess bladder geometry , dynamic compliance , spontaneous rhythmic contraction fill phase micturition . Our new cystometrics include 1 ) slide scale Urgency Meter allow patient continuously record tension sensor output urgency , 2 ) two three dimensional bladder ultrasonography provide real-time measurement bladder geometry use measure effect geometry use dynamic compliance calculation , 3 ) Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) analysis objectively measure fill phase spontaneous rhythmic contraction These new metric provide quantitative mechanistic link OAB symptomatology detrusor function , use new metric identify tension-mediated non-tension mediate sub-groups OAB . In proposal , central hypothesis , measurable biomechanical parameter directly affect output ( urgency ) detrusor tension sensor , test clinical experiment involve accelerated hydration , abbreviate cystometrics , repeat-fill cystometrics , extended-hold cystometrics . Successful completion multi-PI proposal involve combine skill set neuro-urologist mechanical engineer allow development novel cystometric test improve diagnosis treatment OAB potential identification novel mechanistic target pathophysiology OAB .</detailed_description>
