	<brief_title>Phase II Study Comparing LR-GEM R-GEM-P Second-line Treatment Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( LEGEND )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary To assess complete response rate LR-GEM ( lenalidomide , rituximab , gemcitabine methylprednisolone ) R-GEM-P ( rituximab , gemcitabine , cisplatin methylprednisolone ) follow 3 cycle induction treatment secondline therapy patient Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma . To investigate arm : - Overall response rate follow 3 cycle induction treatment evaluate IWG 2007 criterion - Event-free survival - Overall survival - Rate successful stem cell harvest - Toxicity - Subgroup analyse perform primary endpoint cell-of-origin immunohistochemical subtype use Choi method [ 2 ] ( GCB vs non-GCB ) , morphological subtype ( centroblastic v immunoblastic v ) , IPI ( 0-1 v ³2 ) , previous response treatment ( £12 v &gt; 12 month ) , eligibility ASCT randomisation . Treatment : LR-GEM : lenalidomide plus rituximab , gemcitabine methylprednisolone every 28 day . R-GEM-P : rituximab , gemcitabine , methylprednisolone cisplatin every 28 day . Assessment Schedule : - Patients review baseline prior schedule dose treatment toxicity - Radiological tumour assessment do contrast-enhanced CT scan 1st 3rd cycle arm . - PET/CT scan perform baseline upon completion induction treatment ( 3-4 week last dose chemotherapy ) . If PET/CT scan perform contrast-enhanced CT , patient need separate CT scan . - Follow completion induction treatment 3 monthly interval first 12 month Arm A monthly interval first 12 month patient Arm B . Thereafter follow Arm A B 6 monthly interval 2 year , annually 5 year total . - CT scan 3 &amp; 12 month post induction treatment arm - Following disease progression patient follow survival every 3 month death</detailed_description>
