	<brief_summary>Military service member U.S. veteran population face grow serious health threat : widespread antibiotic resistance result resistant bacteria dwindle pipe-line sufficiently potent antibiotic . Infections antibiotic resistant bacteria increase significantly . They cause major complication mortality , drive healthcare cost . Powerful non-targeted antibiotic , widespread use , actually pressure bacteria develop resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Accuracy New Diagnostic Technology Determine Guide Rapid Antibiotic Treatment Serious Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current method diagnose infection typically require 2-3 day produce result guide antibiotic choice . That frequently delay help clinician make good treatment decision . This also result inappropriate over-treatment non-targeted antibiotic start await lab result . More rapid technology accurately diagnose specific cause infection could guide early , targeted antibiotic treatment . This would result effective early treatment infection , decrease unnecessary exposure excess antibiotic , could slow development antibiotic resistance . By diagnose infection earlier , expect reduce complication mortality combat-related infection Wounded Warriors Military Veterans . We propose new ultra-rapid technology ( call MADM ) use digital microscope detect bacteria grow directly patient 's specimen , rather wait growth lab culture . The innovative new method support identification infect bacteria within 2 hour receive specimen . The technology also show effect select antibiotic bacteria include multidrug resistant bacteria doctor know within 6 hour specimen collection antibiotic kill bacteria . This study involve collection excess volume microbiology specimen determine sufficient sample available clinical care . All microbiological sample result obtain solely non-research purpose part usual care ; leftover/discarded material clinical research procedure already perform use study . Samples test tandem usual care new technology test accuracy speed . Results obtain new technology use patient care make treatment decision .</detailed_description>
