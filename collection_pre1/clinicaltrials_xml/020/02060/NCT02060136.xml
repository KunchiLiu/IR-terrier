	<brief_summary>Urinary diary prove beneficial assess low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) , however achieve widespread acceptance . The likely reason fact pen paper diary labor intensive patient ( need carry pen paper record event ) doctor ( need transfer , summarize analyze data ) . Hypothesis : Electronic voiding diary , would automate record analysis data , expedite process , improve accuracy cost effectiveness . Electronic record low urinary tract symptom ( SUF ) use wireless phone web base technology record LUTS remotely store data secure website access doctor patient whenever need .

A dedicated server run program , automatically process incoming data . All data record individual store prospectively , separate file , secure website .

Quality life ( QoL ) evaluate use International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) Questionnaire , two standardized question : Quality Life due Urinary Symptoms ( QoL US ) Patient Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) . Time frame : Participants follow duration study consist two three day period every micturition event low urinary tract symptom associate micturition record . An expected average time 6 day .

After sign informed consent , patient ask record every micturition degree urgency use SUF period 3 day . They ask record frequency micturition degree every episode urgency use pen paper MC equal length time . The efficacy record LUTS method analyze compare . The content validity SUF ( assessment whether instrument make sense patient ) , assess conclusion study patient interview one-on-one specialized research nurse . Patients ask state preference one two diary , disclose number event forget could record . The construct validity ( relationship record data underlie theory ) evaluate correlation symptom record SUF MC base QoL measure . The result study compare previously publish evidence , suggest severe LUTS associate low score health relate QoL questionnaire .</detailed_description>
