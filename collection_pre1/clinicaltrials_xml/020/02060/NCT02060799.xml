	<brief_summary>Braunwald define dyspnoea abnormally uncomfortable awareness breathing . Breathing discomfort , vary degree severity , one disturbing symptom patient experience ; one main complaint patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) . Dyspnea variety underlie etiology , like cardiac , pulmonary metabolic etiology combination , since several disease cause dyspnea like instance heart failure ( HF ) , asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Acute heart failure syndrome ( AHFS ) collectively define gradual rapid change heart failure ( HF ) sign symptom result need urgent therapy . Heart failure ( HF ) one important cause morbidity mortality industrialize world . The prevalence symptomatic HF estimate range 0.4 2.0 % general European population . The incidence increase rapidly age , Europe . Characteristics , clinical presentation , treatment , outcomes HF patient admit hospital adequately describe , Europe United States . The Euro Heart Failure Survey ( EHFS ) I 11 327 patient described demographic acutely hospitalize HF patient . The ADHERE registry data 100 000 hospitalization AHF USA . In-hospital mortality 4 7 % , ADHERE EHFS I , respectively . This sensation breathlessness also drive patient asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ED . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbation account approximately 1.5 million ED visit United States per year . It third common cause hospitalization , estimate 726 000 hospitalization 2000 USA . Previous study demonstrate important difference guideline recommendation actual management COPD exacerbation , either ED hospitalization . The diagnosis front dyspneic patient ED remain challenge , low sensitivity clinical sign associate age population variety underlying disease . Little known Epidemiology dyspneic patient ED European level . Diagnosis , prevalence treatment patient may vary among European country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MAIN OBJECTIVES - Epidemiologic description patient present ED shortness breath main complaint . - Description current management ED patient present ED shortness breath main complaint . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Sub analysis ED discharge patient versus admit patient characteristic , comparison recommend care re-ED visit . - Determine clinical and/or biological criterion distinguish : - Patients treat outpatient admitted patient . - Patients hospitalized ward patient admit intensive care unit ( CCU ICU ) - Prognostic prediction , use clinical biochemical data - To determine ED patient treat acute heart failure differ admit hospital . - Comparison European data characteristic , investigation , treatment outcome similar data part world .</detailed_description>
