	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) account 10 % 15 % cancer second leading cause cancer death Western country . Approximately half patient develop metastatic disease become candidate palliative chemotherapy prove prolong survival improve quality life ( QOL ) patient metastatic CRC . The active chemotherapy regiment include oxaliplatin irinotecan combine fluoropyrimidines . With overall survival metastatic CRC nowadays routinely around 2 year , intensity therapy hardly maintain throughout course therapy . The continuum care therefore mandate change therapy , treatment break phase less-intensive maintenance therapy intersperse period more-intensive therapy control tumor progression . Thereby , chemo-holidays conceivably reduce cumulative toxicity chemotherapy , potentially prevent unplanned , premature discontinuation therapy , preserve ability administer phase therapy , potentially maximize time therapy , reduce cost , could increase QOL patient . Several trial test influence chemo-holidays patient outcome , various rule stop component antitumor therapy follow ; 1 ) Completely stop therapeutic agent , give patient completely chemotherapy-free interval ( OPTIMOX-2 , GISCAD ) , 2 ) Stopping agent associate significant ( cumulative ) toxicity continue agent maintenance therapy ( OPTIMOX-1 , Combined Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial [ CONcePT ] ) . Therefore , 'd like test capecitabine maintenance 8 cycle capecitabine combine oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) could prolong progression-free survival without deterioration QOL toxicities patient metastatic CRC .</brief_summary>
