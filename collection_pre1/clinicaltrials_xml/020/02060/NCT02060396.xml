	<brief_summary>This study healthy volunteer first step develop collaborative research program , seek test hypothesis chemopreventive effect acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) colon cancer due predominantly antiplatelet effect . The following feature clinical evidence consistent platelet-mediated hypothesis : 1 . The apparent saturability chemopreventive effect ASA low dos give daily , find long-term analysis cardiovascular adenoma recurrence randomize clinical trial , well vast majority observational study perform different setting different methodology . A remarkably similar saturability cardioprotective effect low dose ASA give daily explain irreversible nature cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -1 inactivation platelet , limited capacity human platelet de novo protein synthesis . 2 . Given short half-life ASA human circulation ( approximately 20 min ) capacity nucleate cell resynthesize acetylate COX-isozyme ( ) , seem unlikely nucleated target could suppress throughout 24-h dosing interval . 3 . One cardiovascular randomize clinical trial ( Thrombosis Prevention Trial ) chemopreventive effect ASA detect long-term follow-up , involve administration controlled-release formulation ASA ( 75 mg ) negligible systemic bioavailability . 4 . Enhanced platelet activation thromboxane ( TX ) A2 generation vivo demonstrate patient colorectal cancer Familial Adenomatous Polyposis patient . So , main objective study assess extent acetylation serine-529 platelet COX-1 1st 7th dose low-doseof enteric-coated ASA 100 mg daily . Changes novel biomarker ASA action correlate known parameter ASA PK PD : ) Tmax , Cmax AUC ASA salicylate peripheral circulation oral dosing ; ii ) time obtain maximal antiplatelet effect ASA persistence throughout dose interval assess measure inhibition platelet COX-1 activity whole blood ex vivo , inhibition platelet aggregation whole blood ex vivo inhibition systemic generation TXB2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study perform healthy subject , fast condition , allow acquire information pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) low-dose enteric-coated ASA , characterize variability ( coefficient variation ) , accuracy precision novel biomarker ASA action , i.e. , quantification extent COX-1 acetylation serine-529 , use stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) technique . This biomarker use another clinical study target population , i.e . FAP patient , treat low-dose ASA perform Prof Angel Lanas ( University Zaragoza , Spain ) . Twenty four healthy volunteer recruit among hospital laboratory personnel enrol treated ASA ( 100 mg enteric-coated tablet per day , Adiro ) 1 week . Blood sample collect baseline ( treatment ) 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 24 h first last dose ASA ass extent inhibition serum TXB2 , index platelet COX-1 activity , plasma level ASA salicylate extent COX-1 acetylation circulate platelet . Moreover , investigator assess extent inhibition platelet aggregation whole blood PFA-100 system . Twenty four hour urine sample also collect measure 11-dehydro-TXB2 ( TX-M ) , index systemic TXA2 biosynthesis vivo . Healthy subject take daily ASA fasting condition abstain use ASA NSAIDs least 2 week enrolment . All volunteer attend Clinical Research Unit University Hospital Lozano Blesa .</detailed_description>
