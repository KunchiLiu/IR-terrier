	<brief_summary>Aim : main aim study investigate immune cell ( regulatory T-cells , Th17 cell immune cell type ) biomarkers use predict response lack response treatment Infliximab . If , characteristic immune cell may also unveil mechanism behind lack response Infliximab . Design : prospective , observational study three arm . In treatment group , 35 patient Crohn 's disease start Infliximab-treatment recruit . They blood sample draw day 1 first treatment , 6 week , 22 week treatment . 12 healthy volunteer serve control group . Controls investigate . All treatment follow-up accord national guideline , data study use clinician . Methods : number regulatory T-cells pro-inflammatory T-cells ( Th17 cell ) investigate use flow cytometry . From plasma serum sample , various protein ( biomarkers ) , transform growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , measure use immunoassay . Patient data ( demographics medical history ) extract various registry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary analysis : patient response Infliximab treatment quantify use Harvey Bradshaw Index , response related number regulatory T-cells , Th17 cell , biomarker level baseline . The exact cut-off response vs. non-respons determine validate data collect assessor blind flow cytometry result biomarker level . Plan miss data : patient miss Harvey Bradshaw Index , first try re-create score use patient record ( information well-being , abdominal pain , diarrhea , fistulae/abscesses , extra-intestinal Crohn manifestation ) . If possible , experienced clinician rate patient 's Infliximab response base available patient record data , blind flow cytometry result biomarker level .</detailed_description>
