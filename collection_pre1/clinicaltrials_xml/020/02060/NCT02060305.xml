	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The mechanism recurrent hemarthroses ( joint bleeds ) result chronic synovitis target joint hemophilic patient think VEGF-based neo-angiogenic process . Local anti-VEGF therapy intra-articular bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody efficiently antagonize VEGF activity , may block process decrease frequency recurrent bleed episode . In addition , prove intra-articular injection bevacizumab rat model safe without significant local systemic adverse event . Primary Objective The efficacy intra-articular bevacizumab injection secondary prevention recurrent hemarthroses hemophilia patient target joint chronic synovitis . The safety profile intra-articular bevacizumab injection hemophilia patient . Study Population Adult hemophilia patient one target joint chronic synovitis recurrent hemarthroses . Investigational therapy : Intra-articular injection Bevacizumab ( 20 40 mg/ 0.8 1.6 ml/ dose ) every month ( 28 day ) 4 month , depend improvement target joint bleeding . Study Design The estimate study period Jan 2014 Dec 2015 . Totally 10 joint enrol pilot study .

Intra-articular injection bevacizumab administer , prophylactic factor supplementation , every month four injection . In first four patient , 20mg bevacizumab administer . If Gr 3 Gr4 dose-limiting toxicity , bevacizumab dose escalate 40mg 6 patient . Before every procedure , plasma synovial fluid sample collect VEGF quantification correlative biomarker study . After complete protocol treatment , efficacy parameter well safety profile evaluate . Assessments The efficacy : difference total episodes recurrent hemarthroses within 3 month complete bevacizumab intra-articular injection . Post-procedure target joint bleeding record interval 1st , 3rd , 6th , 12th month . The total absence haemarthrosis ( zero bleeding ) rat `` excellent '' response ; bleed reduction 75 % 99 % rat `` good '' , 50 % 74 % `` fair '' , 50 % `` poor '' .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 year old , diagnosis hemophilia A B . 2 . Subjects target one target joint chronic synovitis recurrent hemarthroses 2 time recent 6 month . The target joint ( ) limit knee , elbow , ankle , substantial severity ( World Federation Hemophilia Score =2~3 ) 3 . White cell count ≧ 3000/μL , Hemoglobin level ≧ 10 g/dL , platelet ≧ 100,000/μL 4 . Serum creatinine ≦1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) 5 . Total bilirubin ≦1.5 X ULN ; aspartate alanine aminotransferase ( AST , ALT ) ≦2.0 x ULN . 6 . Willingness ability comply study schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , procedure , include completion patient questionnaire . 7 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test do 1 week prior administration study drug . She partner prevent pregnancy ( oral contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device , barrier method contraception conjunction spermicidal jelly surgically sterile ) least 6 month last treatment completion last drug dose , whatever happen first . 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status : 0~2 9 . Signed write informed consent accord ICH/GCP local regulation ( approve Institutional Review Board [ IRB ] /Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC ] ) obtain prior study specific screening procedure . 1 . Subjects know HIV infection . 2 . Subjects whose target joint heavily damage deformity arthropathy , whose target joint receive intraarticular injection . 3 . Subjects receive MRI study . 4 . Subjects uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg ) . 5 . Subjects experience major surgical procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior first dose Bevacizumab administration ( Patients must recover major surgery ) , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . 6 . Subjects serious nonhealing wound ulcer . 7 . Subjects clinically significant ( i.e . active ) cardiovascular disease . For example , cerebrovascular accident stroke precede six month , myocardial infarction unstable angina precede six month , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . 8 . Pregnancy ( positive serum pregnancy test ) lactation 9 . Subjects impaired major organ dysfunction , active infection , abnormal laboratory physical finding , comorbidities , investigator ' adjustment , may substantially increase risk associate patient ' participation study .</criteria>
