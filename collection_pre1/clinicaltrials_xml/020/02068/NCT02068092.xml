	<criteria>1 . Participants must ≥18 year age . 2 . Participants must elevate risk breast cancer define least one follow category decline tamoxifen and/or raloxifene therapy : 1 . Diagnosis LCIS , atypical ductal lobular hyperplasia . 2 . A known deleterious mutation BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PTEN TP53 . ( Note : The participant must document carrier meet criterion . If know mutation hereditary breast cancer susceptibility gene participant 's family member , participant must undergo genetic test per NCCN clinical guideline eligible per criterion . ) 3 . Modified Gail/CARE model risk 5 year ≥ 1.67 % . ( Note : Risk model use know previous diagnosis resect DCIS LCIS know deleterious mutation BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PTEN TP53 ) . 4 . 10 % probability BRCA mutation BRCAPRO similar model 5 . Can DCIS previous invasive ductal carcinoma 3 . Participants must least one breast available image biopsy . A previously irradiate breast ( i.e. , resect DCIS ) evaluable breast imaging biopsy . . Participants must allow submission core needle breast material ( obtain per Section 7.3 ) future use . 4 . Participants must baseline mammogram perform within 90 day prior study entry , do digital mammography machine , show either normal benign finding . Participants mammograms report suspicious malignancy ineligible . 5 . Participants must baseline mammographic density &gt; 10 % base upon classification system ( 2 = 1150 % , `` scatter fibroglandular density '' ; 3 = 5175 % , `` heterogeneously dense '' ; 4 = &gt; 75 % , `` extremely dense '' ) . Women baseline mammographic density ≤ 10 % ( 1 = ≤10 % , breast almost entirely fat ) eligible 6 . Prior tamoxifen raloxifene use allow provided treatment complete least 1 year prior registration 7 . Participants must bilateral breast implant , prior breast reduction surgery allow . ( Breast implant allow affect density measurement risk rupture implant biopsy ) . 8 . Participants must ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ( see Section 11 ) . 9 . Prior anticoagulant therapy use allow provided therapy discontinue least 7 day prior breast biopsy order reduce risk bleeding . For subject take anticoagulation within past 7 day , INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) must ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal Prothrombin Time Partial Thromboplastin Time ≤ IULN prior breast biopsy . 10 . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer . 11 . Participant must pregnant nursing must agree use effective contraception . Hormonebased birth control ( pill , patch shot ) allow , switch birth control method discourage onstudy hormonal change affect mammographic density . Hormone replacement therapy allow postmenopausal female . 12 . Individuals must participate clinical trial treatment prevention cancer unless long receive intervention followup phase . Participants must also agree join trial participate study . 13 . All participant must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . 14 . Exclude patient prior Tamoxifen Raloxifene use past year Exclusion Criteria 1 . Any prior malignancy except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer . 2 . Prior Tamoxifen Raloxifene use past 1 year</criteria>
