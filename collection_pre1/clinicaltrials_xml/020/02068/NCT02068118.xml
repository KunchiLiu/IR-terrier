	<brief_title>Optimization Ambulatory Monitoring Patients With Heart Failure Tele-cardiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparative study patient chronic heart failure , randomize ratio ( 1 :1 ) , two study arm ( telecardiology vs usual care ) . Regional multicenter study ( 13 center involve ) . The planned enrolment 870 patient total period one year . This study involve enrolment visit , manage recruit investigator cardiologist , four telephone contact Clinical Studies Technicians ( CST ) . The purpose CST telephone contact record study data , occur study arm . Throughout study , patient telecardiology study arm regular contact Cordiva nurse management chronic heart failure , telemonitoring coaching . There plan hospitalization study . Patients control group receive usual care : After enrolment , return home subsequently regular visit GP refer cardiologist . Patients telecardiology group receive necessary monitoring equipment home week follow enrolment visit . This equipment include connect electronic scale questionnaire box . This questionnaire design evaluate evolution patient symptom . During presentation study patient study inclusion , investigator inform patient use equipment . The material provide `` self installable '' patient ask help , equipment instal patient 's home private nurse , also check patient know use equipment . Each patient respond daily 8 yes/no question : - Did breathing issue last night previous night ? - Did need extra pillow good breathing last night ? - Do cough usual ? - Are legs swollen usual ? - Do feel tired usual ? - Have fever 38.5 ° C ? - Have felt feel palpitation ? - Do find physical activity limit today previous day ? Patients simply answer yes question questionnaire box . The self-monitoring parameter ( weight questionnaire answer ) remotely transmit via standard phone line ( wire , 3G GPRS ) secure server . These data analyze automatically expert system generate alert case abnormal value . The objective anticipate possible acute cardiac failure . The specialized nurse Cordiva center manage alert work hour contact patient validate relevance alert . If clinical reality alert confirm , nurse advise patient contact GP refer cardiologist . In parallel nurse advise patient , refer physician receive alert report include weight value symptom trigger alert . Then , take action considers appropriate . A binder sent patient . This contain various information relate management heart failure : heart physiology , symptom , treatment , diet , physical activity ... The purpose binder support discussion Cordiva nurse patient . Upon receipt installation equipment patient 's home , nurse arrange first telephone interview , last approximately 45 minute . The nurse first introduce team overall clinical approach , discussion patient well understand patient ( anamnesis , treatment , psycho-social profile , smoking , alcohol use , physical activity , ) . After call , patient nurse together determine together date next phone call date . On regular basis ( example every three week ) , Cordiva nurse call patient check current status disease treatment , assist management disease daily basis ( compliance , physical activity , nutrition , illness experience ... ) . This call last approx . 15 minute , however , duration call limit , define accord needs patient . At end call , nurse define patient educational goal ( disease knowledge , treatment , recognize acute episode symptom , learn good health habit , practise regular physical activity ) . Cordiva center also available patient 's inbound call . In way , patient able easily call center working hour , discuss specialize Cordiva nurse . This line emergency line replace 112 , remain accredited contact case emergency . In case temporary travel patient away home ( i.e . holiday ) , patient take box scale . This material provide GPRS SIM card , connection maintain . The patient may also provide alternative phone number call nurse . The patient 's GP involve outpatient care begin study . Indeed , data collect connected box scale displayed dedicate report send GP . These report transmit every 2 month . These report also send refer cardiologist . Moreover , case validate alert , refer physician access weight symptom report , allow take action think appropriate . ABOUT CORDIVA CENTER : The center team specialize graduated nurse heart failure management therapeutic education , due dedicate training receive . Indeed , many study multidisciplinary care heart failure patient demonstrate key role nurse , act bridge patient health professional . The nurse take care patient compliance base refer cardiologist general practitioner instruction , monitor patient clinical parameter ( weight symptom ) . The nurse use software base interview guide . Patient objective define base information regard certain factor ( health status , clinical sign , drug ) , information collect nurse computerized database . This information request strict patient accompany perspective therefore appear study result . The two data set ( data collect nurse patient management one hand , data collect CST study another hand ) never connect study data CST use ass study criterion . To evaluate patient knowledge need , nurse use active listening ( open question , paraphrase , empathy positive reinforcement ) . These technique help customize information message reinforce personalize care . Cordiva center nurse benefit specialized training motivational interviewing . They also receive dedicated training cardiology heart failure , `` mental state '' heart failure patient , communication patient education . Coherence informative approach guarantee one hand tool available nurse ( binder , interview guide ) , hand center organization : monitoring patient insured team nurse , weekly debrief record calls…</detailed_description>
