	<brief_summary>The rapid rise obesity ( body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) US past decade responsible disease death single factor . Severe obesity associate numerous co-morbidities contribute increased mortality risk , include end stage liver disease . Liver transplantation life-saving procedure patient end stage liver disease obesity become increasingly prevalent population . In one study , 54 % patient undergoing orthotopic liver transplant ( OLT ) either overweight obese [ body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 25 kg/m2 ] , 7 % severely morbidly obese ( BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) . In addition , weight gain solid organ transplantation common steroid-containing immunosuppression physical inactivity decrease exercise tolerance . Obesity show increase surgical morbidity , include wound infection , wound dehiscence , hernias transplantation . More significantly , excess pretransplant body weight hinders rate improvement health-related quality life liver transplantation [ 7 ] . One possible approach treat obesity liver transplant use bariatric surgery . Currently , bariatric surgery establish effective mean weight loss resolution metabolic disease morbidly obese . Recent publication emphasize usefulness bariatric surgery reduction long-term cardiometabolic risk , cardiovascular disease incidence mortality , management uncontrolled type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . In addition , decrease mortality improve social functioning quality life . Bariatric surgery may improve eligibility transplant patient previously exclude due excessive weight . Bariatric procedure , sleeve gastrectomy , allow significant weight loss time greatly reduce eliminates obesity relate illness diabetes , high blood pressure liver disease . According National Institutes Health , bariatric surgery reserve patient BMI &gt; 40 &gt; 35 kg/m2 presence major co-morbidities ( e.g . type 2 diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , heart disease , etc ) . A significant number liver transplant candidate obesity-related illness , thus put risk cardiovascular metabolic complication post-transplant . In addition , patient await OLT typically longer medically stable undergo intensive diet exercise regimens treatment disease . Finally , decrease activity medication use prevent liver graft rejection contribute increase weight gain follow transplant . In fact , series 320 non-obese liver transplant recipient , 21.6 % patient become obese within two year transplant . These comorbidities also contribute poor post-transplant outcome development know post-transplant metabolic syndrome . Morbidly obese patient ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) may also high frequency morbidity prolong hospitalization readmission well infectious , wound , cardiovascular complication transplantation . Finally , intra-abdominal adiposity create technically challenging operative dissection , data exist whether increase perioperative morbidity mortality liver transplant patient . Sleeve gastrectomy attractive restrictive procedure liver transplant population several key reason . One , sleeve gastrectomy require implantation foreign body , placement adjustable gastric band , immunocompromised post-transplant patient raise concern severe infectious complication . Secondly , state previously , sleeve gastrectomy purely restrictive procedure , therefore least likely cause significant macronutrient micronutrient deficiency . Finally , compare restrictive procedure , adjustable gastric band placement , low likelihood treatment failure ( i.e . &lt; 50 % excess weight loss ) . In fact , recent report describe high failure rate adjustable gastric band placement , also high reintervention rate band-related complication ( e.g . band erosion , leakage , slippage , port infection esophageal dilatation ) failure lose weight 54 % patient may band place 10 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Sleeve Pilot Study Morbidly Obese Undergoing Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROCEDURAL DETAILS A sleeve gastrectomy perform patient reverse Trendelenburg position . The liver retract cephalad right , short gastric vessel great curvature retrogastric attachment divide angle His approximately 6-8cm pylorus . A 30-40 French bougie place stomach direct along less curve . The antrum preserve vertical subtotal , sleeve gastrectomy fashion along less curvature 1 cm away bougie toward esophagogastric junction use linear stapler , begin 6 cm pylorus great curve side continue angle His . The staple line may oversew run absorbable suture absorbable staple buttress material may also use help prevent bleeding . Air infuse via endoscope newly create `` sleeve '' rule leak ( [ 33 ] ) . CLINICAL DATA TO DATE Weight Loss Weight loss surgery show safe , effective durable option treatment morbid obesity . [ 34 , 35 ] The primary weight loss effectiveness parameter measure percent excess weight loss ( % EWL ) , define difference baseline post-surgery weight divide difference baseline weight ideal body weight ( base 1983 Metropolitan Tables Life Insurance ) multiply 100 , reduction BMI . Studies early outcome sleeve gastrectomy report mean EWL 51-85 % 3 year 43-58 % 6 year . [ 36 , 37 ] Additionally , patient show reduce ( average ) BMI 15 point first year . [ 38-40 ] Improvements Obesity-related condition bariatric surgery Patients undergo sleeve gastrectomy experience statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) reduction glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . Over two-thirds patient return HbA1c 6.5 % less within year . [ 41 , 42 ] In addition , half patient experience complete resolution diabetes within one year . Blood pressure normalization see 50-75 % patient undergo gastric sleeve , rate comparable Roux en Y gastric bypass adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) . [ 42 ] Hyperlipidemia , present nearly half patient undergo sleeve gastrectomy , also show resolution rate nearly 100 % . [ 43 ] Improvements Quality Life Fezzi et conduct one year follow-up 78 patient sleeve gastrectomy . The SF-36 Questionnaire Impact Weight Quality Life-Lite questionnaire ( IWQOL-Lite ) use measure quality life . In general , improvement eight SF-36 component domain score compare baseline post-surgery visit . [ 44 ] Quality Life ( BQL ) assessment show compare patient undergo AGB , sleeve gastrectomy patient demonstrate significantly great BQL composite score ( 66.5 versus 57.9 ) , indicate great quality life . Sleeve gastrectomy patient also report significantly less vomiting AGB patient ( 2 % versus 43 % ) . [ 45 ] Mortality Benefit bariatric surgery Morbid obesity associate increased mortality morbidity due association many disease state reduce life expectancy five 20 year . [ 46 ] Two recent landmark study confirm benefit bariatric surgery achieve substantial weight loss improve co-morbidities obesity , reduce mortality . In Swedish Obesity Study [ 10 ] researcher enrol 4,047 obese subject underwent vertical band gastroplasty , gastric bypass adjustable gastric band surgery 25 surgical department 480 primary health care center . After ten year , weight loss 25±11 % gastric bypass , 16±11 % vertical-banded gastroplasty , 14±14 % banding , compare baseline weight . Most importantly , demonstrate prospective , case-controlled surgical intervention trial bariatric surgery obese subject associate reduction overall mortality , compare conventional treatment match obese control ( hazard ratio 0.76 ) . Adams et al [ 11 ] also demonstrate similar result large U.S. retrospective cohort trial compare 7,925 bariatric surgery patient match severely obese control , follow mean 7.1 year . The study conclude adjust long-term mortality cause surgery group decrease 40 % , compare control . Specifically , compare control , surgically treat group 56 % decrease mortality coronary artery disease , 92 % decrease diabetes 60 % decrease mortality cancer . In addition , large systematic review meta-analysis 136 study , bariatric surgery achieve significant result attain long-term weight loss resolution comorbidities diabetes , hyperlipidemia , hypertension obstructive sleep apnea . [ 35 ] Overall Safety Profile The American College Surgeons - Bariatric Surgery Center Network ( ACS-BSCN ) Accreditation Program recently publish first report safety effectiveness sleeve gastrectomy compare Adjustable Gastric Band ( AGB ) , Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( LRYGB ) Open Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( ORYGB ) treatment obesity obesity-related disease [ 38 ] . Univariate multivariate analysis compare 30-day , 6-month , one-year outcome include morbidity mortality , readmission reoperations well reduction body mass index ( BMI ) weight-related comorbidities . 109 hospital submit data 28,616 patient , 7/2007 9/2010 . Sleeve gastrectomy find high risk-adjusted morbidity , readmission reoperation/intervention rate compare AGB , low reoperation/intervention rate compare LRYGB ORYGB . There differences mortality . Reduction BMI weight-related comorbidities follow LSG also lie LAGB LRYGB/ORYGB . The ACS-BSCN accredits facility United States undergone independent , voluntary rigorous peer evaluation accordance nationally recognize bariatric surgical standard [ 47 ] . Hospitals accredit Level I , Level II , Level II New Outpatient facility , depend hospital surgical volume resource . Level I hospital must perform 125 case per year , demonstrate sufficient resource care challenge complex patient . They accredit care patient level obesity , age , comorbidities accredit perform elective revisional surgery . Level II hospital low volume requirement - 25 case per year—and accredit care less complex obese patient . Level II center may perform elective revisional operation , elective primary procedure high-risk patient . High-risk patient define follow : non-ambulatory patient , patient 60 year old , adolescents age 18 , high Body Mass Index ( BMI ) patient ( male patient may BMI ≥55 female patient may BMI ≥60 ) , patient organ failure , organ transplant , candidate transplant , patient significant cardiac pulmonary comorbid condition . Northwestern Memorial Hospital 's Bariatric Surgery Program Level I accredit center thus adhere high safety excellence standard put forth ACS-BSCN . Hutter et al . observe 30-day mortality 0.1 % 1-year mortality 0.2 % prospective study 28,000 patient . These rate higher observe AGB ( 0.05 % 0.08 % ) low RYGB ( 0.14 % 0.34 % ) . Thirty-day morbidity 5.6 % reoperation rate 3 % . [ 38 ] The 30-day morbidity rate LSG ( 5.61 % ) statistically high LAGB rate ( 1.44 % ) , however comparable LRYGB rate ( 5.91 % ) . Similarly , 30-day readmission rate LSG ( 5.4 % ) statistically high LAGB ( 1.71 % ) , comparable LRYGB ( 6.47 % ) . Reoperation/intervention rate LSG ( 2.97 % ) position LAGB ( 0.92 % ) LRYGB ( 5.02 % ) , significant univariate multivariate analysis . Overall , complication rate follow LSG seem position LAGB ( low 30 day morbidity , readmission reoperation/intervention rate ) LRYGB ( high reoperation rate ) [ 38 ] . Unlike bariatric procedure , patient undergo sleeve gastrectomy find suffer nutritional deficit follow surgery , close monitoring B12 , folic acid , zinc , calcium iron recommend . [ 48 ] The common long-term complication sleeve gastrectomy gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , report 22 % patient 1 year , decline less 5 % 3 year . A recurrence observe small population 6 year , attribute asymmetric staple gastric sleeve lead conical shape relative mid-stomach stenosis . [ 37 ] In addition , compare AGB , sleeve gastrectomy statistically high rate peripheral nerve injury , pulmonary embolism , pneumonia , unplanned intubation , renal insufficiency , urinary tract infection , organ space infection , sepsis . When compare LRYGB , sleeve gastrectomy high rate organ space infection , renal insufficiency , sepsis lower rate ventilator dependence . Bariatric surgery-specific postoperative occurrence require readmission , reoperation intervention within 30-days show compare AGB , LSG high rate anastomotic/staple line leak , fluid/electrolyte/nutrition problem , stricture , infection/fevers , pulmonary embolism , bleed event otherwise specify . Compared LRYGB , sleeve gastrectomy comparable rate nearly postoperative bariatric specific occurrence require readmission , reoperation intervention , except low rate stricture , intestinal obstruction , anastomotic ulcer . Safety liver transplant population Campsen colleague recently publish case report young morbidly obese woman ( BMI 42 ) diabetes , hypertension obstructive sleep apnea underwent adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) liver transplantation . [ 24 ] Six month surgery , patient experience 45 % excess weight loss resolution hypertension , diabetes sleep apnea . In another publication , two morbidly obese patient transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) cirrhosis , subsequently develop graft dysfunction secondary disease recurrence , next underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery two year post-op show significant improvement liver histology . [ 49 ] A recently publish case series obese patient undergo sleeve gastrectomy post liver transplant demonstrate efficacy adverse effect graft function . [ 27 ] Finally , researcher Mayo recently report small case series 7 patient end-stage liver disease unsuccessful pre-transplant weight loss underwent combine liver transplant plus gastric sleeve resection . They report minimal additional time add transplant procedure , date , morbidity 6 24 month follow-up 6 7 patient [ 28 ] . One patient experience gastric leak complicate intra-abdominal infection since resolve , well normal liver function BMI 24 kg/m2 6 month transplantation [ 29 ] . However , prospective study conduct examine impact sleeve gastrectomy reduction metabolic risk factor obese patient undergo liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
