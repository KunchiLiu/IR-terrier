We use prospectively collect data house within MSTCVS-QC ( Michigan Society Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative ) reveal risk factor elevate patient 's risk develop HAIs . The result analysis form foundation development standardize regional practice reduce HAIs . We explore effect traditional patient-level measure ( age , sex , comorbid condition ) , process measure ( time selection antibiotic , continuous insulin infusion , transfusion ) , surgical practice ( use bilateral internal mammary artery usage among diabetic , vein harvest approach ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More 400,000 coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) procedure perform every year United States ( U.S. ) . Patients undergo CABG surgery risk number adverse sequela , many impact survival contribute overall health-care cost . Healthcare-acquired infection ( HAIs ) , include pneumonia superficial deep sternal wound infection , occur among 16 % CABG patient elevate patient 's risk mortality add excess upfront long-term expenditure health care system . A number barrier prevent wide-scale improvement HAl rate within set CABG surgery . While number HAl prophylaxis measure develop , measure fully encompass set practice may impact patient 's risk HAl . Identifying cardiac surgery specific risk factor would serve foundation target quality improvement strategy . In absence definitive data concern best practice , HAl prophylaxis variable across surgeon institution , result unnecessary morbidity cost . Prior work show value implement evidence-based protocol general intensive care unit set . To extent implementation cardiac surgery specific standardized practice result low HAl rate uncertain . An understanding effectiveness approach would certainly assist surgeon institution provide safer care patient population . Rates HAIs vary 0-26 % across 33 institution perform CABG surgery Michigan . This application seek reduce rate identify subsequently implement standardized practice , evaluate impact HAl rate . This study base prospective data regional quality improvement activity infrastructure Michigan Society Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative ( MSTCVS-QC ) . We evaluate effectiveness standardized practice reduce HAIs regionally relative national rate time period . Our Aim identify patient risk factor clinical practice associate HAIs cardiac surgery . We use prospectively collect data house within MSTCVS-QC reveal risk factor elevate patient 's risk develop HAIs . The result analysis form foundation development standardize regional practice reduce HAIs . We explore effect traditional patient-level measure ( age , sex , comorbid condition ) , process measure ( time selection antibiotic , continuous insulin infusion , transfusion ) , surgical practice ( use bilateral internal mammary artery usage among diabetic , vein harvest approach ) .</detailed_description>
