	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction 1.1 Background Regarding occupational rehabilitation , balance workload individual 's work capacity require return work successfully injury illness . Therefore , great value evaluate wide range physical work requirement ass employee 's work capacity across occupational group . Although several approach make regard , objective data available far establish reference value exist evaluate , whether , return work possible . One reason could objectify workload work capacity methodically challenge multidimensional nature [ 1 , 2 ] . Physical activity define bodily movement produce skeletal muscle result energy expenditure [ 3 ] . In classical work physiology , energy expenditure therefore consider basis assess amount workload [ 4 , 5 ] . However , energy cost physical activity may necessarily equivalent body movement [ 6 ] . For reason , modern concept include also aspects reflect severity manual work . The 'Dictionary Occupational Titles ' ( DOT ) , develop U.S. government , classifies profession five category ( sedentary , light , medium , heavy , heavy ) base amount energy expend well intensity duration lift carry work [ 7 ] . Though , DOT classification base quantitative work-related analysis , rather consensus meeting expert . Furthermore , validity establish . Work capacity assess use functional capacity evaluation ( FCEs ) , measure ability subject perform specific activity [ 8 ] . Worldwide , various FCE protocol available job specific [ 9 ] , pathology specific [ 10 , 11 ] general type . Soer et al . apply evaluation system consist 12 work-related test establish functional capacity healthy employee [ 12 ] . The assessment include various lift energetic exercise well coordination task . From test result , normative FCE value acquire DOT-category , compare patient data order make work recommendation . However , since validity DOT prove , analysis concern workload assessment require . Moreover , application complex FCE tool related high expense effort may therefore appropriate general clinical field context . Especially large population , implement highly accurate instrument difficult due high cost poor practicability [ 13 ] . For reason , present study focus workload investigate wide range physical work requirement across occupational group put relation employee ' aerobic capacity . Since physical activity characterize various dimension , duration intensity [ 3 ] , factor consider comprehensive analysis . 1.2 Specific aim The primary aim study investigate healthy employee Switzerland regard energy expenditure , metabolic equivalent ( METs ) , physical activity duration different intensity number step take normal working day focus difference occupational group . Furthermore , association physical activity aerobic capacity examine . 1.3 Hypotheses 1.3.1 Individuals practise heavy work physically active consume energy light work . 1.3.2 Aerobic capacity ( VO2max ) correlate positively work non-work related physical activity . 1.4 Potential significance This study expect provide detailed information physical work requirement performance criterion different occupational group . This may valuable regard treatment professional reintegration injury illness , since establish reference value exist . Objective workload data might improve intervention strategy clinician ' recommendation successful return work . 2 .

Furthermore , night shift worker exclude participation . 2.3 Instruments 2.3.1 Personal- job-related factor For subject , gender ( male / female ) employment ( temporary / permanent ) assess binary variable . Nationality ( Swiss / EU / ) , marital status ( single / marry / divorce ) smoking status ( yes / / never ) record three category , alcohol consumption ( never / several time per month / several time per week / per day ) , German skill ( good / good / medium / bad / bad ) , high education ( compulsory school / apprenticeship / high vocational school / diploma maturity / university ) work time model ( flextime / fix time / shift work / weekend work ) evaluate four , five six category , respectively . Age , native language , profession , avocation , medication , illness , accident work hour ask open question . Furthermore , get overview individual work activity , participant ask keep daily list main complete task include time information accordance questionnaire regard professional integration pension [ 14 ] . 2.3.2 Classification occupation The report profession classify 9 category base International Standard Classification Occupations ISCO-88 [ 15 ] ( 1 . Managers , 2 . Scientists , 3 . Technicians , 4 . Office worker , 5 . Service worker , 6 . Agricultural worker , 7 . Craftsmen , 8 . Machine operator , 9 . Labourers ) . These 9 category collapse 3 group low- , moderate-and high-intensity occupational activity accord Suva expert field ergonomics ( 1st group : Categories 1 ( Managers ) , 2 ( Scientists ) 4 ( Office worker ) ; 2nd group : Categories 3 ( Technicians ) , 5 ( Service worker ) 8 ( Machine operator ) ; 3rd group : Categories 6 ( Agricultural worker ) , 7 ( Craftsmen ) 9 ( Labourers ) . Reliability stratification previously show [ 16 , 17 ] . 2.3.3 International Physical Activity Questionnaire The International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) represent convenient simple instrument measure health enhance physical activity population level . The self-administered long version IPAQ , freely available internet [ 18 ] , use present study . It include 26 question assess past-week frequency ( day ) duration ( time per day ) physical activity within domain work , leisure-time , transport , domestic garden . Moreover , domain consist walk , moderate vigorous activity . According IPAQ guideline data analysis [ 19 ] , continuous score form MET-minutes per week calculate domain . MET-minutes per week , define energy cost physical activity , compute multiply intensity ( specific MET value ) activity frequency ( day ) duration ( minute ) . The corresponding MET value set IPAQ guideline base compendium physical activity [ 20 ] . According numerous validity reliability test carry twelve different country , IPAQ consider internationally valid assessment tool acceptable measurement property [ 21 ] . The long version IPAQ translated German part dissertation validate Austrian sample [ 22 ] . It could show suitable research purpose regard physical activity detection [ 23 ] . 2.3.4 SF-36 The SF-36 general quality life questionnaire consist 36 item , format binary question semantic six-point differential scale . It refer past four week include nine content area concern vitality , general health perception , physical functioning , social functioning , role limitation ( emotional/physical problem ) , pain , mental health health change [ 24 ] . The SF-36 consider gold standard measure functional status health-related quality life therefore use questionnaire context [ 25 ] . Since physical mental disorder well pain may influence activity behaviour , SF-36 use present study adjust potential confounders . 2.3.5 Visual Analogue Scale The Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) measure instrument subjective characteristic directly measure . Individuals express response VAS item mark position along continuous line two end-points . The indicated locus quantify define scale [ 26 ] . In epidemiologic clinical research , common VAS straight horizontal line 100 mm length end represent extreme limit measure parameter ( bad - best ) [ 27 ] . The VAS score determine measure distance mm leave end line point mark participant . Validity reliability VAS scientifically test variety parameter , acute chronic pain [ 28 , 29 ] . In study , individual 's perception past-week work non-work related physical exertion effort assess 100mm VASs . This may valuable evaluate whether investigated period ( exposure time ) representative reflect normal week . 2.3.6 Borg Scale The Borg Scale represent simple method rate perceive exertion compare scale , VAS . It use various purpose , measure patient 's exertion performance test assess intensity training competition athletes [ 30 ] . The original scale develop Borg range 6 ( exertion ) 20 ( maximal exertion ) update transformed combined category-ratio scale CR10 rating 0 ( nothing ) 10 ( hard ) [ 31 , 32 ] . The latter use present study . Subjects instructed rate work relate physical exertion twice per day , end morning late afternoon . The indicated Borg value reflect heavy strenuous work feel consider sensation physical stress , effort fatigue . 2.4 Measurements 2.4.1 Anthropometric measurement Anthropometric measurement include body height , body weight waist circumference . Body height assess without shoe medical measure stick near mm . The measurement body weight performed subject light clothe without shoe medical scale accuracy 0.1 kg . Waist circumference determine midway low rib iliac crest accord Swiss Heart Foundation use medical measuring tape precision 0.1 cm . The measurement carry stand subject moderate expiration . 2.4.2 20-meter shuttle run The multistage 20-meter shuttle run common endurance fitness test evaluate maximal aerobic power healthy adult [ 33 ] . It simple use economical large group test . This test conduct flat , non-slip surface participant instruct run back forth two line , 20 meter apart ( Figure 1 ) . Running velocity determine interval two audio signal emit pre-recorded tape . Subjects touch 20 meter line simultaneously sound signal . The initial running velocity 8.5 km/h . Every minute ( stage ) , interval shorten speed increase 0.5 km/h . The test end subject give long keep pace reach line time ( &gt; 3 metre away 20 meter line ) twice row . The test result correspond number reach stage . According validate table [ 34 ] , score use predict maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) , compare age-dependent normative data male female . Validity 1 minute stage version 20-meter shuttle run predict VO2max adult establish Léger et al . [ 35 ] , compare maximal shuttle run speed VO2max attain multistage treadmill test . In addition , blood pressure oxygen saturation assess prior test order detect potential contraindication . Resting pulse recovery pulse ( 2 minute test ) measure heart rate continuously record test . Furthermore , participant instruct rate perceive physical exertion test use Borg scale . 2.4.3 SenseWear Mini armband The SenseWear Mini armband small , lightweight wireless multisensory activity monitor develop Bodymedia ( Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA ) , integrate motion data three-axis accelerometer along several physiological sensor heat flux , skin temperature galvanic skin response . Validity establish Johannsen et al . [ 36 ] compare energy expenditure estimate SenseWear Mini armband criterion method 'Doubly-Labeled-Water ' healthy adult . The subject instruct wear SenseWear Mini armband upper leave arm ( triceps area ) 7 consecutive day , include sleeping , exception one hour daily spend personal hygiene ( 23 hour per day ) . Reliability assessment period previously show [ 37 ] . For record non-wearing period , water activity shower , participant ask keep diary . The physiological data collect armband 's sensor process specific algorithm ( professional software V.7.0 , algorithm V.2.2.4 ) calculate participant ' daily energy expenditure , METs , physical activity duration different intensity number step . Gender , age , height , weight , smoke status handedness also consider calculation . 2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical analyse do use software R ( version 2.15.1 ) IBM SPSS Statistics ( version 19.0 ) . Statistical significance acquire p value le 0.05 attain . Data present descriptive statistic within occupational group . Cross table report count percentage . Ordinal variable report median Interquartile range ( IQR ) . Metric variable report mean standard deviation ( SD ) . To evaluate primary endpoint , linear regression perform . Independent variable `` occupational group '' , dependent variable `` average daily active energy expenditure '' , `` average daily physical activity duration '' `` average daily number step '' . Optionally , personal job related factor include regression analysis covariates . If appropriate , data log-transformed . Regression result present difference mean `` occupational category '' correspond 95 % confidence interval ( C.I . ) p-values . In case logarithmic distribute data , geometric mean ratio present . To evaluate secondary endpoint , linear regression conduct . In case ordinal variable , non-parametric method apply . Furthermore , mean individual time course physical activity period plot primary secondary variable . 2.6 Sample-size calculation Since `` average daily active energy expenditure '' measure SenseWear Mini armband represent valid reliable parameter , consider important primary endpoint present investigation . For reason , variable subject power calculation . In previous study , SD `` average daily active energy expenditure '' normal work shift find 730 kcal [ 38 ] . The expected mean difference three occupational group around 500 kcal . Assuming sample size 100 subject occupational group , power &gt; 90 % detect mean difference 500 kcal group . This calculation base assumption within group SD 730 kcal two-sided significance level 5 % .</detailed_description>
