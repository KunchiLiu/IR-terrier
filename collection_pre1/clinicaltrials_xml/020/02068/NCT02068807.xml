	<detailed_description>In recent year many scientific study demonstrate lutein , nutrient belong family carotenoid , may constitute valid important preventive protective factor large number chronic disease affect million people around world . Studies literature highlight confirm lutein able reduce risk develop ocular disease slow progression . Lutein fat-soluble derivative polar hydroxylated xanthophyll belongs family carotenoid . Carotenoids linear polyenes , ie double bond conjugate hydrocarbon contain 40 atom carbon . Today 35 know carotenoid ingest , absorb , metabolise find human serum . Lutein important corotenoid retina , macula lens . In tissue serum lutein find together isomer , zeaxanthin . Lutein , commonly ingest food , partially eliminate directly faeces ( 50-90 % ) partially absorb fatty food . It incorporate chylomicron reach blood bind lipoprotein thanks fat solubility reach different organ : liver , breast , colon , cervix , lens , iris retina concentrate central region : macula . Inside cell Lutein place lipid bilayer bind polar group cell membrane . Lutein zeaxanthin present umbilical cord pas placental barrier . They also find high concentration breast milk ( high plasma ) , particularly colostrum ; indicate active secretion milk . The rate lutein blood increase 67 % versus 14 % beta-carotene intake food rich carotenoid . Coordinated interdisciplinary study , conduct vitro vivo , show lutein play role tissue defense functional mechanism use phenomenon deactivation ( quench ) singlet oxygen reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . This action give molecule different activity : antioxidant anti-inflammatory property , promotion anti-carcinogenic effect , induction detoxify enzyme promotion proteins positive effect junctional communication ( up-regulation ) . New chemical experimental data show oxidative stress harmful effect ROS may play important role pathogenesis neurological disease like Alzheimer , Parkinson , etc.. This could explain fact central nervous system characterize membrane rich polyunsaturated lipid first target ROS attack ( lipid peroxidation ) . A similar mechanism may occur ocular tissue ( macula , lens , retina ) , vulnerable tissue oxidative damage particularly rich polyunsaturated fatty acid . The photo-protective action seem predominant iris , retinal pigment epithelium may operate light filter antioxidant mechanism . The development human eye include complex series consecutive event begin first differentiation fertilize egg cell continue birth first year life . The eye newborn , although small adult , well developed mature dioptric apparatus , consist cornea , aqueous humor , lens vitreous , transparent structure allow passage light focus image retina . Contrariwise macula central part ( fovea ) , useful vision color discrimination , yet mature birth . The full development fovea occur 4 / 5 month life . This process along development sensitive way , give child great resolve power distinct vision . The partial pressure blood gas regulate blood flow retina importance . Indeed oxygen consumption retina constant defect excess gas highly detrimental natural development retinal structure . An example importance oxygen partial pressure regulate retinal blood flow represent retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) , usually bilateral condition , affect immature retinal vessel . ROP one major cause blindness infant past . Nowadays use oxygen concentration base level partial pressure arterial blood , reduce incidence retinopathy . The vascularization retina begin 4th month gestation . The vessel progress center periphery , reach nasal area 8th month temporal 9th month intrauterine life . In retinopathy prematurity , development retinal vasculature impaired increase PA02 level lead arteriolar vasoconstriction obliteration newly form capillary . Consequently mesenchyme stop proliferate , form marginal tissue . The artery vein margin drain blood capillary , small arteriovenous anastomosis form shunt . The endothelium new vessel also permeable immature incomplete . The capillary bed shunt largely obliterate , cause anomaly pressure responsible dilation tortuosity , microaneurysms , neovascularization result exudative haemorrhagic phenomenon possibility develop vitreous traction retinal detachment . This represent active phase disease , often regress spontaneously , magnitude depend precocity hyperoxia . The evolution could regression , scar , frequently , combination two . During pregnancy , percentage fatty acid maternal plasma increase 51 % . The polyunsaturated fatty acid significantly prone oxidation , change plasma level affect status antioxidant system pregnant consequently newborn . Several study report increased susceptibility peroxidation polyunsaturated fatty acid pregnancy accompany equivalent increase plasma tocopherol level level decrease dramatically immediately birth . Plasma antioxidant level newborn find low compare mother . Tocopherols carotenoid level significantly low umbilical cord record maternal plasma concentration polyunsaturated fatty acid newborn high mother . Many scientific study also show increase interest oxidative stress reactive oxygen specie accumulate birth . OS assess quantification thiobarbituric acid reactive specie ( TBRS ) plasma . TBRS level significantly increase premature infant exposure blue light 96 hour . Studies premature infant show correlation low plasma level antioxidant increase risk free-radical relates disease . Therefore could useful increase antioxidant defense infant order restore redox unbalance prevent damage cause prolonged exposure high level free radical reactive oxygen specie . Oxidative stress consider one main determinant retinal damage age-related disease . A proper balance oxidant antioxidant factor may help prevent reduce eye damage occur newborn , especially preterm infant , ROP . Indeed preterm baby often expose potentially harmful concentration oxygen due respiratory problem undergo phototherapy high intensity blue light . These therapy source free radical . Lutein zeaxanthin macular pigment , may play important role protect eye newborn damage light thanks ability absorb blue light antioxidant action . Lutein increase macular pigment density protect two synergistic mechanism : absorption blue light reach sensitive retinal structure , namely photoreceptors induce photochemical damage , quencing effect determines neutralization singlet oxygen free radical . There many evidence suggest protective effect lutein photo-oxidation damage adult ( Leeuwen 2006 , AREDS 1 , AREDS 2 ) . Lutein zeaxanthin present umbilical cord several study show direct correlation mother newborn plasma level lutein . Lutein also present breast milk concentration three time higher carotenoid plasma concentration . There also correlation plasma level lutein mother level breastfed infant . Studies infant show carotenoid level first four/six month life low . This probably due fact infant diet entirely make milk without solid food ( green leafy vegetable ) source nutrient . Children breastfed high lutein plasma level child feed formula milk . The different type formula milk currently enrich carotenoid content lutein zeaxanthin low , except formulation prepare use egg homogenate sell Italy . Breast milk therefore source lutein infant wean , breastfeed important primary source nutrient proper development protection vision . Considering correlation lutein content plasma breast milk lower lutein level milk already six day birth , really important take food rich lutein lactation . A diet enriched lutein especially important mother premature low birth weight newborn . Indeed premature underweight child need many nutrient essential rapid growth receive highly nutritious element energy transfer mother last week gestation . Moreover , gastrointestinal renal function fully develop could reduce absorption retention micronutrient include important antioxidant protect infant exposure high level free radical produce excess birth often result resuscitation technics use . Breastfeeding important intake antioxidant defense newborn nutritional status mother play certainly key role affect nutritional status infant , especially status soluble nutrient lutein zeaxanthin . The preparation lutein zeaxanthin never gastrointestinal systemic toxic effect humans supplementation . In recent study , adverse effect administration 20 mg/day lutein zeaxanthin administer 6 month interaction fat-soluble nutrient report .</detailed_description>
