	<detailed_description>Many overweight obese people lose weight month , difficulty maintain weight loss long term . One explanation poor long-term outcome weight-loss diet relate behavior , motivation adhere restrictive regimen typically diminishes time . An alternative explanation weight loss elicits biological adaptation - specifically decline energy expenditure increase hunger - promote weight regain . The purpose study evaluate effect dietary composition energy expenditure risk chronic disease , also explore physiological mechanism underlie effect . The study perform collaboration Framingham State University , provide novel feasible method feed subject din hall monitor compliance . Following 12±2 % weight loss standard run-in diet , 150 adult ( age 18 65 year ) randomly assign one three weight-loss maintenance diet control protein content ( 20 % energy ) vary widely dietary carbohydrate-to-fat ratio : Low-carbohydrate ( 20 % energy carbohydrate , 60 % fat ) , Moderate- carbohydrate ( 40 % carbohydrate , 40 % fat ) , High-carbohydrate ( 60 % carbohydrate , 20 % fat ) . During weight-loss maintenance phase , energy intake adjust prevent change body weight . The primary outcome change total energy expenditure ( indirect calorimetry use stable isotope ) 20 week . Secondary outcome weight maintenance include energy intake , rest energy expenditure ( indirect calorimetry use respiratory gas exchange ) , physical activity ( accelerometry ) , measure insulin resistance skeletal muscle work efficiency , component metabolic syndrome , hormonal metabolic measure might inform understanding physiological mechanism . We also assess voluntary food intake weight change 2-week ad libitum feed phase , objective measure dietary effect hunger . The analytic framework address study hypothesis repeated-measures analysis variance , adjustment covariates ( sex , race , ethnicity , age , anthropometrics , insulin sensitivity secretion , obesity-related gene ) . We also test covariate effect modification ( covariate × diet interaction ) .</detailed_description>
