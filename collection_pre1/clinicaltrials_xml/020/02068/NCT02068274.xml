	<detailed_description>1 . Aim study 1.1 Background Opioids effective instrument patient acute chronic pain . Their route administration range transdermal subcutaneous application Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( IV-PCA ) . The use IV-PCA-pumps considerable advantage include decreased delay administration opioids time request , individual dose interval , self -control therapy , rapidity ease dose titration . These potential benefit , however balance need careful assessment adverse effect , include decrease quality life patient 's sedation , constipation possible episode bradypnoea desaturation , eventually lead respiratory depression ( RD ) require treatment . Often describe safety feature help prevent overdose PCA bolus dose , delay , lockout interval . Even though risk serious , potentially life threaten complication use IV-PCA without background infusion describe low ( 0.24 % ) compare method opioid delivery , adverse effect like worry degree hypoxemia bradypnoea occur often remain undetected due lack continuous monitoring . One possible cause patient harm medication error associate PCA administration , common form PCA error , significant source preventable patient morbidity hospital resource utilization . But patient IV-PCA-pumps risk harm , patient treat opioids ( distinguished formulation ; oral , dermal , intravenous , short-acting , continuous-release ) due fear adverse effect respiratory depression . It cause self-potentiating `` vicious cycle '' may result respiratory arrest : Hypoventilation impairs gas exchange , result increased carbon dioxide , decrease oxygen pH ( respiratory acidosis ) . In turn , suppression chemoreceptor response increase carbon dioxide level reduces normally protective central response would increase breathe effort . The individual patient response particular dose opioids depend diagnosed unrecognized comorbidities . Clinical experience show possible prospectively identify patient may increase risk . Conventional opioid monitoring protocol may fail detect frequent episode bradypnoea desaturation measure respiratory rate ( RR ) Saturation Peripheral Oxygen ( SpO2 ) even low respiratory rate SpO2 usually maintain , pulse oxymetry might fail detect respiratory deterioration , particularly patient receive supplemental oxygen . Therefore , continuous monitoring could consider sensitive , especially contain measurement Partial Pressure Carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) , good parameter monitor ventilatory function . As American Society Anesthesiologists emphasize , ventilation oxygenation must consider separate physiologic process . Ventilatory function monitor PCO2 whereas oxygenation express SpO2 . Thus , even continuous monitor heart rate SpO2 pulse oxymetry substitute monitor respiratory rate ( RR ) PCO2 . By capnographic monitoring patient 's desaturation might anticipate decrease RR thus rise PCO2 level baseline occur . Hence , adjustment medication dos make earlier serious adverse event may prevent . The 'gold standard ' method measure arterial partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) still arterial blood gas analysis . But arterial sampling include catheterization intermittent arterial puncture invasive expensive associate pain discomfort patient . Therefore cutaneous carbon dioxide tension ( PcCO2 ) measurement suggest used non-invasive surrogate measure PaCO2 . Transcutaneous measurement CO2 ( tcPCO2 ) base observation gas high tissue solubility diffusion skin . This permit non-invasive measurement arterial PCO2 . But despite increase interest , role PCO2 real measure respiratory function appear widely underestimate . The reason PCO2 play minor role may refer different cause : For many year measurement tcPCO2 inaccurate impracticable sensor fragile expensive , require frequent calibration change skin site sensor avoid thermal injury skin . But modern device feature like automatic calibration , short response equilibration time . Combined cutaneous capnography ( tcPCO2 ) oxymetry ( SpO2 ) gather single earlobe sensor . Based Severinghaus principle , tcPCO2 measure sensor heat surface electrode skin . The local hyperaemia induces increase arterial blood dermal capillary bed sensor . The usefulness method limit clinical situation include profound peripheral vasoconstriction circulatory centralization shock skin edema . Chhajed et al . could show good agreement value obtain use combined oxymetry transcutaneous capnography arterial blood gas analyse large study sample . In conclusion , SpO2 , tcPCO2 , important clinical parameter use conjunction . SpO2 reflect oxygenation , tcPCO2 reflect ventilation ; first still normal second may herald early change respiratory status . Capnography may provide early indication opioid-induced respiratory depression . It important monitor change baseline tcPCO2 level . As tcPCO2 level start increase , early intervention change medication make . The present study aim examine combine oxymetry transcutaneous capnography use single earlobe sensor ( V-Sign™ , Sentec AG , Therwil , Switzerland ) chronic pain patient treat opioids non-invasive monitoring ventilation need ventilatory disturbance suspect . The Sentec Monitoring System already use year clinical setting , instance : Neonatology , Pneumology Surgery , etc . The intention study prove feasibility use sensor hospital setting may allow avoid oversedation lead decreased activity troublesome adverse effect . This may , potentially , improve patient 's quality life . 1.2 Specific aim We want show continuous monitoring use combine transcutaneous capnography oxymetry allow good support patient treat opioids chronic pain regard pain quality possible adverse event . Furthermore want use study feasibility trial generate new hypothesis possible future study . 1.3 Hypothesis Continuous monitor tcPCO2 SPO2 may help warrant good support patient opioid administration minimal additional effort .
