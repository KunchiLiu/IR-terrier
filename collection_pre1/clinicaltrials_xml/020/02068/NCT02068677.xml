	<detailed_description>1 . All adult patient radiologically consistent pancreatic carcinoma refer Florida Hospital undergo EUS stag diagnostic FNA pancreatic mass lesion eligible study entry . A history physical examination perform determine character quality pain evaluate contraindication EUS perform . 2 . Written inform consent study participation obtain time consent procedure study compare standard care treatment option regular treatment setting . Then , give write informed consent prior index procedure , patient complete follow write assessment : 1 . Standardized 11-point continuous visual analog pain scale ( 12 ) 2 . Quality life instrument : Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy , Pancreatic Cancer ( FACT-PA ) ( i.e . QLQ-30 PAN-26 ) ( 13 ) 3 . Pain medication usage prior 2 day ( convert equianalgesic dos morphine ) 3 . EUS perform standard fashion one three experienced endoscopists 4 . Eligible patient include pancreatic carcinoma confirm FNA perform EUS EUS CT staging show unresectability tumor . Cytology evaluation FNA routinely provide procedure pathologist endoscopy room institution . During EUS , include patient receive CPN standard fashion . Whether sympathetic response occur CPN , document . Sympathetic response define change heart rate &gt; 10 bpm change BP &lt; 10mmHg . The technique EUS-CPN follow : - Using curvilinear array echoendosocpe , region celiac plexus visualize less curvature stomach follow aorta origin main celiac artery . It trace , use counter-clockwise rotation , bifurcation splenic hepatic artery , Doppler US control need . - CPN undertaken celiac space locate aorta celiac artery origin . - A 20-gauge fenestrated CPN needle use , tip place slightly anterior cephalic origin celiac artery . - Aspiration first perform ensure vascular puncture occur . - Bupivacaine inject first , follow alcohol . - Patients observe 2 4 hour , careful monitoring pulse , blood pressure temperature . 5 . Following EUS , patient discharge call home research nurse 24 hour evidence pancreatitis complication procedure , Clinical research nurse* also contact patient 1 , 2 , 4 week EUS monthly death 1 year . Clinical research nurse* blind documentation sympathetic response . Assessment pain scale , QOL , medication use side effect perform . 6 . Following CPN , EUS operator actively involved patient care . 7 . Medical decision patient make patient 's primary physician oncologist . 8 . Patient refer rescue CPN patient 's primary physician oncologist feel warrant .</detailed_description>
