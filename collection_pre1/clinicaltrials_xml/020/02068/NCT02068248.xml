	<brief_summary>Research past several decade link intake dietary fiber lower blood cholesterol level . The distinction soluble insoluble fiber fraction emerge shortly general consensus soluble fiber posse capacity low cholesterol . Since discovery cholesterol lower effect soluble dietary fiber , much debate degree cholesterol reduction fiber . In order handle inconsistency full systematic review publish literature conduct Brown et . al ( 1999 ) . Results meta-analysis , conclude 'increasing soluble fiber make small contribution lower cholesterol . ' Research constantly progress new research finding may always consistent old data . For example , result new research challenge previously approve health claim soy food fatty acid . This major public health concern clinical evidence reliable , could lead harm . Since publication meta-analysis Brown et . al ( 1999 ) decade ago , scientist continue research effect soluble fiber cholesterol level new technology trial design , therefore crucial revisit question update literature effect viscous soluble dietary fiber serum cholesterol level . A series meta-analyses perform assess link viscous dietary fiber serum cholesterol level . Nutritionists consider fiber integral part diet disease . Results meta-analyses help address question whether viscous soluble fiber role lower serum cholesterol level .</brief_summary>
