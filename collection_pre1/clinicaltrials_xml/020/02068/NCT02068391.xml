	<brief_summary>Silent ischemic , also know `` covert stroke vascular disease '' ( CSVD ) , contribute neurological deficit cause damage small blood vessel brain . CSVD occur six ten time often acute stroke . It mislead think , however , CSVD inevitable part `` get old '' people CSVD high risk develop acute stroke dementia . In fact , people CSVD lesion volume likely develop day day problem plan , decision-making speed thinking . Unfortunately , proven therapy design address CSVD . We propose test whether aerobic exercise intervention combat CSVD disease fundamentally blood flow problem may improve aerobic exercise . We recruit CSVD adult moderate severe lesion burden use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain term structure , perfusion function . Participants randomly assign either establish aerobic exercise program control stretch program . Both group take part lab exercise session , design monitor progress assess adherence program . The duration intensity exercise increase participant progress . We use activity log book , phone call extra `` booster '' exercise session , need , maximize retention adherence . We aim show aerobic exercise increase cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) frontal-subcortical grey matter , support regional tissue growth , improve cognitive function CSVD adults substantial risk acute stroke dementia . A positive outcome research provide strong support additional clinical trial aim sustain cognition maintain independent living .</brief_summary>
