	<brief_summary>Lung cancer second common cancer United Kingdom around 40,000 new case diagnose every year . Lung cancer associate poor prognosis ( &lt; 10 % patient survival 5 year ) . New strategy urgently need improve survival group patient . The effective common treatment lung cancer radiotherapy ( either alone combined chemotherapy and/or surgery ) generally high dos radiotherapy give tumour . However , increase radiotherapy dose carry increase risk damage surround healthy tissue . Damage minimise reduce movement within lung , cause factor breathe patient motion , treatment . This study test new medical device develop monitor help patient control breathe movement treatment . Optical sensor detect motion patient 's torso feed back patient form visual aid allow regulate breathing maintain ideal treatment position . The device already show reduce motion healthy volunteer . In study investigator hope demonstrate visual aid tolerable lung cancer patient . The investigator additionally aim show device help reduce movement chest also lung tumour , leading improvement treatment result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Feedback With Optical Sensing - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study participant undergo 4 imaging session ( one training session 3 study session ) participant ask use optical feedback display regulate breathing pattern . The training session study session proceed follow : - The patient receive standard treatment include pre-treatment Cone Beam CT ( CBCT ) imaging . - The patient allow get treatment couch relax whilst sensor device turn . - The patient set-up . - The patient ask free-breathe ( i.e . breathe normally ) surface motion record use optical sensor . The first 30 second use generate reference surface use throughout rest process . A 4D CBCT scan acquire free-breathing ass tumour motion . - The patient ask control breathe use feedback display data record ~1:30 minute case . - A 4D CBCT scan acquire controlled breathing traffic light feedback visualization scheme ass tumour motion .</detailed_description>
