	<brief_title>World Trade Center Adolescent Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assess potential longer-latency cardiometabolic pulmonary effect early life exposure World Trade Center ( WTC ) disaster , identify opportunity early identification WTC-related health consequence . Preliminary data investigator regularly provide clinical care child lived/attended school near WTC site identify decrement spirometry associate dust cloud exposure , remarkably high frequency cardiometabolic risk factor . Findings clinically , self-selected population extrapolate entire population child expose disaster nonetheless suggest study warrant possible metabolic cardiovascular consequence WTC exposure . If associate WTC exposure large , representative sample , two new innovative technique , oscillometry pulse wave velocity assessment , hold great promise earlier detection WTC-related pulmonary cardiometabolic disease , dietary , environmental medication intervention may prevent disease progression later life . The study recruit 225 adolescent respond WTC Health Registry ( WTCHR ) , representative pediatric population best-characterized environmental exposure standpoint . Connecting study WTCHR also present efficiency federal resource utilization , provide objective clinical data support self-reported finding increase persistent respiratory symptom capture WTCHR , thereby improve reliability registry data . We compare pulmonary cardiometabolic outcome carefully match ( age , race/ethnicity , gender , socioeconomic status ) unexposed control ( resident/attending school south Houston Street September 11 , 2001 ) population NYU School Medicine affiliate primary care ( private public clinic ) .</detailed_description>
