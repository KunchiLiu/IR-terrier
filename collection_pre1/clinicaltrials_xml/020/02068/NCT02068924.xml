Nevertheless , observe high pregnancy rate transfer fresh blastocyst transfer thaw blastocyst frozen slow freezing procedure . However recent embryo freezing technique ( vitrification ) seem show significant high pregnancy rate blastocyst frozen method . To knowledge , publication report outcome single embryo transfer blastocyst stage prospective randomize comparative study include result fresh frozen/thawed blastocyst two method ( slow freezing vs. vitrification ) case single embryo transfer . Therefore , aim study analyze whether extended culture Day-2 top embryo blastocyst-stage may improve cumulative delivery rate vitro fertilization program Single Embryo Transfer policy prospective randomize study integrate transfer fresh frozen/thawed embryos use slow freezing versus vitrification procedure .</brief_summary>
