	<brief_title>A National Phase IV Study With Ipilimumab Patients With Advanced Malignant Melanoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Norway ipilimumab ( Yervoy® ) available treat patient advance , locally advanced metastatic melanoma , approve reimbursement recently . The Department Health Social Services decide Norway national Phase IV interventional study examine survival Quality Life perform . In addition research project launch aim isolate biological marker identify patient would benefit ipilimumab therapy . Because ipilimumab new therapeutic agent novel mechanism action , important understand scope impact widely available treatment option , i.e . real-world experience . Treatment guideline clinical research provide information unresectable metastatic melanoma treat ipilimumab Adverse Events manage , may reflect actually occur clinical practice compare controlled trial . The result study provide extensive understanding safety profile ipilimumab oncology practice Norway patient may differ substantially include clinical trial program . In addition , study result provide information treatment pattern , patient-reported outcome , clinical outcome survival disease progression may influence ipilimumab . The propose study objective : assessment safety ipilimumab analysis health outcome , routine clinical practice , ensure appropriate patient provider utilization ipilimumab .</detailed_description>
