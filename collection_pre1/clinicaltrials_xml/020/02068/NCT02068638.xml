	<brief_summary>Whereas physical activity clearly result improvement glycemic control type 2 diabetes , individual type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) impact exercise blood sugar control complex . In type 1 diabetes T1DM inability reduce exogenous insulin level exercise key factor contributes increase risk exercise-induced hypoglycemia . Since rapid adaptation insulin dosage may especially difficult patient multiple daily injection regimen , alternative strategy require improve exercise-associated glucose stability . There increase evidence combination steady state continuous low moderate intensity exercise short burst high intensity exertion ( eg form sprint ) effective , well tolerate , novel strategy prevent exercise-related hypoglycemia . A promising option stabilize blood sugar level exercise may ingestion fructose addition glucose form sport drink .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Regular physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity healthy subject patient diabetes mellitus . However , effect physical activity glucose control undoubtedly beneficial patient type 2 diabetes , exercise cause major disturbance blood glucose level type 1 diabetic individual . Hypoglycemia common complication patient T1DM engage endurance activity run cycling . So far limited strategy suggest improve exercise-related blood sugar self-management . Current recommendation focus variation timing dosage insulin administration adjustment carbohydrate intake . Since rapid adaptation insulin dosage may difficult , alternative strategy improve exercise-related glucose stability require . Increasing evidence suggest intermittent high intensity exercise ( IHE ) , trigger counterregulatory hormone response , may counter-balance risk exercise-associated hypoglycemia . However , previous study investigate IHE T1DM limit heterogeneous study population , comparably short exercise protocol , deficit standardization procedure . In addition , comprehensive assessment underlie fuel metabolism perform far . As consequence , result remain controversial interpretation well applicability restrict . A alternative strategy maintain stable glycemia exercise may deduce recent study non-diabetic individual suggest combine ingestion fructose glucose exercise provide liver increased amount gluconeogenic precursor , thereby reduce consumption endogenous glycogen stores.Moreover , conversion fructose glucose lactate may provide constant efficient fuel work muscle . However , study assess impact fructose ingestion exercise patient T1DM perform far . Objective The investigator aim assess impact two novel non-pharmaceutical easily feasible approach exercise-related blood glucose stability underlie exercise-related fuel metabolism patient T1DM . Substudy A assess influence exercise-related glycemia fuel metabolism IHE protocol compare iso-energetic continuous exercise ( CONT ) . It investigate whether individual reach stable blood glucose level engage IHE compare CONT . Substudy B investigate whether fuel patient mixed oral 1:1 glucose-fructose carbohydrate solution maintain glucose value within stable range compare carbohydrate supplementation glucose alone . Methods Blood glucose level , counterregulatory hormone , metabolite lactate free fatty acid well inflammatory biomarkers assess regular blood sampling . By mean oral intravenously give stable isotope ( U-13 C glucose 2H glucose ) exercise-related glucose kinetics investigate . Exercise-induced glycogen consumption measure use magnetic resonance spectroscopy technology . Late glycemic excursion record continuous glucose monitoring system . In order validate 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measurement hepatic myocellular glycogen content pre-study involve 10 patient equal number match healthy control perform ( validation reproducibility study ) .</detailed_description>
