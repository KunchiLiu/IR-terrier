	<brief_summary>This multi-center , single-arm , open-label study virological response chronic HBV infection pegyinterferon-alfa-2a among patient achieve HBeAg seroconversion nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NA ) treatment . The primary endpoint study investigate sustain response ( HBeAg seroconversion HBV DNA &lt; 2000 IU/ml ) peginterferon 24 week end treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label Trial 48-week Peginterferon Alfa-2a ( PEGASYS ) Assess Sustained Response Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With HBeAg Seroconversion Nucleot ( ) Ide Analogue Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B commonest cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma Hong Kong . Treatment interferon nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NA ) reduce risk HCC . NA common used medication Hong Kong . However , patient require long-term treatment premature drug cessation may lead hepatitis relapse . Under current regional guideline , patient positive hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) treat NA consider stop treatment HBeAg seroconversion develop least 12 month . However , 30-50 % patient may develop virological relapse and/or HBeAg reversion cessation treatment . On hand , interferon-based treatment much durable response . HBeAg seroconversion maintain 80 % patient successful treatment peginterferon . Upon long-term follow-up , peginterferon-treated patient also likely achieve hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) seroclearance , condition close cure chronic hepatitis B .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male &amp; female patient &gt; = 18 &lt; 70 year age Positive HBeAg start NA treatment Treated single NA ( lamivudine , adefovir , entecavir tenofovir ) 6 month 5 year Developed HBeAg seroconversion ( HBeAg negative antHBe negative ) undetectable HBV DNA PCR base assay NA treatment . Negative urine serum pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) document within 24hour period prior first dose test drug . Additionally , female must use reliable contraception study 3 month treatment completion Evidence decompensated liver disease ( Childs BC ) , hepatocellular carcinoma , preexist severe depression psychiatric disease , significant cardiac disease , significant renal disease , seizure disorder severe retinopathy . receive telbivudine antiviral therapy receive one NA past . receive interferon peginterferon treatment past . receive antiviral therapy systemic antiviral , antineoplastic immunomodulatory treatment ( include supraphysiologic dos steroid radiation ) within past 6 month . Positive test screening antiHIV , antiHCV . Patients expect need systemic antiviral therapy provide study time participation study also exclude . Exception : patient limited ( &lt; =7 day ) course acyclovir herpetic lesion 1 month prior first administration test drug exclude . Serum total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal screening . History evidence bleed esophageal varix condition consistent decompensated liver disease . History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease HBV ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , metabolic liver disease include Wilson 's alpha1antitrypsin deficiency , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure , thalassemia ) . Women ongoing pregnancy breast feeding . Neutrophil count &lt; 1500 cells/mm3 platelet count &lt; 90,000 cells/mm3 screening . Hemoglobin &lt; 11.5 g/dL female &lt; 12.5 g/dL men screen . Serum creatinine level &gt; 120 umol/ml men &gt; 105 umol/ml woman screen . History severe psychiatric disease , especially depression . Severe psychiatric disease define major depression psychosis , period treatment antidepressant medication major tranquilizer therapeutic dos depression psychosis least 3 month , suicidal attempt , hospitalization psychiatric disease , period disability due psychiatric disease . History immunologically mediate disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , lupus erythematosus , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , scleroderma , severe psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis ) . History evidence chronic pulmonary disease associate functional limitation . Severe cardiac disease ( e.g. , NYHA Functional Class III IV , myocardial infarction within 6 month , ventricular tachyarrhythmias require ongoing treatment , unstable angina significant cardiovascular disease ) . History severe seizure disorder current anticonvulsant use . Evidence active suspect cancer history malignancy risk recurrence &gt; =20 % within 2 year . Patients lesion suspicious hepatic malignancy screen image study eligible likelihood carcinoma &lt; =10 % follow appropriate evaluation . History receive systemic antineoplastic ( include radiation ) immunomodulatory treatment ( include systemic corticosteroid ) &lt; =6 month prior first dose study drug expectation treatment need time study . Major organ transplantation . Thyroid disease thyroid function poorly control prescribed medication . Patients abnormal thyroid stimulate hormone T4 concentration , elevation antibody thyroid peroxidase clinical manifestation thyroid disease exclude . History evidence severe retinopathy ( e.g . CMV retinitis , macula degeneration ) clinically relevant ophthalmological disorder due diabetes mellitus hypertension Inability unwillingness provide inform consent abide requirement study . History evidence severe illness condition would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study . Patients value alphafetoprotein &gt; 100 ng/mL exclude , unless stability ( le 10 % increase ) document least previous 3 month . Evidence drug and/or alcohol abuse ( 20g/day woman &amp; 30g/day men ) . Patients include another trial give investigational drug within 12 week prior screen Any known history hypersensitivity interferon .</criteria>
