	<brief_summary>AsthmaVent multi-center study , investigate association indoor air quality childhood asthma . In Denmark , spend time indoors . Our house build airtight save energy difficult ventilate . We thus expose indoor air ever . We know indoor air contain many different component affect airway inappropriately particularly child asthma , sensitive airway sensitive component . The AsthmaVent project examine whether increase ventilation able improve indoor environment extent asthma disease control , child asthma house dust mite allergy improves , result need less medication . Previous study point towards beneficial effect mechanical ventilation , indoor air quality child 's health quality life . There currently consensus area , study far large good enough confidently determine effect . This project big design take account source error see previous study topic . We include , 3-year period ( 2012-2014 ) , total 80 child asthma house dust mite allergy age 6-18 year , pediatric department Aarhus , Odense , Kolding , Randers Herning . They divide two group , receive either active ventilation placebo ventilation , mean non-functioning ventilation system recirculates air room . Ventilation system instal fall winter ventilate child 's bedroom 9 month . Indoor air quality asthma control assess every 3 month , home visit air quality allergen level house dust mites study visit outpatient clinic control asthma parameter quality life . The project involve collaboration several institution interest indoor air quality relation allergy asthma great expertise field.The project initiate CISBO ( Centre Indoor Environment Health Dwellings ) , center consist several institution Denmark deal indoor environment : Department Public Health Aarhus University University Copenhagen , Danish Building Research Institute Technical University Denmark . Since asthma common chronic childhood disease Denmark since development allergy asthma high social personal cost , important society individual family , find whether simply improve indoor air quality increase ventilation lead improvement asthma disease control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim project investigate whether increase ventilation able improve indoor air quality thereby asthma disease control child asthma house dust mite allergy . Hypotheses : 1 . An increased ventilation home reduce need inhale steroid child house dust mite allergy asthma . 2 . An increased ventilation home improve quality life child house dust mite allergy asthma . 3 . An increased ventilation home improve indoor environment thus improve asthma disease control child house dust mite allergy asthma . Materials method : The study randomize double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study . The intervention balance mechanical ventilation bedroom child asthma house dust mite allergy 9-months . Population : Over 3 year period ( 2012-2014 ) 80 family asthmatic child age 6-18 year include out-patient clinic child 's department University Hospitals Aarhus Odense regional hospital Kolding , Randers Herning . Families also include private pediatric clinic Aarhus . Randomization : After inclusion child randomize either active ventilation placebo ventilation . Randomization do block 4 center . Intervention : The ventilation unit Type DUPLEX 370 EC4.D DUPLEX 370 instal fall run continuously 9 month . The ventilation system place outside house provide filter conditioned air child 's bedroom , insulated pipe mount window opening . The window opening build specifically purpose form thermo plate replace window glass . The unit provide bedroom least 2-3 air change per hour . The placebo unit ( DUPLEX 370 ) completely similar installation recirculates air room instead replace . We recommend parent wash duvet pillow every 3 month . Data collection : Data child 's health collect every 3 month family visit outpatient clinic . The child see specialist doctor . At home visit , also every 3 month , data concern indoor air quality collect .</detailed_description>
