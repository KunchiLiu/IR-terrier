	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety combination therapy vemurafenib trientine patient BRAF mutate metastatic melanoma . Vemurafenib drug currently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) treat adult patient melanoma spread part body remove surgery . It use patient whose cancer change ( mutation ) `` BRAF '' gene . Preclinical data suggest use copper chelator ( reducer ) strategy block cellular signaling activity would result anti-tumor effect ( slow tumor growth ) . Trientine copper chelator FDA approve treatment Wilson 's disease ( disease copper metabolism ) generally well tolerate . It work bind copper help remove body . Trientine FDA approve treatment melanoma use study investigational . `` Investigational '' mean study drug still test research study . All patient receive vemurafenib 960mg PO twice daily continuous dose combination trientine escalate dos . The dose trientine depend portion study . In order participate study , patient must test positive change ( mutation ) BRAF gene .</brief_summary>
