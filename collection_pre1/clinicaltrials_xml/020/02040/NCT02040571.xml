	<detailed_description>At present , decision regard insulin dose make patient intermittent support medical team . Even glucose sensor augment insulin pump therapy ( SAPT ) , represent advanced technology currently available , emotional intellectual demand place upon patient well-educated , intelligent diligent patient often unable perfectly match insulin delivery varying requirement . SAPT improve glycaemia comparison insulin pump therapy alone though significant proportion patient still meet target HbA1c ( &lt; 7.0 % ) . A Closed Loop ( CL ) system whereby computerise algorithm review continuous glucose information determine T1D patient 's insulin requirement control insulin delivery potentially major impact upon acute chronic complication diabetes well upon quality life . Overnight glycaemic control , without added challenge meal , physical activity stress , realistic initial application CL clinical practice . This study aim evaluate insulin pump therapy overnight CL system comparison current best available technology represent SAPT Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) patient , hospital home . Outcomes interest include metabolic control performance Medtronic CL overnight system compare SAPT ( OL ) , Clinical Trials Centre ( CTC ) home setting ; relationship night-time day-time metabolic control CL OL nocturnal clinical , hormonal inflammatory factor may influence subsequent daytime metabolic control ; anti-insulin antibody titres dissociation constant ( Rd ) upon CL algorithm performance ; sleep quality , cognition , satisfaction treatment psychological parameter . A two phase randomise crossover study design employ first phase conduct single night clinical trial centre second phase 5 day ambulatory setting .</detailed_description>
