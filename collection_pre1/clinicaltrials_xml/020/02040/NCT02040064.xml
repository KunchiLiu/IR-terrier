	<brief_summary>This open-label phase 1 , safety , PK , preliminary efficacy study oral Gefitinib IV Tremelimumab previously treat NSCLC patient document evidence activate mutation EGFR gene fail treatment EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib Gefitinib . The primary objective phase I , determine safety tolerability oral Gefitinib combination escalate dos Tremelimumab establish recommend phase 2 dose . Secondary objective include evaluation , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , antitumor activity Gefitinib Tremelimumab combination . The exploratory objective evaluate biomarkers may correlate activity prospectively identify patient likely respond Tremelimumab Gefitinib . The biological rationale study even though disease progress likely EGFR sensitive clone , although diminished pressure EGFR TKI , still present . Therefore , withdraw inhibitory pressure EGFR TKI potentially allow regrowth EGFR sensitive cell . On hand , proliferation EGFR resistant clone need suppress another therapeutic approach . Until today association chemotherapy TKI EGFR demonstrate clinical benefit . Moreover , patient may receive chemotherapy likelihood chemosensitivity low . So , association Gefitinib immune checkpoint blockade attractive may result clinical benefit NSCLC EGFRmut .</brief_summary>
