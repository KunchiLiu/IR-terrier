	<brief_summary>This study propose evaluate use moderate hypofractionated proton therapy low intermediate risk prostate cancer patient . Quality life outcomes well gastrointestinal genitourinary early late toxicity analyze compare conventional proton therapy regimens . It think regimen produce comparable finding would result substantial health care cost saving , well , convenient patient .</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Pathological ( histologically ) proven diagnosis prostatic adenocarcinoma within 365 day ( 1 year ) prior study registration . History physical exam digital rectal exam prostate establish clinical stag Clinical stage T1T2c ( AJCC 7th edition ) within 90 day registration . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) &lt; 20 ng/mL within 90 day prior registration . Gleason Score &lt; 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 01 . Clinically negative lymph node evaluate image ( pelvic +/ abdominal CT MRI scan ) . Patients lymph node equivocal questionable image eligible without biopsy node ≤ 1.5 cm diameter ; node large image require negative biopsy eligibility , unless node know enlarge prior scan consider stable , per discretion treat physician . Patients must 18 year age old . Patient must able provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry . Willingness ability complete Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) Questionnaire . No evidence bone metastasis ( M0 ) bone scan within 60 day prior registration . Bone scan require patient enrol single intermediate risk factor , scan may obtain discretion treat physician . Patients 2 3 risk factor require negative bone scan eligibility . Equivocal bone scan finding allow plain film xrays negative metastasis . Patient able start proton therapy neoadjuvant hormonal therapy , recommend , within 12 week registration . No prior radiotherapy pelvic area . No prior prostate cancer therapy : prostatectomy , cryotherapy , chemotherapy hyperthermia . Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 , Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl acceptable . ) Obs . : Patients high risk factor , T3 , Gleason 810 PSA &gt; 20ng/mL consider candidate pelvic lymph node radiation treatment still consider eligible study . • Prior radiotherapy pelvic area . Prior prostate cancer therapy : prostatectomy , cryotherapy , hyperthermia . Prior systemic therapy ( chemotherapy ) prostate cancer . Evidence distant metastasis . Regional lymph node involvement . Previous concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy prostate cancer . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) definition . Note however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunecompromised patient .</criteria>
