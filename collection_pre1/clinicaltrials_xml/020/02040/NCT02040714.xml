	<detailed_description>Approximately 40 pediatric orthopaedic surgeon pediatric center US country agree participate database member International Perthes Study Group ( IPSG ) . TSRH lead center . Those agree participate seek IRB approval institution . Data collect prospectively enter REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) , browser-based research database . PROMIS questionnaires complete via online test system , NIH fund Assessment Center . For 6—8 age patient group , surgeon treat patient one follow three treatment regimen currently use practice ask participate study . 1 . Nonoperative management ( i.e. , without osteotomy ) ; 2 . Operative containment treatment ( femoral pelvic osteotomy Shelf acetabuloplasty ) render early stage disease process ( stage I ) ; , 3 . Operative containment treatment ( femoral pelvic osteotomy Shelf acetabuloplasty ) render later stage disease process ( stage II ) . For 8—11 patient age group , treatment regimen study : 1 . Nonoperative management ( i.e. , without osteotomy ) ; 2 . Operative containment treatment ( femoral pelvic osteotomy Shelf acetabuloplasty ) 6 week post-operative non-weight bearing ; , 3 . Operative containment treatment ( femoral pelvic osteotomy Shelf acetabuloplasty ) 6 month post-operative non-weight bearing . For &gt; 11 patient age group , know patient generally poor prognosis treatment work well . Thus , collect prospective data surgeon currently treat patient one follow alternative treatment regimens 5,6 : 1 . Core decompression multiple epiphyseal drilling necrotic femoral head ; , 2 . Hip arthrodiastasis ( application hinge hip distractor ) core decompression/multiple epiphyseal drilling . 3 . Non-operative management symptom non-weight bearing Physicians participate study determine prefer treatment arm age group enroll patient arm accord physician declare treatment preference age group . Patient family option elect nonoperative management even non-preferred treatment option physician . Information regard patient characteristic presentation , physical exam finding , response Perthes patient and/or outcomes questionnaire , result radiographic MR image study collect . Participants assign unique study number . A secure web application , REDCap , use capture store research information include de-identified radiographic MR image , clinical information , Perthes patient and/or outcome questionnaire response . All patient willing complete PROMIS questionnaires regardless group , treatment , stage disease . The administration instrument facilitate use online test platform , NIH-funded Assessment Center .
