	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation common procedure use pediatric intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Its use require almost always establishment sedation . Sedation generic term procedure , pharmacological , ensure physical psychological comfort safety patient admit intensive care unit . An inadequate sedation , insufficient excessive , common side effect , increase duration mechanical ventilation hospital-acquired infection ( particular , ventilator associate pneumonia ) , hemodynamic disorder , extubation failure accidental extubation , withdrawal syndrome , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . All complication increase mechanical ventilation time ICU length stay . Several study adult 's population show implementation sedation algorithm allow decrease incidence complication . We hypothetized duration mechanical ventilation would reduce nurse-implemented sedative management protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . During first period ( 15 month ) , protocol use . This period consist assess current analgesia-sedation procedure use pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) , associate collection medical socio-demographical data mechanical ventilation duration , sedation complication , PTSD development . The severity pathology evaluate use PIM2 POPC score . The sedation deepness determine use COMFORT-B scale . Eight week hospitalization , family phone assess child memory , anxious trouble , PTSD symptoms patient 18 month old . 2 . During transition period ( 6 month ) , nurse physician develop protocol undergo training use . During third period , nurse-implemented sedation use .
