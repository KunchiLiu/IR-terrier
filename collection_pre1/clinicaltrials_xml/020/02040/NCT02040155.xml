	<detailed_description>Brachytherapy curative treatment many malignancy , brachytherapy delivers high radiation dose small well-specified target within patient cancer . Yet current convenient , inexpensive , real time method confirm radiation dose deliver . There current monitoring fail-safe device radiation oncologists patient radiation dose becomes high , especially radiation sensitive organ , conversely target receives little dose.High dose-rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy highly advanced radiation-based cancer treatment , small radioactive source , Iridium-192 , place near tumor catheter channel . This provide high radiation dose tumor 5-15 minute precise location , minimize radiation exposure surround tissue organ . This protocol determine feasibility use novel nano-material base fiber-optic dosimeter ( nanoFOD ) device , dimension less 1 mm wide , measure real-time , pin-point , in-vivo radiation dose give radiation therapy treatment . The size device allow placement catheter channel near area interest , within already place brachytherapy delivery catheter .</detailed_description>
