	<brief_summary>This project evaluate impact resistance training synthesis release hormone growth factor musculoskeletal system extent communicative capacity influence glucose homeostasis In turn , contribution glucose regulation musculoskeletal system also evaluate . This small study serve pilot/feasibility study define protocol implementation resistance training intervention pediatric population . To establish feasibility , study population limit overweight African American boy age 7-11 year . In light well-established accolade resistance training , historical recommendation avoidance among pediatric population deter implementation resistance training intervention young adolescent . However , contemporary data indicate profound benefit resistance training skeletal system pre-adolescents lead Academy Sports Medicine , well various pediatric health interest group , support supervise program incorporate resistance training young child , emphasize large muscle core strengthening . To date , trial conduct pediatric population</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early adolescence ( pre-puberty ) associate many physiological change intersection metabolic pathway body composition core . Lifestyle behavior provide substantial influence rise sedentary behavior particularly among population exert profound disruption . Metabolic dysfunction associate limited activity thus limit strain muscle bone associate poor musculoskeletal health . Metabolic disturbance within system critical period development pre-puberty confers long-term health consequence . Communication across system reliant upon various hormone interact regulation glucose homeostasis , bone metabolism , muscle development . While well-established bone muscle growth dependent upon fuel utilization , factor secrete bone muscle recently show play interactive role glucose homeostasis . Data derive primarily animal model demonstrate maintenance physiological level promote optimal growth development , whereas hormone appear adverse effect level alter . While data animal compelling , translation human conduct . Speculatively , impair glucose homeostasis , much attributable decrease strain musculoskeletal system , promote impairment physiological role hormone . As result , disorder development may consequence , bone grow big yet impaired quality , delivery fuel muscle compromise . Obesity-induced perturbation metabolism tissue partition may add stress system , impair muscle function , power , performance overall quality . Strategies optimize protective effect musculoskeletal system may encompass force stress system via resistance training , know influence synthesis release hormone involve fuel delivery utilization muscle bone . The strategy propose target optimization musculoskeletal health , promote synthesis release musculoskeletal-derived signal provide protection metabolic health critical period development .</detailed_description>
