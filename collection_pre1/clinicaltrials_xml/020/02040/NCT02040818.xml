	<brief_summary>Patients undergo hemodialysis via tunneled catheter often develop bloodstream infection arise catheter . There several management option treatment infection , though best option clearly delineate . Standard care option include exchange catheter new one guide-wire instilling high concentration antibiotic directly catheter lumen . The investigator plan treat hemodialysis catheter bloodstream infection one two strategy : 1 . Use novel antibiotic lock solution Or 2 . Changing infected catheter new one . Both option comparable cure rate show medical literature . After obtain informed consent , patient randomize either treatment arm continue receive standard medical care . Specific Aim : To conduct randomized clinical trial demonstrate use novel antibiotic lock solution ( consist N-acetylcysteine , tigecycline heparin ) non-inferior guide-wire exchange treatment hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia .</brief_summary>
