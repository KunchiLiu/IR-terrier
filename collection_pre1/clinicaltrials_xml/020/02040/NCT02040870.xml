	<brief_title>LDK378 Adult Chinese Patients With ALK-rearranged ( ALK-positive ) Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Previously Treated With Crizotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II , open-label , multi-center study PK , safety , tolerability efficacy LDK378 assess adult Chinese patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC harboring confirm ALK rearrangement ( positive ) assess use Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit ( Abbott Molecular Inc. ) positive assess immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) test ( Ventana Medical Systems , Inc ) use rabbit monoclonal primary antibody assay ( D5F3 ) . Patients must demonstrate progression crizotinib treatment whether previously treat cytotoxic chemotherapy . Approximately 100 patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC carry ALK -rearrangement enrol study . The first 15 patient enrol study PK sample 120-hour 5-day PK run-in period follow single oral dose 750 mg. After PK run-in period , treatment period start LDK378 give start Cycle 1 Day 1 continuous daily oral dose 28-day cycle . Separated 15 patient , rest enrol patient receive LDK378 treatment 750 mg QD Cycle 1 Day 1 . Tumor response evaluate every 8 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) start first day treatment LDK378 time RECIST-defined PD investigator assessment , withdrawal consent follow-up , loss follow-up death .</detailed_description>
