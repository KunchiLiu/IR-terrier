	<detailed_description>Streptococcus pneumonia common bacterial pathogen community-acquired pneumonia child [ 1 ] . It may also cause meningitis , bloodstream infection acute otitis medium [ 1 ] . In 2005 , WHO estimate 1.6 million people year die pneumococcal disease , include 1 million child le 5 year old worldwide , particularly infant child le 2 year old [ 1 ] . Most death occur develop country [ 2 , 3 ] . Case fatality ratio high invasive infection range 5-20 % bacteremia 40-50 % meningitis . Among meningitis survivor , long-term neurologic sequela occur 25-56 % case [ 4 ] . Most pneumococcal infection treat effectively antibiotic , although meningitis still often result devastate outcomes . Over last 20 year , emergence antimicrobial resistance among S. pneumoniae complicates treatment infection . Penicillin co-trimoxazole resistance common many part world , include China [ 5-9 ] . Multidrug resistance also emerge best document industrialized country . Treatment failure due resistance document acute otitis medium , meningitis bloodstream infection [ 5-6 ] . Currently two pneumococcal vaccine license available . One 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 ) . However recommend child less 2 year old . Another one 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 ) use child 6 week 24 month age . PCV7 include capsular polysaccharide 7 serotypes ( 4,6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F ) , couple nontoxic variant diphtheria toxin , CRM197 . The vaccine contain 2 μg capsular polysaccharide serotypes 4,9V , 14 , 19F 23F ; 2 μg oligosaccharide 18C ; 4 μg capsular polysaccharide 6B ; 20 μg CRM197 ; 0.125 mg aluminum/0.5 ml dose aluminum phosphate adjuvant [ 10 ] . Since licensure PCV7 2000 , widely use infant toddler develop country . It demonstrate PCV7 provide great protection pneumococcal invasive disease ( meningitis , bloodstream infection ) , pneumonia otitis medium [ 11 , 12 ] . Routine use PCV7 US rapidly reduce rate invasive pneumococcal disease child . The impact vaccine note within 1 year introduction . According CDC 's Active Bacterial Core Surveillance ( ABCs ) incidence invasive pneumococcal disease among child &lt; 5 year drop 75 % 1998/1999 2005 ; disease cause vaccine-type strain fell 94 % 80 4.6 per 100,000 [ 13 , 14 ] . A multi-centre study hospitalize patient find 77 % few case child &lt; 2 year cause vaccine serotypes 2002 compare average number case 1994-2000 [ 15 ] . Surveillance data vaccine impact outside US currently limit . Data Calgary , Canada show 93 % reduction vaccine-type invasive disease child &lt; 2 year age [ 16 ] . In Australia , rate vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease reduce 78 % 2002 2006 child age 2 year [ 17 ] . In US , also find one dose PCV7 96 % effective invasive disease healthy child , 81 % effective child comorbid medical condition 76 % effective overall disease cause strain resistant penicillin [ 18 ] . PCV7 use also appear reduce non-invasive pneumococcal infection US , include otitis medium pneumonia [ 19-22 ] . Currently two immunization schedule : 3+1 2+1 schedule . In US , recommend give three dos infancy ( schedule 2 , 4 , 6 month ) plus one dose 12-15 month ( 3+1 schedule ) . Since several study demonstrate two dos may provide similar direct protection three conjugate dos infancy , recommend give two dos infancy plus booster dose 12 month European country include UK [ 23 , 24 ] . In China , recent serogroup distribution study out-patient department ( OPD ) patient acute upper respiratory infection show coverage PCV7 55 % nasopharyngeal carriage pneumococcus isolates , 75 % penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcus isolates 2000 2005 [ 25 ] , suggest PCV7 effective prevent pneumococcal infection . Since PCV7 license China May 2008 , data effectiveness . For immunization schedule , manufacturer PCV7 ( Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc ) recommend use 3+1 schedule China US . However , China may NOT enough resource mass vaccination develop country PCV7 expensive . Therefore , generate data China develop alternative immunization schedule , 2+1 , may great advantage save life use limited resource .</detailed_description>
