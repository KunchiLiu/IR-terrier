	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call Palbociclib combination endocrine therapy possible treatment hormone receptor positive breast cancer . - Palbociclib drug may stop cancer cell grow . Palbociclib block activity two closely related enzyme ( protein help chemical reaction body occur ) , call Cyclin D Kinases 4 6 ( CDK 4/6 ) . These protein part pathway , sequence step know regulate cell growth . Laboratory test suggest palbociclib may stop growth hormone receptor positive breast cancer . - Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth block estrogen stimulation . During study endocrine therapy either tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor . It standard care premenopausal woman take tamoxifen postmenopausal woman take either aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen diagnosis hormone receptor positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Palbociclib Combination With Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Hormone Receptor Positive , HER2 Negative Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm participant able participate study . The participant give dose diary treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day , time participant take Palbociclib day day 1-21 28 day cycle aromatase inhibitor participant already take day every day . The diary also include special instruction take study drug ( ) . All participant participate research study receive dose Palbociclib . While participate research study participant follow test procedure : - Clinical Exams : The participant physical exam first day month first three month therapy . After , participant physical exam every month end first year therapy . After first year , participant physical exam every 3 month second year therapy . During physical exam , participant ask question general health , question problem may experience , medication take . - Blood test : The participant blood drawn first fifteenth day first three month therapy . After , participant blood drawn every month remainder first year treatment every month end therapy . These test use determine participant side effect relate study drug . - Electrocardiograms ( EKG ) : The participant EKG perform first day first three month therapy . After , participant EKG every month end first year therapy . After first year therapy , participant EKG every 3 month second year therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) HER2 negative stage II ( except T2N0 ) stage III invasive breast cancer . Evaluation metastatic disease require absence symptom . Men pre postmenopausal woman eligible . Prior Treatment : Participants may receive ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy , must least 30 day last dose , grade 1 residual toxicity time screen . Participants may receive adjuvant radiotherapy , must least 30 day last dose , grade 1 residual toxicity time screen . If recent therapy surgery , participant must least 30 day definitive surgery active wound healing complication . Participants must demonstrate ability tolerate endocrine therapy prior successful completion least 1 month tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy without significant adverse event , opinion treat physician ongoing toxicity preclude ability continue tamoxifen AI least project 2 year continuous duration .
