	<brief_summary>The main purpose study assess clemastine remyelinating agent patient relapse form multiple sclerosis . The study also evaluate tolerability clemastine , originally approve first-generation antihistamine , patient multiple sclerosis . Study procedure include assessment evidence remyelination anterior visual pathway brain use electrophysiologic technique magnetic resonance imaging . The study also assess robustness stability clinical effect patient take clemastine 3 month . Patients study remain standard disease modify treatment course study . However , patient participate investigational new drug research study concurrently .</brief_summary>
