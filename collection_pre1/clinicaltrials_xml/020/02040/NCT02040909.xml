	<brief_summary>Newborns admit intensive care unit often require artificial ventilation . For purpose endotracheal tube need place trachea , procedure name endotracheal intubation . The newborn need sedate keep comfortable , stop move relax order enable success procedure . For sedation anesthetic agent name propofol often use . The used dose propofol properly study consequence patient under- -sedated propofol lead side effect hypotension . The current study aim find appropriate dose propofol newborn different gestational age different post-natal age . We use propofol different dos 5 include patient per age group analyze whether dose need increase decrease . The effect propofol extensively monitor study level sedation , quality intubation , stability patient en occurrence side effect . At end aim appropriate guideline propofol dos newborn age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Propofol Dosing ( Preterm ) Newborn Infants That Need Endotracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Propofol , rapidly act anaesthetic agent , currently use unlicensed clinical care ( preterm ) neonates sedative endotracheal intubation . Neonates receive propofol dos per kg bodyweight , independent developmental stage ( gestational age , postnatal age ) , morbidity , co-medication , etc . This related high failure rate intubation attempt lead hypotension around 40 percent patient . Propofol research newborn infant recently publish priority drug research list European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) . Propofol metabolism elimination ( PK : pharmacokinetics ) well propofol effect ( PD : pharmacodynamics ) highly depend stage development genetic make-up patient . This study base hypothesis currently use single dos propofol newborn infant optimize improve quality sedation increase safety patient . Objective : To determine effective safe age specific propofol dose guideline neonate different age group ( gestational age postnatal age ) . Secondary objective determine new age specific PK/PD ( pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ) , include specific propofol genotype ( pharmacogenetic analysis ) enable much good prediction effect side-effects propofol . Study design : Prospective single dose optimize dose validation study Study population : Neonates admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( gestational age 24 - 42 week , post natal age &lt; 28 day divide 8 different age group ) need ( semi- ) elective endotracheal intubation . Intervention ( applicable ) : Adapted propofol dose . Starting dose dependent effect previously include patient . Dose increase case insufficient sedation . Intubation start sedation level adequate ( titration additional propofol possible propofol fast act ) Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome appropriate dose propofol 8 different age group . Optimized propofol dos need relate adequate sedation , good quality intubation condition short term side effect . Secondary endpoint include evaluation cerebral perfusion , stress level short long term outcome include patient . The incorporation PK data genotype patient use make prediction model future patient include various important cofactor , related effect side effect propofol . Physiological behavioural response newborn explore find reliable validate neonatal sedation score intubation . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Propofol use standard care sedation intubation newborn infant . Drug metabolism , drug transporter drug receptor yet well develop ( preterm ) newborn infant . Therefore PK/PD much dependent developmental stage newborn infant though change age . This study therefore do another patient group ( instance old patient healthy volunteer ) . Internationally used propofol start dos newborn vary 1.0 2.5 mg/kg repeat necessary . The current study start propofol dose 1.0 mg/kg every age group . If study start dose insufficient , patient receive additional propofol dos ( 1.0 mg/kg ) adequate sedation acquire . No patient intubate adequate sedation reach . This possible propofol fast act ( 1-2 minute ) . If start dose turn insufficient 5 patient per group increase follow patient group . The effect initial propofol dose test find optimal propofol dose neonate different developmental stage . The study continue appropriate dose age group determine . The appropriate dos re-used another 5 patient per age group validate predetermine dos . Safety monitor intensively hypotension occurs immediately treat . The patient benefit intensive safety monitoring , side-effects detect earlier effectively treat . Included patient monitor non-invasive technique ( videotape , cranial ultrasound , aEEG , NIRS ) next standard intensive care monitor physiological parameter . Blood sample collect indwell arterial line routine blood sample normal patient care . An amount 1.7 ml blood ( 0.5 ml DNA analysis , 2 time 0.6 ml propofol PK analysis ) take possible . Two saliva sample cortisol analysis collect .</detailed_description>
