	<brief_summary>Unintentional fatal drug overdose ( OD ) 2nd lead cause accidental death general population . Fatal OD opioid analgesics specifically increased 400 % 1999 2008 , nonfatal overdose occurs rate 3-7 great fatal OD . Unintentional opioid OD public health crisis several societal population include drug user , patient treat chronic pain , elderly individual , adolescent , child . Educational intervention develop increase knowledge regard opioid OD risk factor , symptom , appropriate response , however randomize control evaluation intervention conduct . Within-subject evaluation report immediate sustain increase participant knowledge behavior change , yet program suffer limitation may limit widespread dissemination . Thus , urgent , critical need develop opioid OD educational intervention access broad audience , produce immediate sustained gain knowledge easily administer cost-effective way . This study develop web-based , computerized , interactive , opioid OD education train program incorporate multi-media learn component fluency train produce knowledge gain . This program evaluate use randomize , control comparison active intervention two control intervention . Participants recruit brief inpatient detoxification ( n=75 ) , receive intervention immediately upon complete detoxification ( post-treatment ) , complete 2 follow-up visit evaluate sustain knowledge . The primary outcome percent change baseline knowledge test administer immediately intervention , 1 3-month follow-up visit . Secondary outcome include self-reported behavior change participant acceptance intervention . The study hypothesis participant receive primary intervention evidence large increase knowledge gain retention time , compare control group . The rationale public health benefit research understated- project make available brief , empirically-supported intervention administer quickly easily within hundred setting ( e.g. , treatment center , prison jail , needle exchange center , primary care office , school ) , diverse patient population ( e.g. , drug user , chronic pain patient , elderly , student , child , parent ) .
