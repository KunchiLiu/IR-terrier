	<brief_summary>An identified hormone link bone kidney function Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 ( FGF23 ) . Data variation FGF23 level bone mineral metabolism child scarce . Currently assume meet mineral requirement skeleton serve body 's overall need . However , clear whether true , particularly growth . The contribution dietary factor directly link bone/kidney axis measurement intake ( via 24hr recall ) kidney nutrient clearance ( via serum urinary analysis ) include investigation . Findings serve springboard delineate specific mechanism system become disordered influenced diet . It expect adequacy nutrient know central role bone function optimize hormonal milieu crosstalk kidney . This effort allow ongoing investigation detect treat disturbance mineral metabolism relate kidney disease , specifically pediatric population broaden understand kidney disease , well chronic disease kidney health importance , diabetes osteoporosis . Findings research may stress importance achieve dietary adequacy essential establish optimal body composition trajectory , particularly puberty .</brief_summary>
