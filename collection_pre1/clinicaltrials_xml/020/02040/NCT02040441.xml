	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled prospective observational study . This study conduct 13 study center various European country . Approximately 3500 participant 18 75 year old Type 2 diabetes mellitus normoalbuminuria participate study . The study period 3 year ( exclude 6 week screen period ) . Depending risk score urinary protein pattern , participant stratify observational group interventional group . Either 5 ( low risk pattern , observational group ) 15 ( high risk pattern , interventional group ) office visit 1-3 hour duration schedule . The interventional group allocate one treatment group either receive spironolactone placebo . A placebo medicine without pharmaceutical substance . The allocation one two treatment group do random distribution procedure establish study start . The result urine sample Screening visit analyse urine proteomic pattern determine either low- high risk pattern determine study program . Participants low-risk pattern ( observational group ) ( approximately 80 % ) : During next three year , participant attend annual project visit , regular diabetes care perform three urine sample analyse albuminuria . Participants high-risk pattern ( intervention group ) ( approximately 20 % ) : Participants high-risk pattern randomization either spironolactone treatment placebo . The treatment one tablet oral use ta en day next three year . Four time year ( every 13th week ) study visit conduct include examination three urine sample albuminuria . This study aim : 1 . Confirm prospective multicenter study normoalbuminuric type 2 DM patient urinary proteome test identifies patient high risk development microalbuminuria . 2 . Demonstrate clinical utility test show aldosterone blockade high-risk patient reduce progression microalbuminuria comparison placebo , top standard treatment randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Prediction Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System Inhibition Prevention Of Early Diabetic nephRopathy In TYpe 2 Diabetic Patients With Normoalbuminuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) affect 9 % European population cost care patient DM account 15 % European health care budget expenditure . Al-most 90 % patient type 2 DM , absolute number expect rise parallel current obesity metabolic syndrome epidemic . Improved treatment reduce mortality prolong duration DM increase likelihood development late diabetic complication . Diabetic nephropathy one major late complication diabetes associate substantial cardiovascular morbidity mortality lead cause end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Western world . In clinical practice , renal impairment diagnose albuminuria proteinuria and/or change serum creatinine/creatinine clearance indicate alteration glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . However , inter-individual variability high , consequence , standard test moderate specificity sensitivity early stage disease , major limitation diagnosis early stage diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) . Development DN generally characterize increase urinary albumin excretion rate ( &gt; 300 mg/24 h 200 μg/min ) . Microalbuminuria ( 30-300 mg/24 h 20-200 μg/min ) consider risk factor early indicator future onset DN . Microalbuminuria regard early clinical marker renal damage . However , structural change kidney already occur stage microalbuminuria patient microalbuminuria high risk development renal disease , also increase morbidity mortality due cardiovascular disease . Blood pressure glycemic control pharmacotherapeutic intervention well life style intervention cornerstone type 2 DM management aim prevention microvascular complication . Specific therapy , particularly treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE ) angiotensin receptor antagonist ( ARB ) prevent progression overt proteinuria advance stage diabetic nephropathy recommend microalbuminuria present . Studies aim early prevention nephropathy start renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) block treatment normoalbuminuric patient give mixed often disappointing result . This might reflect large fraction normoalbuminuric patient may risk progression thereby reduce event rate power previous study . Early identification normoalbuminuric patient high risk development diabetic nephropathy could identify patient might benefit intervention increase blockade RAAS . Furthermore , blockade RAAS aldosterone blockade demonstrate reduce urinary albumin excretion 20-30 % top standard antihypertensive treatment include ACE ARB proteinuric type 1 2 diabetic patient , 60 % reduction see microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patient . Therefore , may also hold potential reduce risk development microalbuminuria high risk normoalbuminuric patient . CKD Biomarker panel Proteomics analysis large number protein polypeptide tissue body fluid . Capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry ( CE-MS ) enable reproducible robust high-resolution analysis several thousand low-molecular-weight urinary proteins/peptides one hour . Urine hold several advantage blood clinical proteomics . It collect non-invasively proteome relatively stable . Members consortium successfully identify urinary biomarker pattern include 273 peptide significantly associate chronic kidney disease ( CKD273 ) . Importantly , biomarker panel validate multicentric approach involve &gt; 1000 blind sample . The accuracy high ( 96 % sensitivity 98 % specificity ) , evaluate diabetic patient test-set . To test CKD273 pat-tern tool early detection DN , recently perform independent longitudinal study normoalbuminuric diabetic patient inclusion . The urinary CKD273 pattern distinguish progress patient non-progressing patient . The corresponding receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analysis result area curve ( AUC ) 0.925 assume prevalence 30 % DN . The positive predictive value 97 % negative predictive value 88 % . The specificity CKD273 pattern evaluate patient without evidence renal impairment base clinical history , creatinine , urinary protein level result overall specificity 98 % . The used CKD273 pattern show biomarkers detect initiation progression DN earlier currently use indicator , well precede increase urinary albumin level . While CKD273 pattern detect DN &gt; 90 % accuracy four year clinical diagnosis , serum creatinine and/or Urine albumin execration rate detect DN earlier one two year clinical manifestation , respectively . In addition , diagnostic accuracy significantly low compare CKD273 pattern . In addition , two independent study type 1 type 2 DM patient , longitudinally collect sample period 10 year demonstrate CKD273 marker kidney disease alter 3 5 year prior manifestation albuminuria , 1 2 year prior development microalbuminuria . Thus , performance CKD273 pattern good prediction base urinary albumin value represent potentially significant improvement current state art assess DN , enable early detection high accuracy urinary albumin . Finally , proteome analysis application CKD273 pattern indicate positive scoring CKD microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patient , show persistent improvement long-term renoprotective treatment Irbesartan , placebo treat patient show slight deterioration kidney damage marker likely reflect disease progression absence preemptive intervention . Collectively , exist data strongly indicate urinary proteomics base test ap-pears ideal identify patient develop microalbuminuria ultimately DN thereby facilitate target intensified preventative therapy group . Rationale : 1 . Urinary proteomics predicts development microalbuminuria ( surrogate marker development overt nephropathy ) cohort 3280 type 2 diabetic patient normal urinary albumin excretion screen . 2 . Early initiation preventive therapy spironolactone reduces risk transition microalbuminuria identify urinary proteomics high risk , thereby delay progression overt nephropathy . Treatment spar low risk accord urinary proteomics , pave way personalise medicine Primary Objective To confirm urinary proteomics predict development microalbuminuria ( surrogate marker development overt nephropathy ) cohort 3280 type 2 diabetic patient normal urinary albumin excretion . Secondary Objectives To investigate early initiation preventive therapy spironolactone 25 mg daily reduces risk transition microalbuminuria patient identify urinary proteomics high risk . Additional Scientific Objectives To compare rate change urinary albumin excretion rate high vs. low-risk population ( base proteomic test ) , compare effect spironolactone rate change urine albumin execration rate intervention group . In addition , objective study rate change estimate GFR relation urinary marker pattern ( CKD 273 ) intervention spironolactone . To study ability urinary proteomic pattern , predict cardiovascular renal event study well response intervention , relation study endpoint .</detailed_description>
