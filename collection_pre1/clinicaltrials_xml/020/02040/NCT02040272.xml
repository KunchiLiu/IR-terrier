	<brief_summary>Mesothelioma cancer thin membrane line chest abdomen . Around 2300 people UK diagnose mesothelioma year average survival approximately 17 month . Exposure asbestos common cause although cancer usually become apparent 30-40 year exposure . Anti-cancer drug ( chemotherapy ) usually give help treat mesothelioma sometimes lung-sparing surgery ( pleurectomy decortication ) surgery undertaken . However , know surgery , addition chemotherapy , increase survival improve quality life patient . The aim MARS2 study determine feasible enrol patient mesothelioma study randomise chemotherapy chemotherapy lung-sparing surgery . Patients follow regularly usual clinic visit 5 year . Patients ask complete Quality Life Questionnaire visit . Tissue sample take time diagnosis surgery ( randomise surgery ) mesothelioma research central storage blood sample take clinic visit 12 month mesothelioma research central storage . If show feasibility recruitment apply continue study include patient order determine lung-sparing surgery improve survival quality life mesothelioma patient .</brief_summary>
