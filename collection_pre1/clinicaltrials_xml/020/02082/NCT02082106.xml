	<brief_summary>Problem description In industrialized country rapid increase number senior citizen . In Austria 50 % population overweight , high prevalence age group 60 74 yr WHO list physical inactivity one main behavioral risk factor cardiovascular disease . Especially winter month , activity relate energy expenditure 40 % 31 % low US Canada , respectively . In addition , Austrian study winter season associate high blood pressure , total cholesterol body mass index , give increase risk chronic coronary disease 6.8 % men 3.6 % woman . Therefore , development intervention program overcome winter physical activity deficit feasible also elderly goal future research . Alpine skiing ( AS ) cross country skiing ( XCS ) long stand tradition Austria could potentially fill winter physical activity gap . The Salzburg Skiing Elderly Study ( SASES ) find AS save feasible possibility improve health age population many parameter . XCS competitive sport already well explore hardly study effect normal elderly population . Unfortunately knowledge difference AS XCS physiological adaptation process elderly population also lack . Aims hypotheses pre-study In order standardize training intervention , present pre-study aim compare physiological metabolic parameter AS , XCS IT . Therefore , result pre-study serve determinant train parameter mention main study . We postulate , base result present study , possible set comparable isocaloric training session AS , XCS IT elderly unfit person . Furthermore , assume elderly unfit subject able perform full spectrum intensity technique necessary set appropriate stimulus isocaloric comparison . We hypothesize arterial stiffness index circulate microRNA ( miRNA ) pattern change due one bout physical activity AS , XCS , IT variations depend kind sport .</brief_summary>
