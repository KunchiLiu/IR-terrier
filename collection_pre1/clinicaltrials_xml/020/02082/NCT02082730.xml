	<brief_summary>This study aim improve delivery treatment people Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ( CFS/ME ) . People CFS/ME low energy . This interfere everyday activity major impact quality life . Energy management key aspect treatment involve patient build energy level gradually . Their health professional find much energy patient us daily prescribe much activity rest right patient . The prescription adjust throughout treatment . Over time , patient learns best way `` spend '' `` preserve '' energy . To begin treatment , patient record activity level paper week . Records need accurate , often difficult problem memory , concentration low energy pain . We recently develop new technology call ASARM ( `` Advanced Sleep Rest Activity Rest Management '' ) record activity level electronically check whether match activity prescription . The ASARM device wear patient 's wrist . It measure sleep , activity rest , electronic diary ( smartphone app ) record daily activity . The health professional remote access information use app change prescription . This study investigate ASARM ( ) acceptable patients; ( ii ) good way deliver Cognitive Behavioural therapy CBT treatment; ( iii ) able improve symptom . Patients clinicians gain experience ASARM short time , analyse data . Our finding help u develop ASARM use routine care CFS/ME patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility , Acceptability Clinical Utility New Remote-mobile Technology Intervention ( ASARM ) CFS/ME Paediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard practice patient use pen paper diary capture initial `` baseline '' sleep rest activity . However , take several week determine , rely excellent adherence well subjective record information sometimes hard capture . Filling diary also place extra demand energy memory patient compromise treatment , particularly early stage care , characterize feeling hopelessness disempowerment . Similarly , number trip clinic discus diary place particular demand energy resource patient group . ASARM 's clinical impact therefore increase treatment adherence treatment efficacy , reduce number clinic visit patient , well speed process `` diary '' information clinician monitor progress adapt treatment plan . ASARM improve health patient reduce cost run service make treatment accessible reduce number appointment need offer . There two group patient use ASARM part treatment , `` mid-treatment group '' `` start treatment group '' . Both group receive standard CBT treatment clinic , however provide ASARM equipment addition . Data also collect clinical record 20 patient previously treat standard treatment Manchester CFS/ME Service Children &amp; Young People , refer `` case file audit '' data . Finally focus group make one clinician service , two clinician similar service , researcher , three past present patient receive treatment service . Start treatment Group : Nine newly present patient assess `` gold-standard '' fatigue outcome measure receive ASARM administer treatment 10 week ( `` baseline '' 2 week `` prescription '' mode 8 week period ) . Patients revert treatment usual . On completion ASARM treatment , information patient experience paper diary versus ASARM explore , clinical measure ASARM activity diary data also assess Mid-treatment group : Six patient complete 6 session Manchester CFS/ME Service Children &amp; Young People recruit . Each provide ASARM treatment 6 week . Clinicians CFS/ME Service deliver continue treatment administer ASARM `` baseline '' 2 week `` prescription '' mode next 4 week . They return treatment usual within service . After complete ASARM treatment , information patient differentially experienced paper diary versus ASARM collect use acceptability questionnaire , clinical outcome assess `` gold-standard '' fatigue outcome measure along rest , sleep activity data ASARM . The activity diary data clinical data contain patient 's case file ASARM treatment also collect ( see detail overview ) . `` Case file audit '' data : To provide comparative baseline data general treatment response , audit pre-treatment post-treatment clinical data regular `` gold standard '' clinical measure package describe `` endpoint '' section , outcome measure routinely use clinic . This information extract record 20 consecutive exist patient receive treatment usual i.e . patient used paper activity record . Their treatment duration dictate length time first post-treatment data set available clinical case file , closest 10 week . Focus group The focus group form ask review ASARM description demonstration . Feedback use advise clinical protocol potential refinement make system future . When draft version treatment manual develop Focus group meet review suggest change necessary . When patient complete treatment , clinician participant service patient use ASARM form focus group explore experience consider ASARM data compare TAU patient .</detailed_description>
