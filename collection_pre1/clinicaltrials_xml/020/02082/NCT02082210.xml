	<brief_summary>The purpose study find recommended schedule dose range LY2875358 give ramucirumab may safely give participant cancer . In Part A study , escalate dos LY2875358 give combination fix dose ramucirumab evaluate safety combination . After recommended schedule dose range LY2875358 ramucirumab establish , Part B study confirm safety see well certain tumor respond combination study drug . The average amount time study expect 6 month .</brief_summary>
