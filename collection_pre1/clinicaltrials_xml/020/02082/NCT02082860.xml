	<brief_summary>This Phase I trial aim determine safety investigational gene therapy product ( rAAV2/5-PBGD ) treatment Acute Intermittent Porphyria ( AIP ) . Up eight patient fulfil eligibility criterion participate multicentre , open label , single dose , dose-ranging Phase I clinical trial . The enrolled patient follow assess safety profile investigational gene therapy product establish maximum therapeutic safe dose administer future confirmatory/pivotal clinical trial ( ) . In addition , biological clinical response treatment rAAV2/5-PBGD AIP patient assess . A complete evaluation clinical ( symptoms quality life assessment ) laboratory ( blood urine ) data performed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Gene Therapy Clinical Trial Using Vector rAAV2/5-PBGD Treatment Acute Intermittent Porphyria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Intermittent Porphyria ( AIP ) inherit autosomal dominant disorder heme biosynthesis pathway . AIP cause genetic defect porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , key enzyme heme synthesis . AIP characterize acute episode asymptomatic period . Neuropathic symptom predominantly attack , may relate toxic effect produce precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) porphobilinogen ( PBG ) , accumulate enzyme deficiency . It occur low prevalence ( 1 50,000 ) , figure prevalence base clinical manifestation ( i.e. , acute attack ) greatly underestimate number patient latent AIP . Abdominal pain common symptom , sometimes constipation . Paresthesia paralysis also occur , death may result respiratory paralysis . Other symptom , include seizure , psychotic episode , hypertension , develop acute attack . They may precipitate porphyrogenic drug barbiturate , progestogen sulfonamide , know induce first rate-controlling step heme synthesis , ALA synthesis . Other known precipitant alcohol , infection , starvation , hormonal change ; attack common woman . Acute attack rarely occur puberty . This Phase I clinical trial mainly aim evaluate safety recombinant adeno associate vector liver-specific promoter PBGD expression ( rAAV2/5-PBGD ) , treatment Acute Intermittent Porphyria . The patient enrol adaptive dose-escalation , multicentre trial ass safety profile , establish maximum therapeutic safe dose administrate patient confirmatory pivotal clinical trial . This clinical trial precede `` Observational study acute intermittent porphyria patient '' ( DIG-API-2011-01 ) . In observational study , severe AIP patient follow 6 maximum 24 month . During time , clinical laboratory ( blood urine biochemistry ) condition patient evaluate , order establish clinical biological baseline history compare future result clinical trial . During clinical trial , safety evaluate Adverse Events ( AEs ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) assessment . A complete evaluation clinical laboratory ( blood urine ) data collect . The study also investigate secondary endpoint effect treatment modify aspects patient condition . Due heterogeneity genetic mutation inter-individual variation , clinical symptomatology ALA/PBG level AIP subject show evident variability urine sample acute attack remission ; subject control , study intra-individually controlled clinical trial . At end clinical trial efficacy evaluation perform base clinical biochemical change compare baseline establish previous observational study .</detailed_description>
