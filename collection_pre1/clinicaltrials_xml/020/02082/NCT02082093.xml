	<brief_summary>The main objective study demonstrate efficiency ( cost-effectiveness ) telemedicine system : eNephro Application , compare traditional care management chronic renal failure different population : - population 1 : Patients CKD stage 3B- 4 , combine endpoint achievement target blood pressure proteinuria . - population 2 : Patients ESRD treat ambulatory dialysis , cumulative duration hospitalization short-stay 1 year . - population 3 : Patients ESRD treat Renal Transplantation , cumulative duration unplanned short stay 1 year . The intervention test study telemedicine system collaborative expert system , consist : - A dynamic shared medical record collection administrative , medical , biological clinical data patient . All health professional access folder fill support . It patient treat home . - A secure message communication health professional patient health professional - Expert system analyze data patient - A management tool therapeutic education - A compliance assistance : electronic pillbox pharmaceutical care Patients include study major patient , male female sign consent form . These patient chronic renal failure moderate end treat ambulatory dialysis kidney transplantation . The patient population randomly assign group 1 ie traditional care group 2 ie traditional care add telemedicine system . Each patient whatever group perform part monitor CKD assessment baseline , 6 month end study ( 12 month ) . These evaluation compliance , quality life , anxiety - depression state . To enhance cost point view retain health insurance 's point view . Among various cost , direct cost consider : disease management , hospitalization , consultation hospital private practice , prescribe medical transportation , home visit health professional , additional assessment relate evaluated intervention . A probabilistic matching data base National Information System Social Insurance perform . In addition , acceptability system telemedicine patient intervention health professional also evaluate .</brief_summary>
