	<brief_title>In-Vivo Evaluation Nebulized Aerosols Delivered Via Nasal Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerosol medicine widely use treat pulmonary disease child . Delivering drug via aerosol face several challenge ; relate drug delivery method others patient behavior . The latter crucial significantly affect lung deposition drug . Infants know obligate nose breather make transnasal route natural approach drug delivery age group . Different interface already available market specifically design use child improve child acceptability interface result improve drug deposition . Due limitation use radiolabeled aerosol pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study infant child , in-vitro model develop . These model still lack biological variability lead overestimate lung deposition . So , real life correction factor need improve current in-vitro modeling . Previous unpublished data laboratory show alignment aerosol stream nostril important pulmonary deposition . Our objective provide real life data acceptance different interface infant child provide real life correction factor improve current in-vitro modeling .</detailed_description>
