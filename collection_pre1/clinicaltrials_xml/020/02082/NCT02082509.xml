	<brief_summary>One common symptom suffer traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) patient disruption attention . Lack attention impact daily life include academic professional task , interpersonal relationship . The focus Therapeutic Resources Attention Improvement Neuroimaging Traumatic Brain Injury ( TRAIN-TBI ) investigate change neurological function special interest attention TBI child age 8 16 . This study do advance neuroimaging procedure , neurocognitive testing , online training tool create The Brain Plasticity Institute . The investigator hypothesize train improve attention TBI subject advance image show corresponding neural connectivity change , compare match healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To use advanced functional neuroimaging method well understand nature attention disruption patient sustain TBI . We use image data acquire 3 Tesla ( 3T ) quantification regional change brain volume time . The microstructural integrity white matter tract assess diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Resting state functional MRI ( rs-fMRI ) 3T provide understand neural network associate brain 's baseline activity may correlate cognitive health . We also try good understand attention process relation time employ magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . By overlay MEG information top structural T1 T2-weighted MRI sequence , get good overall picture , spatial temporal resolution , brain cognitive task . MEG examination include standard cognitive task rely intact attention executive functioning , directly trained attention training module . This allow assessment improvement functional attention ability training generalize across related cognitive task . All image corroborate neuropsychological neurocognitive test ass whether abnormality see image indicative functionality . Specific Aim 2 : To measure extent improvement patient ' attention post cognitive training , good understand process timeline underlie recovery attention dysfunction . Comparing pre- post-training neurocognitive test result measure difference , , attention capacity . These improvement correlate respective advanced imaging . 3T MRI MEG information cognitive training compare look anatomical , functional , connectivity change . Specific Aim 3 : To determine demographic factor ( age , race , etc . ) clinical factor ( medical history , severity injury , etc . ) contribute attention impairment , . By collect detailed clinical intake assessment patient ( and/or parent , applicable ) medical record , recommend NIH Common Data Elements TBI , able identify epidemiological variable significantly contribute 1 ) sustain attention deficit post-TBI 2 ) propensity recovery successful completion cognitive training protocol .</detailed_description>
