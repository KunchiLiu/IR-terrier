	<brief_summary>Heart transplantation lifesaving procedure patient end-stage heart failure provide well survival quality life compare conventional medical pharmacological treatment . Transplanted heart subject effect alloimmune response , leave uncontrolled capable jeopardize long-term cardiac function . Recently , advance immunosuppression enhance survival transplanted patient . Nearly 2500 cardiac transplant per year perform US last 10 year despite significant improvement , long-term cardiac allograft survival rate remain poor . More 20 % patient survive beyond 3 year , survive afflict long-term complication associate chronic immunosuppression . Life expectancy patient lose cardiac allograft dramatically poor due absence therapeutic tool apart re-transplantation , plague poor outcome . The identification novel therapeutic target thus mandatory . ATP/P2X7R signal T cell highly relevant cardiac allograft survival . ATP small molecule present high concentration inside cell release extracellular ATP ( eATP ) follow cell damage death , abundant inflammation site act danger signal constitute `` alert system '' . ATP sense ionotropic purinergic P2X receptor ( seven receptor name P2X1-7 ) express mainly , exclusively , T lymphocytes , thereby regulate T cell activation . We recently demonstrate ATP/P2X7R axis key role cardiac allograft survival human mice . Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) major limit factor cardiac allograft survival . One major limit factor cardiac transplantation CAV , develop frequently heart transplant recipient . CAV result allograft failure , occur 50 % cardiac transplant recipient 5 year transplantation , show angiography intravascular ultrasound examination . CAV clearly immunological origin , syngeneic murine graft develop CAV . Once CAV occur , definitive treatment re-transplantation , survival limit due fact pharmacological management somewhat attenuate process . We hypothesize single nucleotide polymorphysm ( SNP ) loss-of-function P2X7R mutation ( p.Glu496Ala / c.1513A &gt; C , rs3751143 ) generate compensatory upregulation purinergic receptor ( P2XsR ) , thus create state hypersensitivity eATP . This eATP hypersensitivity result abnormal generation Th1/Th17 cell , lead CAV early cardiac allograft loss . Our study answer fundamental question : What effect P2X7R loss-of-function mutation immune system ? Our expertise study ATP/P2X7R axis recently recognize two publication ready test novel hypothesis P2X7R loss-of-function mutation . Our goal generate first targeted-therapy select group cardiac transplant recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart transplantation lifesaving procedure however , 20 % patient survive beyond 3 year , cardiac allograft afflict cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) , result allograft loss . The purine adenosine 5'-triphosphate ( ATP ) , release cell damage/inflammation , sense ionotropic purinergic P2X7 receptor ( P2X7R ) , express primarily , though exclusively , lymphocyte , thus regulate T cell activation . Loss-of-function single nucleotide mutation ( SNPs ) detect P2X7R gene ; particularly Glu496 Ala 1513A &gt; C ( rs3751143 ) P2X7R loss-of-function mutation relatively common ( 1-3 % individual mutate omozygous 25 % heterozygous ) . Our central hypothesis loss-of-function P2X7R mutation identifies group cardiac transplant patient high risk CAV cardiac allograft loss compensatory overexpression P2X1R/P2X4R , induce disregulation T-bet/ROR-g , ultimately lead abnormal generation Th1/Th17 cell . Our primary goal define effect P2X7R loss-of-function mutation clinical end point CTOT-05 cohort cardiac transplant recipient ( 200 patient ) explore effect mutation immune system . Our preliminary data demonstrate P2X7R increase cardiac transplant rejection vivo mouse human activate ATP release cardiac cell , thus trigger activation Th1/Th17 cell . However , short-term disruption P2X7R pathway prolongs cardiac allograft survival , genetic deletion P2X7R accelerate CAV shortens cardiac allograft survival . This evident P2X7R KO-B6 mouse group cardiac transplant recipient bear P2X7R loss-of-function mutation . Based publish result novel observation , develop follow work hypothesis : P2X7R loss-of-function mutation generate compensatory overexpression ionotropic purinergic receptor ( P2X1/P2X4 ) chronic delivery ATP immunity , hyperactivation T-bet/ROR-g , abnormal generation Th1/Th17 cell ultimately lead accelerate CAV cardiac allograft loss . To test hypothesis , follow two main path : ) evaluate CTOT-05 cohort cardiac transplant recipient effect Glu496 Ala 1513A &gt; C ( rs3751143 ) P2X7R loss-of-function mutation clinical end point ( development coronary artery vasculopathy , death , re-transplantation re-listed transplantation , rejection ) first year post transplant ; ii ) explore vivo ex vivo CTOT-05 cohort cardiac transplant recipient effect P2X7R loss-of-function mutation immune system .</detailed_description>
