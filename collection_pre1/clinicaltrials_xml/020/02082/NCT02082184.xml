	<criteria>1 . Has Type 2 diabetes insulin therapy ≥ 6 month current regimen ≥3 month prior study entry . 2 . Their insulin management must one following ; 1. injection regimen prandial insulin least daily , 2. , prandial insulin least daily plus basal insulin least daily , 3. , continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) plan change study . 3 . HbA1c result ≥7.5 % ( 58 mmol/mol ) ≤12.0 % ( 108 mmol/mol ) entry study . 4 . Reports selftesting blood glucose level regular basis equivalent minimum 10 test per week , least 2 month prior study entry . 5 . In investigator 's opinion subject consider technically capable use Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System . 6 . In Investigator 's opinion subject proactive therefore willing modify diabetes management 7 . Aged 18 year . 1 . Insulin regimen consist entirely basal include biphasic insulin . 2 . Subject currently prescribe animal insulin . 3 . Subject currently prescribe steroid therapy likely require steroid therapy acute chronic condition study . 4 . Has know allergy medical grade adhesive . 5 . Currently participate another device drug study could affect glucose measurement glucose management . 6 . Currently use Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) device use one within previous 4 month . 7 . Is plan use CGM device time study . 8 . Total daily dose insulin ( TDD ) &gt; 1.75iu/kg entry study . 9 . A female subject pregnant planning become pregnant within study duration . 10 .
