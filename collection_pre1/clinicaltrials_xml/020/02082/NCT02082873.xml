Several hour data display single screen several graphical panel . Routine evaluation EEG data consist manual inspection page EEG data quite time-consuming . Since continuous review EEG data possible , EEG data always relay primary clinical team post-hoc manner ideal . Theoretically , qEEG graphical display provide simplified view complex EEG data could possibly use non-neurophysiologists , Neuro ICU nurse . There study adult pediatric population prospectively evaluate use qEEG non-neurophysiologists identify recurrent NCS . Given retrospective data show neurophysiologists non-neurophysiologists similar sensitivity specificity identify presence NCS qEEG panel , hypothesis Neuro-ICU nurse acceptable sensitivity specificity prospectively identify recurrent NCS . DESIGN AND PROCEDURES This observational , prospective evaluation Neuro ICU nurse ' ability detect NCS via qEEG run bedside . The study affect clinical management decision patient care . It utilize DUHS Neuro ICU nurse serve qEEG reader . The goal study compare accuracy Neuro-ICU nurse ' ability detect NCS bedside qEEG post hoc review correspond raw EEG blind , board-certified neurophysiologists . The neurophysiologists blind Neuro ICU nurse prospective seizure identification . We plan enroll sample 40 nurse 30 adult patient already continuous video electroencephalogram ( EEG ) monitoring admission Duke Neuroscience ICU . In prospective study include adult clinically suspect NCS , define fact treatment team physician request cEEG monitoring . The treat physician make decision initiate cEEG monitoring determine duration monitoring . We exclude subject convulsive seizure without concern NCS . All eligible subject consent enrollment clinical team decide patient place cEEG monitoring . Subsequently , neurophysiology fellow review raw EEG intermittently standard care . Once neurophysiology fellow detect NCS , research team contact either clinical Neuro ICU team neurophysiology team patient deem appropriate continue participation study . Nurses consent participation trial involve ability detect NCS use bedside qEEG trend . Neuro ICU nurse consent receive training qEEG monitoring research team via 15 minute online PowerPoint presentation . In addition , binder contain printout train PowerPoint presentation attach EEG machine . A single printout qEEG panel , contain sentinel seizure capture cEEG monitoring display next cEEG machine . The NCS clearly mark research team . All patient undergo cEEG monitoring Duke qEEG run simultaneously addition raw EEG . The program create qEEG display Magic Marker develop Persyt , Inc. Neuro ICU nurse ask check qEEG screen hourly record number seizure ( similar appearance sentinel seizure qEEG print ) see qEEG display . A 24 hour log attach EEG machine . If patient nurse enrol study , second nurse later shift agree participate trial either end study ask second nurse he/she would like participate . There nurse float pool may interest , , provide one-on-one training session begin shift consent . At one hour interval nurse mark one following option : seizure , 1-2 seizure , 3-5 seizure , 6-10 seizure &gt; 10 seizure . The absolute time nurse evaluate qEEG display determine study team time enrollment clearly mark log sheet . The standard practice neurophysiology fellow independently review raw EEG intermittently continue unchanged . Treatment recurrent NCS discretion Neuro ICU team conjunction neurophysiology team . The nurse 's review qEEG impact patient care treatment decision . The nurse review subject 's qEEG duration shift ( 12 hour ) part shift . The total duration study 24 hour treat physician discontinues continuous EEG monitoring , whichever short . If first nurse participates study , nurse second shift agree participate , study stop . After complete enrollment , qEEG data raw EEG data de-identified study author ( CW ) . Board-certified neurophysiologists study author ( SS CS ) review raw EEG data independently identify seizure . Electrographic seizure identify use publish criterion [ 15 ] . In case discrepancy identification seizures two author review study together establish consensus . Each hour raw EEG place follow category : seizure , 1-2 seizure , 3-5 seizure , 6-10 seizure &gt; 10 seizure . In addition , average seizure duration , spatial extent seizure ( focal , hemispheric generalized/bilateral ) , primary background EEG abnormality determine author board-certified neurophysiologist , CS , raw EEG . SELECTION OF SUBJECTS Neuroscience ICU Nurses : All Neuroscience ICU nurse ask participate . Subjects : The responsible treating team Adult Neuro ICU identify subject treat physician decide initiate cEEG monitoring . No restriction make regard gender , race , religion underlie cause hospitalization , include prior history seizure disorder . SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND COMPENSATION Appropriate subject identify treat team Adult Neuro ICU . It sole discretion treat team Adult Neuro ICU clinical neurophysiology team notify research coordinator approach patient recruitment study . Subject demographic mirror patient demographic Duke Adult Neuro ICU . No compensation provide . CONSENT PROCESS Neuroscience ICU Nurses : The study introduce Neuro ICU nurse via email request participate study . The consent form review nurse willing participate trial . The study physicians review consent form individually nurse Duke Medical Pavilion conference room answer question individually time . Those agree participate study sign consent form attend brief , 15 minute training session qEEG monitoring present study author ( SS , CS CW ) . Their participation completely voluntary record response qEEG interpretation use part project data . No identify information record . It make explicitly clear penalty participate incentive provide . Subjects Subjects Legal Representative : The study introduce patient Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) member clinical team . If patient LAR willing participate , study team approach . Informed consent obtain PI , Study Coordinator , Key personnel subject study . Consent obtain patient LAR , define Duke guideline , patient unable provide consent . The patient assess impaired decision-making time consent . All patient require cEEG monitoring require involvement neurologist determine ability consent determination already make either PI investigator trial . All investigator personnel trial neurologist . Consent obtain quiet , private location protect privacy prospective participant . Potential participant identify bedside evaluation DUHS Neuro ICU .
