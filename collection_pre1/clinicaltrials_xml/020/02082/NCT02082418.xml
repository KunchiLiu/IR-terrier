	<brief_summary>Aging modifies metabolic pathway neurotransmitter serotonin reduce synthesis rate increase breakdown rate serotonin , possibly relate observe enhanced sensitivity serotonergic pathway . Since serotonin play prominent role neuropsychological function anxiety , mood memory , enhanced sensitivity serotonergic pathway age probably explain fact elderly vulnerable develop cognitive deficit depressive symptom . Serotonin synthesis brain regulate precursor tryptophan ( TRP ) . Because tryptophan essential amino acid , modify availability tryptophan dietary intake , directly influence central serotonin metabolism consequently affective cognitive process . The aim study test hypothesis acute intake whey protein high level TRP alpha-lactalbumin stabilize metabolism serotonin subsequently enhance metabolic cognitive function healthy old adult . The acute effect dietary protein investigated subject mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , dementia , compare control subject order examine whether healthy old subject MCI benefit intake alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey . The investigator investigate meal optimize serotonin metabolism elevate plasma TRP level plasma TRP appearance enhance splanchnic TRP extraction . In addition , effect mood cognitive function examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study involve subject 3 test day ( approximately 8 hour ) . On test day investigator examine acute effect protein meal . Subjects receive mixture alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey and/or casein , carbohydrates amino acid stable isotope investigate protein amino acid kinetics ( assign alpha-lactalbumin whey casein group test day 1 , switch test day 2 3 ) . The subject receive stable isotope infusion blood oral intake ( e.g . simultaneously protein meal ) . For study purpose , blood drawn approx . 25 time 8 hour test day , altogether 100-120 ml blood drawn test day .</detailed_description>
