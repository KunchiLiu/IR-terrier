	<brief_summary>This study design estimate two-way drug interaction DCV DTG drug interaction DTG DCV expect low study perform confirmation . This single-center , open-label , three-period , crossover study healthy adult subject . This study describe compare steady-state plasma DTG DCV pharmacokinetics follow administration DTG 50 mg q24h without DCV 60 mg q24h follow administration DCV 60 mg q24h without DTG 50 mg q24h also safety tolerability assess repeat dose DTG 50 mg q24h without DCV 60 mg q24h repeat dose DCV 60 mg q24h without DTG 50 mg q24h</brief_summary>
