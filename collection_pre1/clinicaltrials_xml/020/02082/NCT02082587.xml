	<brief_summary>As treatment improve patient live long cancer , even spread brain , effort improve quality life grow . Neurocognitive function ( think ability memory ) area particular concern patient brain metastasis ( cancer spread brain ) . Although establish test measure neurocognitive function , require face-to-face assessment take long time complete . As result , effort use test measure change neurocognitive function patient follow treatment brain metastasis result large proportion patient return follow-up . This limited ability evaluate impact current treatment neurocognitive function . This study aim evaluate shorter , telephone-based neurocognitive assessment tool , would make easy patient complete test follow-up . If new tool find reliably measure neurocognitive function , could use future study evaluate new intervention prevent treat neurocognitive deterioration follow treatment brain metastasis . This first prospective study evaluate feasibility reliability novel telephone-based brief neurocognitive assessment battery ( Toronto BNB ) compare battery deliver face-to-face population . The investigator hypothesize telephone administration brief neurocognitive battery reliably evaluate neurocognitive function improve patient ability complete follow-up assessment .</brief_summary>
