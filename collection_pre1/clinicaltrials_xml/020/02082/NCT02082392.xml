	<detailed_description>This study utilize 2 x 2 , double-blind , acute , prospective design randomize adult outpatient MDD `` Research Frequency Management '' ( RFM , weekly study visit ) vs. `` Community Frequency Management '' ( CFM , every 4 week study visit ) antidepressant medication vs.placebo . Specifying visit frequency independent variable study distinct advantage easily operationalized research purpose avoid priori assumption component study visit influence antidepressant placebo response ( i.e. , behavioral activation vs. doctor-patient relationship vs. medical procedure ) . Close monitoring subject assure telephone evaluation individual randomize CFM interval monthly visit , additional study contact schedule necessary maintain patient safety ( extra-protocol contact record include variable outcome analysis ) . Additionally , subject characterize extensively clinical , demographic , psychological measure pilot study assessment battery search predictor variable influence effect contact frequency medication placebo response .</detailed_description>
