	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , 2-part study determine recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) GSK2816126 give twice weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusion . Part 1 conduct adult subject relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , transform follicular lymphoma ( tFL ) , Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , solid tumor multiple myeloma ( MM ) determine safety tolerability GSK2816126 . Expansion cohort ( Part 2 ) plan explore clinical activity GSK2816126 RP2D subject Enhancer Zeste 2 ( EZH2 ) wild type EZH2 mutant positive germinal centre B-cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( GCB-DLBCL ) , tFL MM .</brief_summary>

Tumor type criterion : relapsed/refractory nonHodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) meet one follow criterion : DLBCL transform FL relapse refractory least one prior chemotherapy regimen AND candidate standard salvage regimens autologous stem cell transplant . Local confirmation lymphoma subtype ( e.g . GCBDLBCL ) allow enrollment must confirm central laboratory testing ; DLBCL transform FL relapse refractory least two prior chemotherapy regimen ; Other NHLs fail least one prior line therapy standard salvage regimen . Relapsed and/or refractory MM fail prior standard therapy standard salvage regimen .
