	<brief_summary>Prevention physical disability represent major priority public health system . Physical disability final result complex cascade negative event occur different level ( i.e. , environmental , social , biological , clinical ) . The heterogeneity underlie mechanism responsible onset physical disability may require adoption preventive intervention affect multiple domain . Although several study suggest single different combination preventive intervention ( particular , physical activity , cognitive training , healthy diet ) might provide beneficial effect prevent functional loss ( related feature , pain reduce quality life ) , limited evidence come clinical trial currently available topic . Intervention trial usually design test effect specific monodimensional intervention select population , reduce risk bias result . This approach , although legitimate methodologically correct , may 1 ) insufficient target multiple heterogeneous physiopathological mechanism underlie onset physical disability , 2 ) cause population selection bias lead difficulty implement study result overall old population ( thus , determine `` evidence-based medicine '' issue elderly ) . To knowledge , available data clinical trial evaluate effect multidomain intervention base lifestyle modification ( e.g. , physical activity , cognitive training , nutritional modification ) prevent mobility disability ( early phase disable process ) community-dwelling old person . In present project ( Multidomain Intervention preveNt Disability ElDers , MINDED ) , propose conduct pilot study aim estimate effect multidomain person-tailored preventive intervention ( base physical activity , cognitive training , nutritional modification ) frailty status , physical performance , cognitive function , nutritional status , health-related quality life , use health care service . In addition , perform cost-effectiveness analysis propose intervention . The project yield necessary preliminary data design definitive full-scale Phase 3 randomize clinical trial . By provide conclusive answer effectiveness multidimensional preventive program primary prevention major health-related outcome , result full-scale trial relevant clinical public health implication , promote practice truly evidence-based geriatric medicine .</brief_summary>
