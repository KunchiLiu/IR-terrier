	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well low dos bortezomib , dexamethasone , cyclophosphamide work treat old patient multiple myeloma . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cyclophosphamide daily may kill cancer cell . Giving bortezomib , cyclophosphamide , dexamethasone may effective treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) toxicity rate therapy weekly bortezomib combine oral metronomic cyclophosphamide low-dose dexamethasone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival . II . To describe association disease status , treatment response , treatment toxicity , quality life , functional status , risk development frailty , inflammatory cytokine level . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 ; cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
