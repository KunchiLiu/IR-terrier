	<brief_summary>The improvement treatment preterm neonates improved survival , however still significant portion preterm infant ( specifically preterm infant ) suffers brain insult result developmental deficit . The brain injury consequence hypoxic ischemic event , intracranial hemorrhage , well , infection metabolic crisis . The brain injury combination abnormal myelination , axonal damage neuronal death . Although reduction focal brain injury , diffuse brain injury still abundant . Several treatment suggest test animal model prevent brain insult include glutamate receptor blocker , allopurinol , xenon different type stem cell . However , two main obstacle prevent use medication , first uncertainty effect develop brain second difficulty time brain insult . Unlike neonatal asphyxia , delivery time clinical sign use time grade brain injury , preterm infant real time tool indicate severity timing brain injury . The disability point beneficial therapeutic window major obstacle acute treatment brain injury preterm infant . The aim study try delineate therapeutic window use brain injury biomarkers . S100b GFAP well recognize biomarkers brain injury adult , child infant . Serial measurement S100b saliva ( every 2 day ) GFAP serum ( weekly ) sample . A database clinical status infant collect , well , head ultra sound weekly head MRI term age . Development assess 18 month . Two hypothesis state : One , increase level S100b GFAP timing correlate severity clinical status , Two duration increase level S100b GFAP associate abnormal MRI term finding abnormal developmental assessment .</brief_summary>
