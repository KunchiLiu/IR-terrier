	<brief_summary>Kidney transplant candidate high risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The optimal strategy monitor maintain cardiac fitness patient await kidney transplantation unknown . Currently patient undergo annual testing ; however , screen CAD may increase morbidity mortality : 1. expose patient risk angiography revascularization procedure 2. delay exclude patient life save transplantation . Before proceed definitive study determine whether screen necessary , feasibility determine pilot study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot trial determine feasibility multi-center , randomize , parallel group definitive trial . Asymptomatic wait-listed patient randomize routine screening coronary artery diesease ( CAD ) ( i.e . Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy ( MPS ) Dobutamine Stress Echo ( DSE ) ) per current standard care versus selective screening base symptom . Patients enrol pilot include definitive trial analysis . The pilot trial include four Canadian centre . The definitive trial aim determine strategy selective use screening test ( i.e . Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy Dobutamine Stress Echo ) presence symptom ( i.e . chest pain , dyspnea etc ) non-inferior respect composite endpoint non-fatal MI cardiac death compare screen asymptomatic wait-listed patient regular interval describe transplant specific guideline publish National Kidney Foundation . Currently strong evidence use routine cardiac screen asymptomatic transplant patient , evidence base randomized clinical trial need . This need highlight number factor : wait-listed patient increase number medical complexity ; long wait time change donor characteristic increase CAD risk ; wait-listed patient high risk CAD commonly asymptomatic ; standard care evidence base expensive ; current standard may harmful . The study determine feasibility definitive trial measure outline 'Outcome Measures ' . End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient wait-listed kidney transplantation randomize undergo selective screening CAD , patient screen develop symptom suggestive CAD current standard care involve regular screen CAD fixed time interval base presence risk factor . Patients remain pilot trial protocol death , non-fatal MI , transplantation , permanent removal wait list reason , 24 month enrolment pilot trial . During wait-listing , follow-up telephone interview chart review perform every six month . After transplantation , in-person follow visit chart review occur time discharge hospital , telephone interview chart review perform 3 month transplantation . Patients follow 24 month date enrolment . Patients receive kidney transplant study follow 27 month . For pilot trial , descriptive analysis plan . Feasibility summarize proportion , rate , mean , median appropriate . Comparison definitive trial outcome treatment group , do end internal pilot patient include definitive trial . Analyses enrolment rate consent rate do enrolment phase pilot trial late 2014 . An interim analysis protocol adherence plan mid 2016 support definitive trial funding application September , 2016 .</detailed_description>
