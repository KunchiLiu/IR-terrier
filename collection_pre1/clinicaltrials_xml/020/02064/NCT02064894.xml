	<brief_summary>Pain management child present emergency department ( ED ) injure limb often under-treated , even though know broken arm legs cause moderate severe pain . Further , child less likely receive appropriate pain medicine adult similar injury . This study aim improve pain treatment child present ED suspect fracture , break bone severe sprain . The investigator compare use 3 different possible medication combination ( ibuprofen alone , oral morphine alone , combine ibuprofen oral morphine ) determine combination best treat child 's pain . The investigator also plan verify safety use different drug treat child 's pain . The investigator strongly believe child 's pain optimally treat ED . Adequately relieve child 's pain crucial , inadequate pain treatment short longterm effect child . It also generate unnecessary stress child caregivers/parents . Given knowledge , investigator feel study potential impact care provide EDs , improve pain management safely , child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale . Musculoskeletal trauma ( MSK-T ) child common almost universally painful . Standards child 's pain management MSK-T Emergency Department ( ED ) vary greatly Canadian hospital , overall , pain poorly treat . This inadequate pain treatment significant acute chronic negative effect . Previous study determine monotherapy ibuprofen , commonly prescribed oral analgesic ED , likely provide inadequate pain management child . In response problem , clinician turn back classic oral opioids ( eg morphine ) experiment combination therapy . To date , study focus efficacy combination non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) ( eg ibuprofen ) opioid ( eg morphine ) . Such combination analgesic know potentiate pain relief block level peripheral central nervous system . By combine two drug different mechanism action , may able provide additive analgesic effect . To knowledge , study ever study efficacy safety combination medication MSK-T pediatric EDs . Primary Hypothesis : For child MSK-T ED , addition morphine ibuprofen safe provide well pain relief either two drug alone . Primary Research Question : For child MSK-T ED , combination oral morphine ( 0.2 mg/kg ) oral ibuprofen ( 10 mg/kg ) efficacious either two drug , alone , decrease pain score &lt; 30 mm , 60 minute administration ? Methods . Design : This study double-blind , placebo-controlled , two center , three-arm , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) . Patients randomize receive either : ( ) ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg ) + placebo ( b ) morphine ( 0.2 mg/kg ) + placebo ( c ) morphine ( 0.2mg/kg ) + ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg ) . Setting : Stollery Children 's Hospital ( Edmonton , AB ) CHU Ste.Justine 's pediatric hospital ( Montreal , PQ ) . Inclusion criterion : We include child : ( ) age 8 17 year ; ( b ) visit ED injured upper low limb neither obviously deform , neurovascularly compromise , ( c ) self-reported pain score &gt; 30 mm 0 to100mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , 0 mm corresponds pain 100 mm worst pain child experience , ( ) understand French English . Sample Size : Based previous study , expect 25-52 % ( Clark et al. , 2007 , Le May et al. , 2013 ) child achieve VAS &lt; 30 mm 60 minute ibuprofen arm . We conservatively set proportion child VAS &lt; 30 mm 60 min 50 % . A sample size 500 necessary provide least 80 % power detect 20 % absolute difference proportion use two-tailed alpha level 5 % . In order ensure overall alpha level 5 % , Bonferroni correction apply order take account 3 pairwise comparison perform . Primary Outcome Measurement : The primary outcome measure pain intensity score 30 mm 60-minutes medication administration , use VAS ) . Primary Safety Outcomes : We also assess clinical measure safety monitoring oxygen saturation 30 minute interval , 120 minute . Level sedation/alertness , well respiratory rate , child monitor set time point study , 120 minute . Participating child follow ( via phone call ) 24 hour , record latent side effect adverse event . Further , acceptability intervention assess . Relevance : Our propose work first RCT investigate additive effect bi-therapy pain ibuprofen morphine . In summary , currently available research support ibuprofen monotherapy agent choice . However , give concern regard ability provide adequate relief , small study look morphine possible alternative combine ibuprofen . Very study analgesic combination exist , , yet identify optimal ED pain management strategy child MSK-T. A large trial careful control principal source bias rigorous approach safety data collection provide clinician strong evidence regard efficacy safety new therapeutic strategy pain management relate MSK-T pediatric EDs .</detailed_description>
