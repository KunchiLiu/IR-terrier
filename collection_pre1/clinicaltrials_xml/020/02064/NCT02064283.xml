	<brief_title>Early Assessment Treatment Response Using Functional Diffusion Mapping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate special type MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan measure movement water molecule tissue call diffusion MRI . Researchers use new MRI technology track diffusion , movement , water tumor tissue , map change cancer patient undergoes treatment . Early research seem indicate tumor cell restrict movement water , tumor cell die , movement water change within tumor . These change movement ( diffusion ) water may help doctor determine earlier traditional test whether patient 's cancer responding ( get well ) treatment . This study evaluate feasibility identify change diffusion MRI characteristic bone correlate response therapy men metastatic prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Diagnosis prostate cancer . Evidence metastatic disease bone scan . Patients must initiate systemic therapy metastatic disease . New D2 disease begin therapy androgen deprivation . CRPC ( Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ) begin systemic non hormonal therapy . Patients must willing provide blood sample correlative marker . Patients must able lie flat MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) magnet 3060 minute . Life expectancy 12 week great . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Contraindication MRI image . Patients require sedation general anesthesia undergo MRI imaging . Weight great 275 pound .</criteria>
