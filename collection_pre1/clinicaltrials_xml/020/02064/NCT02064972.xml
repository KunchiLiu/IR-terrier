	<brief_summary>In consideration fact vascular endothelium show target GvHD early stage count CEC may represent marker endothelial damage , want evaluate change CEC count patient affected hematological disorder undergo allo-HSCT , function endothelial damage . We enroll 50 patient affected hematologic disorder undergo allo-HSCT . Peripheral blood drawn ( T1 , baseline ) end condition regimen ( T2 , pre-transplant ) , upon confirmation hematopoietic recovery ( T3 , engraftment ) thereafter onset GVHD ( GVHD T4 ) one week start steroid therapy ( T5 , post-GvHD ) . All patient also check CEC day + 28 . CEC enumeration perform use CellSearch® System flowcytometry procedure . Through conduct study , expect confirm preliminary result large series patient , evaluate predictive role CEC occurrence GvHD prognostic response treatment GvHD . The possibility early identification patient respond traditional treatment GvHD , reason high risk morbidity mortality , may allow great individualization therapeutic program , example introduction early possible alternative treatment . In addition , identification patient high risk non-responsiveness steroid treatment , would allow , close monitoring , early introduction additional treatment development resistance/refractoriness treatment GvHD . The present study take form prospective study . The primary endpoint identification enumeration CECs peripheral blood patient hematological disorder undergo allo-HSCT , function endothelial damage . The secondary endpoint define prognostic predictive value change CEC count diagnosis GvHD response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The endothelial damage characteristic common several complication vascular origin may occur course allo-HSCT ( GVHD , IPS , VOD , TMA ) . The diagnosis vascular complication represent interesting challenge , unfortunately limited fact marker endothelial damage extremely scarce . In particular , plasmatic dosage von Willebrand factor , thrombomodulin adhesion molecule generate result difficult use potential application routine diagnostics high degree non-specificity potential influence assay co-morbid condition related recipient . Much promising method appear base evaluation microparticles derive endothelial cell ( EMP ) direct count circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) . Recently , EMP assess flow cytometry ( annexin V-FITC anti-CD62-PE ) 19 patient undergoing allo-HSCT , show increase patient acute GvHD grade ≥ I , compare patient display GvHD . In addition , evaluation EMP appear affect radio-chemotherapy conditioning regimen . This method , however , burden procedural complexity certain degree non-specificity due fact microparticles release endothelial cell well also platelet , red blood cell leukocytes . Currently , direct counting CEC seem reliable way assess degree endothelial damage . The finding elevate number CEC show reflect extent endothelial damage numerous pathology autoimmune nature , still preliminary data course allo-HSCT . Woywodt et al . demonstrated patient ANCA-positive vasculitis correlation number CEC degree disease activity response treatment . Moreover , number CEC correlate , patient undergoing renal transplantation , risk organ rejection . In course allo-HSCT , author show correlation number CEC endothelial damage induce radio-chemotherapy conditioning regimen . However , lack standardized method , use manual procedure immunoselection , lack consensus identification CEC represent limit factor routine application . The present study take form prospective study . The primary endpoint identification enumeration CECs peripheral blood patient hematological disorder undergo allo-HSCT , function endothelial damage . The secondary endpoint define prognostic predictive value CEC count change diagnosis GvHD response treatment . Peripheral blood ( PB ) drawn ( T1 , baseline ) end condition regimen ( T2 , pre-transplant ) , upon confirmation hematopoietic recovery ( T3 , engraftment ) thereafter onset GVHD ( GVHD T4 ) one week start steroid therapy ( T5 , post-GvHD ) control GvHD . All patient also check CEC day + 28 . The peripheral blood count CEC collect , respectively , CellSave Preservative Tube ( Veridex , J &amp; J , USA ) , contain preservative stabilization cell room temperature , count CellSearch® System CBC tube contain K2EDTA , count flow cytometry . By CellSearch® System event classify CEC morphology consistent cell simultaneously show follow phenotype : CD146+ , CD105+ , DAPI+ CD45- . By flowcytometry procedure , stain cell lyophilized antibody Endo Panel tube ( CD146 , 7-AAD , CD34 , CD309 , CD45 ) 4x106 event lympho-monocyte gate immediately aquired flowcytometry .</detailed_description>
