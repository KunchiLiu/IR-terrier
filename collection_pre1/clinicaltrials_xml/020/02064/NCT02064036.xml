	<brief_summary>We hypothesize SBRT boost prostate follow whole pelvic intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) deliver effectively safely population men unfavorable intermediate high risk localize prostate cancer . Our primary objective ass feasibility safety treatment strategy incorporate whole pelvic IMRT follow SBRT boost prostate neoadjuvant , concurrent , adjuvant androgen deprivation total 28 month men unfavorable intermediate high risk localize prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess feasibility safety treatment strategy incorporate whole pelvic IMRT follow SBRT boost prostate neoadjuvant , concurrent , adjuvant androgen deprivation total 28 month men unfavorable intermediate high risk localize prostate cancer . The secondary objective assess biochemical control 24 month follow experimental treatment strategy `` Phoenix definition '' . Patients meet PSA criterion ( Phoenix Definition ) failure undergo salvage therapy ( ADT , radical prostatectomy brachytherapy , Cryosurgery ) also declare failure time positive biopsy obtain salvage therapy administer , whichever come first . Another secondary objective ass toxicity experimental treatment approach score Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events The third secondary objective ass prostate organ motion hypofractionated radiotherapy . To assess motion prostate protract delivery hypofractionated radiotherapy assess implanted EM transponder beacon .</detailed_description>
