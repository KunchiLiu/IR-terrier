	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cells Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tendon disorder compromise pain free activity often progress chronic pain major impact quality life . More 85,000 patient year see general practitioner ( GP ) Achilles Tendinopathy ( AT ) affect low leg young middle age adult . The main treatment physiotherapy , although surgery eventually consider 25-45 % patient , intervention require several month immobilisation unpredictable outcome . Other treatment include , shockwave therapy , Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) ( blood injection platelet rich plasma ) steroid injection , physiotherapy non show well placebo . There need improved nonsurgical treatment . There establish treatment horse involve injection horse stem cell tendon , show effective never use man . We wish translate technology human propose pilot phase II trial establish safety stem cell implant diseased human tendon . We aim study 10 patient chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy assess safety primary outcome measure . In addition capture clinical outcome score ultrasound appearance . Other stem cell injection , assessment non invasive . Participants otherwise healthy adult , age 18-70 recruited routine outpatient clinic Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital , present painful heel , diagnosed specialist Achilles tendinopathy , already undergone minimum 6 month physiotherapy . Each participant 6 month follow . This study help inform large clinical trial future ethic application make .</detailed_description>
