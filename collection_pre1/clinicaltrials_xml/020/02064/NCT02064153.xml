	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis ( HD ) widely use treatment end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient . The chief aim HD solute fluid removal . Decades practice improve HD care , do improve morbidity mortality . Enhancing toxin removal important consideration improve patient outcome . Also , decrease incidence intra-dialytic hypotensive ( IDH ) episode ( dominant Singapore patient cohort ) significantly reduce associated morbidity mortality . A simple maneuver clinician dialysate temperature . Literature suggest low dialysate temperature ( 35ÂºC ) result reduce hypotensive episode vasoconstriction . Conversely , high dialysate temperature result high blood temperature decrease peripheral resistance , lead increase toxin removal , may cause IDH episode partly due vasodilation . Optimal manipulation dialysate temperature therefore primary handle obtain improved patient outcome . In study , effect dialysate temperature ( cool vs. warm dialysate ) toxin removal study . In intervention , outcome measure patient hemodynamic response amount toxin remove . The spent dialysate collect study quantum toxin remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cool dialysate , vasoconstriction , simple maneuver control and/or prevent incidence intra-dialytic hypotension ( IDH ) . During dialysis fluid continuously remove . IDH occur plasma refill rate small set ultra-filtration rate . When plasma refiling rate small , continuous fluid removal bring patient threshold state patient sufficient fluid central compartment . This lead cascade event , viz. , low blood pressure , muscle cramp , dizziness , first manifestation . To minimize occurrence event , clinician often prescribe cool dialysate result vasoconstriction , ensure sufficient fluid volume central body compartment continuous fluid loss impact patient hemodynamics severely . It important note vasoconstriction may also inhibit toxin movement remote peripheral compartment central blood compartment , thus less toxin remove . On hand warm dialysate lead vasodilation mobilize toxin remote peripheral compartment increase toxin influx central blood compartment . Few researcher investigate effect dialysate temperature urea removal , urea true marker toxin milieu . In pilot clinical research , compare effect dialysate temperature removal small large size uremic toxin . Our objective study effect dialysate temperature incidence IDH , recruit subject stable dialysis prior history IDH episodes .</detailed_description>
