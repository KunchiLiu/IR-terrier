	<brief_title>Study Compare Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Standard Dressings After Orthopedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most surgical wound heal primary intention , mean wound edge bring together , approximate , sort mechanical mean ( suture , staple , paper tape , surgical glue adhesive strip ) heal minimal scar formation . National clinical guideline recommend incision cover postsurgical cover dressing , period 48 hour , help control postoperative bleeding , absorb exudate , provide mechanical protection , help reduce edema provide protection exogenous source . Multiple patient comorbidities , environmental factor type length surgery may elevate certain group patient high level risk develop post-surgical complication : call high degree vigilance postsurgical intervention . Surgical complication include ; wound dehiscence , infection ( deep superficial ) , hematoma , seromas , tissue necrosis delay incision heal . Complication rate range 19 % patient require open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) tibial plateau , pilon calcaneus fracture 50 % high energy trauma wound . These complication high degree morbidity patient sequela may result additional surgical procedure revision , low functional status patient , increase length hospital stay ( LOS ) high cost healthcare provider . Traditional NPWT show effective adjunct therapy treatment acute chronic wound , emergence incisional NPWT ( iNPWT ) support evidence grow momentum . In vitro study show iNPWT may help improve stimulation blood flow , help manage exudate , help reduce edema , provide mechanical `` splinting '' effect incision provide mechanical protection environment . Its impact prevention reduction post-surgical incision complication still infancy , recent study encourage demonstrate statistically significant reduction infection dehiscence patient consider high-risk follow severe skeletal trauma . The aim study assess prevention incision heal complication patient undergo TKA THA treat either Single-Use Incisional NPWT compare standard care dressing .</detailed_description>
