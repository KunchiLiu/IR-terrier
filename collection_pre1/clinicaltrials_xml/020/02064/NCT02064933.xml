	<brief_summary>Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) rare serious medical condition cause problem immune system easy bruise bleeding . The immune abnormality cause patient WAS susceptible infection . Depending specific type primary immune deficiency disease , effective treatment , include antibiotic , cellular therapy gene therapy , study large number patient need determine full range cause , natural history , best method treatment long term success . This multicenter study combine retrospective , prospective cross-sectional analysis transplant experience patient WAS already receive HCT since 1990 , undergo Hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) study period . The retrospective prospective portion study address impact number pre post-transplant factor post-transplant disease correction ultimate benefit HCT cross-sectional portion study ass benefit HCT 2 year post-HCT consent survive patient .</brief_summary>
