	<brief_summary>Previous study show triggered electromyogram ( EMG ) pedicle screw stimulation use effectively test correct pedicle screw placement lumbar thoracic vertebra . Most paper agree 6mA current need elicit response screw correctly place bone . If response le 6mA strong likelihood breach pedicle wall invasion spinal canal . Typically trigger EMG stimulation do screw place ball-tipped probe pair intraoperative fluoroscopy ensure correct placement screw . Another method test current screw power screwdriver , stimulate give read surgeon place screw . Both method currently use surgeon , however power screwdriver find fast method . The investigator 's aim study compare two method test trigger EMG value . The investigator plan test screw ball-tipped probe power screwdriver , order see statistically significant difference reading .</brief_summary>
