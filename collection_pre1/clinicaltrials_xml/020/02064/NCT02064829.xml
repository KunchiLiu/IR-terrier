	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate bioequivalence IG-001 versus nab-paclitaxel female patient metastatic locally recurrent breast cancer . In addition , study compare safety tolerance IG-001 nab-paclitaxel bioequivalence 2-period crossover portion study . The study also evaluate long-term safety IG-001 repeat cycle , 4 additional cycle administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design compare pharmacokinetics ( PK ) IG-001 nab-paclitaxel patient metastatic locally recurrent breast cancer . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize determine drug administer first . - Patients randomize Group 1 receive single dose IG-001 ( Period 1 ) follow 3 week later single dose nab-paclitaxel ( Period 2 ) . - Patients randomize Group 2 receive single dose nab-paclitaxel ( Period 1 ) follow 3 week later single dose IG-001 ( Period 2 ) . Blood sample PK analysis take specified time , , infusion drug Periods 1 2 . Following successful completion Period 1 Period 2 , patient may eligible 4 additional cycle treatment IG-001 extension study . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
