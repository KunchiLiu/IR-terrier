	<brief_summary>This study ass safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) therapeutic potential GSK2857916 subject multiple myeloma ( MM ) lymphomas express B cell maturation antigen ( BCMA ) . The hypothesis GSK2857916 safely administer subject MM BCMA positive malignancy dose target engagement demonstrate . This study determine adequate target engagement BCMA receptor translate clinical benefit subject MM BCMA positive lymphoma . The study consist two part : Part 1 dose escalation phase Part 2 expansion phase safety , tolerability , PK , PD , clinical activity test . The study enroll total approximately 80-95 subject relapsed/refractory MM BCMA-expressing hematologic malignancy . The maximum dose administer trial exceed 5 milligram/kilogram ( mg/kg ) .</brief_summary>

Male female , 18 year old ( time consent obtain ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Part 1/dose escalation ; Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis Multiple Myeloma subject fulfills follow : undergone stem cell transplant , consider transplant ineligible , pretreated least 3 follow class antimyeloma drug : alkylators , proteasome inhibitor immunomodulators , demonstrate progression , within 60 day completion last therapy . Part 2 /MM cohort ; Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis : Multiple Myeloma subject fulfills follow : undergone stem cell transplant , consider transplant ineligible , pretreated least 3 follow class antimyeloma drug : alkylators , proteasome inhibitor immunomodulators , demonstrate progression , within 60 day completion last therapy , measurable disease least one following : serum Mprotein &gt; =0.5 gram ( g ) /decilitre ( dL ) ( &gt; =5 g/Litre ( L ) ) , urine Mprotein &gt; =200 milligram ( mg ) /24hour ( h ) . Serum free light chain ( FLC ) assay : Involved FLC level &gt; =5 mg/dL ( &gt; =50 mg/L ) abnormal serum FLC ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) biopsy prove plasmacytoma ( measure within 28 day Screening Visit ) . Part 2/Other BCMA positive Hematologic Malignancies cohort : Subject one follow lymphoma : Diffuse Large Bcell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) follicular lymphoma ( FL ) exhibit positive BCMA expression tumor cell determine central laboratory use validate Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) assay . Eligible subject BCMA positive malignancy must also fulfill prior treatment requirement follow : DLBCL : least 2 prior line systemic therapy contain least one line chemoimmunotherapy antiCD20 antibody , either undergone stem cell transplant consider transplant ineligible . FL : least 2 prior line systemic therapy . Subjects history autologous stem cell transplant eligible study participation provide follow eligibility criterion meet : transplant &gt; 100 day prior study enrolment , active infection ; subject meet remainder eligibility criterion outline study protocol . Adequate organ system function define Absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1.0x10^9/L , hemoglobin &gt; =8.0 g/dL , platelet &gt; =50x10^9/L , international normalize ration ( INR ) &lt; =1.5 , Partial thromboplastin time &lt; =1.5xupper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin &lt; =1.25xULN , alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase &lt; =1.5 X ULN , serum creatinine calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 1.2XULN &gt; =60 mL/min Part 1 ; &gt; =50 mL/minute ( min ) Part 2 data support loosen criterion , Albuminuria &lt; =500 mg/24h , leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; =50 % , Troponin &lt; =1xULN , Calcium &lt; =1.1xULN A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour first dose study treatment agree use effective contraception study 60 day follow last dose study treatment . Men female partner childbearing potential must either prior vasectomy agree use effective contraception time first dose study 60 day last dose study treatment allow clearance alter sperm All prior treatmentrelated toxicity ( defined National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events , version 4 ) must &lt; =Grade 1 time enrollment except alopecia , grade 2 neuropathy . Systemic antitumor therapy within 14 day , plasmapheresis within 7 day prior first dose study drug Use investigational drug within 14 day five halflives , whichever short , precede first dose study drug . Prior treatment monoclonal antibody within 30 day receive first dose study drug . History allogeneic stem cell transplant . Subjects history autologous stem cell transplant NOT exclude meet inclusion criterion related history autologous stem cell transplant . Presence active renal condition ( infection , requirement dialysis condition could affect subject 's safety ) . Subjects isolate proteinuria result MM eligible , provide fulfil inclusion criterion relate organ system function . Evidence active mucosal internal bleeding Any major surgery within last four week . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric disorder , condition ( include lab abnormality ) could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study procedure . Known active infection require antibiotic treatment Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , hepatic , renal cardiac disease Subjects previous concurrent malignancy allow second tumor contribute subject 's illness . The subject must receive active therapy , hormonal therapy disease disease must consider medically stable least 2 year . Evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : QT interval correct &gt; =470 millisecond , evidence current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia , history myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome ( include unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting bypass graft within six month Screening , Class III IV heart failure define New York Heart Association functional classification system , uncontrolled hypertension , subject intracardiac defibrillator permanent pacemaker , abnormal cardiac valve morphology ( &gt; =grade 2 ) document echocardiogram ( subject grade 1 abnormality [ i.e. , mild regurgitation/stenosis ] enter study ) .
