	<brief_summary>Patients localised prostate cancer treat radical prostatectomy ( prostate gland removal surgery ) radiotherapy . Around 15 % men prostate cancer diagnose high risk disease mean likely suffer treatment failure , disease progression mortality . To date little progress make towards identify effective treatment strategy might delay prevent disease recurrence patient population . Better identification patient high risk relapse improvement therapy therefore research priority . A protein name Mammalian Target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) know play important role development prostate cancer . mTOR form two protein complex ( mTORC1 mTORC2 ) send signal help cancer cell grow control energy use . Blocking function mTOR , inhibitor AZD2014 , might shut supply energy supply tumour cell lead reduce cell growth potentially slow progression disease . The purpose study investigate molecular pharmacology AZD2014 treatment give patient prostate cancer prior radical prostatectomy . The feasibility , safety tolerability short course AZD2014 also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Effects AZD2014 Therapy Given Prior Radical Prostatectomy Men With High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient require take 50mg AZD2014 tablet twice daily 15 day prior radical prostatectomy . Immunohistochemistry carry prostate tumour biopsy take baseline radical prostatectomy order detect phosphorylated biomarkers mTOR signal determine amount mTORC1 mTORC2 signal inhibition cause AZD2014 treatment . On day radical prostatectomy , blood sample collect pre- specified time post- dose pharmacokinetic analysis . Additional blood sample collect study genetic change DNA , RNA circulate tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) may cause AZD2014 treatment . Refer `` outcome measure '' section information .</detailed_description>
