	<brief_title>Two Consecutive Randomized Controlled Trials Using Mobile Phone Applications Risky Alcohol Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : This composite study consist Study 1 Study 2 : Study 1 evaluates efficacy two mobile phone application , Promillekoll PartyPlanner among university student union member two university Sweden . The design three-armed randomized control trial , outcomes measure term change problematic alcohol use followup 6,12 18 week baseline data collection . Both Promillekoll PartyPlanner apps feature real time registration alcohol consumption feedback estimate blood alcohol concentration ( eBAC ) level . Both apps show user estimate alcohol level 0.6 % , level lead negative health consequence . PartyPlanner additionally provide possibility simulate plan alcohol consumption event advance later compare consumption actual event . Study 2 : At 6 week followup participant report alcohol consumption weekly recommend level Sweden redirect Study 2 . They ask stop use prior app alcohol use . Half group randomize TeleCoach app intervention , offer user different exercise reduce abstain alcohol use , depend user 's goal ( reduction abstinence ) . This group access app 6 week . The half participant randomize waitlist control group 6 week . Six week study , TeleCoach intervention group lose access app , waitlist control group give access TeleCoach app 6 week . All participant ( Study 1 Study 2 ) follow 6 , 12 18 week initial baseline recruitment . Method : Study 1 : Participants problematic alcohol use ( AUDIT &gt; 7 men &gt; 5 woman ) , access smartphone run either Android iOs operate system , randomize one three group : 1 . Access Promillekoll , 2 . Access PartyPlanner 3 . Waitlist control group ( gain access apps week 12 ) . Alcohol use outcome collect 6,12 18 week recruitment study . Study 2 : At week 6 Study 1 , participant risky weekly consumption , i.e . 9 14 Swedish standard glass ( Swedish standard glass = 12 g alcohol ) woman men respectively randomize one two group : 1 . Access TeleCoach 6 week , follow 6 week without app . 2 . Six week waitlist control follow 6 week access TeleCoach . Alcohol use outcome collect 6 12 week enter Study 2 ( equivalent 12 18 week initial recruitment Study 1 ) . Students without problematic drinking and/or appropriate smartphones also participate followup , order control regression mean phenomenon . All student complete baseline followup questionnaire participate lottery chance win one three computer tablet . Hypotheses : Study 1 : 1 . The group receive Promillekoll PartyPlanner intervention reduce alcohol use large extent control group follow-up compare baseline level . 2 . The planning function PartyPlanner associate increased decrease alcohol consumption compare real-time use Promillekoll . Study 2 : The proportion participant risky use recommend level decline fast group receive intervention first , comparison control .</detailed_description>
