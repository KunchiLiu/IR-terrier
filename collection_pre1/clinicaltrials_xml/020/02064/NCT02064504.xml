A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) great 40 MlU/mL estradiol le 40 picogram ( pg ) /mL ( le 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential negative pregnancy test determine serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen urine hCG test prior dose AND Agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point .
