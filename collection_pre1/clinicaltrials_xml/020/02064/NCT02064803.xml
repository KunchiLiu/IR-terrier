	<brief_summary>The incidence unresectable obstructive gastric cancer patient range literature 5 30 % . In case , gastro-entero anastomosis traditionally perform improve quality life relieve symptom impaired oral intake without high surgical risk . Unfortunately , 25 % patient may develop impaired gastric empty syndrome . Gastric partition originally describe Devine 1925 method antral exclusion complete division stomach accompany gastro-entero anastomosis proximal gastric pouch management difficult duodenal ulcer . This procedure modify along year adopt palliative treatment gastric cancer . The advantage partition include : well gastric emptying , avoidance direct tumor invasion gastro-entero anastomosis , less contact ingest food tumor less blood lose improved survival . Retrospective randomized study publish demonstrate effectiveness procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first group ( Group A ) consider control group patient undergo gastro-entero anastomosis . The anastomosis pre-colic , along posterior wall stomach length least 5 cm . The first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm angle Treitz use . The anastomosis perform manually stapler . The second group ( group B ) consider intervention group patient undergo gastric partition plus gastro-entero anastomosis . The gastric partitioning do 5 cm proximal lesion along great curvature towards less curvature incisura use linear cut stapler . The partitioning perform horizontally preserve narrow tunnel along less curvature calibrate orogastric tube gauge 32 . Subsequently , pre-colic gastro-entero anastomosis perform proximal gastric chamber create partitioning . The anastomosis do along posterior wall , least 5 cm length use first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm angle Treitz . The anastomosis perform manually stapler .</detailed_description>
