	<brief_title>Long Term Stability , Survival Tolerability ( Novel ) BahaÂ® Implant System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two implant product , standard implant abutment novel implant abutment , develop Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB test CAG5173 clinical investigation complete December 2012 . The primary objective show superiority novel implant compare standard implant term implant stability quotient ( ISQ ) measure resonance frequency analysis1 . Results 6 36 month implantation show new design , novel implant abutment , provide statistically significantly high stability time insertion time compare standard Baha implant2,3,4 . In investigation , sound processor fitting perform 6 week post-implantation . No reduction implant stability follow sound processor fitting record , suggest safe load implant 6 week implantation . The investigation also show improved soft tissue outcome , term low Holgers index5 score novel implant abutment compare standard implant abutment . After initiation 3-year CAG5173 investigation , Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB launch Cochlear Baha BIA300 Implant Abutment , critical aspect identical novel implant use investigation . The 36-month visit last visit investigation . Hence , visit plan scheduled subject participate investigation.participating subject . It clinical scientific interest evaluate clinical performance safety data implant subject additional two-year period , order gain additional understanding implant stability soft tissue status evolve time two implant abutment design , order evaluate long-term implant survival . No randomise control investigation Baha implant 5-year follow-up conduct date . The rationale behind clinical investigation collect long term stability , survival tolerability data novel Baha implant system 5 year implantation population previously follow complete controlled investigation 3 year period . The collect data enable comparison data gather previous complete CAG5173 clinical investigation .</detailed_description>
