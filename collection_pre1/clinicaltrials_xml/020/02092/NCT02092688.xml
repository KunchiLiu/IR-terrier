	<brief_title>Evaluation Novel Diagnostic Kit Detection Placental Alpha-Microglobulin-1 Prediction Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Placental alpha microglobulin-1 ( PAMG-1 ) protein find high concentration amniotic fluid low concentration background level cervico-vaginal discharge . In recent year , medical community increasingly accept widespread use detect PAMG-1 aid provider confirm ruling rupture fetal membrane ( ROM ) . The test use commercially market AmniSure® ROM Test , manufacture AmniSure® International , LLC , Boston , MA , USA . In one original investigation PAMG-1 detection ROM , Lee et al . note 20 23 case AmniSure® ROM Test positive standard clinical assessment ( i.e . nitrazine , ferning pool ) negative , patient ultimately determine rupture upon retrospective analysis clinical course . It later report preterm patient group show sign symptom labor , delivery follow within 7 day . In 2011 , clinical value positive AmniSure® ROM Test patient present sign symptom preterm labor ( PTL ) without membrane rupture investigate group . The result demonstrate AmniSure® ROM Test highly predictive delivery patient within 48 hour , 7 day 14 day . In patient group test perform , membrane rupture exclude condition , present , confirms imminent delivery dictate different course management . It demonstrate AmniSure® ROM Test detect PAMG-1 patient present sign symptom ROM traditional method unable . The likelihood adverse outcomes associate sub-clinical rupture demonstrate statistically different adverse outcome associate gross clinically detectable rupture . The proposed physiological explanation phenomenon PAMG-1 release micro-perforations amniotic membrane copious amount fluid pas . The major difference , however , patient presenting sign preterm labor describe presence , absence , membrane rupture sign complaint . Given complaint ROM typically root overt episode suspicious fluid leakage , hypothesize result concentration PAMG-1 vagina patient without overt complaint sign ROM low current sensitivity threshold AmniSure® ROM Test . Accordingly , device sensitive detection PAMG-1 AmniSure® ROM Test presumably able detect patient risk imminent delivery predecessor patient present labor delivery unit sign , symptom complaint suggestive preterm labor ( PTL ) clinical evidence membrane rupture . If case , tool may significant value provider decide manage patient suspect risk imminent delivery . Management option may include administration tocolytics prolong gestation , corticosteroid improve respiratory development , administration antibiotic decrease risk infection ( intra-partum post-partum ) , prescription bed rest , well increased observation fetal monitoring . Currently , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) indicate recent Practice Bulletin Management Preterm Labor many test identify woman risk preterm birth propose evaluate ; however , ultrasonography fetal fibronectin test show benefit . Ultrasonography determine cervical length , fetal fibronectin testing , combination may useful determine woman high risk preterm delivery . However , clinical usefulness may rest primarily ability identify woman least likely deliver ( i.e . negative predictive value ) . Therefore , urgent need test high positive predictive value order accurately predict imminent delivery allow salutary intervention . Objective 1 . To assess efficacy novel kit detection PAMG-1 cervico-vaginal secretion pregnant woman clinically intact membrane present sign symptom PTL predict time-to-delivery . Assessment stratify follow gestational age range : 1 . 24-31 6/7 week 2 . 32-36 6/7 week 2 . To compare result novel kit detection PAMG-1 pregnant woman present sign PTL control group pregnant woman gestational age without symptom without elevate risk preterm birth . 3 . To compare novel kit detection PAMG-1 method available assess time delivery patient population , include : 1. cervical length measurement trans-vaginal ultrasound 2. cervical dilatation &gt; 1 cm 3 . Contraction Frequency ≥ 6 per hour ( one every 10 min ) 4 . Determine association result kit , cervical length neonatal outcome . Methods 1 . Study group : Patient present symptom PTL 24 36 6/7 week gestation sign inform consent . Control group : Patient present routine pregnancy control without symptom PTL 24 36 6/7 week gestation sign inform consent . 2 . Specimen PAMG-1 test collect accordance manufacturer 's recommendation . During examination physician take vaginal microbiological smear . 3 . The sample label store later examination separate investigator know result physician 's regular clinical evaluation . 4 . After physician completes physical examination patient . 5 . Cervical length measurement transvaginal ultrasound ( TVU ) perform . 6 . Patient delivery data ( e.g . time , condition , etc . ) record follow .</detailed_description>
