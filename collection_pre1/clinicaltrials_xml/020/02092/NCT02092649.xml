	<brief_summary>Fatty acid main component cell membrane . It demonstrate diet alter characteristic function many membrane body , effect cardiovascular metabolic health . Over last two decade substantial rise research effect Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid bodily function . There two fatty acid particular interest researcher , eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) . These fatty acid unique unsaturated structure , incorporation biological membrane seem generate important positive physiological effect . The body unable synthesize fatty acid high concentration elicit significant effect , must obtain diet food via supplementation . It suggest EPA DHA supplementation increase rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) human , part increase use fat fuel rest . There limited number study examine effect Omega 3 supplementation RMR . Some found increase RMR others find change . These study limitation , either use small sample size , low omega fatty acid dose and/or short supplementation period . Due variable result , investigator improve reliability RMR measurement make measure subject two consecutive day time point measure ( 0 , 6 12 week ) . Therefore , purpose study determine effect 12 week omega 3 supplementation ( 3 g/d ) healthy young adult vs. supplementation placebo . The researcher hypothesize EPA DHA supplementation result increase RMR fat oxidation subject others . The duplicate RMR measure determine prevalence magnitude omega 3 supplementation .</brief_summary>
