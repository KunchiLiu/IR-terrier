	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial compare effect delay umbilical cord clamp umbilical cord milk preterm infant ( less 34 week gestation ) . The infant ' hemoglobin hematocrit level Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) evaluate , well rate necrotizing enterocolitis , intraventricular hemorrhage , blood transfusion . The hypothesis milk umbilical cord prior clamp superior simply delay cord clamping , presumably provide increase blood volume preterm neonate improve outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Clamping Milking Umbilical Cord Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal timing clamp umbilical cord birth preterm infant subject controversy debate many year . It recently standard practice ob/gyn clamp umbilical cord immediately post delivery allow immediate transition resuscitation neonate , especially preterm infant . Due fact optimal timing cord clamp yet definitively establish preterm population , information need . Immediate cord clamping , however , could preclude infant extra boost blood volume may prove beneficial later newborn life . Directly compare recently recommend practice delay umbilical cord clamp milk umbilical cord prior clamp potential prove beneficial neonate question , well change daily obstetrical practice . In study infant 34 week randomize one two group : delay cord clamp milk umbilical cord prior clamp . The decision make include immediate cord clamping due recent American Congress Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) recommendation preterm infant cord clamp delay . Their outcome measure serial hemoglobin hematocrit level NICU , incidence necrotizing enterocolitis , incidence intraventricular hemorrhage , need neonatal blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
