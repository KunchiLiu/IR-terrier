	<detailed_description>Methodology : Single-centre , open-label , parallel group , non-randomised multiple-dose 7-day study 12 healthy elderly 12 healthy young male subject . Duration treatment : Each subject participate study approximately 6 week . Participation include screening evaluation within 28 day inpatient period , 12 day inpatient period end study visit ( ESV ) 7 10 day discharge Unit . The study design follow recommendation CPMP/ICH/379/95 ( ICH Topic E7 ) Note Guidance Studies Support Special Populations : Geriatrics , namely inclusion subject age 65 year old contemplate single-dose steady-state PK profile . As primary endpoint study characterize pharmacokinetic profile BIA 9-1067 metabolite different parallel group , need implement blinding procedure include control group . Consequently , trial open label study . Healthy subject rather patient Parkinson 's disease chosen study population , due lack over-toxicity drug acceptable risk-benefit ratio . This allow good interpretation study result , confound factor result change disease state concomitant medication . The subject give screen number signing informed consent chronological order inclusion group ( young/elderly ) .</detailed_description>
