	<brief_summary>ScopeGuide ( Magnetic endoscopic image ) device use colonoscopy provide real-time 3D image shape configuration colonoscope travel colon . Whilst use clinical practice unit UK , device routinely used list , department enough ScopeGuides list . Studies show potentially aid colonoscopy improve completion rate times well patient comfort select endoscopists ( person perform colonoscopy ) . However data benefit conflicting . Subjective mental workload ( individual mental resource require result multiple demand place him/her task ) healthcare employee know important performance safety healthcare delivery . Increased workload task performance may increase fatigue , facilitate error lead overall inferior performance . In colonoscopy high mental workload could potentially responsible longer procedural time , lack trainee learning , inadvertent miss lesion bowel well poor technique lead patient discomfort . The effect endoscopist mental workload performance potential facilitator reduce mental workload area neglect field . This study aim look mental workload endoscopist colonoscopy effect ScopeGuide may workload . Hypothesis : The use ScopeGuide colonoscopy reduce mental workload endoscopist perform procedure</brief_summary>
