	<detailed_description>Introduction Sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) disability affect people worldwide , prevalence expect increase due prolonged life expectancy . SNHL significant negative impact quality life , especially prelingually deafened child . Except certain disease sudden deafness endolymphatic hydrops , may treat alleviated medication surgery , patient SNHL wear hearing aid undergo cochlear implantation regain hearing . However , many individual measure satisfactorily resolve communication problem , hear first step series event lead communication . Between hear communication lie important skill listen comprehension , achieve successful communication suggest patient receive amplification offer type audiological rehabilitation . It report old subject spontaneously acclimatize wear hearing aid , effect either small nonexistent , emphasize importance rehabilitation wear hearing aid . Unfortunately , everyone SNHL Taiwan receive kind rehabilitation . The reason may : ( ) method rehabilitation familiar clinician speech pathologist ; ( b ) shortage clinician speech pathologist provide time-consuming rehabilitation ; ( c ) hearing impaired patient may unable afford unwilling dedicate time rehabilitation ; ( ) difficult measure improvement provide rehabilitation . Recently , rehabilitative training procedure garner interest due technological advance enable hear aid user perform procedures home use personal computer . Burk et al trained young normal-hearing old hearing-impaired listener digitally record training material use computer . The result show old hearing-impaired listener able significantly improve word-recognition ability train one talker , degree achieve level young normal-hearing listener . In addition , improve performance maintain across talker across time . The computer-aided speechreading training ( CAST ) system developed simulate face-to-face training intervention design one component comprehensive aural rehabilitation program preretirement adult acquire mild-to-moderate hearing loss . The aim training enhance speechreading skill complement auditory speech perception . Throughout training , learner view monitor show either computer-generated screen videotape record teacher . CAST design used clinician extend rather replace exist rehabilitative technique . Computer-based training also apply rehabilitation cochlear implant user . Before development computer-based training , study assess effect limited train speech-recognition skill poorer-performing cochlear implant user . Busby et al conduct ten 1-hour speech perception production training session , result demonstrate minimal change perceptual ability three cochlear implant user . Dawson Clark conduct one 50-minute training session per week 10 week , four five subject show measure improvement . The limited success attempt improve speech-recognition ability cochlear implant user think due inadequate amount training . More intensive training cochlear implant user predict effective , normal hearing population train show successfully improve speech segment discrimination identification , recognition spectrally shift speech . Fu et al report encouraging result rehabilitation cochlear implant user use computer-assisted speech training system also call CAST , although different CAST system Pichora-Fuller Benguerel . The CAST system Fu et al , develop House Ear Institute , contain large database training material instal personal computer , minimal facility skill , cochlear implant user conduct train home , clinician speech pathologist monitor subject 's test score training progress . The result demonstrate moderate amount train ( 1 hour per day , 5 day per week ) , 10 postlingually deafen adult cochlear implant user study significant improvement vowel consonant-recognition score . Wu et al apply CAST system 10 Mandarin-speaking child ( three hear aid user seven cochlear implant user ) . After train half hour day , 5 day week , period 10 week , subject show significant improvement vowel , consonant Chinese tone performance . This improved performance largely retain 2 month train complete . Stacey Summerfield also use computer-based auditory training improve perception noise . The result confirm training help overcome effect spectral distortion speech , train material effective several talker include . Based previous study , cochlear implant user improve speech recognition ability train CAST system . If system also effective hearing aid user , especially prelingually deafened patient , CAST system substantially positive impact , many hearing aid user cochlear implant user . The purpose study train prelingually deafen adolescent young adult CAST measure benefit objectively subjectively . The objective benefit measure use publish speech recognition test [ 13 ] , subjective benefit measure use client-oriented scale improvement ( COSI ) . Materials Methods Subjects Fifteen hear aid user prelingual severe profound hearing loss participate study . Another six hearing aid user similar age hearing average include control group . The inclusion criterion study subject control : ( 1 ) age 15 year ; ( 2 ) wear hear aid least 2 year hearing loss diagnose ; ( 3 ) basic ability operate computer ; ( 4 ) Mandarin Chinese speaker ; ( 5 ) motivation undertake training program . The exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) aid hearing average bad 70 dBHL ; ( 2 ) unable operate computer . Before train CAST , participant receive unaided aided sound field audiometry . Table 1 show basic information 21 participant . Client-oriented scale improvement ( COSI ) We use COSI questionnaire evaluate subjective benefit . Before train CAST system , train control group ask identify five specific situation would like cope well . At end training , situation ask ( A ) much good ( bad ) could hear , ( B ) well able cope . For scale purpose , response assign score 1 5 , 5 correspond `` much good '' `` almost always '' , 4 correspond `` good '' `` time '' , 3 correspond `` slightly good '' `` half time '' , 2 correspond `` difference '' `` occasionally '' , 1 correspond `` bad '' `` hardly ever '' , question A B , respectively . Question A define `` improvement '' , question B define `` final ability '' . The total score five situation compare train control group . Test material procedures The speech recognition test material include monosyllabic word , disyllabic spondee word , vowel , consonant Chinese tone recognition test record onto CD-ROM Melody Medical Instruments Corp. male female speaker . The test material display laptop computer connect GSI 61TM clinical audiometer ( Grason-Stadler , USA ) output level 70 dBHL . The testing procedure perform double-walled , sound-treated room . Monosyllabic Chinese word recognition test material include four block 25 Chinese word . For speech recognition test , 50 word select result set 50 token . After monosyllabic Chinese word display , participant ask write word . Four different set open-set test generate speech recognition test . Disyllabic Chinese spondee-word recognition test material include two block Chinese spondee-words , block contain 36 Chinese spondee-words . For speech recognition test , one block select result set 36 token . After Chinese spondee-word displayed , participant ask write word . Four different set open-set test generate via change order material speech recognition test . Vowel recognition test material include 16 Chinese word . Vowel recognition measure use 4-alternative , forced-choice procedure Chinese character show choice list . For speech recognition test , order word change . Thus , four different set closed-set test generate . Consonant recognition test material include 21 Chinese word . Consonant recognition measure use 4-alternative , forced-choice procedure Chinese character show choice list . For speech recognition test , order word change , thus four different set closed-set test generate . Chinese tone recognition test material include 50 Mandarin Chinese word . The participant ask write Chinese tone ( tone : 1 : flat ; 2 : rising ; 3 : falling-rising ; 4 : fall ) Chinese word displayed . For speech recognition test , order word change , thus four different set open-set test generate . Before training , group underwent series speech recognition test baseline data . The training group start train whereas control group receive training . Every 4 week , participant return lab another series speech recognition test use different test material . Every participant receive total four speech recognition test end study . Training tools procedure CAST software develop House Ear Institute distribute Melody Medical Instrument Corp. use train tool . The training group instruct train home follow program least 1 hour per day , 3 day week , 12 successive week . The control group receive training return lab every 4 week speech recognition test . For participant training group , baseline speech recognition test perform software instal personal computer . The result analyze software automatically generate targeted training program . The software contain large amount information include pure tone , vowel recognition , consonant recognition , tone recognition , speaker recognition , environmental sound , occasional word occasional sentence . The subject ask focus pure tone , vowel recognition , consonant recognition tone recognition training . The subject start train level generate computer software . There usually five level difficulty training category , level consist several training session . For pure tone recognition training , subject ask choose sound different others . Visual feedback provide whether response correct incorrect . After train session complete , score calculate . If score exceed 80 , train proceed high level . If score exceed 80 , train session repeat score exceed 80 . At high level training session , difference speech feature response choice reduce . For vowel recognition training , subject ask choose vowel different others . After subject progress beyond 3-alternative forced-choice discrimination task , train identify final vowel . Similar training procedure use consonant tone recognition training . Each subject training group ask register Melody Medical Instrument Corp. website , username password provide u . Therefore , able monitor total time spent training , training time score exercise . If subject reach require amount time training session , contact family encourage training . Statistical method All statistical analysis perform SAS software ( Version 9.1.3 , SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , U.S.A. ) R software ( Version 2.7 ) . Two-sided p value 0.05 less consider statistically significant . Continuous data express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) unless otherwise specify . Percentages calculate categorical variable . Two-sample test Wilcoxon rank-sum test use compare mean medians continuous data two group , whereas chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test use analyze categorical proportion two group . In addition univariate analysis , data five speech recognition test analyze fit multiple marginal linear regression model use generalized estimating equation . If first-order autocorrelation ( i.e. , AR ( 1 ) ) structure fit repeat measure data well , model-based standard error estimate use generalized estimating equation analysis ; otherwise , empirical standard error estimate report . In addition , data COSI analyze fit multiple linear regression model . Basic model-fitting technique variable selection , goodness-of-fit assessment , regression diagnostics use regression analyse ensure quality result . In stepwise variable selection , univariate significant non-significant covariates consider , significance level entry stay set 0.15 large . The goodness-of-fit measure , coefficient determination ( R2 ) , compute linear regression model , square correlation observe response variable predict value . It value 0 1 , large value indicate good fit multiple linear regression model observe continuous data . In addition , variance inflation factor examine detect potential multicollinearity problem ( define value ≥ 10 ) .</detailed_description>
