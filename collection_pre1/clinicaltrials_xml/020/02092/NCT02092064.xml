	<brief_title>Association Between Basal Proteinuria Levels Pregnancy Outcomes Familial Mediterranean Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) also know recurrent polyserositis common hereditary recurrent febrile disorder . It characterize paroxysmal episode high fever sign serositis-peritonitis , pleuritis , synovitis . Between attack , patient usually asymptomatic . FMF mainly affect population Mediterranean region Turks . The diagnosis FMF may extremely difficult establish presence atypical sign , absence family history . Colchicine effective patient FMF . The one important complication FMF development renal amyloidosis . It potentially progress sequentially preclinical , proteinuric , nephrotic , azotemic uremic stage end stage renal disease treat properly colchicine . Previous study suggest colchicine appear major human teratogen , , probably , cytogenetic effect . FMF affect female mainly childbearing year . FMF associate high rate recurrent abortion , premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) preterm birth . Despite adverse outcome report pregnants FMF outcome pregnancy FMF appear favorable healthy population since usingof colchicine . Although effect pregnancy course FMF related amyloidosis controversial , generally accept renal function may disrupt pregnancy . Few study investigate effect FMF complication ( amyloidosis nephrotic syndrome ) pregnancy course . The aim study investigate effect basal proteinuria pregnancy outcome patient Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) .</detailed_description>
