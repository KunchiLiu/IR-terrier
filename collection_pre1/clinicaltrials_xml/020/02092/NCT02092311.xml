	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine rate major post-varicocelectomy complication ( Recurrence , Hydrocele Testicular Atrophy ) patient operate new method name Combined Mini-incision Microscopic Varicocelectomy . The study hypothesis use method lead less major complication recurrence , hydrocele , also less incidental injury arteries result less testicular atrophy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Rates Major Complications Combined Mini-incision Microscopic Varicocelectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sample select patient refer center surgical treatment varicocele . Most diagnosed evaluated infertility . All operate single experience expert microscopic surgeon . Informed consent receive possible candidate accordance national Declaration Helsinki guideline . Selection patient undergo Combined varicocelectomy do operation due nature include criterion . In method making incision inguinal level , vein evaluate include criterion exist , external spermatic vein ligate depth inguinal canal vein leave alone prevention damage artery . Then another mini incision make high inguinal level rest surgery conduct retroperitoneal approach . The incidence rate major complication ( recurrence , testicular atrophy , hydrocele ) experimental group compare incidence rate complication patient control group operate currently common inguinal subinguinal microscopic varicocelectomy accompany testicular delivery , approach suggest Goldstein associate . The study hypothesis use method lead less major complication include recurrence , hydrocele also less incidental injury arteries result less testicular atrophy .</detailed_description>
