	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ruxolitinib phosphate work treat patient chronic neutrophilic leukemia ( CNL ) atypical chronic myeloid leukemia ( aCML ) . Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop growth cancer cell block enzyme need cell reproduce . This trial also study genetic makeup patient . Certain gene cancer cell may determine cancer grows spread may respond different drug . Studying gene associate CNL aCML respond study drug may help doctor learn CNL aCML improve treatment disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Phosphate Treating Patients With Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient chronic neutrophilic leukemia ( CNL ) atypical chronic myeloid leukemia ( aCML ) hematologic response ruxolitinib ( ruxolitinib phosphate ) ( partial response [ PR ] , complete response [ CR ] , complete response , partial [ CRp ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency grade 3 4 hematologic non-hematologic adverse event experienced subject therapy ruxolitinib . II . To determine whether hematologic response correlate certain type mutation colony stimulate factor 3 receptor ( CSF3R ) reduction mutant CSF3R allele burden peripheral blood . III . To determine maximum clinical response subject median duration maximum clinical response . IV . To determine mean % reduction spleen size , estimate volume use conventional prolate ellipsoid method measure ultrasound compare baseline . V. To determine mean % reduction total symptom score measure modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form version 2.0 ( MPN-SAF ) compare start study ( day 1 , cycle 1 ) . VI . To determine overall survival subject complete minimum 6 cycle . VII . To determine proportion subject discontinue completion &gt; 3 cycle &lt; 6 cycle . VIII . To determine proportion subject discontinue prior completion cycle 3 . OUTLINE : Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally ( PO ) every day , daily ( QD ) , twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course ( 96 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 2 week 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
