	<brief_summary>The study large scale cluster randomise trial evaluate effect sodium reduction base upon use salt substitute risk stroke define occurrence stroke stroke death . The corresponding null hypothesis test sodium reduction effect upon stroke risk . The secondary objective determine effect sodium reduction major vascular event total mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China Salt Substitute Stroke Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lowering sodium intake use salt substitute prove low blood pressure level . Effects risk vascular outcome define adequately power randomised trial . Rural Chinese know consume large quantity sodium suffer high rate hypertension stroke . This study large scale cluster randomise trial do rural area China . The study define effect salt substitute-based sodium reduction strategy primary outcome stroke . Secondary endpoint include major cardiovascular event total mortality . The study conduct 600 rural village across five Northern Chinese province Tibet . The study recruit 35 individual elevate risk stroke village total 21,000 participant . The participate village randomise intervention control group 1:1 allocation . Recruitment prioritise individual history stroke also include old individual high blood pressure . Follow schedule 5 year . Individuals intervention village receive repeat dietary advice supply low sodium salt substitute individual control villages receive dietary advice baseline . Every 6 month throughout follow-up individual contact phone call inquire occurrence stroke , hospitalisation cause diagnose serious illness . The interview structure do individual mask randomised assignment individual . For death identify event might possibly non-fatal stroke home visit make . A series process indicator include urinary sodium , urinary potassium , blood pressure , knowledge sodium use salt substitute also measure random sample least 20 individual draw random selection 60 village baseline every year thereafter .</detailed_description>
