	<brief_summary>Background : EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUSFNA ) well establish technique tissue acquisition diagnosis excellent safety profile . The overall diagnostic yield EUSFNA exceed 80 % , high rate EUSFNA lymph node , rate &gt; 90 % may expect , compare pancreatic mass , low diagnostic rate report . To maximize diagnostic yield , least 3 needle pass require lymph node least 4 pass pancreatic mass . Olympus recently make commercially available new 22 gauge FNA needle ( EZ Shot 2 side port ) side port needle tip . The theoretical basis introduction side port increase diagnostic yield . Preliminary unpublished retrospective data suggest yield might raise . However , prospective multicenter randomize controlled study ascertain validity assumption . Aim : To determine whether difference diagnostic yield EZ-Shot 2 EZ-Shot 2 side port patient pancreatic mass evaluation . Methods : Patients pancreatic mass refer EUSFNA recruit prospectively randomize either EZ-Shot 2 EZ Shot 2 sideport first puncture , alternative needle use repeat punctured . The cytological diagnostic yield first pas needle compare . Clinical significance : This determine whether new needle design improve diagnostic yield EUSFNA pancreatic mass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUSFNA ) well establish technique clinical practice . In routine gastrointestinal endoscopy gastroscopy , mucosal layer digestive tract visualize . In case EUS , ultrasonic transducer locate tip echoendoscope allow endoscopist visualize wall gastrointestinal tract series definable layer correspond histology , rather single entity , also enable detailed image area outside digestive tract , intra-abdominal lymph node , solid organ liver , pancreas see . EUS significant clinical impact allow assessment submucosal GI lesion , loco-regional stag gastrointestinal malignancy , tissue diagnosis EUSFNA stag pancreaticobiliary lesion , non-small-cell lung carcinoma , mediastinal disease . EUSFNA minimally invasive technique tissue acquisition EUS guidance . A FNA needle insert accessory channel curvilinear echoendoscope . Both target lesion needle tip visualize real time ultrasound guidance , potential intervening vessel exclude turn Doppler mode prior needle puncture . The lesion puncture real-time ultrasonic guidance material aspirate needle cytological assessment . In prospective trial , EUSFNA clearly establish important diagnostic tool , excellent safety profile . The overall diagnostic yield EUSFNA exceed 80 % , high rate EUSFNA lymph node , rate &gt; 90 % may expect , compare pancreatic mass , low diagnostic rate report . The somewhat low rate solid pancreatic lesion compare lymph node could due underlie desmoplastic change associate pancreatic malignancy . EUSFNA may perform rapid site cytopathological assessment ( ROSE ) aspirate material guide number needle pass perform . In practice , rapid site cytopathological assessment feasible recommended situation , order maximize diagnostic yield , least 3 needle pass perform lymph node least 4 pass perform pancreatic mass . Even without onsite cytopathological assessment , excellent result great 90 % diagnostic yield report expert center . Needles EUSFNA available four manufacturer , namely Cook Endoscopy , Boston Scientific , Olympus Corporation Mediglobe . The available needle diameter 25 , 22 19 gauge . These needle sharp tip puncture hollow core aspiration puncture . The hollow needle core cover stylet withdrawn puncture facilitate aspiration . Aspiration usually facilitate application suction use syringe attach entry port hollow core needle , stylet withdrawn , although must also acknowledge endoscopists prefer apply suction order reduce possibility bloody aspirate . Olympus recently make commercially available new 22 gauge FNA needle side port needle tip . The theoretical basis introduction side port facilitate process fine needle aspiration , increase diagnostic yield . There preliminary unpublished retrospective data suggest yield might raise . However , prospective multicenter randomize controlled study ascertain validity assumption . Currently two needle similar design , apart absence presence side port , available Olympus Corporation . These EZ-Shot 2 ( model : NA-220H-8022 ) EZ-Shot 2 side port ( NA-230H-8022 ) Aim The aim prospective randomize study determine whether difference diagnostic yield EZ-Shot 2 ( model : NA-220H-8022 ) EZ-Shot 2 side port ( NA-230H-8022 ) patient pancreatic mass evaluation . Materials methods 1 . Setting trial design : Setting : International ; multicenter . Trial design : Randomized prospective comparative study . 2 . Subjects : Inclusion criterion : 1 ) patient refer EUSFNA pancreatic mass ; 2 ) inform consent obtain performance EUSFNA . Exclusion criterion : 1 ) presence active gastrointestinal bleeding ; 2 ) presence coagulopathy define platelet count &lt; 50000/mm3 or/ international normalize ratio &gt; 1.5 ; 3 ) current use thienopyridines ( e. g. clopidogrel ) patent require anti-platelet therapy ; 4 ) absence procedural informed consent . 3 . Informed Consent : The protocol approve local Institutional Review Board . Patients give informed consent procedure . 4 . Interventions : Randomization : Randomization needle use initial puncture carry block 5 equal assignment EZ-Shot 2 ( model : NA-220H-8022 ) EZ-Shot 2 side port ( NA-230H-8022 ) needle . Once first 2 puncture perform , alternative needle use obtain subsequent needle pass . EUS EUSFNA technique : EUS EUS perform use curvilinear echoendoscope accord standard techniques9 credentialed endoscopist direct supervision credentialed endoscopist case procedure perform trainee . The patient either undergo procedure without sedation , sedation general anesthesia clinically indicate . As per standard technique , lesion visualize use EUS , 22gauge EUSFNA needle ( depend randomization either NA-220H-8022 NA-230H-8022 ) introduce accessory channel echoendoscope lesion puncture real time ultrasonic guidance . After withdrawal stylet application suction attachment syringe negative pressure , needle move fro within lesion approximately 30 second , needle withdrawn material aspirate express onto glass slide reinsertion stylet direct smear make either endoscopist cytotechnician . This process repeat use first needle . The alternative needle use make 2 punctures.. Preparation aspirate material definition cellular adequacy diagnostic yield10,11 : The material aspirate express onto glass slide reinsertion stylet direct smear make either endoscopist cytotechnician . After express cellular material onto glass slide , half slide air-dried half alcohol fix ( 95 % ethanol ) subsequent cytological assessment . When material express , residual content needle flush 5 10 mL sterile saline solution balance salt solution . After flush needle , outside needle stylet vigorously wipe saline solution-soaked sterile gauze reduce cross contamination pass . An adequate specimen define clear presence target organ cell . In case pancreas must least 4 cluster pancreatic acinar cell without presence malignant-appearing cell . A cytopathologist blind needle use FNA , characterize individual needle pas assessment adequate cellularity ( 0 [ inadequate ] 1 [ adequate ] ) diagnosis malignancy ( insufficient , normal , `` suspicious , '' malignant ) . . The diagnosis arrive needle pas compare final diagnosis base composite cytology , histology clinical course . The EUSFNA finding classify 1 ) inadequate diagnosis ; 2 ) true positive malignancy ; 3 ) true negative malignancy ; 4 ) false positive malignancy ; 5 ) false negative malignancy . 5 . Statistics Sample size : As exploratory study , sequential trial design use determine ideal sample size . For initial assessment , total 30 pancreatic mass target . Dependent outcome trend , may increase 100 case . Outcome variable : Primary 1 . Compare 1st pas cellular adequacy rate needle : 2 . Compare overall cellular adequacy rate needle 3 . Compare overall diagnostic accuracy rate needle 4 . Compare 1st pas diagnostic accuracy adequacy rate needle 6 . Timetable work Complete study within 6 month , may extend 24 month</detailed_description>
