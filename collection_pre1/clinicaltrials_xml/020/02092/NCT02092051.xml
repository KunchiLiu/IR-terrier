	<detailed_description>Background A keystone prevent diabetic complication patient type 1 diabetes good glycaemic control ( 1 ) . Today , intensive glycaemic treatment generally achieve multiple daily insulin injection ( MDI ) insulin pump , also term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII , [ 2 ] ) . Regular capillary self-measured blood glucose value crucial obtain good glycaemic control guide patient insulin dos ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) . During recent year continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) become treatment option guide patient insulin dosage activity ( 6 ) . CGM advantage inform patient estimate glucose value continuously , least important illustrate trend increase decrease glucose level . Data several clinical trial CGM show divergent result glycaemic control effect ( 7 ) . In clinical trial , patient CSII include initiated CGM CSII simultaneously intervention . In trial patient MDI CSII include , post hoc analysis also result divergent finding whether effect glycaemic control potentially differs combine CGM MDI CSII ( 8 , 9 , 10 ) . Although absolute majority adult type 1 diabetic patient treat MDI , clinical trial initiate CGM pure MDI-treated group absent . The current trial cross-over design 69 week duration , patient randomize patient CGM-treatment 26 week , conventional therapy 26 week wash-out period 17 week . The primary endpoint effect HbA1c . Purpose/aim The aim study analyse effect CGM glycaemic control measure A1C , high low glucose level measure CGM , quality life patient type 1 diabetes treat MDI . Treatment The study intervention CGM ( Dexcom G4 , Dexcom Corporation ) compare conventional therapy use self-measurements blood glucose level ( SMBG ) guide dosage insulin . Randomization After maximum run-in period six week patient randomize either CGM continue conventional therapy . During run-in period blind CGM perform two week . After blinded CGM period patient believe wear CGM sensor 80 % study time period randomization CGM , patient perform adequate calibration run-in period ( average least 12 14 7-day period ) , randomize . The patient show example picture glucose curve ( curve ) trend arrows , explain physician/diabetic educator give patient good chance judge often use sensor . Consenting patient randomize CGM conventional therapy 26 week conventional therapy 26 week , intermittent wash-out period 17 week . Patients initially randomize 1:1 , stratify site , CGM conventional therapy . A centralised web system use randomisation . Each patient assign unique anonymous Subject ID randomisation . Duration The expect study duration participant 72 week , include assume mean run-in period 3 week . The total study period expect 84 week , include recruitment period 12 week . Selection withdrawal subject Patients fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion HbA1c level , fast C-peptide creatinine analyse central laboratory . The study plan include 120 patient randomize 1:1 , stratify site , CGM conventional therapy . Treatment 26 week group , wash-out period 17 week treatment . An expected drop-out rate assume 5 % -10 % without replacement . Rescreening Rescreening patient possible study , maximally one time . There time limit rescreening . It perform interval previous screening . Rescreening performed inclusion/exclusion criterion fit inclusion criterion fulfil exclusion criterion previous screening . However , possibility criterion fit inclusion criterion fit exclusion criterion rescreening visit ; e.g . glycaemic control worsen since last screening HbA1c fit inclusion criterion previous screen visit . Treatment procedure During run-in period patient blind CGM two week . If patient believe perform blind CGM he/she able wear sensor use CGM-system majority study period ( 80 % time ) randomize CGM , he/she exclude randomization . In addition , subject adherent calibration procedure ( require average &gt; 12 14 calibration 7 day period ) . There least 10 day valid blind CGM data randomization . All patient trial instruct regard basic information insulin dosing , bolus correction , type food elevate glucose level effect physical activity glucose control . This information provide level clinical practice patient type 1 diabetes , i.e . guarantee patient basic skill dose insulin . All patient also educate proportion rapid act insulin analogue remain various time point injection . At clinical visit care-giver discuss glucose level measure SMBG CGM data patient possible improvement diabetes care . This perform correspondence intensive therapy use clinical practice . All patient possibility contact responsible staff trial site additional support visit need , e.g . technical problem SMBG meter DexCom 4G system , extra visit plan aim improve glycaemic control . During least first week randomization CGM alarm level set CGM , constantly active acute alarm low glucose level . The reason patient shall taught active judging trend CGM react certain level alarm . Alarm setting introduce 2 week randomization , late . At visit patient motivate active use information CGM least every 1-2 hour daytime . In correspondence , patient motivate measure blood glucose level randomize conventional therapy accordance guideline , i.e . least 4 time day . At 2 initial visit treatment period patient check general skill adopt dose insulin , type food elevate glucose level influence physical activity glucose level . BG-values evaluate visit patient receive conventional therapy possible improvement dose insulin , food intake physical activity . In correspondence , CGM-curves analyse well algorithms dosage insulin CGM-data physical activity influence eat habit glucose level . When randomized CGM patient instructed start point treatment phase two consecutive visit predefined algorithm adjust insulin . In treatment phase visit take place start point , week 2 , 4 , 13 26 . Blinded CGM perform participant two week baseline two week start point second treatment phase . Participants randomize conventional therapy also CGM 2 4 last week treatment period ( perform 23-26 66-69 respectively ) . HbA1c record start point treatment period subsequent study visit except week 2 treatment phase . At start point end treatment phase extend blood sample take include biobank sample . At visit SMBG CGM data download randomized patient , diabetes educator physician discus potential improvement optimise glycaemic control patient . SMBG-data download also patient CGM-treatment . Rescue criterion If clinician diabetic educator determines CGM use associate severe risk , e.g. , severe hypoglycaemia , CGM treatment shall stop patient receive conventional treatment . Treatment satisfaction quality life Patients fill questionnaire blind CGM treatment phase end treatment phase . The DTSQ use many diabetes therapy clinical trial validate questionnaire consist 8 question . Two version use , DTSQs DTSQc , DTSQs use record current treatment satisfaction DTSQc patient retrospectively compare various treatment . SWE-HFS consist 23 question concern action prevent hypoglycaemia fear hypoglycaemia . The Swedish translation well validate ( 12 ) . SWE-PAID-20 consist 20 question regard situation diabetes may problem individual . WHO-5 consist 5 question assess patient well-being . IPAQ consist 4 question various level physical activity last 7 day . ( 13 ) Hypoglycaemia confidence questionnaire consist 9 question regard confident patient regard handle hypoglycaemia The questionnaire complete study site . The patient allow individually complete questionnaire reasonably quiet environment . It emphasize patient complete questionnaire prior clinical measurement meet doctor . Questionnaires answer patient alone ; however , nurse/assistant inform help patient complete questionnaire , necessary , without influence patient ' response . Only anonymous Subject ID use identify questionnaire ensure patient confidentiality . Study nurses/assistants check questionnaire completeness . The PI shall ensure appropriate study training provide . Hypoglycaemia Periods hypoglycaemia compare use blind CGM versus randomization open CGM corresponding time period . The regular definition hypoglycaemia use SMBG difficult compare since patient use CGM detect asymptomatic hypoglycaemia due CGM alert symptom hypoglycaemia . The number severe hypoglycaemic event , define unconsciousness due hypoglycaemia need assistance another person resolve hypoglycaemia , record . The time low glucose value analyse compare active treatment CGM blind CGM corresponding time period .</detailed_description>
