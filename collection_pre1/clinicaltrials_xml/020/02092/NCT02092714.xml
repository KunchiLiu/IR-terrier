	<brief_title>Molecular Analysis Tissue Samples From Patients With Advanced Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform gene panel sequence patient neuroendocrine tumor care Fox Chase Cancer Center purpose identify therapeutic target prognostic marker . II . To assess feasibility perform clinical trial molecularly match therapy patient differ subtypes neuroendocrine tumor ( neuroendocrine tumor pancreas [ PNETs ] , non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [ NETs ] , poorly differentiate NETs ) , base upon proportion patient actionable mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proportion patient whose therapy alter base upon result molecular test . II . To evaluate percent patient local protocol offer potential therapeutic option . III . To evaluate number patient treat base therapy guide molecular profiling . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare outcomes patient treat early therapy base gene profile outcome treat via National Cancer National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline recommend therapy ( systemic therapy , liver direct therapy , hepatic resection ) expectant observation via measurement progression free survival ( PFS ) , via radiographic response rate , via biochemical response rate . II . To evaluate prognostic power commonly ( &gt; = 10 % ) detect mutation . III . To evaluate impact mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway alteration ( mutation phosphatase tensin homolog gene [ PTEN ] , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha [ PIK3CA ] ) efficacy mTOR target therapeutic , assess progression free survival ( PFS ) response rate ( RR ) . IV . To evaluate impact o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase ( MGMT ) status efficacy alkylating base chemotherapy regimen ( Temodar , dacarbazine , streptozocin ) , assessed progression free survival ( PFS ) response rate ( RR ) . V. To evaluate impact thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) status efficacy fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen ( capecitabine , 5-fluorouracil ) , assessed progression free survival ( PFS ) response rate ( RR ) . VI . To evaluate impact excision repair cross-complementing 1 ( ERCC-1 ) status efficacy platinum-based chemotherapy regimen ( carboplatin , cisplatin , oxaliplatin ) , assessed progression free survival ( PFS ) response rate ( RR ) . OUTLINE : Previously collect tissue sample analyze via mutational sequence immunohistochemistry . After completion study , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
