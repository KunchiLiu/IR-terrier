	<brief_title>Objective Assessment Upper Extremity Functioning Stroke Patients Before After Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Most stroke patient continue suffer upper extremity motor deficiency even prolong intense rehabilitation hospital . Even though guideline study recommend apply rehabilitation program patient reception . As opposed scarce evidence efficacy rehabilitation . Objectives : To evaluate objective measure improvement motor performance upper extremity stroke patient sub acute period . Secondary objective describe correlation proximal distal motor deficiency upper extremity . Hypothesis : Patients show good hand performance end hospitalization . Part attribute rehabilitation part spontaneous recovery . Correlation find proximal distal upper extremity motor deficiency . Methods : Trial begin IRB research approval . All treatment session implement physical occupational staff hospital . Assessments measure carry certified physical therapist coinvestigator . The coinvestigator collect raw data analysis Excel SPSS . 20 stroke patient meet inclusion criterion participate study , sign informed consent.Patients undergo first assessment measure , e.g : motor ability Fugl-Meyer test , handwrite kinematic kinetic measure surface electromyography measurement muscle synergy.Patients treat standard rehabilitation physical occupational therapy period 3-4 week . Before discharge hospital patient undergo another assessment measure , order evaluate progression upper limb motor ability reception . Part patient assess two three week discharge follow . Outcome Measures : upper limb Fugl-Meyer assessment , handwrite Air-time , pressure velocity , EMG ( i.e. , muscle onset , muscle amplitude , muscle co-activation ratio ) . Statistical analysis : ANOVA analysis use measure time effect . Correlation measure measure Pearson ` correlation . Sample size ( n=20 ) calculate base 5 point improvement Fugl-Meyer test minimal significant change power 0.8 p-level 0.05 significance . Key word : Stroke , Muscle synergy , Handwriting , Fugl-Meyer</detailed_description>
