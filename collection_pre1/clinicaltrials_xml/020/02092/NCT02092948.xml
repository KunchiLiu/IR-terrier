	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether positron emission tomography ( PET ) , use new image drug [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody use image prostate , pancreatic bladder cancer spread bone soft tissue ( e.g. , lymph node , lung , etc. ) . The PET image drug test study bind cell marker call Prostate Stem Cell Antigen ( PSCA ) , present certain prostate , pancreatic bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study evaluate124I-A11 PSCA Minibody Patients With Metastatic Prostate , Bladder Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The people study want find : 1 . Can [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody use image prostate , pancreatic bladder cancer ? 2 . How much PSCA Minibody need use see prostate , pancreatic bladder cancer ? 3 . Does PSCA Minibody see more/same/fewer lesion identify traditional scan bone scan CT scan ? To answer question , want evaluate [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody distribute throughout body 20 patient prostate , pancreatic bladder cancer . This do PET/CT image . A PET/CT scan non-invasive x-ray test use special camera take picture inside body . It `` see '' radiation give tiny particle call positron radioactive drug inject also take picture organ within body . For study radioactive substance [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody . The scanning study do imaging procedure department Nuclear Medicine experimental drug [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody administer intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion . An experimental drug one yet approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . [ 124 I ] PSCA-Minibody combination monoclonal antibody , I-124 , radioactive type iodine . The iodine make antibody cancer cell visible PET scan . PET stand positron emission tomography use radioactivity image inside body . A CT scan us x-rays look internal organ body . This study use combination PET/CT look cancer cell body take study agent well see location body .</detailed_description>
