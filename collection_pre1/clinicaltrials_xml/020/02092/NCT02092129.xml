	<brief_summary>Acromegaly frequently associate impaired glucose tolerance diabetes . We hypothesise pituitary histopathology plasma hyperprolactinaemia could prognostic value predict risk glucose metabolic disturbance acromegalic patient . The aim study examine glucose metabolic outcome acromegalic patient without histologically verify prolactin growth hormone ( GH ) co-secreting adenoma . The study population include 79 patient undergone surgical treatment acromegaly .</brief_summary>
