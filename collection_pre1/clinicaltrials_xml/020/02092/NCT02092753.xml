	<brief_title>Ketogenic Or LOGI Diet In Breast Cancer Rehabilitation Intervention ( KOLIBRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient 's whole body metabolism characterize increased fat oxidation rate decrease ability metabolize glucose energy demand ( insulin resistance ) . In preliminary study show , fat rich diet allow spare muscle mass reduce due catabolic mechanism . The result well body composition relate less fatigue high quality life , latter show advanced cancer patient ketogenic diet . The aim KOLIBRI-study analyze fat rich ketogenic diet ( KD ) moderate fat rich `` low glycämic insulinemic '' ( LOGI ) diet compare standard low fat diet ( SD ) feasible , safe tolerable improve quality life physical performance patient Breast Cancer rehabilitation phase . The stringent nutritional regime high fat low carbohydrates ketogenic diet ( KD ) comprise least 75 % daily calorie via fat ( derive several plant oil , nut , avocado , butter , cream , cheese , egg , fatty fish fat rich meat ) , balance protein ( 1.4 g/kg body weight/day ) low carbohydrate ( approx . 20-30 gram per day , derive salad , vegetable , berry fruit , milk product like yoghurt ) . A less strict even low carbohydrates rich fat protein standard diet LOGI regimen . It allow 120 gram carbohydrate ( inclusion vegetable fruit rare grain potato compare KD ) , high protein ( 1.7 g/kg body weight/day ) rich fat ( remain calorie ) The control nutritional regime follow standard recommendation German society nutrition ( DGE ) comprise least 50 % daily energy derive carbohydrate , 0.8 grams/kg body weight protein 30 % daily energy expenditure fat . It open-label trial nutritional intervention 20 week span three phase : The first phase span 3 week stationary intervention hospital ( location : Bad Kissingen , Bavaria , Germany ) initial examination ( medical , body composition , food preference , quality life , blood sample , physical performance ) follow implementation allocate diet respective training patient diet calculation , cook realization diet regimen routine daily life . The second phase encompasses16 week outhouse phase continue select nutritional regime close contact supervision study team accompany urine measurement ( KD group ) , food diary , questionnaire cover quality life one blood sample ) The third phase study represent one week stationary intervention hospital final examination teach eiterh stick select diet change diet individually preferred one .</detailed_description>
