	<brief_summary>Investigators Biomedical Imaging Research Institute ( BIRI ) Cedars-Sinai Medical Center develop Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) method image coronary artery use slow-infusion , contrast-enhanced data acquisition . This method allow fast data acquisition well spatial resolution . Specific aim study : 1. compare coronary artery image without contrast medium healthy subject patient ; 2. ass accuracy coronary MRI detect coronary artery disease compare conventional x-ray angiography Researchers hypothesize contrast-enhanced MRI improve delineation coronary artery non-contrast-enhanced MRI optimize , contrast-enhanced coronary MRI technique accurately detect coronary artery disease ( CAD ) compare conventional x-ray angiography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast- Enhanced Whole-Heart Coronary MRA 3.0T ( Tesla )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare image quality contrast non-contrast cardiac MR evaluate diagnostic accuracy cardiac MRI procedure patient population include healthy volunteer study group patient know CAD schedule clinical coronary angiography within one month signing informed consent . Both group eligible combination image test . Subjects may receive either non-contrast MRI contrast-enhanced MRI depend upon kidney function study focus . Also base upon focus study time scan improve image quality , beta-blocker lessen motion artifact patient higher heart rate may administer patient may ask undergo stress test comparison.This one-day research procedure . Studies acquire approve Institutional Review Board # 25881 Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : All subject must enrol IRB approve CedarsSinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry data collect analysis study . Male female â‰¥ 18years age Healthy Group No known CAD CAD GroupScheduled clinical invasive coronary artery xray angiography within one month study participation Exclusion : MR image contraindicated person mechanically , magnetically , electrically activated implant , cardiac pacemaker , neurostimulators , infusion pump . Persons ferromagnetic implant ferromagnetic foreign body , intracranial , aneurysm clip , shrapnel intraocular metal chip could become dislodged . Patients pregnant , nursing implant intrauterine device ( IUD 's ) Persons atrial fibrillation time MR scan could result poor image quality due interference electrocardiographic gate necessary image acquisition . Persons unable tolerate MRI image secondary inability lie supine severe claustrophobia . Patient renal failure ( GFR &lt; 45 ) Allergy animal dander animalinstigated asthma Specific Ablavar : Baseline ECG measurement concomitant medication check subject choose participate Ablavar study , base upon study need . If ECG measurement and/or medication indicate subject high risk arrhythmia , subject exclude Ablavar study , participate OptiMark/MultiHance contrast study noncontrast study . Specific betablocker administration : contraindication beta blocker . If subject find contraindication betablockers decline administration betablockers subject exclude betablocker portion still participate noncontrast contrastenhanced scan without betablocker administration . Specific Regadenoson : contraindication regadenoson administration . If subject find contraindication regadenoson subject exclude regadenoson portion still participate noncontrast contrastenhanced scan without regadenoson stress test . Specific Adenosine : contraindication adenosine administration.If subject find contraindication adenosine subject exclude adenosine portion still participate noncontrast contrastenhanced scan without adenosine stress testing .</criteria>
