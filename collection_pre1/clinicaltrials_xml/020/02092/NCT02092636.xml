	<brief_summary>An imaging method develop us near infrared light adjunct ultrasound good diagnosis monitor tumor response . This study use new , non-invasive way evaluate breast lump use low power light source &amp; ultrasound see breast lump benign cancerous . This study also evaluate new technique might useful assess response chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose validate utility investigator novel hybrid imaging technique accurate diagnosis breast lesion , assess chemotherapy response cancer treatment predict treatment efficacy . The investigator unique hybrid technique implement simultaneously deploy near infrared ( NIR ) optical sensor commercial ultrasound ( US ) transducer mount hand-held probe , utilize co-registered lesion structure information provide ultrasound improve inverse optical tomography reconstruction . As result , optical tomography assist US overcome problem associate intense light scatter provide reliable tumor angiogenesis distribution . Initial result group 200 biopsied patient show early stage invasive cancer present two-fold great total hemoglobin concentration average fibroadenomas benign lesion . Initial result advance cancer show angiogenesis distribution highly distort heterogeneous , distorted distribution correlate histological microvessel density count use assess chemotherapy response . Objective study validate investigator initial result NIR light guide ultrasound improve breast cancer diagnosis monitor chemotherapy response .</detailed_description>
