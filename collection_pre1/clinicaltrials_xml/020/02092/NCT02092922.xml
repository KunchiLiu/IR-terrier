	<criteria>Key Patients confirm multiple myeloma whose treatment history must include follow : 1 . Received least 2 prior line therapy ( induction therapy stem cell transplant ± maintenance consider single line therapy ) . 2 . Received least 2 cycle bortezomibcontaining regimen 2 cycle lenalidomidecontaining regimen , unless intolerant agent ( define require discontinuation due toxicity ) . 3 . Disease refractory carfilzomibcontaining regimen and/or pomalidomide contain regimen . Refractory define either failure achieve minimal response ( MR ) well therapy , development progressive disease ( PD ) therapy within 60 day last dose therapy . Measurable multiple myeloma disease , define meeting least one follow criterion within 14 day prior first dose study drug : 1 . A monoclonal Ig ( Mprotein ) concentration serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP ) ≥ 1.0 g/dL . 2 . Measurable urinary light chain secretion quantitative analysis use urine protein electrophoresis ( UPEP ) ≥ 200 mg/24 hour . 3 . Involved serum free light chain ( FLC ) level ≥ 10 mg/dL , provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 within 14 day prior first dose study drug . Adequate hematology , hepatic renal function laboratory value within 14 day prior first dose study drug . Additional criterion exist . Key Prior treatment filanesib ( ARRY520 ) KSP inhibitor . Past current plasma cell leukemia . Primary amyloidosis ( amyloidosis associate multiple myeloma allow ) . POEMS syndrome ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal protein skin change ) . Autologous allogeneic stem cell bone marrow transplant within 3 month prior first dose study drug . Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy ( multiple myeloma ) less 2year diseasefree interval time first dose study drug . Patients adequately resect basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix breast , Stage 1 prostate cancer eligible irrespective time diagnosis . Use investigational agent expect cleared time first dose study drug demonstrate prolonged side effect . Patients must recover side effect Grade 0 1 ( except alopecia neuropathy ) . Any severe concurrent disease condition ( include severe graftversushost disease , requirement dialysis , symptomatic congestive heart failure [ New York Heart Association Class III IV ] , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ) , judgment Investigator , would make patient inappropriate study participation . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Acute active infection require treatment . Additional criterion exist .</criteria>
