	<brief_title>Clinical , Anti-Inflammatory And Anti-Infective Properties Of Amniotic Membranes Used For Guided Tissue Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design include Randomization Blinding The study design split-mouth , double-blind , randomize control clinical trial . Randomization blind include computerized generation allocation sequence random permute block ( block randomization ) blind disbursement medication . Allocation perform assign block site study group accord specify sequence . Based sequence , first operator select two site follow experimental site ; test site , amniotic membrane graft place control site treat graft placement . All surgery perform designate operator sake uniformity whereas relevant reading record first operator blind nature site . The blind broken clinical trial completely finish . After prospective interdental area probe buccally lingually/palatally , site consider study average probe pocket depth ( PPD ) ≥5 mm . All baseline ( day surgery ) value record surgical procedure . Gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) sample IL-1β take baseline 1 week hBD-2 take baseline , 1 week 4 week . Non-invasive site-specific measure plaque index ( PI ) modify gingival index ( MGI ) baseline , 1 week , 12 week 24 week . The PPD , CAL bone fill record baseline ( day surgery ) end 12 24 week . PPD CAL record baseline end 12 24 week use UNC-15 color-coded periodontal probe . A custom acrylic stent limit occlusal 2/3rds clinical crown prepare cast obtain alginate impression . A groove prepared stent standardize probe angulation throughout procedure also follow visit . Radiograph Standardization Standard digital radiograph take baseline , 12 24 week paralleling/long-cone technique pre-set parameter use commercially available RVG system . After image plate place film holder paralleling technique , addition silicon impression material add around bite surface allow set . This arrangement ensure standardized alignment aim device holder ensure correct position collimator subsequent radiograph . Collection GCF Samples : After isolation , 6 mm diameter filter paper circle use collect sample intra-crevicular method . The fluid seep sulcus collect paper contaminate blood saliva discard , collection repeat 30 minute . GCF sample elute strip place Eppendorf tube contain 500 µL buffer store -80ºC . GCF Samples collect baseline , end 1 4 week . Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) IL-1ß hBD-2 Commercially available ELISA kit use quantify GCF level IL-1ß hBD-2 . All assay procedure conduct accord manufacturer 's instruction test , 100μl sample standard add respective well duplicate . Color development stop use 1 % H2SO4 absorbance entire plate measure within 30 minute ELISA reader 450nm . The amount IL-1ß hBD-2 calculate base dilution , result express pico-gram/30 second pico- gram/site 30-second GCF sample . Amniotic membrane Lyophilized irradiate AM ( 3×3 sq.cm ) obtain commercial tissue bank . The tissue dispatch clinical use tissue bank . The tissue conform International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) recommendation Asia Pacific Association Surgical Tissue Banks ( APASTB ) standard . AM stable stored room temperature . Surgical phase : All surgical procedure perform one clinician . After record relevant parameter , follow routine local anesthesia , sulcular incision give full thickness mucoperiosteal flap elevate defect access . Thorough degranulation bone defect do root plan do use appropriate site-specific curette . The test site treat follow ; After placement proper condensation natural Hydroxyapatite graft defect , AM cut base defect anatomy surgical site adapt bone graft alveolar bone extend base flap reflection tooth surface . Flap approximate stabilized placing direct loop suture . Periodontal dress place subsequently . For control site , procedure identical except membrane place . Patients receive post-operative instruction prescribe medication . The suture remove 1 week post-surgery subsequent measure record . Radiographic assessment The evaluation bone fill perform use digital subtraction technique morphometric area analysis use specific tool two image processing software .</detailed_description>
