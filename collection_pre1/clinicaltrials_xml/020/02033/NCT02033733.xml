	<brief_summary>After successful resuscitation cardiac arrest , cool whole body well establish treatment improve chance brain recovering . This however , do within certain time-frame arrest . The purpose study explore best way dose muscle relax medication give cool process . Hypothesis : In context institutional therapeutic hypothermia protocol , cisatracurium infusion lead fast drop core temperature compare cisatracurium prn boluses alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE : A large proportion comatose survivor cardiac arrest presenting intensive care unit London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) undergo therapeutic hypothermia . Current evidence suggest timely achievement target temperature desirable improve outcome . At LHSC , intervention protocolized defined set preprinted order include dose regimen neuromuscular block agent ( NMBA 's ) . Our preprinted protocol place since January 2004 . Cisatracurium infusion part therapeutic hypothermia protocol October 2011 . Since time , protocol change cisatracurium prn boluses observed shivering . In study examine change time achieve target temperature implementation change . It important note change protocol take place since first implement , make comparison valid fair . Our hypothesis NMBA infusion lead faster drop core temperature compare NMBA prn bolus . If stand true , would expect cisatracurium IV infusion result fast reduction core temperature compare cisatracurium prn boluses context therapeutic hypothermia protocol . Hypothermia know cause subclinical increase muscle tone . This previously report phenomenon name `` microshivering '' . When attempt reduce core temperature , microshivering likely natural body response try restore body temperature back normal . We therefore hypothesize NMBA infusion likely effective abolish microshivering , would desirable effect try induce therapeutic hypothermia . Although current American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline suggest consider administration NMBA 's facilitate induce hypothermia control shiver . Their recommendation minimize duration NMBA use possible , avoid altogether . After publication guideline institutional protocol change prn bolus instead previous infusion order . We therefore believe important examine effect change cool protocol potentially add grow body knowledge field .</detailed_description>
