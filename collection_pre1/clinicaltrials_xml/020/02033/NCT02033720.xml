	<brief_summary>After successful resuscitation certain type cardiac arrest , total body cool well establish treatment improve chance brain recovering . This however , definitively proven certain type cardiac arrest `` ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia '' . The purpose study explore total body cool beneficial patient recover another type cardiac arrest `` pulseless electrical activity '' . HYPOTHESIS : Patients undergo post-cardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia well neurological outcome initial arrest rhythm pulseless electrical activity ( PEA ) comparison asystole .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION : After successful resuscitation cardiac arrest body experience period global reperfusion . During period , patient may show sign myocardial stunning , lactic acidosis , neurological injury reperfusion syndrome . This constellation find constitutes know post-cardiac arrest syndrome . The brain appear one vulnerable organ injury reperfusion phase vary degree cognitive impairment may end result . Inducing mild therapeutic hypothermia show protective brain setting demonstrate improve neurological recovery . The evidence however , conclusive case arrest shockable rhythm i.e . pulseless ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation . In 2002 , two randomize control trial publish show improvement neurological outcome patient treat mild therapeutic hypothermia post resuscitation shockable cardiac arrest . Therapeutic hypothermia since widely adopt authority part comprehensive treatment bundle post cardiac arrest syndrome . Whether benefit patient arrest non-shockable rhythm however , matter controversy . Some report improved mortality well neurological outcome therapeutic hypothermia patient population . Others report benefit even trend towards harm . And although matter remain controversial , recommendation still stand therapeutic hypothermia offer comatose survivor cardiac arrest whatever arrest rhythm . Most previous report examine difference shockable non-shockable rhythm term neurological outcome mortality rate therapeutic hypothermia . To knowledge , study examine difference outcome two type non-shockable rhythm , pulseless electrical activity ( PEA ) asystole . We hypothesize PEA arrest , patient may retain degree cerebral perfusion hence well neurological outcome post-resuscitation . That contrast asystole patient likely cerebral perfusion . In study attempt detect possible difference neurological recovery ( indicated Cerebral Performance Category scale hospital discharge ) therapeutic hypothermia , patient arrest PEA arrest arrest asystole .</detailed_description>
