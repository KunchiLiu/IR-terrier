	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Into Adjustment Radiation Beam Account Prostate Motion During Radiotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer account one third new cancer diagnose men approximately 30 % men external beam radiotherapy primary local therapy . Prostate motion radiotherapy divide interfraction intrafraction motion . Interfraction motion well establish largely overcome daily online image verification either ultrasound , online CT implant fiducial marker , however motion radiation beam time ( intrafraction motion ) correct cause significant error radiation dose delivery . The common technology utilised 2012 allow prostate gate Calypso system . The Calypso system consist implantable electromagnetic transponder , array contains source receiver coil , computer data analysis display purpose , infrared camera system localise electromagnetic array treatment room . The array place patient , source coil array emit electromagnetic signal excite transponder . Once transponder excite , source coil turn receiver coil detect signal emit excited transponder . This process repeat rate 10 Hz , provide realtime radiofrequency localisation prostate triangulate three implanted beacon . The current study investigate use continuous prostate positioning data Calypso integrate treatment beam delivery allow real-time adaptation base prostate motion . This call Realtime Dynamic Multileaf Collimator ( DMLC ) track . In technique multileaf collimator motion alter gantry head real time beam delivery account measure prostate motion . The propose study examine dosimetric impact account intrafraction motion Calypso DMLC track . We hypothesise improvement deliver prostate dose DMLC track even great gate . This improved treatment delivery ensure prostate cancer receive appropriate dose normal tissue spar extra radiation .</detailed_description>
