	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Nab-Paclitaxel Paclitaxel Patients With Advanced Urothelial Cancer Progressing After Platinum Containing Regimen .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nab-paclitaxel formulation chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel combine human protein call albumin . In Canada , nab-paclitaxel currently approve treatment metastatic breast cancer . This drug test cancer show promising activity lung cancer , melanoma pancreatic cancer . Information research study suggest nab-paclitaxel may useful treatment urothelial cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis TCC urinary tract ( bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis ) metastatic locally advanced inoperable disease extent ( T4 , N2 , N3 M1 disease ) Note : Mixed histology ( except small cell ) permit predominately TCC IHC . Patients must evidence metastatic disease , measurable disease mandatory . To consider evaluable overall response rate ( complete partial response ) , patient must least one measurable lesion follow : Xray , physical exam ≥ 20 mm Conventional CT scan , MRI ≥ 20 mm Spiral CT scan ≥ 10 mm Male female , 18 year age old . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 study entry Adequate hematological , renal hepatic function define follow required laboratory value obtain within 14 day prior randomization . If anemic , patient asymptomatic decompensated . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x10^9/L ( 1,500 cells/mm3 ) Platelet count ≥ 90 x10^9/L ( 100,000/mm3 ) Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 25 mL/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ≤ 2.5X Gilbert 's disease ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ≤ 5 x ULN hepatic metastasis present Patients may prior neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy completely resect disease , provide complete least 12 month prior randomization . Patients must recover acute toxic effect ≤ Grade 2 prior treatment . Neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy consider first line therapy metastatic setting patient progress within 12 month last dose . Patients must receive one one prior chemotherapeutic regimen include platinum ( least one cycle ) metastatic/recurrent disease . Treatment must discontinue least 4 week prior randomization study . Patients must recover acute toxic effect ≤ Grade 2 prior treatment Patients may prior therapy taxane set . Patients may prior investigational agent must discontinue least 4 week prior randomization . Patients must recover acute toxic effect ≤ Grade 2 prior treatment . Prior treatment radiation therapy adjuvant and/or metastatic setting permit provide least 2 week elapse since last fraction radiation therapy treatment related adverse event ≤ Grade 1 time randomization . Patients may prior surgery provide least 4 week elapsed end surgery randomization onto study . Patients must recover acute toxic effect ≤ Grade 2 prior treatment . Patients may peripheral neuropathy previous treatment provide ≤ Grade 1 . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete health demographic , quality life , health utility questionnaires either English French . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline , prior registration/randomization . Inability ( illiteracy English French , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior randomization . In addition routine contraceptive method , `` effective contraception '' also include heterosexual celibacy surgery intend prevent pregnancy ( sideeffect pregnancy prevention ) define hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation vasectomy/vasectomized partner . However , point previously celibate patient choose become heterosexually active time period use contraceptive measure outline protocol , he/she responsible begin contraceptive measure . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . A candidate potentially curative surgery radiotherapy . Patients brain metastasis ineligible meet least one follow criterion : 1. diagnosis within 3 month randomization 2. untreated brain metastasis 3. unstable brain metastasis define : cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion symptomatic state daily prednisone equivalent use great 10 mg Patients need CT/MRI scan rule brain metastasis unless clinical suspicion CNS metastasis . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol include , limited : 1. . evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( i.e . know case hepatitis B C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ) . 2. patient active uncontrolled infection . Screening chronic condition require , although patient know condition screen include . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Patients history allergic hypersensitivity reaction study drug excipients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical composition study drug . Planned concomitant participation another clinical trial experimental agent , vaccine device . Concomitant participation observational study acceptable . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Prior prostate cancer allow provide incidental find cystoprostatectomy PSA &lt; 0.5 ng/mL randomization prior diagnosis low risk prostate cancer time define ≤T2 , Gleason Score 6 less PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL .</criteria>
