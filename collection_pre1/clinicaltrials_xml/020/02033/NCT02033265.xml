	<brief_summary>Axillary brachial plexus block ( freeze nerve armpit ) commonly perform primary anesthetic technique elbow/ forearm hand surgery . These nerve identify use ultrasound nerve stimulator ( stimulating nerve use small current needle ) . Axillary brachial plexus block show result well pain relief , less nausea , vomit early discharge hospital . The use nerve block also show decrease duration hospital stay , decreased side effect opioids painkiller good satisfaction score conventional use intravenous oral pain medication . These beneficial effect particularly useful patient overweight obese . A study Hauouz et al publish Anesthesia Analgesia July 2010 suggest success rate brachial plexus block low obese overweight patient . However , ultrasound guidance use perform axillary brachial plexus block study . We propose usage ultrasound guidance success rate brachial plexus block similar obese non-obese patient . In study , want compare success rate axillary brachial plexus block obese non-obese patient group . We would also like look performance time , complication patient satisfaction study population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block : Influence Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity increase throughout world . General Anesthesia obese patient associate increased risk difficult/failed tracheal intubation aspiration gastric content . These life-threatening complication avoid use regional anesthesia . Other potential advantage regional anesthesia include improve pain control , less incidence nausea vomiting , early ambulation , decrease pulmonary complication , short hospital stay . On hand , regional anesthesia obese patient challenge loss anatomical landmark . However , availability high-resolution ultrasound image decreased reliance anatomical landmark vascular , nervous musculoskeletal structure directly visualize . Ultrasound image also allow real time needle visualization local anesthetic deposit precisely allow faster onset anesthesia reduce incidence complication . Brachial plexus anaesthetize various level along course provide anesthesia elbow , forearm hand surgery . Axillary region ideal site target brachial plexus obese patient plexus superficial region likelihood cause serious complication ( e.g . pleural puncture ) low . Study 188 patient Chan et al show use ultrasound increase success rate axillary brachial plexus block 63 % 80 % compare nerve stimulation technique . A recent study ( Hanouz et al ) show obesity increase failure rate immediate complication axillary brachial plexus block ultrasound use perform block . In current era , consider ultrasound-guidance standard care . We hypothesize block performance time , success rate incidence acute complication similar obese non-obese patient ultrasound-guidance used perform brachial plexus block axillary region .</detailed_description>
