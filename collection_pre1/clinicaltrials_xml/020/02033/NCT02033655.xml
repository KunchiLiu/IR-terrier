	<detailed_description>Assess effect combine regular , generous intake high quality protein ( primarily lean pork animal source protein ) calorie restriction functional status lean muscle mass frail , obese , woman participate 6 month intervention 9 month intervention . For 6 month intervention : Participants randomize one two study arm : Weight Loss Control ( n = 20 ) subject follow calorie-reduced diet weight loss ≥10 % ; Weight Loss-High Protein : ( n = 40 ) subject follow calorie-reduction diet weight loss ≥10 % , high proportion high quality protein meal . Intakes &gt; 30g high quality protein achieve three time day subject group , predominantly animal source 60-70 % animal protein pork . Subject criterion include obese ( &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) woman ( ≥ 45 yr . ) mild moderate functional impairment ( 6 minute walk ) . For 9 month intervention : Participants randomize one two study arm : Weight Loss Control ( n = 10 ) subject follow calorie-reduced diet weight loss ≥10 % ; Weight Loss-High Protein : ( n = 10 ) subject follow calorie-reduction diet weight loss ≥10 % , high proportion high quality protein meal . Intakes &gt; 30g high quality protein achieve three time day subject group , predominantly animal source 60-70 % animal protein pork . Subject criterion include obese ( ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) woman ( ≥ 60 yr . ) mild moderate functional impairment ( 6 minute walk ) . This randomized clinical trial repeat measurement , purpose assess change time overall sample difference High Protein group relative Control group regard primary outcome ( function lean body mass ) . The statistical analysis proceed chronologically 3 phase : 1 ) descriptive analysis summarize distribution covariates dependent variable , 2 ) bivariate analysis association group membership outcome measure , 3 ) control multivariable analysis , assess association experimental group outcome , control important covariates .</detailed_description>
