	<brief_summary>For nearly 75 % patient live type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) use insulin , decision regard self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) unclear . SMBG test resource intensive activity without firmly establish patient benefit . While SMBG hold great promise spark favorable behavior change , potential benefit even patient harm must acknowledge . Possible negative effect patient quality life must closely examine along speculative benefit SMBG non-insulin treat T2DM . Among study examine issue general consensus evolving ; SMBG may may useful , value fully appreciate SMBG result provide patient useful manner . The overarch goal proposal assess impact three different SMBG test approach patient-centered outcome patient non-insulin treat T2DM within real-world , clinic setting . In pragmatic trial , 450 patient randomize one follow three SMBG test regimen : 1 ) SMBG test , 2 ) daily SMBG test standard patient feedback consist glucose value immediately report patient glucose meter , 3 ) daily SMBG test enhanced patient feedback consist glucose value immediately report patient PLUS automate , tailor feedback messaging . The first two arm represent common SMBG testing approach . The third arm enhance , patient-centered approach SMBG testing . SMBG value evaluate routine clinic visit 52 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Approaches Glucose Monitoring Non-insulin Treated Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within context control randomize pragmatic trial , seek answer follow question : SMBG test make sense Non-insulin treat ( NIT ) diabetes mellitus ( DM ) patient term either A1c value QOL . We also examine whether patient different baseline characteristic might see different outcome three SMBG test approach . To achieve goal test SMBG option community-based primary care practice , study design minimize much possible interruption alteration standard daily patient care . We recruit 450 patient five primary care practice . Patients follow one year . During routine clinic visit , health care provider guide modify therapy base ADA guideline , focus A1c value SMBG value available . Study Arms Two three study arm choose reflect existing , widely use option patient NIT DM . Arm 3 , describe , trial particularly novel test potential benefit new technology available patient ; namely , wireless transmission blood glucose test result accompany instantaneous tailored feedback . While option may hold great promise patient provider , data support lacking . The result study inform consumer provider whether new technology support effort alter behavior way result improve A1c value well quality life . Particularly appeal approach employ technology support efficient use SMBG value patient provider . In term pragmatic 'fit ' , three group fit easily current practice participating practice . For example , require extra clinic visit ( possibly initial recruitment assessment ) , staff need download glucose report patient Arms 2 3 , simple , streamlined procedure . In term risk patient , none three group put patient additional risk , three version 'standard practice ' patient population doctor free alter therapy test schedule normally would . - Arm 1 : No SMBG Testing This group represent approach SMBG support research follow many primary care provider . Patients randomize group provide meter , receive standardize education detail sign symptom hyper- hypoglycemia information regard lifestyle approach maintenance normoglycemia . If previously obtain SMBG value , ask discontinue . Healthcare providers staff alert patient test arm encourage maintain treatment fidelity except patient safety concern . Study coordinator provide patient write oral educational information support approach SMBG testing , view toward reconcile message may receive past receive future regard SMBG . This education recur every 3-6 month routine clinic visit ( recommend follow-up frequency person T2DM ) health care provider . A1c obtain visit per usual care provider adjust medication lifestyle recommendation see fit . Providers give algorithm base current ADA recommendation relate A1c result use guide treatment modification . - Arm 2 : Once Daily Testing Standard Feedback This group represent approach take large proportion NIT DM patient US . At assessment visit , patient give study glucose meter test supply , along instruction use . They ask test daily different time day rotate basis , order obtain representative distribution blood glucose value time . The meter wireless capability transmit SMBG result time test secure server . Subjects also note circumstance test time glucose meter ( e.g. , fasting , 2 hour post meal , etc . ) information also send server . As Arm 1 , Arm 2 patient receive train hyper- hypoglycemia approach maintain normoglycemia . They also receive train write material instructing interpret SMBG reading action might take response value . SMBG result review clinic visit ( 3-6 month interval ) primary care provider use print glucose meter value download analyze wirelessly . During early phase project , streamline system develop allow participate clinic staff download SMBG value minimal effort create accompany SMBG report patient 's provider . This customized report , detail blood glucose average , range standard deviation , generate group 2 participant give provider prior routine clinic visit . The report identify problematic glucose value ( hypo- hyperglycemia ) suggest approach address problem . Providers review result participant make appropriate treatment recommendation base upon blood glucose trend . The recommendation report drive algorithm treatment modification base upon ADA guideline include suggestion lifestyle pharmacotherapy adjustment . At end clinic visit , patient instruct primary care provider continue daily test . Using share decision-making standardized testing recommendation , health care provider patient jointly determine test approach ( e.g. , time daily test ) patient employ next monitoring period . - Arm 3 : Once Daily Testing Enhanced Feedback This Arm represent enhance , patient-centered approach . Participants randomize Arm 3 , like Arm 2 participant , instructed test daily different time day , glucose value transmit wirelessly server . However , Arm 3 participant , blood glucose value analyze automatically time value transmit . Based upon value , instantaneous personalize feedback provide via wireless message patient ' glucose meter . These message include suggestion pharmacological therapy modification motivational nature , include suggestion enhance effort lifestyle management adherence pharmacologic therapy prescribe . At weekly interval , analysis SMBG value previous week send glucose meter highlight trend identify specific problematic time . Subjects also receive message remind upcoming clinic visit ( begin 1 week prior schedule visit ) . As Arm 2 , SMBG result customize report download review clinic visit primary care provider . In addition , summary message send wirelessly patient since recent visit include . Like glucose value report , message report give provider begin clinic visit provider ask also review result patient . Providers make appropriate treatment recommendation base upon blood glucose trend message . Report recommendation drive algorithm treatment modification base upon ADA treatment guideline include suggestion lifestyle pharmacotherapy adjustment . At end clinic visit , patient instruct primary care provider continue test blood glucose daily collaboratively determine test approach ( e.g. , time daily test ) patient employ next monitoring period . Potential Alterations Testing Recommendations : Providers strongly encourage maintain SMBG test fidelity base upon treatment arm patient randomize ; however , provider believe test occur frequently due concern serious unrecognized hypo- hyperglycemia reason , test recommendation may modify . This approach provide patient safety preserve pragmatic nature trial . Glucose test strip provide participant quarterly basis . If provider deem SMBG test occur frequently recommend patient base study arm randomize , health care provider must write prescription additional test strip strip must pay out-of-pocket insurance . Following intention treat model , patient opt follow test regimen randomly assign encourage remain study . Any deviation assign SMBG test protocol readily know via glucose meter report . Mixed method approach . A mixed method approach qualitative quantitative data collect provide advantage explore complex research question one pose proposal . The quantitative data allow u assess change objective measure , qualitative data provide deeper understand patient ' provider ' experience various component SMBG test arm ( e.g. , meter , SMBG result , personalized messaging , downloadable report , treatment algorithm , etc . ) It also case , patient interested see hard fact figure , others prefer testimonial patient like . The mixed method approach enable u provide type information , increase effectiveness uptake dissemination effort . Recruitment randomization procedure . Patient Recruitment : All potentially eligible patient express interest study complete initial screen phone call . The call take 15 minute , member study team describe study , answer question , conduct short set simple screen determine eligibility . Eligible patient remain interested participation complete assessment visit research coordinator . To decrease patient burden engage participate practice , assessment visit occur patient 's primary care office . Assessments separate appointment primary care provider , may may occur day regularly schedule clinic visit , though patient convenience make every effort coordinate assessment regular clinic visit . During assessment , research coordinator review study detail great depth , verify inclusion exclusion criterion , obtain write informed consent . Patient Randomization : After provide informed consent , baseline A1c , complete baseline study questionnaire , participant randomize one three treatment arm use sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . The research coordinator review treatment assignment patient , use standardized script , provide initial training supply necessary participation study arm answer remain question .</detailed_description>
