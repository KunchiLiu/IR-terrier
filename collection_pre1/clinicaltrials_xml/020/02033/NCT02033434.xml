	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize intra-nasal ketamine , analgesia patient moderate severe pain alpine setting , provide clinically significant reduction pain provide effective feasible alternative intravenous opioids . The investigator wish know : 1 . Is study protocol feasible study INK mountain , prehospital care environment ? 2 . What estimate make recruitment rate ? 3 . Does study use INK interfere delay care Whistler/Blackcomb ? 4 . Is intra-nasal ketamine effective safe method control pain study population set ? 5 . Does intranasal ketamine provide clinically significant reduction pain patient require additional IV narcotic extraction ? 6 . Are significant change vital sign administration intra-nasal ketamine 7 . Does use intra-nasal ketamine reduce time patient extraction transport alpine pre-hospital setting ? 8 . Are long term sequela INK one week ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-hospital Care With Intra-Nasal Ketamine Transport ( PRECINKT ) : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whistler/Blackcomb large world-class resort attract hundred thousand skier snowboarder annually 's steep terrain excellent on-mountain facility . Ski patrol operation exist mountain respond 10000 injury per year ( 1 ) . As ski snowboard activity gain popularity , number people injure also rise ( 2 ) demand ski patrol attend on-mountain physician provide adequate on-mountain treatment . The provision analgesia , relieve patient suffer facilitate transport , central tenet pre-hospital care . This special import alpine set environmental factor challenge extrication play significant role patient outcome ( 3 ) . Despite significance patient practitioner , adequate timely pain relief often delay . The underlying cause multifactorial ; intravenous access challenging , limited availability advance health care provider monitor capability . To date , remain widespread guideline treatment acute pain alpine rescue ski patrol set . Intravenous ( IV ) opioid analgesia widely use primary method attain pain control . While effective , route administration several shortcoming . The insertion IV invasive , painful , , time-consuming , expose skin cold injury delay transport . Opioids also raise risk hypotension , hypoxemia vomit . In previous work ( 15 ) , intranasal ( IN ) route medication delivery rapid , effective well-tolerated . In addition adverse side effect minor transient , change vital sign require clinical intervention . This data corroborate previous research low dose ketamine provide safe meaningful analgesia preserve cardiovascular function , respiratory drive airway reflex ( 27 ) . Thus , use IN ketamine reduces need IV access stable patient reduces need monitor risk opioids ( 6 ) . These characteristic indicate great potential ketamine reduce extraction transport time patient mountain environment . Intranasal ketamine attractive austere alpine environment , monitor capability slow transport IV access difficult . Previous case report suggest IN ketamine provide rapid , easily administer effective method analgesia pre-hospital setting ( 7 ) . However , data feasibility conduct medical trial large busy commercial ski area , calculate appropriate sample size . The investigator propose pilot study investigate feasibility conduct study IN ketamine ( INK ) prior large study determine INK provide effective safe method analgesia patient present ski patrol acute injury . In addition , although current body literature show minimal adverse event , investigator continue study safety INK monitor negative side effect . The purpose provide insight information potential utility IN ketamine setting , assess feasibility future clinical trial power demonstrate efficacy safety .</detailed_description>
