	<brief_summary>Cerebral small vessel disease ( cSVD ) encompass pathological process affect small vessel brain . On brain-MRI cSVD characterize structural brain abnormality white matter lesion ( WMLs ) . Clinically , cSVD relate acute syndrome lacunar stroke also chronic health problem cognitive decline . Recent literature suggest disrupt blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , lead elevate BBB permeability , may play pivotal role aetiology cSVD lacunar stroke . The BBB complex system neuronal , glial vascular cell main function shield brain toxic component regulate homeostasis . Elucidating role BBB may far reach consequence treatment cSVD patient reduction recurrence rate disease . This could lead good quality life among cSVD patient reduce economic burden society . Currently exact contribution extent possibly defective BBB cSVD remain largely unclear , due lack reliable method accurately quantify BBB permeability cSVD patient . As result , current treatment consist treat cardiovascular risk factor , often poor result . Quantification BBB permeability provide objective measure integrity BBB aid study role BBB . The aim study realize clinically applicable MRI-method quantify BBB permeability . Moreover , method use study involvement BBB disruption neuropathologies include Alzheimer 's disease , vascular dementia , hypertension diabetes . Primary Study Objective : To realize clinically applicable quantification BBB permeability use DCE-MRI determine reproducibility DCE-MRI method Secondary Study Objective : To achieve short scan duration without compromise reliability BBB permeability quantification . Hypotheses : 1 . Using optimized DCE-MRI method quantify BBB permeability , BBB permeability reliably determine cSVD patient . 2 . The scan duration shorten without compromise reliability BBB permeability quantification .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subject : Age &gt; 18 year old The condition patient must well enough allow participation study , decide consultation treat physician . cSVD patient : patient present transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) cSVD related abnormality brain MRI . TIA patient define patient stroke like symptom last longer 24 hour . MRI abnormality include extended white matter lesion , ( asymptomatic ) lacunar infarct , microbleeds enlarge VirchowRobin space . The patient eligible first DCEMRI scan perform 812 week TIA avoid acute phase , second MRIscan within four week first . Cortical stroke primary intracerebral hemorrhage patient : patient clear clinical presentation either cortical stroke primary intracerebral hemorrhage confirm brain CT . The patient eligible DCEMRI scan perform within 06 week vascular event two subsequent day vascular permeability may change significantly timescale week . All subject : History cerebrovascular disease ( e.g . ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke ) History diseases central nervous system ( e.g . epilepsy , brain tumor , multiple sclerosis ) Contraindications MRI examination : e.g . pacemaker ; neurostimulator ; medication pump ; cochlear hearing implant ; tattoo item remove include metal part ( instance operation past ) ; metal splinter eye ; pregnancy claustrophobia ; brain vessel clamp ; denture , contain magnet . Contraindication MRI contrast agent : e.g . strong suspicion impair kidney function ( GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) , previous allergic reaction contrast agent , dialysis patient Psychiatric comorbidity inability perform ( DCE ) MRI scan . cSVD patient Patients potential cardioembolic source ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) Stenosis â‰¥50 % one internal carotid artery</criteria>
