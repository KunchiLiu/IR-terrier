	<brief_summary>Men early prostate cancer face number option lie extremes care . On one hand , active surveillance involve monitor disease , immediate treatment involve surgery radiotherapy . The difference two strategy term reduce chance man die disease small . Not benefit small , surgery radiotherapy carry significant side-effects . These occur damage surround tissue result incontinence urine ( 1 5 ) , erectile dysfunction ( 1 2 ) back-passage bleeding , diarrhoea discomfort ( 1 10 ) . The investigator work new form treatment use heat , light cold destroy tissue minimise treatment-related harm . The investigator yet find one delivers ideal treatment . The ideal treatment one do local anaesthetic , effectively destroy area cancer , limit damage surround tissue , repeatable , adaptable future discovery molecular target cancer cell . The investigator think magnetic thermoablation may able deliver ideal attribute . Magnetic thermoablation involve inject magnetic iron nanoparticles directly cancer . When magnetic field apply close , nanoparticles heat high temperature kill cell . Magnetic thermoablation use x-rays surgical incision . The investigator do lot preclinical work already develop type treatment . The investigator need develop system use treat prostate cancer . However , investigator , need test whether magnetic nanoparticles actually stay injected . The consequence move area serious . First , nanoparticles could move away cancer mean cancer heat effectively . Second , nanoparticles could move sensitive structure around prostate ( back-passage , bladder , sphincter muscle control urine flow , nerve control erection ) . If happens , damage sensitive structure could occur lead side-effects . The investigator propose study try find happens nanoparticles . The study involve approach men prostates remove radical surgery . If patient agree participate , investigator inject prostate varying amount nanoparticles . The investigator NOT heat . The investigator use special scan , surgery , look pathology specimen see nanoparticles go . The actual nanoparticles harmful process injection carry small amount harm . If nanoparticles stay inject , investigator able run another study treat men prostate cancer magnetic thermoablation .</brief_summary>
