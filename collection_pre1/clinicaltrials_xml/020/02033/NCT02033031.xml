	<brief_summary>Retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) second leading cause retinal vascular disease patient older 50 years.The prevalence varies 0.7 % 1.6 % literature . Visual recovery depend ischemic damage retina , occurence macular edema ( ME ) development neovascular glaucoma . The occurence ME main reason visual loss frustrate visual recovery among patient central branch RVO . Therapeutic option use discussed year treatment anticoagulant , fibrinolytics , corticosteroid , acetazolamide isovolemic haemodilution . Furthermore , surgical option like vitrectomy radial optic neurotomy use . Panretinal photocoagulation grid pattern photocoagulation establish additional tool induce chorioretinal anastomosis . Nevertheless , effectiveness evidence different treatment option could verify remain mostly unknown . Nowadays , intravitreal anti-VEGF application become treatment choice ME secondary RVO . Multi-center study already show effectiveness anti-VEGF treatment reduce intraretinal fluid retinal hemorrhage ( BRAVO , CRUISE ) . Unfortunately , often high number re-treatments become necessary year . In knowledge , report show 3 year treatment effect antiangiogenic drug patient BRVO . However , result treatment effect longer 3 year important , mean age &lt; 70 year onset BRVO estimate 60 % case . In addition , patient regard application anti-VEGF treatment real clinical setting , rare experience concern need optimum time duration follow-up department . Hence , present study aim evaluate long-term clinical outcome , safety therapeutic benefit flexible dose regimen intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy patient ME secondary BRVO .</brief_summary>
