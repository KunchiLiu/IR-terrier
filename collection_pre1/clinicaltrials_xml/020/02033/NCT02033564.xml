	<brief_title>Incidence Sore Throat With Traditional Intubation Blades Glidescope Blade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine whether use GlideScope™ video laryngoscope intubation lead great less incidence sore throat compare traditional laryngoscope blade use intubation , Macintosh Miller blade . During postoperative check board certify anesthesiologist Albany Medical Center ( AMC ) Hospital , notice patient report sore throat often required intubation GlideScope™ . Standard care AMC Hospital dictate Glidescope use `` rescue '' device fail direct laryngoscopy difficult airway ; traditional direct laryngoscopy Macintosh Miller blade provide adequate laryngeal view , progression different airway device Glidescope fiberoptic scope indicate . The initial attempt direct laryngoscopy difficult airway often require utilization McGill forceps , increase chance upper airway injury prior rescue attempt GlideScope . Consequently , difficult determine whether patient ' report post-operative sore throat cause irritation inflict multiple laryngoscopic attempt require patient Glidescope need rescue method , whether due actual utilization Glidescope . Previous study show use GlideScope™ decrease likelihood upper airway injury decrease low mean force apply laryngoscopy compare Macintosh laryngoscope ; however , study do use manikin know whether result translate patient orient outcome . Another study compare GlideScope™ direct laryngoscopy nasotracheal intubation . Their result suggest incidence postoperative moderate severe sore throat significantly reduce use GlideScope™ videolaryngoscope . However , study show increased incidence postoperative sore throat Glidescope usage compare videolaryngoscopes conventional Macintosh laryngoscope primary laryngoscopy method . In light study , none attempt direct comparison Glidescope conventional Macintosh/Miller laryngoscope blade incidence sore throat primary outcome interest . The purpose study determine whether difference incidence postoperative sore throat use GlideScope™ versus traditional intubation blade involve patient anticipate difficult airway . Exclusion patient difficult airway allow u perform direct comparison Glidescope conventional direct laryngoscopy without compromise standard care increase patient risk , determine use standard care preoperative exam .</detailed_description>
