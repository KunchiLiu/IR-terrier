	<brief_title>Icotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile icotinib ( icotinib hydrochloride ) patient advance cancer . II . To determine safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) icotinib patient advance cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily assess anti-tumor activity icotinib patient advance cancer . II . To characterize effect , , icotinib correct QT interval use Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphism gene encode icotinib 's target ( epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] ) , putative transport protein ( ATP-binding cassette , sub-family G [ WHITE ] , member 1 [ ABCG1 ] ) major metabolize enzyme ( cytochrome P450 3A4 [ CYP3A4 ] ) well gene may find important icotinib activity , correlate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) clinical activity toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive icotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
