	<brief_summary>This double-blind study approximately 99 study patient randomize 2:1 ratio receive either ovapuldencel-T ( autologous dendritic cell load irradiated autologous tumor cell GM-CSF ) MC ( autologous PBMC GM-CSF ) . Patients eligible treatment ( 1 ) undergone debulking surgery , ( 2 ) cell line establish , ( 3 ) undergone leukapheresis , ( 4 ) schedule primary adjuvant chemotherapy , ( 5 ) ECOG performance grade 0 1 . The primary endpoint trial death cause metric overall survival ( OS ) date randomization . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) secondary endpoint calculate time date randomization treatment subjective tumor progression death . Progression subjectively define treat physician , expect base tumor marker level ( e.g . CA-125 ) and/or image . Secondarily , also define PFS OS date debulking surgery . Patients stratify ( 1 ) platinum-resistant , base progression adjuvant chemotherapy detectable disease conclusion adjuvant therapy ( 2 ) platinum-sensitive , evidence disease ( NED ) conclusion adjuvant therapy ( per elevate blood CA-125 and/or tumor marker and/or detection disease physical examination image ) .

	<detailed_description>Sponsor : NeoStem , Inc. Protocol Title : Phase II , Double-Blind , Randomized , Single Center Trial Of Ovapuldencel-T ( Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Irradiated Autologous Tumor Cells In GM-CSF ) vs. Autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells In GM-CSF ( MC ) Component Maintenance Secondary Therapy Patients Stage III IV Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma Debulking Surgery Adjuvant Chemotherapy Study Design : A double-blind , randomize , single center trial . Number Study Centers : 1 . Study Phase : Phase II . Objectives : Primary Objective : • Compare overall survival ( OS ) date randomization patient treat ovapuldencel-T ( autologous dendritic cell pulse autologous irradiated tumor cell GM-CSF ) patient treat autologous blood mononuclear cell GM-CSF ( MC ) control . Secondary Objectives : - Establish safety repeat administration ovapuldencel-T. - Compare duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) date randomization patient treat ovapuldencel-T patient treat MC . - In subset platinum-sensitive patient evidence disease ( NED ) post-debulking chemotherapy , compare OS PFS date randomization - In subset platinum-resistant patient , compare OS PFS date randomization . - Compare OS PFS date randomization patient achieve optimal tumor debulking patient whose tumor debulking suboptimal . Optimal tumor debulking define patient residual tumor nodule less equal 1 cm diameter . - Compare OS PFS date diagnosis date debulking surgery patient treat ovapuldencel-T patient treat MC . - Determine many , , patient stop ASI treatment reaction attribute treatment GM-CSF . Study Treatments : - Ovapuldencel-T : Autologous dendritic cell load antigen irradiate autologous tumor cell suspend GM-CSF . - MC : Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell suspend GM-CSF serve control arm . Patient Population : Female subject 18 year old newly diagnose stage III IV ovarian cancer , candidate surgical debulking receipt chemotherapy . Performance status must ECOG score 0 1at time enrollment ASI treatment . Number Patients : Approximately 99 . Inclusion Criteria : Pre-Treatment Phase : Tissue Procurement Establishment Tumor Cell Line - Histologic diagnosis epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma . - Advanced ( metastatic , stage III IV ) epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma candidate surgical debulking obtain fresh viable tumor tissue effort establish short-term tumor cell line . - Age &gt; 18 year - Each patient must aware neoplastic nature disease process must willingly consent manipulation tumor tissue effort establish tumor cell line . Patients sign Tissue Informed Consent allow tissue give NeoStem , Inc. , effort establish autologous tumor cell line - Patients must ability willingness travel Newport Beach , California administration ASI treatment . Treatment Phase - Successful establishment autologous epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer cell line NeoStem , Inc. - Patients must previously stag stage III ( intraperitoneal ) Stage IV ( distant metastatic ) ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , undergone surgical debulking , initiate complete standard adjuvant chemotherapy , may include intravenous and/or intraperitoneal chemotherapy use standard regimen . Patients characterize complete remission per physical exam , CT scan , CA-125 , complete remission . - Medical fitness undergo leukapheresis , include peripheral venous access access central vein necessary . - Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential use effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) woman childbearing potential prior therapy , therapy , 4 month complete therapy . - Patients one brain metastasis treat stereotactic radiotherapy consist single dose , Gamma Knife Cyberknife , allow include study , need wait one week treatment.. - Additional write informed consent treatment ASI include explanation procedure follow , experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential benefit , side effect , risk , discomfort associate investigational therapy , obtain . Exclusion Criteria : Pre-Treatment Phase : Tissue Procurement Establishment Tumor Cell Line • ECOG performance status great 2 . Treatment Phase - Known positive hepatitis B C HIV . - Pregnant lactating woman . - Underlying cardiac disease associate myocardial dysfunction require active medical treatment , unstable angina relate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , treatment arterial venous peripheral vascular disease - Diagnosis invasive cancer consider life-threatening within next five year , and/or take anti-cancer therapy cancer ovarian ( continuation hormonal therapy prostate breast cancer diagnose five year earlier ) . - Active infection active medical condition could eminently life-threatening , include active blood clot bleed diathesis . - Active central nervous system metastasis time treatment . - Known autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency , disease process involve use immunosuppressive therapy . - A low malignancy potential tumor . - Received another investigational drug within 28 day first dose . Treatment Duration : The study product administer subcutaneously weekly three consecutive week approximately every three four week ( time subsequent maintenance secondary therapy give ) , total eight dos ASI treatment give four six month . Dosage : Each dose ovapuldencel-T MC contain approximately 5-10 million cell . Each dose suspend 500 mcg GM-CSF prior administration . Mode Administration : Subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . Study Endpoints : Primary Efficacy Endpoint : • Overall Survival ( OS ) : time death date randomization . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : - The success rate establish tumor cell line . - Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) : time disease progression death date randomization . - OS PFS subset patient platinum-sensitive adjuvant therapy . - OS PFS subset patient platinum-resistant after/during primary adjuvant chemotherapy . - OS PFS date initial diagnosis debulking surgery . Safety Endpoints : - Adverse event attribute cell therapy ( include GM-CSF ) attribute chemotherapy ass safety tolerability . - Abnormal finding history &amp; physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test ( safety ) , test clinically indicate , might attribute cell therapy . Study Duration Follow-Up : All patient qualify participation study follow 5 year date randomization death , whichever occur first . Statistical Methods : Null-Hypotheses : [ 1 ] For patient , OS different patient receive ovapuldencel-T compare patient receive MC [ 2 ] For platinum-sensitive patient , OS different patient receive ovapuldencel-T compare patient receive MC , [ 3 ] For patient platinum-resistant , OS different patient receive ovapuldencel-T compare patient receive MC . Analyses : Kaplan-Meier curve display survival time treatment group . The log rank test use analyze OS test null hypothesis treatment difference . The Cox regression model Wald test use estimate hazard ratio associate treatment identify significance potential prognostic factor impact , treatment difference . Analyses base intention treat population consider primary analysis , analysis base Per-Protocol population consider sensitivity analysis . Subgroup analyse OS endpoint mimic plan lay primary endpoint platinum-resistant patient platinum-sensitive patient separately .</detailed_description>
