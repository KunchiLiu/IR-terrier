	<brief_summary>Screening breast cancer improve early detection aggressive cancer show reduce breast cancer relate mortality . Currently , mammography effective way detect early stage , non palpable breast cancer . However , mammography reveals breast structure , say much breast physiological state . We propose Tomographic Optical Breast Imaging ( TOBI ) inexpensive , patient friendly technique non-invasive use non-ionizing radiation . TOBI use near infrared light measure light pass breast , image blood volume hemoglobin oxygenation obtain . In study , TOBI combine digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT , form 3D mammography ) hypothesis TOBI-DBT combine image use diagnose breast cancer significantly improve sensitivity specificity compare DBT alone .</brief_summary>
