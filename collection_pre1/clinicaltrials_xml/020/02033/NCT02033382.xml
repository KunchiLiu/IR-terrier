	<detailed_description>It currently unknown whether deterioration early course psychotic illness represent medication toxicity natural course illness . The study help clarify issue observe 20 schizophrenic patient prescribe antipsychotic via standard care . In addition , schizophrenia heterogeneous disorder putative brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) deficit , possibly common pathway , may fully capture biological diversity—the supplemental biomarkers allow u perform comprehensive assessment factor contribute clinical course . Taken together analysis biomarkers relation clinical course relation healthy subject inform u biological mechanism contribute illness onset , effect antipsychotic medication mechanism , predictive value biomarkers clinical course . This information provide foundation future early intervention trial target biological mechanism utilize personalized medicine approach . The baseline visit 20 schizophrenic patient 20 healthy age gender match control consist structural functional MRI addition blood draw biomarkers include BDNF , inflammation marker , DNA , oxidative stress , folate status additionally salivary cortisol sample collection . Biomarkers image repeat 8 week antipsychotic treatment patient .</detailed_description>
