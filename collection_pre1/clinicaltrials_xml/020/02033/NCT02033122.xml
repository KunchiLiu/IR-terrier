	<detailed_description>This randomize , control single-blind trial whose intervention aerobic training . Fifty -eight patient moderate severe persistent asthma recruit university hospital randomly assign two group : control ( CG ) training ( TG ) .The study perform two medical visit interval six month period medication dosage maintain . Patients CG perform ( educational program + breathe exercise ; n=28 ) TG patient perform ( educational program+breathing exercises+aerobic training ; n=30 ) .The session conduct twice week , 3 month . Before intervention , patient evaluate bronchial hyperresponsiveness , serum cytokine level , total immunoglobulin E , induce sputum , fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) , asthma clinical control ( daily symptom dairy , exacerbation asthma control questionnaire - ACQ ) , health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) ; asthma quality life questionnaire- ( AQLQ ) , pulmonary function cardiopulmonary exercise testing . All patient evaluate specific immunoglobulin E ( atopy ) ( skin prick test Phadiatop ) .</detailed_description>
