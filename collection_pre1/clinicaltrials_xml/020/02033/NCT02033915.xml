	<brief_summary>Suicide attempter people self-harm high percentage seek medical service suicidal self-harm behaviour compare general population . Studies reveal apart psychiatric service , likely seek help doctor various unit ( e.g . emergency department , general medicine , medical-surgical unit ) across different healthcare system ( i.e . hospital district clinic ) . Besides , suicide event possibly hear in-patients psychiatric non-psychiatric unit . People self-harm experienced poor communication healthcare personnel , perceive staff 's lacking knowledge suicide serious problem . In Taiwan also find emergency nurse general practitioner need improve negative attitude enhance knowledge towards suicidal behaviour . From point nurse healthcare personnel spend time in-patients compare others hospital , suicide risk assessment training may enhance nurse ' attitude ability risk awareness assessment towards people self-harm , may turn significantly increase identification rate high risk group suicide . Currently lack suicide training program reference nurse education Taiwan . The study therefore aim strengthen suicide risk assessment ability among clinical nurse interactive discussion group . Using quasi-experimental design randomize cluster sample strategy , case vignette use suicide risk assessment together measurement regard suicide knowledge attitude experiment control group train course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Interactive Discussion Group Intervention About Suicide Risk Identification Assessment Clinical Nurses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : The effectiveness interactive discussion group intervention improve nurse ' ability risk identification assessment people suicide attempt self-harm behavior A.Background Suicide become important issue public health medical-related field past decade also arouse attention government Taiwan . It one top ten cause death since 1997 . The high percentage people act suicide idea different age group pose great challenge healthcare personnel . Clinical worker first-line gatekeeper patient health safety . They suppose willing care people suicide risk equip ability identify patient suicide risk . However , negative attitude medical worker towards people suicide attempt self-harm behavior may affect patient ' intention seek professional help nurse ' quality care people . At present , investigator limit nurse curriculum relate concept guidance suicide prevention limit resource guide nurse suicide risk assessment . Few information suicide process suicide risk available nurse , may result inability provide proper care group people . If investigator improve ability suicide risk identification nurse , investigator may promote nurse ' confidence change attitude care patient . Also , nurse learn empathize suicidal patient , intervene early stage patient ' hospitalization , potentially build good nurse-patient relationship patient high risk suicide . Furthermore , investigator refer patient receive appropriate therapy provide adequate support reduce suicide attempt . The investigator address background importance study follow sub-sections : The importance suicide prevention throughout process nursing education clinical training People deliberate self harm behavior high risk group suicide , prevalence self-harm behavior 10-30 time suicide . Identification assessment suicide risk main target suicide prevention . However , opportunity nurse acquire knowledge suicide prevention process nurse education training . For instance , Nursing Department Medical college Northern Taiwan , one class talk related issue suicide prevention among Psychiatric Nursing lecture . In general , student nurse think unfamiliar issue unable assess patient ' suicide risk . Clinical nurse chance care suicide high risk group , Emergency Department ( ED ) psychiatric ward , may still negative attitude toward self-harm behavior . Nurses regard suicidal behavior selfish , waste social medical expense , worthy show sympathy . Moreover , may think self-harm behavior kind control behavior , call attention , difficult care building therapeutic relationship . These negative thinking emotion less likely promote care quality patient self-harm . It find psychiatric nurse tend use verbal communication , inform doctor patient ' suicide risk , give close observation prevent self-harm act offer safe environment psychiatric ward . But lack concept early prevention among clinical nurse , irrespective work psychiatric medical-surgical ward . Patients suffer chronic illness terminal stage disease medical ward might suicide ideation . It might helpful promote ability suicide identification assessment among nurse give good care quality suicide high risk population . Moreover , nurse ED easily encounter high risk ( i.e . people suicide attempt self-harm behavior ) . There still research focus ability suicide risk evaluation nurse ED . It suggest training course change negative attitude suicide nurse work ED , promote ability suicide risk assessment , enhance confidence face patient . The policy suicide prevention gatekeeper program form currently health organization Taiwan . Not public play role gatekeeper indentify suicide risk , clinical nurse also know assess suicide risk . So far investigator course suicide risk assessment , investigator need research develop complete content suicide evaluation , use clinical training nursing education . The investigator provide learn environment base interactive group , help improve critical thinking problem solve skill . Also , use case vignette design discussion course ( case-based curriculum ) help learner understand integrate knowledge content base clinical situation ; advantage include promote motivation active learning , strengthen analysis skill , enhance decision make ability , cultivate learner correctly evaluate effect patient social culture perspective . At present , nursing education Taiwan focus critical thinging , problem-solving , decision making , use group discussion help reach teaching goal . The importance patient safety hospital It important keep patient safety medical environment , also necessary provide quality care . However , issue suicide self-harm behavior neglect hospital , investigator lack effective preventive intervention policy . There many topic related patient safety medical environment , include mistake happen process give medicine , fall , environment safety . However , suicide behavior among inpatient pose great challenge medical personnel . According Taiwan Patient-Safety Reporting System ( Taiwan Joint Commission Hospital Accreditation , 2009 ) , 1,613 accident event hospitalize patient 2008 . General ward mainly location event , category event , 12.0 % self-harm behavior . Although 43 event suicide attempt , consequence serious compare patient safety issue . Researches 1960s western country indicate death rate suicide among hospitalized patient 0.06~5.66 per thousand . Even suicide rare topic , investigator ignore severity . To prevent suicide event , psychiatric ward general ward put emphasis prevention , education training communication patient nurse ( Taiwan Joint Commission Hospital Accreditation , 2009 ) . For general medical worker , might underestimate formation effect suicide self-harm behavior . The investigator may reach goal suicide prevention treat self-harm behavior appropriately clinical nurse identify high risk group suicide effectively follow step suggest gatekeeper program . The importance suicide risk assessment There remarkable percentage seek medical help among patient harm commit suicide . These patient appear psychiatric department , also seek medical help different medical setting . According systemic literature review , people self-harm behavior think good communication medical worker , medical worker idea self-harm behavior either . This common problem medical system across different department . The investigator also understand negative attitude knowledge actually exist nurse Emergency Department doctor . Tzeng &amp; Lipson ( 2005 ) suggest medical worker need know reason suicide self-harm behavior kind intervention may helpful . Cognition attitude train like usual nursing education , nurse , among medical group , relatively time stay patient . So strengthen train suicide evaluation identification help u know potential group high risk , also provide social support medical connection reduce formation rate suicide self-harm behavior . The reason investigator need identify assess suicide risk To identify evaluate suicide risk first step suicide prevention . Evaluations factor suicide risk ( major depression high risk group suicide ) often perform clinical care , expect psychiatric care setting . However , process help seek behavior could happen follow way self-disclosure suicide idea risk factor , transfer nurse department start accept treatment . In process , help social support family friend strengthen intention seek help . Therefore , identify case potential risk key point start suicide prevention . Although investigator n't research talk suicide prevention policy hospital world , awareness identification group high risk , risk assessment transfer strongly recommend many Western country . Nurses play role gatekeeper suicide prevention , identify suicide self-harm behavior occurs transfer right association care instead provide assessment protective instruction event . Based background , research focus ability suicide risk identification evaluation clinical nurse teach hospital Northern Taiwan . And investigator evaluate impact interactive discussion group promote identification ability nurse . The investigator expect find patient high risk suicide provide appropriate intervention improve sensitivity first line clinical professional . B . Aims study - To improve ability suicide risk identification assessment hospitalize patient clinical nurse - To understand impact use interactive discussion group promote ability suicide risk identification evaluation clinical nurse - To provide evidence-based nursing education basis practice interactive discussion group promote nurse ' ability suicide risk identification evaluation C. Methods The study randomize control trial . The sample consist 120 people , half allocate intervention group another half allocate control group . Therefore , sample distribute experimental group control group equally randomly . After receive approval Ethical Review Committee , investigator start recruit people attend intervention , `` interactive discussion group '' ( IDG ) , investigator aim discuss concept suicide risk identification evaluation well investigate impact intervention . The investigator develop standardized teaching program ( IDG suicide gatekeeper course nurse ) intervention . Moreover , start intervention , investigator three focus group pilot study order recruit clinical nurse ' perspective issue study opinion study tool . Depends opinion , investigator revise teach material assessment tool , evaluate feasibility put IDG practice . Next , experimental group take one suicide gatekeeper course IDG discussion twice , control group take one suicide gatekeeper course . The investigator baseline measurement outcome measurement evaluate effect intervention . The research method rationale describe detail . The rationale adopt intervention `` interactive discussion group '' ( IDG ) Education training nurse currently include classroom teaching speech , film/website teaching , group discussion practice , classroom teach popular one nowadays . Materials investigator use teach suicide assessment interactive website provide Taiwan Nurses Association book also available nurse self-learning . Concerning importance discussion evaluation suicide risk , realization suicide risk base case vignette , also interactive learn trainee facilitator , investigator choose use interactive discussion group teaching policy , via randomize controlled trial investigator evaluate effect research intervention . Standardized procedure interactive discussion group Researchers take interactive discussion group class six time ( 8-10 person every time ) . During 50-60 minute , facilitator guide trainee understand case vignette focus key issue discus , improve ability suicide risk identification evaluation . Two research team worker responsible facilitator , experience suicide prevention clinical work . The two facilitator guide group comprehensive way standardize maneuver . The topic discussion focus suicide case , 47-year-old man , hospitalization medical ward . In content investigator find many message sign major depression suicide behavior . Through discussion , investigator guide nurse realize suicide-related factor , teach identify/evaluate suicide risk . 10 minute group , investigator ask trainee read case answer question . In next 30 minute , investigator start problem discussion use three simple , convenient tool : PHQ2 , simplify health scale , SAD PERSONS , teach identification evaluation suicide risk . In last 10-15 minute , investigator go conclusion , point review get feedback trainee . The Research team use standardize material course authorize Health Department Taiwan- '' The Gatekeeper Training Program '' intervention . Facilitators train use material way teach experimental group control group consistency . In part , investigator discuss suicide case vignette , investigator divide group train interactive discussion therefore investigator evaluate effect use discussion group training . Research Tools 1 . The baseline measurement 1-1 Information Assessment basic demographic variable age , sex , marriage , duration practice nursing , nursing level , work experience psychiatric ward , care experience person know ( friend , colleague neighbor ) patient commit suicide self-harm behavior , accept training related suicide prevention past year . 1-2 Suicide Case vignettes risk assessment question Research team design case discussion depend clinical experience suicide case care . The investigator draft important question evaluate ability suicide risk identification evaluation research sample ( Nurses ) . 8 student nurse university go case discussion , investigator get good result pilot test . Student nurse agree interactive discussion teacher problem-based teaching help grab point suicide prevention arouse learn interest . 1-3 Assessment cognition attitude suicide behavior This scale use survey Health Department Taiwan understand attitude opinion toward suicide Psychiatric disease randomize sample size population Taiwan . And validity tool already prove . 2 . Assessment tool Interactive Discussion Group 2-1 Case vignette point interactive discussion group , please read detail &lt; Methods &gt; . 2-2 PHQ PHQ originally use evaluate health situation general public community , PHQ-9 , part scale , use evaluate tendency Major Depression . And content PHQ-9 correlate 9 diagnosis item DSM IV . Scholars modify new vision PHQ-2 , reliability validity good public Taiwan ( Sensitivity : 88.0 % , Specificity : 81.9 % ) ( Lu et al. , 2010 ) . Therefore investigator use scale train nurse screen possibility Major Depression patient . The two question relate symptom `` depress mood '' `` lose interest '' . 2-3 Simplified Health Measurement Scale This scale develop test general mental health public , include five question `` feel nervous anxious '' , `` easily feel worrisome angry '' , `` feeling depressed sad '' , `` feel low self-esteem '' `` bad sleeping quality '' . Also , investigator ask extra question `` suicide idea '' . This reliability validity prove Li et al. , ( 2003 ) , 's simple , convenient scale screen potential depression tendency suicide risk . The goal investigator use scale research improve recognition nurse Major Depression . 2-4 SAD PERSONS-check list suicide risk This checklist originally design screen patient need hospitalize Emergency Department staff base 10-item suicide risk screen sheet . S - Sex : male A - Age ( &lt; 19 &gt; 45 ) D - Depressive symptom P - Previous suicide attempt/psychiatric care E- Excessive ethanol/drug use R- Rational thinking loss , sever psychiatric symptom delusion , hallucination S - Separated/ divorce/drug use/widowed O - Organized serious attempt , severe objective self-harm behavior like carbon monoxide poisoning , overdose medicine take need hospitalized…etc . N - No social support , lack family , friend , work religion support S - Stated future intent , clear plan include time , method location Each item score one point , two point weigh item underlined . Kripalani et al. , ( 2010 ) suggest people get five point high need hospitalize accept therapy . The validation Chinese version scale perform group psychiatric researcher Taiwan draft . Data collection procedure 1 . The target population study sample The target population ( i.e . clinical nurse ) study define variety ward Hematology , Oncology , Stroke Rehabilitation potential case high suicide risk may identify . The investigator hypothesise nurse work ward understand concept suicide prevention suicide risk assessment . Therefore study include clinical nurse ward target population . The sample size calculate base suggestion literature , investigator set significant level data , α = 0.05 , power = 0.80 . Then investigator divide study subject experimental group control group randomly , use different intervention examine effect research . 2 . Pilot study The investigator design focus group course ( three time ) clinical nurse understand opinion need teach material suicide risk identification assessment . Also , investigator examine possibility add interactive discussion group suggest group discussion . The investigator choose 6-8 nurse time study sample randomly exclude already joined focus group . Location focus group independent discussion room hospital . Meanwhile , nurse join focus group also exclude later study sample ( neither experimental group control group ) . 3 . The baseline measurement The experimental group control group administer baseline measurement include ability suicide risk identification , attitude recognition toward suicide behavior , ability suicide risk assessment ( investigator use case vignette SAD PERSONS check list ) . The goal baseline measurement evaluate difference demographic characteristic perception attitude toward suicidal behaviour two research group intervention . 4 . The outcome measure The investigator use score SAD PERSONS-check list outcome measure assess effect intervention . The reason use check list simple convenient tool screen suicide risk clinical setting , research proof reliability validity . Statistical analysis All statistic analysis research base Intent-to-treat method , follow participant finish whole study process ( i.e . drop study ) . The investigator still ask outcome measurement . All data count original group analysis order get conservative conclusion . Researchers key-in data investigator use SPSS 16.0 statistical analysis . The significant level set 0.05 . Main variable method analysis list : Independent variable 1 . Demographic information : Basic demographic variable age , sex , marriage status , nursing practice year ( continuous variable ) ; categorical variable nursing level recognize study hospital , work experience psychiatric related field , care experience suicidal person acquaintance ( friend , colleague neighbor ) patient commit suicide self-harm behavior , train experience relate suicide prevention past year . 2 . Variables baseline measurement : Attitude cognition toward suicide ( continuous variable ) , ability suicide risk identification assessment ( category variable ) , SAD PERSONS-the check list suicide risk ( continuous variable ) . Outcome variables The ability identify evaluate suicide risk , SAD PERSONS-the check list suicide risk ( continuous variable ) , case analysis 1 ( category variable ) Baseline comparison To make sure difference first among participant research , investigator compare characteristic basic ability suicide risk . Independent t-test use deal continuous variable , Chi-square test use category variable . However , whether significant difference , investigator analyze suicide identification assessment ability multivariate analysis . Further analysis The investigator compare change score outcome , scale `` SAD PERSONS '' , continuous variable intervention . The investigator also analyze frequency association item baseline measurement include participant ' work site , age , sex , education , duration nursing practice , training suicide risk assessment , care experience suicide self-harm case . D. Predictable Difficulties Solutions 1 . Attendance Participation interactive discussion group Nurses According different shift clinical nurse , investigator arrange schedule interactive discussion group , investigator completely communicate chief manager different department get support hospital administration make sure investigator appropriate time every member group . Also , researcher remind every member one one elevate attendance participation . Furthermore , time nurse spend train count in-service education time arouse enforce motivation . Besides , researcher provide research fee every participant promote participation interest . 2 . Missing data questionnaire To prevent miss data , researcher join every discussion activity examine problem nurse fill questionnaire , keyin data individually ensure correctness . Moreover , research assistant key data twice surveilance principle investigator whole procedure .</detailed_description>
