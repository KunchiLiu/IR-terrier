	<brief_summary>Background : Subcortical Vascular Dementia ( VaD ) , consequent deep brain small vessel disease ( SVD ) , frequent form VaD . The term vascular mild cognitive impairment ( VMCI ) define transitional state normal age VaD . Attentional deficit common find patient affect VMCI subcortical VaD . At present , drug treatment available prevent vascular dementia patient VMCI improve cognitive performance large group patient . Cognitive rehabilitation direct achieve functional change reinforce , strengthen , reestablish previously learn pattern behavior , establish new pattern cognitive activity compensatory mechanism . A hierarchical model attention use build Attention Process Training-II ( APT-II ) programme . The APT-II programme effectiveness demonstrate traumatic brain injury post-stroke rehabilitation , increase interest study cognitive rehabilitation pathological process evolve time , chronic cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) . Aims : The purpose study investigate whether APT-II programme could useful tool rehabilitation attention individual affect VMCI SVD , , whether improvement performance generalize functionality daily activity quality life . Main Expected Results Impact : Considering APT-II contains specific exercise facilitate generalization daily life , skill learn patient rehabilitation programme generalize daily activity . Furthermore , improvement cognitive skill also improve patient 's overall quality life learn skill applicable real-life situation . The main expected result : 1 ) impact APT-II disability , everyday cognition , quality life , performance attention test short long term rehabilitation programme end compare standard care ; 2 ) reduction risk transition dementia 1 year follow-up compare control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Attention Patients With MCI Brain Subcortical Vascular Changes Using APT-II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design The present study 3-year prospective , single-blinded , randomized clinical trial . The enrolment carry Stroke Unit VASCOG clinic Careggi University Hospital . Forty patient enrol accord follow criterion : 1 ) MCI define accord Winblad et al . criterion ( 19 ) ; 2 ) Evidence impairment across attention neuropsychological test ; 3 ) Evidence MRI subcortical vascular lesion : moderate severe age-related white matter change ( WMC ) accord modify version Fazekas scale ( 20 ) . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 year . All enrol patient evaluated baseline accord study protocol , include : 1 ) Clinical assessment ; 2 ) Functional , quality life mood assessment ; 3 ) Extensive neuropsychological assessment ; 4 ) MRI protocol . After baseline assessment , participant randomly assign attention train standard care . Stratified minimization randomization use ensure balance possible prognostic factor ( i.e. , age , gender , MMSE total score , extension localization WMC ) across group . All APT-II session administer clinical neuropsychologist , appositely trained graduate student medicine . The student clinicians receive minimum 30 hour train adult rehabilitation patient , closely supervised neuropsychologist . Participants APT-II group receive overall 40 hour individual attention process training . Therapy administer one two-hour session week total 20 week . Participants standard care group receive cognitive training rehabilitation intervention , instruct usual lifestyle , conventionally provide medication clinic consultation . Each patient followed-up 6 12 month baseline assessment . During follow-up visit clinical assessment , extensive neuropsychological evaluation , mood , functional , quality life assessment perform accord baseline protocol . The MRI protocol repeat 1-year follow-up . Work Methodology Baseline follow-up clinical , neuropsychological , functional , MRI data collect dedicated database . Data check controlled consistency real time collection . At end enrolment , first exploratory data analysis carry . Postprocessing neuroimaging acquire baseline perform experienced radiologist . At end follow-up ( 6 12 month enrollment ) , analysis data ( uni- multivariate model effect size measure ) carry . All analysis perform use SPSS 18 mainly direct : 1 ) evaluate short long-term effectiveness rehabilitation program , use cognitive performance functional quality life measure dependent variable ( within group analysis ) ; 2 ) identify potential predictor effectiveness rehabilitation program ( multivariate model ) . The variable include model : demographic vascular risk factor , baseline cognitive profile functional status , preexist brain structural change ; 3 ) evaluate potential protective effect rehabilitation program increase cognitive impairment transition dementia 1 year follow-up ; 4 ) evaluate long-term effect rehabilitation brain activation , use f-MRI data , whole-brain histogram , voxel-based analysis dependent variable ( within group analysis ) . Milestones - Phase 1 ( 4 month ) : 1 ) Project protocol establishment ; 2 ) Dedicated database data collection construction ; 3 ) MRI protocol determination ; 4 ) Training cognitive rehabilitation - Phase 2 ( 24 month ) : 1 ) Baseline patient cohort enrolment clinical , neuropsychological , functional , MRI data collection ; 2 ) Neuropsychological rehabilitation program administration ; 3 ) Follow-up assessment ( 6 12 month enrolment ) - Phase 3 ( 8 month ) : 1 ) Post-processing neuroimaging acquire baseline 1-year follow-up ; 2 ) Data completeness consistency control ; 3 ) Data analysis ; 4 ) Dissemination result</detailed_description>
