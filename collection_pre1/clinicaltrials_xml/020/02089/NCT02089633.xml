	<brief_title>Pegylated Recombinant Human Arginase 1 Combination With Oxaliplatin Capecitabine Treatment HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II open-label study . The first part study ( Part 1 ) dose escalation study 21-day regimen IV Oxaliplatin combination weekly IV PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg oral Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice per day 14 day . There 3 successive treatment cohort dose level 85 mg/m2 , 100 mg/m2 130 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin . Subsequent treatment cohort open patient previous cohort complete first 3 cycle PACOX . The first patient enter study start Cohort 1 . At least three subject treat cohort observe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . If one three treat patient develop DLT dose level , three additional patient enter dose level . The dose Oxaliplatin escalate DLT first three patient one six treated patient develop DLT . If two three/six patient give dose level experience DLT , dose escalation stop previous dose level declare MTD ( recommend dose ) PACOX regimen second part study ( Part 2 ) . If first three patient Cohort 3 develop DLT , additional three patient enrol Cohort 3 . If one less one patient Cohort 3 develop DLT . dose level declare MTD . Toxicity assess physical examination vital sign finding , safety laboratory test result , grade NCI CTCAE ( version 4.0 ) . Part 2 : Patients receive recommend dose PACOX regimen define Part 1 . A 14-day screening period follow treatment period consist 3-week treatment cycle . Patients treated disease progression intolerable toxicity . The treatment period end follow visit 30 day last dose trial treatment . After study treatment , patient follow-up every 8 week survival status study termination . Patients part study receive PACOX regimen disease progression , intolerable toxicity , death patient withdraw consent . The clinical effect PACOX regimen tumor response evaluate . Tumour assessment base RECIST 1.1 criterion perform disease progression .</detailed_description>

Patients give write informed consent prior study specific screen procedure understand patient right withdraw study time , without prejudice . Prior use systemic anticancer treatment HCC target therapy , e.g . sorafenib . Systemic anticancer treatment HCC include chemotherapy , immunotherapy hormonal therapy ( except hormonal therapy supportive care permit ) . Antiviral treatment allow , however interferon therapy must stop least 4 week prior start trial treatment Prior use approve investigational target therapy HCC , e.g . sorafenib , within two week prior start trial treatment Use local ablative treatment TACE within 6 week prior start trial treatment , must clear evidence progressive disease local treatment ; Radiotherapy within 3 week prior start trial treatment . ( Palliative radiotherapy allow ) Major surgery within 4 week prior start trial treatment Use biologic response modifier , GCSF , within 3 week prior start trial treatment .
