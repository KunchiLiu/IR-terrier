	<brief_summary>Subjects study diagnose bulge aneurysm abdominal aorta , blood vessel abdomen ( belly ) supply blood low body include major organ legs . The purpose study gather safety effectiveness Zenith t-Branch customized physician-specified stent-graft combination fenestration and/or branch repair aneurysm . The Zenith t-Branch physician-specified fenestrated branch endovascular graft tubular graft make polyester fabric sewn stainless steel stent keep graft open . As aneurysm expands , wall become weak may rupture , cause major loss blood high risk death serious complication . To avoid risk aneurysm repair put graft place aneurysm . The graft inserted artery leg ( call endovascular repair ) . This procedure use catheter go inside blood vessel place stent graft aneurysm . The upper portion graft include 1 5 small hole ( fenestration ) cuff ( side branch ) allow graft locate renal artery without block blood flow . These small hole branch investigational part research study . This need enough healthy aorta renal artery . At least one artery may also treat alignment stent ( small tubular stainless steel structure ) help keep artery open align fenestration branch . The Zenith t-Branch physician-specified fenestrated branch endovascular graft refer Zenith Fenestrated-Branched System .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This traditional device feasibility study intend generate preliminary safety efficacy information may use plan appropriate future study , inform product development . The study prospective , non-randomized , non-blinded , single-arm , single-center study . The purpose study evaluate clinical outcome quality life measure consecutive cohort patient treat endovascular aortic repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( type I IV ) use Zenith t-Branch customized physician-specified stent-graft combination fenestration and/or branch .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1 . Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm diameter ≥ 5.5 cm 2 time normal aortic diameter . 2 . Aneurysm history growth ≥ 0.5 cm per year . 3 . Saccular aneurysm deem significant risk rupture base upon physician interpretation . General 1 . Less 18 year age 2 . Unwilling comply followup schedule 3 . Inability refusal give informed consent patient legally authorize representative 4 . Pregnant breastfeed 5 . Life expectancy &lt; 2 year 6 . Prior open surgical interventional procedure within 30 day anticipate date fenestratedbranched procedure , exception plan stag procedure provide access repair ( e.g. , stag iliac conduit , cervical debranching ) , facilitate procedure allow open revascularization target artery amenable revascularization investigational device , internal iliac artery , subclavian artery visceral artery early bifurcation , tortuosity occlusive disease prevent successful placement alignment side stent . 7 . Participation another investigational clinical device trial , exception participation another investigational endovascular stentgraft protocol percutaneous aortic valve protocol , encompass IDE protocol perform remotely fenestrated procedure ( &gt; 30 day ) . Examples include remote ( &gt; 30 day ) participation thoracic , abdominal iliac branch device trial , participation percutaneous aortic valve trial . 8 . Patients rupture aortic aneurysm require urgent emergent repair , exception patient contain , stable rupture anatomy suitable offtheshelf design . Medical 1 . Known sensitivity allergy stainless steel , nitinol , polyester , solder ( tin , silver ) , polypropylene , polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) , urethane gold 2 . History anaphylactic reaction contrast material adequately premedicated 3 . Leaking rupture aneurysm associate hypotension 4 . Uncorrectable coagulopathy 5 . Mycotic aneurysm patient evidence active systemic infection . 6 . History connective tissue disorder ( e.g. , vascular Ehlers Danlos , Marfans syndrome ) , exception patient prior open surgical aortic replacement , surgical graft would serve land zone investigational stentgraft . 7 . Body habitus would inhibit Xray visualization aorta branch . Anatomical 1 . Inadequate femoral iliac access compatible require delivery system . 2 . Inability perform temporary permanent open surgical endovascular iliac conduit patient inadequate femoral/iliac access 3 . Absence nonaneurysmal aortic segment distal thoracic aorta diaphragmatic hiatus : 1 . A diameter measure outer wall outer wall great 38mm less 21 mm ; 2 . Parallel aortic wall &lt; 20 % diameter change without significant calcification and/or thrombus select area seal zone 4 . Visceral vessel anatomy compatible Zenith tBranch physicianspecified stentgraft due excessive occlusive disease small size amenable stent graft placement 5 . Unsuitable distal iliac artery fixation site anatomy : 1 . Common iliac artery fixation site diameter , measure outer wall outer wall sectional image ( CT ) &lt; 8.0 mm inability perform open surgical conduit 2 . Iliac artery diameter , measure outer wall outer wall sectional image ( CT ) &gt; 21 mm distal fixation site , inability perform open internal iliac artery revascularization iliac branch stent graft 3 . Iliac artery distal fixation site &lt; 10 mm length 4 . Inability preserve least one hypogastric artery</criteria>
