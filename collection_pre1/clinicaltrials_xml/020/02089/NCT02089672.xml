	<brief_summary>Abnormal heart rhythm arrhythmias often manage procedure catheter introduce heart . These catheter cauterize abnormally functioning portion heart muscle hope return heart effective rhythm . In process performing procedure , call catheter ablation , operator must able accurately sense electrical activity display computer screen different part heart , provide sufficient localize energy abnormally behave tissue ( ideally without damage uninvolved heart structure ) , accurately reassess electrical activity heart ensure spot heart cauterize . When sense electrical activity heart , specialize catheter produce recording computer screen know electrograms ( EGM ) . To produce record conventional catheter commonly use positive negative electrode , difference two provide EGM . The distance two electrode varies device device . The great distance , less accurate measurement local electrical activity become . This may result poorly localize excessive use energy could damage normal heart structure put patient risk return development additional arrhythmia . The IntellaTip MiFi catheter construct specialized sensing tip use `` microelectrodes '' relatively close proximity ( &lt; 1 mm apart ) hope improve sense capability device . This study analyze signal obtain FDA-approved catheter people undergo catheter ablation procedure . The study examine signal procedure finish prolong differ process standard ablation procedure . The goal study determine ability microelectrodes distinguish ablate , cauterize versus non-cauterized tissue .</brief_summary>
