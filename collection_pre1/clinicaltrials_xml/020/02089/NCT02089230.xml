	<detailed_description>Phase I : Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 2 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase 1 study . If enrolled Phase 1 , dose MEK162 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level MEK162 . The second group receive high dose MEK162 group , intolerable side effect see . This design find high tolerable dose MEK 162 . Participants Phase 2 receive high tolerate dose find Phase 1 . Study Drug Administration : You take MEK162 tablet mouth 2 time day ( 12 hour apart ) every day full cup water . There 4 week study cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test blood sugar test . On Days 4 8 Cycle 1 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test blood sugar test . Sometime Days 13-27 cycle Day 28 Cycles 2 beyond , study staff call ask drug may take side effect may . The call last less 10 minute time . On Day 28 Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease biomarker cytogenetic testing . If bone marrow collect , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn test . You EKG either ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . On Day 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test blood sugar test . - Urine collect routine test . - You eye exam eye doctor . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On visit blood sugar testing , fast least 8 hour blood draw . On visit urine collect , give container collect urine 24 hour doctor think need . If convenient , may able blood draw do away MD Anderson . The study staff discus . Every two three month treatment , echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan check heart function . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease biomarker , PD , and/or cytogenetic testing . If already bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy recently doctor think repeat need , leftover bone marrow use test . If bone marrow collect , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn test . - You EKG . This investigational study . MEK162 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 57 patient total take part phase study . All enrol MD Anderson . Phase II : Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 42 participant enrol Phase 2 study . Participants Phase 1 give dose MEK162 base join study . Groups participant give different dose level high tolerable dose MEK162 find . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive MEK162 high dose tolerate Phase 1 . Study Drug Administration : You take MEK162 tablet mouth 2 time day ( 12 hour apart ) every day full cup water . There 4 week study cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test blood sugar test . On Days 4 8 Cycle 1 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test blood sugar test . Sometime Days 13-27 cycle Day 28 Cycles 2 beyond , study staff call ask drug may take side effect may .
