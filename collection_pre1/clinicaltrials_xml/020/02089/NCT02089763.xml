	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pegylated Recombinant Human Arginase 1 Second-line Therapy Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-arm clinical trial . Approximately 35 subject enrol study . All subject treat PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg weekly ( day1 , 8 15 ) . Three week treatment PEG-BCT-100 consider 1 cycle . All subject receive PEG-BCT-100 till progressive disease , intolerable toxicity patient withdraw consent . The clinical effect PEG-BCT-100 disease response evaluate every 6 week disease progression . Disease response evaluation base RECIST 1.1 criterion . The disease response base modify RECIST criterion also evaluate documented reference . Safety parameter evaluate throughout study . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( NCI CTC AE v4 ) . All subject undergo tumor tissue biopsy baseline evaluation biomarkers ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC ) arginine succinate synthetase ( ASS ) except subject whose tumor tissue block obtain within 1 year available biomarkers evaluation . The association level 2 biomarkers disease response PEG-BCT-100 treatment explore study . The effect patient ' quality life evaluate every 2 cycle PEG-BCT-100 treatment .</detailed_description>
