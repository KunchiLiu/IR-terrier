	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) differs head neck malignancy term epidemiology , pathology , treatment outcome . It endemic China one major public health problem . Concurrent radiotherapy chemotherapy primary treatment patient NPC . Despite aggressive treatment , many patient locally advance NPC still develop locally recurrent disease . Since local control directly relate patient morbidity mortality NPC , strong need identify method improve treatment outcome NPC . One strategy improve local control escalate dose radiotherapy . This local control show directly relate radiotherapy dose . Several different technique , include brachytherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , dose-painting intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , use increase radiotherapy dose . However , due large number critical anatomic structure near nasopharynx , dose-escalation NPC also lead increased toxicity . One technique achieve dose-escalation minimal increase toxicity simultaneous modulate accelerated radiation therapy ( SMART ) . The main challenge treatment identify appropriate tumor volume receive high-dose radiotherapy . Conventional dose-escalation conduct use compute tomography ( CT ) identify gross tumor volume ( GTV ) . However , recent progress F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18F-FDG-PET/CT ) treatment planning allow accurate tumor volume delineation . We hypothesize use PET/CT treatment plan improve dose-escalation radiotherapy NPC turn improve therapeutic efficacy reduce toxicity . PET/CT image tissue hypoxia use [ F-18 ] fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) , widely use nitroimidazole image agent.Given clinical trial directly compare conventional chemoradiotherapy CT-guided dose-escalation chemoradiotherapy PET/CT guide dose-escalation chemoradiotherapy locally advance NPC.This study evaluate role FMISO-PET hypoxia image predict survival NPC , study aim compare local control , overall survival toxicity three treatment regimens..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Patients previously untreated Stages III~IVA ( AJCC 6th Edition ) locally advanced NPC , Karnofsky performance status≥70 , good bone marrow , liver kidney function ( white blood count ≥ 4.0×109/L , platelet ≥ 100×109/L , albumin ≥30 g/L , creatinine ≤100μmol/L ) enrol study . Patients young 18 , prior ( within 5 year ) synchronous malignancy exclude . Pretreatment evaluation consist history physical , dental laboratory study . The clinical stage determine base information provide examination include contrast enhance CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head neck , Chest X-ray , liver sonography , bone scan , 18F-FDG-PET . All tumor histologically confirm except distant site . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize 1:1:1 three treatment arm : conventional chemoradiotherapy ( group A ) , FDG PET/CT -guided dose escalation chemoradiotherapy ( group B ) FMISO PET/CT -guided dose escalation chemoradiotherapy ( group C ) . All patient give concurrent chemoradiotherapy within two week diagnosis . Radiotherapy deliver use simultaneous modulate accelerated radiation therapy ( SMART ) IMRT technique dose-escalation treatment arm . Concurrent chemotherapy consist cisplatin ( 20mg / m2 , iv , d1- 4 ) docetaxel ( 75mg / m2 , d1 , d8 ) administer 1st 4th week treatment . All patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy range 2 4 cycle . Follow-up statistical analysis Planned patient assessment include physical examination fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy every 3 month 3 year start 4 week post-treatment . A contrast-enhanced CT MRI head neck also obtain follow . After 3 year , patient follow yearly thereafter . Suspected recurrence histologically proven . To assess distant metastasis , CT chest bone scan obtain every half year . During every follow-up visit , treatment toxicity assess . Radiotherapy-related toxicity grade accord Acute Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) . Chemotherapy-related toxicity ( except nausea alopecia ) grade criterion WHO . All event measure date randomization . OS define time date radiotherapy death late date know alive . Durations calculate end treatment . The Kaplan-Meier method use calculate actuarial rate local control , DFS OS . The χ2 test use compare incidence rate categorical variable Student 's t-test use comparing mean continuous variable .</detailed_description>
