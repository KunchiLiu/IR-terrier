	<brief_title>Optimizing Pazopanib Exposure RCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , multi-center , intraindividual dose-optimization study . Patients locally advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive 800 mg Pazopanib daily . After 14 day Pazopanib plasma concentration determine . In patient show good tolerability plasma trough level ≤ 20 µg/mLthe daily dose increase 200 mg step plasma trough level &gt; 20 µg/mL achieve dose-limiting toxicity occur , daily dose 1600 mg reach , disease progression . After dose optimization plasma concentration determine 14 day ( day 11-15 ) . If indicate , dose optimization perform 21 day previous dose optimization ( day 18-24 ) .</detailed_description>
