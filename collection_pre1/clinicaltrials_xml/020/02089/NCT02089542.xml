	<detailed_description>Around 13,000 thyroid parathyroid operation perform per year England benign malignant disease . Reliable identification parathyroid glands critical success thyroid parathyroid surgery . In thyroid surgery , inadvertent injury parathyroid gland may cause temporary permanent hypoparathyroidism ( low calcium level need long term treatment ) ; latter associate significant long term problem . In parathyroid surgery , early identification normal and/or enlarge parathyroid gland help decide extent surgery increase chance postoperative normal calcium level . Methylene Blue ( Methylthioninium chloride , MB ) dye give intravenously high dos , take differently thyroid parathyroid tissue . It currently use parathyroid surgery surgeon help identify enlarged parathyroid gland visual examination alone . At dos , risk adverse effect administration MB . Such visual examination unhelpful identification 'normal ' parathyroid tissue . MB currently use surgery thyroid pathology . MB exhibit fluorescent property near-infrared range ( light beyond visible spectrum ) . This picked appropriate imaging system . This potential identify differentiate 'normal ' parathyroid , 'abnormal ' parathyroid thyroid tissue surgery . The investigator establish feasibility intra-operative use near infra-red fluorescent image device call Fluobeam® demonstrate ability device pick near infra-red fluorescence human tissue administration intravenous MB . Animal experiment show dos low 0.1mg/kg MB give intravenously enable fluorescent visualisation thyroid parathyroid glands . This study aim optimise dose time administration MB human thyroid parathyroid surgery develop protocol would subsequently assess effectiveness multi-centred randomize controlled setting .</detailed_description>
