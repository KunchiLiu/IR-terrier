	<brief_title>Efficacy Artemether/Lumefantrine Treatment Uncomplicated Malaria .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin base combination therapy ( ACTs ) currently recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria malaria endemic country include Tanzania , adopt policy 2007 . ACTs proven highly efficacious different part world different malaria endemicity . Artemisinins clear asexual parasite rapidly also potent P. falciparum gametocyte , hence reduce disease transmission spread drug resistance . Nonetheless , report Kenya show increase proportion patient parasitaemia day 1 . Most recently , resistance artemisinins confirm four country South-East Asia , may spread Africa . In order safeguard ACTs life span , WHO recommend suspect malaria case confirm parasitological diagnosis , follow prompt treatment effective antimalarial . It also emphasize need conduct efficacy study first second line antimalarial treatment every two year able detect resistance early course . Therefore , base notion , study aim assess therapeutic efficacy Artemether/Lumefantrine among child uncomplicated falciparum malaria Bagamoyo district , five year wide scale use Tanzania .</detailed_description>
