	<brief_summary>Background : There variety treatment option medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy . Evidence randomize trial indicate vagus nerve stimulation therapy use proven therapy medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy . Resective surgery one commonly use method treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy . The aim study compare effect vagus nerve stimulation therapy resective surgery treatment medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy . Methods/Design : In article , report design protocol randomize control trial treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy vagus nerve stimulation therapy resective surgery . In total , 40 patient age 12 60 year medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy assess . There two treatment group . These patient randomly assign one follow two treatment group , i.e . 1 ) undergo temporal lobe resection group , 2 ) receive vagus nerve stimulation therapy group . The primary outcome ass whether vagus nerve stimulation produce reduction mean monthly seizure frequency comparable resection 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month follow-up . The secondary outcome include neuropsychological , seizure severity , seizure type , quality life , mood assessment , operative postoperative complication long-term side effect , compare resection . Discussion : The result trial ass efficacy use vagus nerve stimulation therapy resective surgery treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy , determine good therapy treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Published data suggest patient temporal lobe epilepsy continue experience seizure trial two three antiepileptic drug unlikely become seizure-free attempt resection . Such patient may experience poor quality life functional outcome continue seizure adverse effect associate attempt resection . Vagus nerve stimulation minimally invasive treatment epilepsy well-established effectiveness adjunctive treatment partial seizure refractory resection , vagus nerve stimulation minimally invasive treatment epilepsy well-established effectiveness adjunctive treatment partial seizure refractory resection , control randomized clinical trial compare effectiveness Vagus Nerve Stimulation therapy resection patient .</detailed_description>
