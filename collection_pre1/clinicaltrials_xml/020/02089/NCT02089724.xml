In disease melanoma , duration administration usually short , due bad prognosis disease progression despite treatment . As long-term follow-up , ECD patient vemurafenib seem stable disease , want evaluate possibility treatment interruption current practice .

	<detailed_description>Erdheim-Chester disease ( ECD ) rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis . Diagnosis ECD base clinical symptom , image histology infiltration tissue foamy CD68 positive+ CD1a negative histiocyte . The clinical course mainly depend extent distribution disease , range asymptomatic bone lesion life-threatening manifestation . The overall mortality remain high ( 22 % 100 ECD patient see institution August 2013 ) . Due rare nature disease ( 500 case worldwide report since 1930 ) prospective therapeutic trial perform . Interferon alpha ( IFN alpha ) , standard pegylated form , first line therapy ECD . However , long-term IFN alpha treatment lead severe side effect . Moreover , patient CNS and/or cardiovascular infiltration , two lethal organ involvement , develop secondary resistance high dos IFN alpha . For refractory patient , anakinra , cladribine , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , infliximab propose second line treatment . The optimal second line therapeutic strategy remain however define , mostly treatment evaluate small number patient . Because half ECD patient carry BRAFV600E mutation , recently propose vemurafenib , inhibitor mutant BRAF , possible target therapy . We treat 10 patient refractory ECD life-threatening manifestation associate BRAFV600E mutation observe short long term efficacy ( median follow-up 9 month ) . However , vemurafenib may several side effect long term administration drug evaluate . In disease melanoma , duration administration usually short , due bad prognosis disease progression despite treatment . As long-term follow-up , ECD patient vemurafenib seem stable disease , want evaluate possibility treatment interruption current practice . Other BRAF inhibitor , dabrafenib , recently propose treat BRAF mutate histiocytoses .</detailed_description>
