	<brief_summary>Background : - People learn use feedback brain activity change activity . Researchers want see people stroke change brain activity practice think feedback , improve motor control . They study brain activity people stroke . Objectives : - To see people stroke change brain activity improve motor control practice think . Eligibility : - Adults 18 80 year old stroke . - Healthy volunteer 18 80 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , MRI , physical exam . For MRI , magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They scanner less 2 hour , lie still 15 minute time . The scanner make loud noise . Participants get earplug . - Participants 3 scan visit 3 follow-up visit within 24 week . Visits may include screening , MRI , functional MRI ( fMRI ) , questionnaire , simple motor test . Stroke participant may take additional motor test , include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . - fMRI : During MRI , small metal disk may tap skin fabric glove small wire may use monitor hand movement . Heart rate breathing may also monitor . Participants may monitor video ask perform task . - TMS : A brief electrical current go coil scalp . It create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Participants may ask perform simple action . Finger hand movement may record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study understand whether healthy volunteer patient chronic stroke result hemiparesis learn modulate brain activity use feedback real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rtfMRI ) , whether feedback train lead improvement motor rehabilitation chronic stroke patient . Study population : This study carry two parallel phase . In Phase 1 , study learn control brain functional activation ( feedback technique use rtfMRI ) adult healthy volunteer ; Phase 2 , study adult patient chronic stroke . In phase , intend study whether feedback training rtfMRI lead increase control brain activity whether correlate improvement motor control healthy participant improvement motor function , chronic stroke patient , immediately train late time point . The reason carry study parallel , state recently Dr Petra Kaufman PIRC meeting , patient brain lesion may benefit approach even healthy volunteer . Design : Phase 1 : We test healthy volunteer learn modulate brain connectivity use feedback connectivity pattern two brain region rtfMRI neurofeedback paradigm . Phase 2 : We test chronic stroke patient learn modulate brain activity connectivity similar healthy volunteer , learn improve function . Outcome measure : The primary outcome Phases 1 2 difference brain activation brain connectivity feedback training compare baseline . Secondary outcome phase include : 1 ) change brain connectivity rest , feedback image display ( structural and/or functional connectivity ) , 2 ) change motor behavior training compare baseline , immediately follow time delay , 3 ) correlation change behavior change brain activity brain connectivity ( measure 1 2 ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion healthy volunteer : Age 18 80 Have normal neurological exam Have capacity give inform consent Exclusion criterion healthy volunteer : &lt; TAB &gt; Pregnancy Any report MRI safety questionnaire prevents safely undergo MRI scan ( e.g. , metal implant ) per MRI center questionnaire History claustrophobia Inability carry task scanning . Any medical condition would prevent lie flat 2 hour Inclusion criterion patient hemiparesis stroke ( regardless TMS ) : Aged 18 80 Stroke onset great 3 month prior participation study Hemiparesis due stroke involve upper extremity Have capacity give inform consent . If investigator feel volunteer capacity give inform consent questionable , NIH Human Subjects Protection Unit ( HSPU ) request determine individual ability consent . Exclusion criteria patient hemiparesis stroke : &lt; TAB &gt; Pregnancy Any report MRI safety questionnaire prevents safely undergo MRI scan ( e.g. , metal implant ) per MRI center questionnaire History claustrophobia Inability carry task scanning . Any medical condition would prevent lie flat 2 hour Given heterogeneity population stroke , strong hypothesis effect specific medication experimental outcome . Thus , medication list exclusion criterion pose concern . Furthermore , take advantage heterogeneity lesion location experimental outcome , perform posthoc stratification lesion location initial study stroke patient . There little data support specific hypothesis lesion size/location contribute difference participant ability successfully perform task ( e.g. , control his/her neural activity use rtfMRI neurofeedback ) . The one prior study use rtfMRI individual stroke recruit two participant internal capsule lesion . Thus , study stratify participant lesion location posthoc analysis use result information inform future protocol stroke patient use rtfMRI neurofeedback . Exclusion TMS portion specifically : Have metal body , cardiac pacemaker , brain stimulator , shrapnel , surgical metal , clip brain , cochlear implant , metal fragment eye Have epilepsy history seizure , medication epilepsy .</criteria>
