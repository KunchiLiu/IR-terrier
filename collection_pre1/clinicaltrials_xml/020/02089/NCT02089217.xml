	<brief_title>Carotid Revascularization Medical Management Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention stroke involve manage treat risk factor . Most stroke cause blood flow portion brain block . One place often happen carotid artery . This blockage call atherosclerosis harden artery . The purpose trial determine best way prevent stroke people high amount blockage carotid artery stroke symptom related blockage . Each eligible participant evaluate determine procedure ( ) best him/her . All participant receive intensive medical treatment . In addition , participant randomize receive select procedure . The trial conduct United States Canada physician carefully select ability perform procedure low risk . Another key component trial important stroke risk factor , include hypertension , diabetes , high cholesterol , cigarette smoking , physical activity , diet manage intensively . Participants remain study 4 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients ≥35 year old . 2 . Carotid stenosis define : Stenosis ≥70 % catheter angiography ( NASCET Criteria ) ; OR DUS ≥70 % stenosis define peak systolic velocity least 230 cm/s plus least one following : 1. end diastolic velocity ≥100 cm/s , 2. internal carotid/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio ≥4.0 , 3 . CTA ≥ 70 % stenosis , 4 . MRA ≥ 70 % stenosis . 3 . No medical history stroke TIA ipsilateral stenosis within 180 day randomization . Lifelong asymptomatic patient define medical history stroke transient ischemic attack negative response symptom item Questionnaire Verifying Strokefree Status ( QVSS ) .18 4 . Patients must modify Rankin Scale score 0 1 time inform consent . 5 . Women must childbearing potential , childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test prior randomization . 6 . Patients must agree comply protocolspecified followup appointment . 7 . Patients must sign consent form approve local govern Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /Medical Ethics Committee ( MEC ) respective clinical site . 8 . Randomization treatment group apply one carotid artery patient bilateral carotid stenosis . Management nonrandomized stenosis may do accordance local PI recommendation . Treatment nonstudy internal carotid artery must take place least 30 day prior randomization , great 44 day randomization 30 day study procedure complete ( whichever longer ) . 9 . Carotid stenosis must treatable CEA , CAS , either procedure . General Exclusion Criteria 1 . Intolerance allergic reaction study medication without suitable management alternative . 2 . GI hemorrhage within 1 month prior enrollment would preclude antiplatelet therapy . 3 . Prior major ipsilateral stroke past substantial residual disability ( mRS ≥ 2 ) likely confound study outcome . 4 . Severe dementia . 5 . History major symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 12 month relate anticoagulation . 6 . Prior Intracranial hemorrhage investigator believe represent contraindication perioperative periprocedural antithrombotic antiplatelet treatment necessary complete endarterectomy stenting per protocol . 7 . Current neurologic illness characterize fleeting fixed neurologic deficit distinguish TIA stroke . 8 . Patient object future blood transfusion . 9 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000/microliter history heparininduced thrombocytopenia . 10 . Anticoagulation Phenprocoumon ( Marcumar® ) , warfarin , direct thrombin inhibitor , antiXa agent . 11 . Chronic atrial fibrillation . 12 . Any episode atrial fibrillation within past 6 month history paroxysmal atrial fibrillation deem require chronic anticoagulation . 13 . Other highrisk cardiac source emboli , include leave ventricular aneurysm , severe cardiomyopathy , aortic mitral mechanical heart valve , severe calcific aortic stenosis ( valve area &lt; 1.0 cm2 ) , endocarditis , moderate severe mitral stenosis , leave atrial thrombus , intracardiac mass , know unrepaired PFO prior paradoxical embolism . 14 . Unstable angina define rest angina ECG change amenable revascularization ( patient undergo plan coronary revascularization least 30 day randomization ) . 15 . Left Ventricular Ejection fraction &lt; 30 % admission heart failure prior 6 month . 16 . Respiratory insufficiency life expectancy &lt; 4 year FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict value . 17 . Known malignancy basal cell nonmelanoma skin cancer . There two exception rule : patient prior cancer treatment recurrence &gt; 5 year eligible enrollment cancer patient life expectancy great 5 year eligible enrollment . 18 . Any major surgery , major trauma , revascularization procedure , acute coronary syndrome within past 1 month . 19 . Either serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl estimate GFR &lt; 30 cc/min . 20 . Major ( noncarotid ) surgery/procedures plan within 3 month enrollment . 21 . Currently list evaluated major organ transplantation ( i.e . heart , lung , liver , kidney ) . 22 . Actively participate another drug aortic arch cerebrovascular device trial participation CREST2 would compromise regard followup assessment outcomes continuation CREST2 . 23 . Inability understand cooperate study procedure provide inform consent . 24 . Nonatherosclerotic carotid stenosis ( dissection , fibromuscular dysplasia , stenosis follow radiation therapy ) . 25 . Previous ipsilateral CEA CAS . 26 . Ipsilateral internal common carotid artery occlusion . 27 . Intracarotid float thrombus . 28 . Ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm &gt; 5 mm . 29 . Extreme morbid obesity would compromise patient safety procedure would compromise patient safety periprocedural period . 30 . Coronary artery disease two proximal major diseased coronary artery 70 % stenosis , , revascularized . Specific carotid endarterectomy exclusion criterion Patients consider revascularization CEA must follow criterion : 1 . Serious adverse reaction anesthesia able overcome premedication . 2 . Distal/intracranial stenosis great index lesion . 3 . Any following anatomical : radical neck dissection ; surgically inaccessible lesion ( e.g . cervical spine level 2 ( C2 ) ) ; adverse neck anatomy limit surgical exposure ( e.g . spinal immobility inability flex neck beyond neutral kyphotic deformity , short obese neck ) ; presence tracheostomy stoma ; laryngeal nerve palsy contralateral target vessel ; previous extracranialintracranial subclavian bypass procedure ipsilateral target vessel . Specific Carotid Artery Stenting Exclusion Criteria Patients consider revascularization CAS must follow criterion : 1 . Allergy intravascular contrast dye amenable premedication . 2 . Type III , aortic arch anatomy . 3 . Angulation tortuosity ( ≥ 90 degree ) innominate common carotid artery precludes safe , expeditious sheath placement transmit severe loop internal carotid sheath placement . 4 . Severe angulation tortuosity internal carotid artery ( include calyceal origin carotid bifurcation ) preclude safe deployment embolic protection device stent . Severe tortuosity define 2 ≥ 90 degree angle within 4 cm target stenosis . 5 . Proximal/ostial CCA , innominate stenosis distal/intracranial stenosis great index lesion . Excessive circumferential calcification stenotic lesion define &gt; 3mm thickness calcification see orthogonal view fluoroscopy . ( Note : Anatomic consideration tortuosity , arch anatomy , calcification must evaluate even carefully elderly subject ( ≥ 70 year ) . ) 6 . Target ICA vessel reference diameter &lt; 4.0 mm &gt; 9.0 mm . Target ICA measurement may make angiography contralateral artery . The reference diameter must appropriate device use . 7 . Inability deploy utilize FDAapproved Embolic Protection Device ( EPD ) . 8 . Noncontiguous lesion long lesion ( &gt; 3 cm ) . 9 . Qualitative characteristic stenosis stenosislength carotid bifurcation ( common carotid ) and/or ipsilateral external carotid artery , preclude safe sheath placement . 10 . Occlusive critical iliofemoral disease include severe tortuosity stenosis necessitate additional endovascular procedure facilitate access aortic arch prevents safe expeditious femoral access aortic arch . `` String sign '' ipsilateral common internal carotid artery . 11 . Angiographic , CT , MR ultrasound evidence severe atherosclerosis aortic arch origin innominate common carotid artery would preclude safe passage sheath endovascular device target artery need carotid stenting .</criteria>
