	<brief_summary>Background : - Proteins , fat , molecule body build block . Many molecule must sugar , chain sugar , attach work properly . People congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDGs ) attach sugars sugar chain properly . A child adult CDG symptom different part body , include brain , nerve , muscle , liver , immune system . Researchers want learn disease understand well cause problem . Objective : - To learn CDGs . Eligibility : - People age 1-80 CDG suspect CDG . Design : - CDG participant stay hospital 3-5 day . They : - Medical history physical exam . They answer question CDG . - Blood take several time . Their skin numb , needle take blood arm vein . - Samples take skin , urine , maybe stool spinal fluid . - Photos take whole body . They wear underwear cover eye . - Brain MRI . They lie table slide metal cylinder . The scanner make loud knock noise wear earplug . - Abdomen ultrasound . Sound wave take image body outside . - Hand/wrist X-rays young patient . They may full-body X-ray . - DEXA bone density scan . Participants lie table scanner . - Echocardiogram electrocardiogram heart activity . Pads stick skin electrical activity heart record . - Tests hear , think , motor skill , speech . - Children participant may test do sedation benefit directly . - CDG participant may procedures visit . They may follow-up visit every year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Basic Investigations Into Known Suspected Congenital Disorders Glycosylation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDGs ) group diseases characterize abnormal glycosylation protein , also result abnormal synthesis glycosaminoglycans , glycophospholipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol abnormal synthesis utilization dolichols . CDGs first describe 1980 , initial description mutation gene underlie CDGs occur 1997 . Since , rapid discovery phase new CDGs , 80 different type , reflect define mutation 80 different gene glycobiologic pathway affect 1000 patient worldwide . The clinical manifestation CDGs quite variable within among different type , physician every specialty likely encounter patient affected glycosylation defect . The diagnosis CDGs suspect case neurological sign symptom unknown etiology , patient multisystemic disease even absence neurological feature . Other potential clinical presentation include tissuespecific disorder anemia ichthyosis , common disorder rule . Diagnostic screen many disorder perform analyze glycosylation serum transferrin , initially isoelectric focusing , mass spectrometry , specialized clinical diagnostic laboratory United States abroad . The pattern transfer glycoforms allow differentiation defect Nglycosylation assembly ER ( type I ) defect Nglycan trim elongation , occur mainly Golgi apparatus ( type II ) . Most recently , wholeexome sequencing lead elucidation underlie mutation patient unknown CDGs . Treatment available three CDG subtypes . In protocol , propose clinically evaluate 100 patient ethnicity know suspected CDGs , obtain cell , plasma , urine future study , perform mutation analysis know CDGcausing gene , search gene responsible CDGs . Routine admission 35 day occur annually require change clinical symptomatology .</detailed_description>
