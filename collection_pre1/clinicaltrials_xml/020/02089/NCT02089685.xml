	<brief_summary>This study do analyze safety , tolerability , efficacy treatment advance melanoma ( MEL ) renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) use combination regimen pembrolizumab + pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PegIFN-2b ) pembrolizumab + ipilimumab ( IPI ) . The primary hypothesis combination sufficiently well-tolerated permit continue clinical investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) + Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b Pembrolizumab+ Ipilimumab Participants With Advanced Melanoma Renal Cell Carcinoma ( MK-3475-029/KEYNOTE-29 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial do three part : Part 1A ( MEL RCC ) define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /maximum administer dose ( MAD ) drug combination ; recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination identify . Part 1B ( MEL-single arm expansion ) good characterize safety efficacy provide preliminary efficacy data penbrolizumab + IPI combination participant MEL . Part 2 ( MEL RCC ) randomize portion trial evaluate preliminary efficacy drug combination give 6-week cycle advance MEL participant . Part 2 remove study Amendment 3 protocol . Part 1C ( MEL ) add third part study Amendment 3 . Part 1C evaluate safety efficacy different dos dose interval IPI combination pembrolizumab participant advance MEL .</detailed_description>
