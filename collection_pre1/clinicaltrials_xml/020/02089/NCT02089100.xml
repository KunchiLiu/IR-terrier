	<brief_summary>The previous report phase I study allow u prospectively define optimal total dose different metastatic location ( 88 ) . However , several question still unanswered adequate timing stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) oligometastatic disease . Indeed , two different oligometastatic state : `` de novo '' , i.e . occur first metastatic presentation without previous systemic therapy ; `` secondary '' , define residual disease systemic treatment . The investigator wish prospectively study role metastasis SBRT curative intent de novo oligometastatic disease . This clinical trial would first randomize study study SBRT onset metastatic disease . If trial show PFS improvement , definitively change standard treatment highlight SBRT key treatment metastatic disease . It confirm oligometastasis hypothesis well Simon Norton hypothesis ( 92 ) .</brief_summary>
