	<brief_title>African American Alzheimer 's Progression Markers - CSF Neuro-Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>African Americans represent 10 % population US , under-represented biomarker-related age study Alzheimer 's Disease Neuro-imaging Initiative ( ADNI ) World Wide ADNI . Epidemiologic study show , compare non-Hispanic white ( NHW ) Americans , African Americans ( AA ) likely develop mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , different genetic risk develop AD , experience different rate cognitive decline cognitive symptom develop . All point existence MCI/AD endophenotype AA , although epidemiological study involve modern chemical image biomarkers associate AD pathology progression . Preliminary study use AA subject undergone CSF analysis ( n=36 ) show AA MCI subject likely normal CSF AD biomarkers NHW MCI subject , yet time great hippocampal atrophy MRI . The investigator hypothesize endothelial dysfunction alternate mechanism independently contribute cognitive impairment AA subject sub-threshold AD pathology race-independent fashion , endothelia dysfunction enhances neurotoxicity AD-associated brain change race-dependent fashion . The investigator propose build success recruit AA volunteer memory age study Emory 's Registry Remembrance recruit cross-sectional cohort 75 AA subject along 75 NHW subject normal cognition , MCI , mild AD . They test hypothesis two aim . In Aim 1 , determine whether endothelial dysfunction independently contribute cognitive decline AA NHW subject measure cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) level AD , endothelial , inflammatory marker . Each subject also undergo MRI analysis total area white matter hyperintensities image marker endothelial dysfunction . Based hypothesis , predict AA MCI/AD subject likely NHW MCI subject normal CSF AD biomarkers , abnormal CSF endothelial marker , great number area white matter hyperintensities MRI . In Aim 2 , investigator determine endothelial marker - intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM-1 - gene variant unique AA enhances AD neurotoxicity explain great hippocampal atrophy among AA MCI subject . The Lys56Met ICAM1 gene variant associate low ICAM-1 level uniquely find 16-20 % AA , subject may impair downstream activation neprilysin , Abeta-degrading enzyme . If hypothesis true , AA subject Lys56Met gene variant likely hippocampal atrophy , temporal-parietal cerebral hypoperfusion , cerebral amyloid deposition AA subject NHW subject without gene variant . This may occur set CSF Abeta2 pseudo-normalization low neprilysin level lead increase Abeta42 level . Successful completion current proposal confirm preliminary finding unique AA endophenotype within broad AD-spectrum disorder , directly examine whether endothelial dysfunction additively synergistically lead cognitive decline AD among AA cross-sectional cohort , help power design future multi-center , multi-racial longitudinal biomarker study validate cross-sectional finding .</detailed_description>
