	<brief_summary>Narrowing aortic valve heart , know severe aortic stenosis , impede blood delivery associate poor quality life death . In elderly considerable medical burden , relatively new non-invasive valve replacement technique call Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( TAVI ) use instead open-heart surgery . However , long term change cognition TAVI remain unclear previous study suggest increase risk cognitive decline patient follow surgical procedure . In pilot study , investigator characterize change cognition , physical capacity , overall quality life neuropsychiatric symptom ( depression apathy ) 6 month TAVI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Cognitive Functional Outcomes Following TAVI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease include valvular heart disease , contribute estimate 36 % deaths age 70 . In particular , severe aortic stenosis common valvular heart disease elderly Western world associate reduced quality life increase mortality . TAVI show improve survival , all-cause mortality 1 year similar surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) favourable outcome long-term include improved functional capacity quality life . Recent evidence randomize controlled trial suggest increase risk neurological event ( e.g . cognitive decline ) 1 year TAVI comparison SAVR medical treatment . Studies show change short-term memory , work memory , verbal learning , delay recognition verbal fluency 3 month TAVI . In addition , patient severe aortic stenosis increase risk mortality future health complication . This study observational , prospective cohort pilot study examine change cognitive performance functional outcome TAVI . We propose recruit 34 patient study . Cognitive performance measure use standardized cognitive battery prior TAVI 6 month post-TAVI . Functional capacity , change neuropsychiatric symptom quality life also assess prior TAVI 6 month post-TAVI . We hypothesize change cognitive performance , functional capacity , mood outcome quality life 6 month TAVI .</detailed_description>
