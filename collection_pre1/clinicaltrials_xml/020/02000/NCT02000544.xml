	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Modular Extracorporeal Circulation Circuit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Development cardiopulmonary bypass circuit ( heart-lung machine ) consider landmark breakthrough cardiac surgery , greatly promote treatment cardiovascular disease . Since 1953 , first operation cardiopulmonary bypass perform almost 6 decade , little progress make direction improve cardiopulmonary bypass technology . However , evolution feasible . The propose research project challenge traditional belief conventional cardiopulmonary bypass consider `` state art '' technology deduct solid evidence towards extend use novel minimal extracorporeal circulation circuit , relate improved outcome multiple study . Research methodology base analyze laboratory clinical data obtain implement standard novel technology . In order provide solid evidence comparative effectiveness therapy , combine analysis clinical laboratory data data related cost quality life . Thus , assess novel technology global perspective evidence obtain would consider robust . The ultimate purpose research proposal design modular hybrid system , could easily convert form close semi-closed circuit accord indication , could expand potential minimal extracorporeal circulation could ultimately become new standard circuit perform every type cardiac surgery . The term modular refers additionally mount , clamped-off venous reservoir allows run system open circuit case anticipated volume loss ( ie bleeding , complex procedure , long bypass run ) . This measure follow proverb 'always expect unexpected ' offer clinical practitioner additional safety margin case unexpected intraoperative event . Unique design circuit would offer opportunity reduce cost , time improve clinical outcome . Preliminary design circuit , perform institution , present schematically appendix . After completion study protocol design circuit patent . Our institution already perform extensive research gain international reputation training centre minimal extracorporeal circulation . Design circuit could promote research funded medical industry . Considering number cardiac surgical procedure perform every day worldwide , evolution greatly ambitious could characterize major breakthrough field cardiac surgery open new horizon field cardiovascular research . It would also exert positive effect global healthcare affect life million people suffer cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
