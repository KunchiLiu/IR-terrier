	<brief_summary>Glucose transporter deficiency syndrome ( Glut1-DS ) form pediatric epilepsy cause genetic mutation disrupt body 's ability process food child 's diet sugar ( energy ) need support brain function . Children Glut1-DS experience seizure control anticonvulsant medication , well delay cognitive motor development . Currently , Glut1-DS treat ketogenic diet , high-fat , low-sugar diet provide brain alternate source energy . Despite significant improvement seizure upon diet , seizure control incomplete majority child , continue experience problem brain development . Our team researcher clinician expertise metabolic disease , neurology , pediatrics , biochemistry , genetics believe opportunity achieve CURE 's goal `` No Seizures/No Side Effects '' child Glut1-DS investigating use new treatment option design compensate underlie biochemical deficiency think contribute seizure impair brain development associate Glut1-DS . The propose treatment involve incorporate special type oil , call triheptanoin , ketogenic diet way make specific biochemical deficit affect kid Glut1-DS standard ketogenic diet fail address . Our goal pilot study test safety effectiveness promise new treatment option small group child Glut1-DS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Triheptanoin Patients With Glucose Transporter 1 Deficiency Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome ( Glut1-DS ) metabolic epileptic encephalopathy cause defect cerebral glucose transporter GLUT1 . It characterize infantile seizure refractory anticonvulsant , deceleration head growth , delay mental motor development . Low brain glucose subsequent energy deficiency consider major pathogenic factor cause seizure . The ketogenic diet ( KD ) causal treatment available Glut1-DS , therapeutic effect reside ability provide alternate source energy brain . However , seizure control KD complete many patient long-term cognitive outcome optimal . Biochemically , observation explain lack energy metabolic function provide pathway derive exclusively glucose , alternate energy KD fail supplement . HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize anaplerotic agent adjunct KD may effective control seizure improve cognitive outcome child Glut1-DS . Triheptanoin ( C7 ) triglyceride contain odd chain C7 ( heptanoic ) fatty acid , occurs limited amount natural diet . It improve oxidation acetyl CoA tricarbonic acid ( TCA ) cycle , lead subsequent oxidative phosporylation electron transport chain produce sufficient ATP energy utilization . It also provide TCA intermediate alpha ketoglutarate oxaloacetate , important precursor neurotransmitter glutamate , GABA , aspartate . Therefore , expect metabolic effect enhance seizure control and/or neurodevelopmental function . SPECIFIC AIMS : We aim generate preliminary evidence 1 ) safety , 2 ) clinical , 3 ) biochemical effect C7 add therapy GLUT1-DS patient inadequate response ketogenic diet . RESEARCH PLAN : To generate preliminary data well understanding precise biochemical mechanism novel treatment , conduct pilot/proof concept study use open-label n-of-1 trial 'an interrupted time-series ' design . We plan enrol 3 Glut1-DS patient incomplete seizure control , n-of-1 study design help provide distinct effectiveness estimate C7 individual patient . As participant act his/her control , design also support evidence-based , personalized medicine approach treatment . SIGNIFICANCE : If successful , personalized treatment approach may extend GLUT1-DS patient symptoms refractory KD , tolerate diet , ultimately serve model eliminate seizure side effect medically refractory epilepsy . The data generate study essential design future trial large number Glut1-DS patient create high-grade evidence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis Glut1DS mutation ( ) SLC2A1 gene . Male female age 118 year . Glut1DS currently manage ketogenic diet minimum 4 month prior baseline visit patient willing maintain diet study duration.. Inadequate response ketogenic diet define clinical 'breakthrough seizure ' , confirm EEG least 1 clinical seizure episode document seizure logbook baseline period . For participant take anticonvulsant seizure , antiseizure medication change least 4 week prior start triheptanoin treatment participant willing maintain dose medication ( ) study participation . Willing able provide write informed consent parent ( ) guardian ( ) assent participant , depend age , nature study explain , prior research relatedprocedures . Participants medium chain acylCoA dehydrogenase ( MCAD ) propionyl CoA carboxylase ( PCC ) deficiency exclude study MCAD PCC require triheptanoin metabolism . A known allergy sensitivity component triheptanoin . The participant use valproate control his/her seizure . They eligible study , take valproate within 3 week prior baseline visit willing take entire study duration . Valproate AED partially inhibit TCA cycle via alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase , administer subject take triheptanoin . Participant condition situation , investigator 's opinion , place patient significant risk adverse event , may interfere significantly participation compliance study .</criteria>
