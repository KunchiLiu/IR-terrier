	<detailed_description>Phelan-McDermid Syndrome ( PMS ) result deletion within 22q13 chromosome region . Most child specific physical morphology developmental delay many display characteristic autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) include abnormality social development . The behavioral aspect PMS parallel ASD raise particular interest SHANK3 gene , lie 22q13 region , important synaptic development , animal SHANK3 knockout model demonstrate ASD characteristic thereby confirm importance gene PMS . However , despite importance SHANK3 gene , individual PMS variation development , behavior medical characteristic fully explain SHANK3 deletion . Recently , Frye ( 2012 ) note existence 6 mitochondrial gene lie slightly proximal SHANK3 gene within 22q13 region . These include gene important electron transport change function ( SCO2 , NDUFA6 ) , mitochondrial DNA ( TYMP ) RNA ( TRMU ) metabolism , fatty acid metabolism ( CPT1B ) tricarboxylic acid cycle function ( ACO2 ) . Since Individuals PMS deletion include chromosomal deletion outside SHANK3 region , likely many , , child PMS may deletions mitochondrial gene . Many gene link mitochondrial disease , even heterozygous state . Even recognize , mitochondrial disease link homozygous abnormal state ( autosomal recessive ) , loss one gene ( heterozygous state ) could result symptomatology associate deletion mitochondrial non-mitochondrial gene . Abnormalities mitochondrial pathway result neurologic non-neurologic symptom include sometimes see child PMS . Added SHANK3 deletion , abnormalities mitochondrial gene could explain variation pattern development eventual cognitive potential . References : Frye RE .
