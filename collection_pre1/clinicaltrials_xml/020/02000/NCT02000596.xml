	<brief_title>1303GCC : Trastuzmab &amp; Pertuzumab With Hormonal Therapy Chemotherapy Women Aged 60 Over .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available standard therapy HER2 overexpressed metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) include treatment chemotherapy hormonal therapy , alone combination medication target HER2 gene , Trastuzumab Pertuzumab . This study examine effect treat HER2 overexpressed MBC combination Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab , without hormonal chemotherapy , first line treatment . If patient progress treatment , receive hormonal chemotherapy addition Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab treatment . The objective see overall response rate treatment compare first line treatment patient population .</detailed_description>
