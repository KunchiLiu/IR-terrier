	<brief_summary>This open label exploratory study investigate safety 400 milligram ( mg ) twice day ( b.i.d . ) GSK2586184 patient moderate severe , active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Study medication administer orally ( tablet ) , twice daily , 8 week ( 56 day ) . Study medication take food . Each subject 6 out-patient visit : Screening ( Day -30 -1 ) ; Baseline Start treatment ( Day 1 ) ; Week 2 ( Day 14 ) ; Week 4 ( Day 28 ) ; Week 8 ( Day 56 ) ; Follow-up ( Week 12 ; Day 84 ) . Visit windows week 2 , 4 8 + 2 day . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability GSK2586184 . The primary endpoint measure safety laboratory test ( include haematology , clinical chemistry serum creatinine ) , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , physical examination , adverse event reporting . These standard measurement evaluate safety .</brief_summary>
