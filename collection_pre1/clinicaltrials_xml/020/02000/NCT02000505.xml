	<detailed_description>Even paramedic emergency physician , resuscitation patient cardiac arrest remain challenge . Previous study show cardiac output varies widely even among professional helper . This especially due different mean frequency cardiac compression wich vary 60 160/min paramedic . Aim study investigate whether use feedback-devices cardiac-pulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) lead improvement cardiac output may improve survival . For , examine impact different feedback-methods frequence-variety manikin lay rescuer . Overall , compare three different device feedback CPR .
