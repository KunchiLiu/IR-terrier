	<detailed_description>SB-480848 ( darapladib ) novel selective orally active inhibitor lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) develop GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) treatment atherosclerosis . This open label study Subject participate 2 study session , single dose session repeat dose session . All Subjects receive 160 mg enteric coat micronised free-base darapladib single dose repeat daily dos 28 day . The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) safety single repeat oral dose darapladib healthy Chinese Subjects . The primary endpoint safety : clinical safety data spontaneous adverse event reporting , 12-lead electrocardiogram recording , vital sign measurement , nursing/physician observation clinical laboratory test . The primary PK parameter interest area plasma concentration time curve ( AUC ) maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) darapladib , secondary PK parameter interest : time occurrence Cmax ( Tmax ) apparent terminal phase half-life ( t1/2 ) darapladib well AUC , Cmax , Tmax t1/2 metabolite , SB-553253 . Finally , PD endpoint interest plasma Lp PLA2 activity , express term percent inhibition relative baseline .</detailed_description>
