	<brief_title>Influence Exercise Therapy Insulin Resistance Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background study aim During last decade , prevalence ( pre ) diabetes also chronic heart failure ( CHF ) increase dramatically . Somehow , condition link , mechanism involve completely clarify yet . It clear presence ( pre ) diabetes CHF patient affect morbidity mortality . Although feasibility , safety beneficial effect exercise train CHF generally acknowledge , effect insulin resistance well understood . Therefore , present study aim investigate effect ET insulin resistance possible link cardiac function , exercise tolerance , muscle strength body composition CHF patient . 2 . What study involve ? A randomized control study ( n=30 ) perform period 12 week . Following study inclusion , baseline measurement perform 1 week . They include : - maximal exercise test bicycle ergometer ass exercise tolerance , - two oral glucose tolerance test assess fast post-exercise insulin resistance , - venous blood sample determine HbA1c , blood lipid , BNP , - muscle strength measurement isokinetic dynamometer , - assessment body composition via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , - cardiac echography , - questionnaire ass health-related quality life , - questionnaire ( IPAQ ) pedometer ( 3 day ) assess physical activity . Following baseline measurement , subject randomize control group ( CON , n=10 ) exercise intervention group ( EX , n=20 ) , match gender reduced/preserved ejection fraction glucose tolerance . Hereafter , CON receive usual care advise maintain normal lifestyle , EX subject enrol 12-week training program . Following 6 ( MID ) 12 ( POST ) week exercise train include progressive training load adaptation , baseline measurement repeat patient . 3 . What possible benefit risk participate ? - Benefits : patient receive free training program personal professional supervision . After complete study , receive report personal result evaluation training effect . - Risks : usual risk exercise tolerance test exercise training CHF population limit training session hold supervised condition Jessa hospital training characteristic accord guideline European Society Cardiology . Exposure x-rays body composition assessment low , almost negligible .</detailed_description>
