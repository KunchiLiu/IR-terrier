	<brief_summary>The lysosome specialize part cell function degrade metabolic waste cell . Defects function lysosome result accumulation subsequent storage metabolic waste . These defect lead condition know lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) . LSDs cause inherited genetic mutation 40 genetically distinct lysosomal storage disease . Within specific lysosomal storage disease variance severity disease , age onset , clinical presentation . Though genetic mutation contribute disease largely clarify , molecular cellular mechanism contribute variation distinct LSD remain unclear . With study intend good understand cellular molecular level accumulation storage metabolic waste lysosome affect clinical manifestation LSDs , detect change mechanisms upon treatment administration , correlate result genetic information . The knowledge obtain research study could lead good way diagnose treat lysosomal storage disease .</brief_summary>
