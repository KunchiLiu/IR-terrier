Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male . One unit equivalent 8 g alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 ml ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 milliliter [ mL ] ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Subjects history cholecystectomy must exclude . History sensitivity quinolones include photosensitivity tendon rupture . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . A screening Day 1 urinalysis positive protein glucose ( great `` 1+ '' finding protein glucose ) . A serum creatinine value screen Day 1 visit increase 0.2 milligram per decilitre ( 15.25 micromole per liter ) change . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . Exclusion criterion screen baseline ECG ( single repeat allow eligibility determination ) : Heart rate &lt; 40 &gt; 100 beat per minute ; PR Interval &lt; 120 &gt; 220 millisecond ( msec ) ; QRS duration &lt; 70 &gt; 100 msec ; QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) interval &gt; 450 msec ; Evidence previous myocardial infarction ( include ST segment change associate repolarization ) ; Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , atrioventricular block [ second degree high ] , Wolf Parkinson White [ WPW ] syndrome ) , sinus pause &gt; 3 second , nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( &gt; =3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) significant arrhythmia , opinion principal investigator GSK medical monitor , interfere safety individual subject . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 millilitre ( mL ) within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .
