	<brief_summary>Genetic mutation associate cancer discover new treatment create treat people whose cancer tumor certain genetic mutation . Genetic sequence tumor do , study information send company call `` N-of-One . '' They match patient 's tumor 's genetic profile target therapy . The targeted therapy may use FDA-approved drug , off-label use FDA-approved drug , use experimental drug clinical research study open various location region . The purpose study compare length time take tumor grow people receive standard treatment metastatic cancer length time take tumor grow people receive drug specifically target cancer 's genetic mutation . Investigators kind genetic testing call `` DNA sequencing '' . Everyone take part trial genetic test do cancer tumor tissue Dartmouth . The result DNA sequence send N-of-One note . The treatment participant get depend result DNA sequence availability target therapy match genetic profile tumor identify DNA sequence . If genetic mutation identify current DNA sequencing , participant receive standard treatment metastatic cancer . If genetic mutation identify current DNA sequence drug develop mutation , participant may able receive drug . If one drug available , participant his/her oncologist decide best one participant . Because many drug may use study , investigator advise advance whether drug participant might receive approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment personalize target therapy plan base cancer genetics improve time disease progression ( TTP ) compare standard therapy . By compare A ) patient 's TTP target therapy vs. B ) TTP recent prior therapy , investigator minimize variability TTP observe across cancer subtypes , able enroll patient type solid tumor statistically unbiased manner . Based literature , investigator expect least 35 % patient treat genetically-informed targeted therapy exhibit longer progression-free interval would expect standard therapy . This `` TTP ratio '' patient calculate use formula : TTP ratio : ( TTP target therapy ) / ( TTP recent non-targeted therapy ) An individual patient 's benefit genetically-informed target therapy define TTP ratio ≥ 1.3</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic cancer progress RECIST criterion least 1 prior therapy metastatic setting . Patients must receive anticancer therapy ( i.e. , EGFR , BRAF , AR , ER Her2 target agent , chemotherapy , radiation surgery ) within last 4 week , must recover Grade 2 well treatmentrelated adverse event . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % Women lactate pregnant . If childbearing age , must negative pregnancy test within two week entry study practice effective birth control study . Patient must mentally competent provide write informed consent study participation . Tumor tissue must obtain clinically indicated biopsy surgical procedure , perform standardofcare progression disease . Patient must consent use blood , plasma , tumor tissue research purpose . Only tumor genetic information use recommend therapy study . Tumor , blood and/ plasma may retrospectively analyze research purpose . Patients must willing consent pay supply drug necessary . Cost estimate provide time consent . As per current standard care prescription drug , treat oncologist his/her staff responsible make every effort obtain reimbursement and/or find low possible cost drug minimize pocket cost . Concomitant second invasive malignancy within five year enrollment except non melanoma skin cancer . In patient prior history invasive malignancy , less five year complete remission . Evidence significant comorbidities uncontrolled diabetes , hypertension active infection would preclude treatment propose regimen . Prior treatment propose regimen . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality include limited malabsorption syndrome , major resection stomach small bowel affect absorption oral drug , active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease , history small bowel obstruction abscess fistula within 28 day prior begin study treatment . Presence uncontrolled infection . Known lesion infiltrate major vessel , risk bleed perforation , determine radiographic review . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study . Any ongoing toxicity prior anticancer therapy Grade 3 high /or progress severity . Untreated brain metastasis progress within 8week period prior enrollment .</criteria>
