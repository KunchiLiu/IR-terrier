	<brief_title>The Australian Colonic Advanced Mucosal Neoplasia Endoscopic Resection Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Australian Colonic Endoscopic Mucosal Resection study ( ACE ) , multicentre prospective observational study examine WF-EMR colonic AMN ( Ethics approval No . HREC JH/TG 2008/9/6.1 ( 2858 ) ) . This project extensive dataset 8 lead colonic endoscopic resection centre Australia 1500 lesion resect 4 year since June 2008 . The ACE study successful address several aspect resection AMN , result several high profile paper internationally recognised journal . The collection data produce robust information efficacy procedure4 , recurrence rates7 , bleed complications8 mortality compare surgery5 . Single centre analysis ACE dataset Westmead also allow insight refine procedure improve outcome . The target sign recognised indication placement clip prevent perforation9 , CO2 insufflation WF-EMR show superior air insufflation10 succinylated gelatin ( Gelofusine® ) show superior normal saline submucosal lift agent11 . There remain number unanswered question regard endoscopic resection large sessile lesion expand ACE dataset new cohort patient allow address . Enhancing prediction submucosal invasive cancer , advanced lesion classification , refinement assessment deep injury , submucosal injectate constituent , optimum electrosurgical resection method , prevention prophylaxis bleeding , subtype analysis different histological group comprise AMN examine .</detailed_description>
