	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy FURESTEM-CD Inj . Patients With Moderately Active Crohn 's Disease ( CD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease mysterious chronic inflammatory bowel disease . It usually happen young age last forever . It yet clearly know origin crohn 's disease . However , crohn 's disease therapy get develop use immunosuppressant TNF-alpha inhibitor . Nonetheless , patient still n't react TNF-alpha inhibitor effective treatment . Also , Even though patient react treatment first , effect treatment decrease time . Plus , long-term use TNF-alpha inhibitor lead complication infection occurrence malignant tumor like lymphoma . Recently , treatment intractable crohn 's disease attempt use stem cell . Especially , Mesenchymal stem cell well-known immunosuppression , anti-inflammatory ability cell differentiation ability various lineage cell non hematopoietic stromal cell . When body get infected pathogen , innate immune response operate primary defence mechanism . time , receptor react first TLR ( toll-like receptor ) NLR ( nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ) locate cytoplasm cell . It report activity TLR express Mesenchymal stem cell play important role immunomodulatory ability Mesenchymal stem cell . Furthermore , human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells ( hUCB-USCs ) manifest TLR NLR Mesenchymal Stem cell time . receptor become activation , maximize ability immunomodulatory . Therefore , hUCB-USCs utilized cure intractable autoimmune disease like Crohn 's disease . Further , It huge possibility cell therapy product autoimmune disease .</detailed_description>
