	<detailed_description>Objectives Hypotheses : Infants bear preterm low birth weight know increase risk early onset cardiovascular renal disease later life . This related low nephron mass due inadequate early termination glomerulogenesis utero perinatal period . Risks subsequent development hypertension kidney disease include excessive weight gain early life insulin resistance supplemental high calorie feeding . Specific Aims The long-term goal early diagnosis infant risk future development hypertension kidney disease investigator might intervene potentially avert progression adult disease . The objective clinical trial acquire data natural history neonatal kidney function size infant born preterm first year life . This do use standard serum urine marker well non-invasive ultrasound technology . The central hypothesis clinical trial subgroup patient born preterm demonstrate early marker kidney injury include elevate serum cystatin C , proteinuria hypertension . This hypothesis formulate basis preliminary data group study question retrospectively old child born prematurely developed overt kidney disease . The rationale propose research develop early serum demographic marker pre-clinical kidney disease early intervention may occur . The investigator expect test central hypothesis achieve objective application pursue follow 3 specific aim : 1 . Identify risk factor associate proteinuria , microalbuminuria , hypertension kidney function preterm infant . 1 . Intra-uterine perinatal factor : Based preliminary data , work hypothesis infant born preterm nephron deficit predispose hypertension subclinial clinical kidney disease lifetime may origins perinatal period . 2 . Acquired factor : The investigator postulate early perinatal stressor exposures nephrotoxic antibiotic vasoactive medication well high calorie nutritional supplement may pre-dispose renal disease vulnerable population . 3 . Ethnic difference among Caucasians , African Americans , Caribbean Blacks Hispanics . Based preliminary data , work hypothesis statistically significant difference among ethnic group . 2 . Observe natural history proteinuria , microalbuminuria , hypertension kidney function preterm infant first year life . Based preliminary data old infant child , work hypothesis degree proteinuria microalbuminuria reflection kidney injury dysfunction correlate ongoing disease progression . The investigator postulate subset patient persistent manifestation kidney disease perinatal period , especially nephrotoxic exposure high calorie nutritional supplement . 3 . Establish serum cystatin C sensitive test measure kidney function preterm infant . The investigator hypothesize cord blood early serum cystatin C predictive kidney function serum creatinine preterm infant . Study Design . This single-center case-controlled prospective observational study rationale evaluate parameter renal function include proteinuria , microalbuminuria cystatin C preterm infant associate kidney size blood pressure first 6 year life . Demographics include race , gender growth provide important perspective relative formula and/or breast feed with/without high calorie supplement first year .</detailed_description>
