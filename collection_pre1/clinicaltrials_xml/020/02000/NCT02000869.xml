	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) significant public health problem United States , particularly southern state like Louisiana . People CKD end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) poor survival compare general population , primarily due high prevalence cardiovascular disease population . Almost 50 % deaths patient CKD attributable cardiovascular disease . The prevalence cardiac arrhythmia , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , stroke peripheral arterial disease common patient CKD compare general population . The mechanism behind increased cardiovascular risk population complex strong evidence suggest change arterial stiffness play central role . It known patient CKD ESRD increase arterial aortic stiffness . Examination aorta conduit artery patient CKD reveals feature arteriosclerosis , disease arterial medial layer . Increased collagen content , collagen cross-linking , loss elastin , hyperplasia hypertrophy vascular smooth muscle cell result arterial wall hypertrophy together medial calcification promotes increase stiffness . The cause arteriosclerosis CKD include hypertension due sodium retention , oxidative stress , inflammation , production advance glycation end product , together activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sympathetic nervous system . In addition , arterial stiffness exhibit dynamic functional component . Endothelial dysfunction result high level oxidative stress uremic toxin , asymmetrical dimethyl arginine , contribute significantly increase arterial stiffness . Increased arterial stiffness cause adverse morphological change leave ventricle believe basis CHF , lethal arrhythmia , SCD thrombo-embolic stroke . Arterial stiffness measure aortic pulse wave velocity ( aPWV ) augmentation index ( AIx ) , surrogate marker cardiovascular organ damage , signiﬁcantly associate future risk clinical event . In addition , study demonstrate aPWV independent powerful predictor all-cause cardiovascular mortality patient dialysis . Reduction aPWV , mainly use ACE-inhibitor , associate improved survival dialysis patient . These finding suggest arterial stiffness merely marker arterial damage potentially reversible factor contribute mortality dialysis patient . There strong cross-sectional evidence arterial stiffness increase glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) fall . In general population , among treated hypertensive , even minimally impaired baseline renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 90μmol/l ) associate increased rate aortic stiffening . Conversely , arterial stiffness also establish number study significant risk factor CKD progression . In addition arterial stiffness , elevated central aortic blood pressure central pulse pressure show increase risk progression CKD ESRD . In patient CKD , central aortic pulse pressure also positively independently correlate increase brachial pulse pressure , old age , female sex , presence diabetes mellitus . Furthermore central blood pressure strongly related standard BP measure brachial artery ( brachial blood pressure ) concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy carotid artery hypertrophy well future cardiovascular event . Kidney transplantation prolongs survival compare dialysis , cardiovascular disease remain foremost cause death post-transplant . Although , successful kidney transplant show improve arterial stiffness post-transplant , know extent pre-transplant arterial stiffness central aortic blood pressure improvement post-transplant impact cardiovascular allograft outcome . In addition , unclear transplant relate factor associate improvement arterial stiffness central aortic blood pressure post-transplant . The goal study : 1 . To determine pre-transplant central blood pressure aortic stiffness impact post-transplant cardiovascular kidney allograft outcomes . 2 . To determine whether change central blood pressure aortic stiffness post-transplant impact cardiovascular kidney allograft outcomes . 3 . To determine factor associate improved central aortic blood pressure arterial stiffness post-transplant . Clinical significance study : Since , arterial stiffness merely marker arterial damage potentially reversible factor contribute mortality , study may provide u important insight potential factors-both reversible irreversible associate arterial stiffness central aortic blood pressure well cardiovascular morbidity mortality kidney allograft outcomes post-transplant .</detailed_description>
