	<brief_summary>The overall prevalence Ovarian Cancer United States accord US SEER Registry 182,710 woman . Ovarian cancer also high mortality rate gynecological cancer . The overall five-year survival rate 45 % Stages III IV 20-25 % . The majority age 50 year old , girl le 10 year age diagnose ovarian cancer . This risk increase age decrease number pregnancy . The prognosis many carcinomas dependent extent surgical resection . At present , ability perform complete resection negative margin limit investigator 's ability palpate visualize tumor border . In many case , radical resection necessary perform order provide assurance negative margin achieve . This approach may also increase complication rate , well short- long-term morbidity . It desirable improve visualization primary tumor occult metastasis real time , surgery . The use fluorescent probe recognize cancer-specific antigen , conjunction clinical imaging system , investigation . Ovarian cancer prototypic disease type clinical imaging system call intra-operative imaging . Except Stage IV , tumor confine pelvis abdomen typically involve extension implant onto pelvic abdominal organ membrane . Tumor debulking surgery common early disease process many tumor identify appearance feel skilled surgeon 's hand . The major problem tumor diffuse numerous , various size , often readily visible surgical field . Over 90-95 % serous ovarian cancer express folate receptor ( FR ) -alpha , make receptor ideal target mark ovarian cancer . Folate prototypic agonist FR-alpha potential us image target therapeutic strategies.Chemotherapy affect FR-alpha expression ovarian cancer specimen examine immunohistochemistry , prior treatment unlikely affect utility FR-alpha agonists image therapeutic agent .</brief_summary>
