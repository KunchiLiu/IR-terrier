	<brief_summary>Researchers Arkansas Children 's Hospital Research Institute conduct study mitochondrial function child . The study involve 2 visit Arkansas Children 's Hospital fasting blood draw behavioral assessment . ENROLLMENT IS LIMITED AT THIS TIME TO MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE AND TYPICALLY DEVELOPING POPULATIONS Patients may eligible participate age 0‐17 year And fall one follow group : - Is Typically Developing know problem OR - Has history Developmental Delay OR - Has diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder OR - Has history Mitochondrial Disease . There cost visit study‐related exam . Participants receive gift card compensation time .

	<detailed_description>Objective : The main objective proposal develop minimally-invasive biological assay widely use identify variation mitochondrial function dysfunction child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . This assay allow investigator determine true range mitochondrial function dysfunction across population child ASD . The relationship mitochondrial function dysfunction ASD , redox metabolism core ASD symptomology also investigate . To understand true variation mitochondrial function relationship cognitive development autism symptom , participant evaluate two time point understand within subject variation mitochondrial measurement . Specific Aims : 1 ) To develop minimally-invasive assay accurately identify child ASD/MD general ASD population . 2 ) To establish whether simply ASD/MD subgroup whether mitochondrial dysfunction occur spectrum mild severe ASD . 3 ) To determine relationship mitochondrial function redox metabolism child ASD . 4 ) To evaluate effect mitochondrial dysfunction glutathione redox status language social development ASD symptom . Study Design : Using Seahorse Analyzer , investigator develop profile mitochondrial function individual ASD know MD ( ASD/MD ) individual ASD know MD ( ASD/NoMD ) . These two group serve two end spectrum mitochondrial function child ASD compare profile TD child . Investigators examine profile mitochondrial function general population individual ASD determine individual fall spectrum define ASD/MD ASD/NoMD group , well DD ASD/MD . Glutathione redox metabolism measure participant . The relationship mitochondrial function , redox metabolism core ASD symptom study ASD group particular attention whether ASD symptom , language ability adaptive behavior directly relate mitochondrial function indirectly relate mitochondrial function effect redox metabolism . Study Population : Investigators recruit several group child study : 50 child ASD MD ( ASD/MD ) ; 50 child ASD MD ( ASD/NoMD ) ; 50 ASD/MD ; 50 ASD/no MD DD ; 50 TD control ; general population 150 child ASD . Children ASD without MD identify autism multispecialty clinic ( AMC ) , well ATN medical clinic evaluate child ASD outpatient clinic Arkansas . When child identify , study coordinator contact parent describe study . If parent interested , coordinator screen ask inclusion/exclusion criterion question . If child qualifies , coordinator schedule visit mail consent form parent review . During visit undergo blood draw metabolic testing . The child send breakfast since blood test require collection prior breakfast . After breakfast participant undergo language behavioral assessment parent interview Vineland questionnaire . The parent provide questionnaire teacher fill mail address , postage pay envelope . For TD participant , child recruit several way include use social medium Arkansas Children 's Hospital , flyer post community ( i.e . primary pediatric clinic ) , well referral pediatrician . When child identify , study coordinator contact parent describe study . If parent interested , coordinator screen ask inclusion/exclusion criterion question . If child qualifies , coordinator schedule visit mail consent form parent review . During visit undergo blood draw metabolic testing .</detailed_description>
