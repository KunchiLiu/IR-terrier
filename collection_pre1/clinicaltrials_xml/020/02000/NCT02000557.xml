	<brief_summary>The present day social setup considers facial charisma important physical characteristic . The facial characteristic individual measure anthropometry , photogrammetry , computer image cephalometric radiograph . Cephalometric radiograph offer significant diagnostic information regard association dental skeletal structure . By mean photogrammetric measurement , fresh diagnostic resource accessible orthodontist permit intangible , radiation free attainment measure point soft tissue instrumental expense radiation patient . Orthodontic patient range adolescent senior citizen originate assortment population , thus extensive series representative norm ideal . Knowledge normal dentofacial outline every group make certain good success treatment set best possible facial agreement . Hence , extremely important ass soft tissue profile patient one vital component orthodontic diagnosis treatment planning . The purpose present study evaluate photographic characteristic soft tissue facial profile patient class II malocclusion ethnic difference find reported literature . It hypothesize soft tissue facial characteristic lateral profile photograph lateral cephalometric radiograph sample local population class II malocclusion closely relate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photographic Analysis Soft Tissue Facial Profile Patients With Class II Malocclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal orthodontic treatment plan achieve facial synchronization esthetically please face.It common idea orthodontic treatment plan soft tissue enhancement would follow hard tissue , always happen.The reaction soft tissue hard tissue movement find consistent.With emergence new paradigm orthodontic diagnosis treatment planning , great emphasis place relationship soft tissue less emphasis treatment malocclusion . During last year , diagnosis treatment plan orthodontics reallocate direction facial planning . Formerly , lot consideration place dental skeletal component great think pay soft tissue component . The purpose treatment new paradigm place teeth optimal position reference lip , vertically well antero-posteriorly . The facial characteristic individual measure anthropometry , photogrammetry , computer image cephalometric radiograph . Cephalometric radiograph offer significant diagnostic information regard association dental skeletal structure . Lateral cephalogram report literature essential element diagnostic procedure orthodontics . Frontal lateral photograph patient correspond another frequently use diagnostic method . Linear angular soft tissue facial profile analysis photograph carry corresponding radiographic cephalometry . While take lateral cephalometric radiograph , patient expose radiation , moreover ; bony structure overlap enhances likelihood misread measure value . By mean photogrammetric measurement , fresh diagnostic resource accessible orthodontist permit intangible , radiation free attainment measure point soft tissue instrumental expense radiation patient . It also report lip-tooth relationship speech smile document mean cephalometric radiograph . Photographs face smile rest essential acquire lip-tooth relationship . By mean , orthodontist evaluate anterior tooth well adjoin soft tissue relationship . Even though cephalometry standard illustrate skeletal dental morphology might appropriate extensive epidemiologic study radiation patient expose . Edward Angle , father modern orthodontics classify malocclusion base position maxillary first molar three type ; class I neutrocclusion , class II distocclusion class III mesiocclusion . Class II malocclusion contemplate one common among forms malocclusion . It report literature class II malocclusion present assortment dental skeletal configuration . Skeletal class II pattern occur merely sagittal discrepancy well vertical discrepancy . Dental class II associate distal relationship lower teeth upper counterpart . It two subdivision , class II division 1 class II division 2 . Class II division 2 malocclusion less commonly come across compare class II division 1 . The etiology behind class II malocclusion multifactorial . An important etiological agent type malocclusion soft tissue . For instance , class II division I malocclusion commonly due result short hypotonic upper lip class II division II due result bimaxillary retroclination cause active muscular lip . Prevalence different occlusion vary population diverse origin comparable case class II malocclusion . It report international literature class II malocclusion prevalent form malocclusion compare class I class III malocclusion . The purpose present study evaluate photographic characteristic soft tissue facial profile patient class II malocclusion . The current study also plan observe compare result photographic cephalometric variable . Soft tissue profile analysis class II patient would assist u plan orthodontic treatment individual . This would serve purpose establish diagnostic value would aid orthodontist future plan treatment plan class II patient . Planning soft tissue analysis photograph would also save patient excessive radiographic exposure would help good planning soft tissue .</detailed_description>
