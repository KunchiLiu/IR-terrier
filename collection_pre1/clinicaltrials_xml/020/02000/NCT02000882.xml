	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , single-arm study determine safety efficacy BKM120 plus capecitabine breast cancer patient brain metastasis . 40 patient include , either ER+/HER2- , HER2+ triple negative breast cancer.. The Graded Prognostic Assessment ( GPA ) recently develop , validate prognostic score patient brain metastasis . The Graded Prognostic Assessment utilized evaluate efficacy clinical study . Capecitabine prodrug enzymatically convert 5-fluorouracil tumor target inhibits DNA synthesis slow tumor growth . It currently FDA approve colorectal breast cancer . BMK120 pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor develop IND # 102,823 Novartis Corporation . As September 2012 600 patient enrol fourteen separate Novartis sponsor monotherapy combination therapy clinical study BMK120 . Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) signal regulates diverse cellular function include cell proliferation , survival , translational regulation protein synthesis , glucose metabolism , cell migration , angiogenesis . PI3K signal also serve central role pathogenesis numerous cancer . Constitutive activation PI3K signal know critical step mediate transform potential oncogene tumor suppressor many tumor type . Resistance variety therapeutic intervention , include hormonal therapy , anti-HER2 therapy chemotherapy also link constitutive activation PI3K pathway . Preliminary data suggest activation PI3K pathway predictor poor prognostic outcome many cancer type . Thus , pan-PI3K inhibitor , BMK120 may provide therapeutic benefit patient MBC . Both capecitabine BMK120 previously show activity patient MBC . Like capecitabine , BMK120 also effective cross blood brain barrier making preferred candidate evaluation patient MBC . Trastuzumab monoclonal antibody target HER2 receptor overexpressed amplified approximately 20-25 % breast cancer . The clinical benefit trastuzumab woman metastatic breast cancer demonstrate two pivotal study . Current clinical experience BMK120 show frequent adverse event ( AEs ) include fatigue , decreased appetite , diarrhea , hyperglycemia , nausea , rash mood alteration disorder . Therefore patient closely monitor fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) HbA1c , insulin C-peptide . Patients also frequently routinely evaluate mood disorder disturbance . The remain frequent AEs detect regular , frequent monitoring symptomatic treatment provide require .</detailed_description>
