	<brief_summary>The aim Phase I/IIa study identify safe tolerable dosage regimen intravenously administer otelixizumab . In addition , C-peptide decline new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus ( NOT1DM ) patient possible immunological mechanism investigate view identify trend early immunological biomarkers could predict response halting/slowing Beta-cell destruction patient population . This exploratory study explore safety tolerability well tolerate non-efficacious cumulative dose 3.1 mg cumulative dose 48 mg efficacy base C-peptide analysis demonstrate , albeit evidence Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) reactivation Cytokine Release Syndrome ( CRS ) . Exploration tolerability dose response consider necessary first step determine therapeutic index otelixizumab .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female age 16 27 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . NOTE : Subjects age 16 17 year must Tanner Stage &gt; = 2 . All subject must weigh least 31 kg . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( DM ) accord Amerrican Diabetes Association ( ADA ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria consistent Type 1a ( autoimmune ) Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) , interval approximately 28 day ( 32 day ) initial diagnosis first dose study drug ) . Written documentation diagnosis DM , include date diagnosis , must obtain diagnose physician . Currently require insulin treatment T1DM receive intensive insulin therapy least 7 day prior screen . Positive least one autoantibody associate T1DM : antibody glutamic acid decarboxylase ( anti GAD ) , antibody protein tyrosine phosphataselike protein ( anti IA 2 ) , antibody isletcell antigen ( ICA ) ZnT8 Autoantibody . Evidence residual functioning Betacells measure mixed meal stimulate C peptide peak level &gt; = 0.2 nanomole/litre ( nmol/L ) . A female subject eligible participate negative pregnancy test determine urine hCG test screen prior dose agrees use one contraception method list study protocol . Female subject must agree use contraception 2 week prior dose 60 day last dose study drug samesex partner ( refrain heterosexual intercourse ) , preferred usual lifestyle . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list study protocol . This criterion must follow 2 week prior dose 60 day last dose study drug . Willing follow procedure outline protocol . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2xupper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 percent ) . Subjects eligible enrolment study must meet following criterion : QTc &lt; 450msec QTc &lt; 480msec patient bundle branch block . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord either Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , another method , machine manual overread . For subject eligibility withdrawal , QTcF use . For purpose data analysis , QTcF use primary . The QTc base single average QTc value triplicate electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain brief recording period . Screening total lymphocyte count within normal range two separate sample take least three day apart ( eg screen Day 1 ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . In case minor ( 18 year ) write informed consent must also obtain parent Legally Acceptable Representative ( LAR ) . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen core antibody positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) 1 and/or 2 antibody . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new investigational drug within 12 month prior first dose day . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 milliliter ( mL ) within 3 month period . Lactating female . Subject mentally legally incapacitate . History thrombocytopenia . The subject receive immunizationion vaccine within 4 week first dose study drug require vaccine within 30 day last dose study drug The subject significant systemic infection 6 week first dose study drug ( e.g. , infection require hospitalization , major surgery , intravenous ( i.v . ) antibiotic resolve ; infection , e.g. , bronchitis , sinusitis , localize cellulitis , candidiasis , urinary tract infection , must assess casebycase basis investigator regard whether serious enough warrant exclusion ) . Current prior malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patient undergone splenectomy Radiological evidence active tuberculosis ( TB ) . Significant and/or active disease body system likely increase risk subject interfere subject 's participation completion study . Examples significant disease include , limited , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , renal failure , emphysema , history bleed peptic ulcer , history seizure ( ) , addiction illicit drug , alcohol abuse . Clinically significant ( base Investigator 's discretion consultation Medical Monitor second opinion require ) abnormal laboratory value Screening period , due T1DM . A clinically significant abnormal value result exclusion , upon test , abnormality resolve becomes clinically insignificant . Positive EBV capsid Ab IgM absence positive EBV EBNA Ab IgG EBV viral load &gt; 10,000 copy per 10^6 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) determine quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) negative EBV . A positive result ImmunoAssay test syphilis ; , result Immunoassay test positive , confirmatory test perform . Have use atypical antipsychotic drug ( e.g. , risperidone , quetiapine , clozapine ) within 30 day sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Have previously receive otelixizumab anti cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 monoclonal antibody , e.g . muromonab , teplizumab , willing refrain use antibody plan duration study participation ( 2 year last dose study drug ) . Previous current exposure biologic celldepleting therapy ( e.g . antiCD11a , antiCD22 , antiCD20 , anti B lymphocyte stimulator/ Bcell activate factor ( BLyS/BAFF ) , antiCD3 , antiCD5 , antiCD52 ) include investigational agent , plan use antibody plan duration study participation ( 2 year last dose study drug ) . Predisposition thromboembolic disease , thromboembolic event ( exclude superficial ) past 12 month . Is currently receive corticoid treatment receive systemic corticoid treatment within month screening , History Graves disease Prior allergic reaction , include anaphylaxis , human , humanise , chimeric , rodent antibody . Have undergone major surgical procedure within 30 day first dose study drug , and/or plan undergo surgery within 3 month last dose study drug . Any condition situation , investigator 's judgment , likely cause subject unable unwilling participate study procedure complete schedule assessment .</criteria>
