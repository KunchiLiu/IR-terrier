	<brief_title>Portico Re-sheathable Transcatheter Aortic Valve System US IDE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PORTICO trial include approximately 758 randomized subject 70 investigational site . The study power analyze high risk cohort extreme risk cohort together commercially available control primary safety effectiveness endpoint . In addition , data cohort analyze separately subgroup analysis . A minimum two ( 2 ) three ( 3 ) roll-in patient per primary implanting physician allow . These roll-in subject add Roll-in Registry . In addition , 100 subject may enrol Valve-in-Valve registry . Implanting physician prior Portico experience minimum 3 implant last 6 month require include roll-in patient . Registry data include randomized cohort analysis , analyze present separately . The sponsor submit final clinical report combine risk cohort enrollment follow-up complete accord protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : High Risk Cohort : All candidate High Risk Cohort study must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Subjects must comorbidities surgeon cardiologist CoInvestigators concur predict risk operative mortality ≥15 % minimum STS score 8 % . A candidate meet STS score criterion ≥ 8 % include study peer review least two surgeon conclude document patient 's predict risk operative mortality ≥15 % . The surgeon 's assessment operative comorbidities capture STS score must document study case report form well patient medical record . 2 . Subject 21 year age old time consent . 3 . Subject senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis echocardiographically derive criterion : mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg jet velocity great 4.0 m/s Doppler Velocity Index &lt; 0.25 initial aortic valve area ( AVA ) ≤ 1.0 cm2 ( indexed EOA ≤ 0.6 cm2/m2 ) . ( Qualifying AVA baseline measurement must within 60 day prior informed consent ) . 4 . Subject symptomatic aortic stenosis demonstrate NYHA Functional Classification II , III , IV . 5 . The subject inform nature study , agree provision provide write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) respective clinical site . 6 . The subject treating physician agree subject return require postprocedure followup visit . 7 . Subject 's aortic annulus 1927mm diameter measure CT conduct within 12 month prior inform consent . Note : CT contraindicate and/or possible obtain certain subject , 3D echo noncontrast CT chest abdomen/pelvis may accept approve subject selection committee . Extreme Risk Cohort : All candidate Extreme Risk Cohort study must meet # 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 criterion , 1 . The subject , formal consults cardiologist two cardiovascular surgeon agree medical factor preclude operation , base conclusion probability death serious , irreversible morbidity exceed probability meaningful improvement . Specifically , probability death serious , irreversible morbidity exceed 50 % . The surgeon ' consult note shall specify medical anatomic factor lead conclusion include printout calculation STS score additionally identify risk patient . All Candidates : Additionally , candidate study must meet follow inclusion criterion TAVR Leaflet Motion Substudy , minimum substudy sample size achieve : 1 . Be willing able undergo , 30days 6months postimplant , MultiSlice Computed Tomography ( MSCT ) scan ( TEE , medically technically contraindicate MSCT ) heart cardiac structure . High Extreme Risk Cohort : Candidates exclude study follow condition present : 1 . Evidence acute myocardial infarction ( define : ST Segment Elevation evidence 12 Lead ECG ) within 30 day prior index procedure . 2 . Aortic valve congenital unicuspid congenital bicuspid valve , noncalcified verified echocardiography . 3 . Mixed aortic valve disease ( aortic stenosis aortic regurgitation predominant aortic regurgitation 34+ ) . 4 . Any percutaneous coronary peripheral interventional procedure perform within 30 day prior index procedure . 5 . Preexisting prosthetic heart valve implant valve position , prosthetic ring , severe circumferential mitral annular calcification ( MAC ) continuous calcium LVOT , severe ( great 3+ ) mitral insufficiency , severe mitral stenosis pulmonary compromise . Subjects preexist surgical bioprosthetic aortic heart valve consider ValveinValve registry . 6 . Blood dyscrasia define : leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 3000 mm3 ) , acute anemia ( Hb &lt; 9 mg/dL ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm³ ) . 7 . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy . 8 . Cardiogenic shock manifest low cardiac output , vasopressor dependence , mechanical hemodynamic support . 9 . Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease require revascularization . 10 . Hemodynamic instability require inotropic support mechanical heart assistance . 11 . Need emergency surgery reason . 12 . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without obstruction ( HOCM ) . 13 . Severe ventricular dysfunction LVEF &lt; 20 % measure rest echocardiogram . 14 .
