	<brief_summary>Investigating receptor involve nutient sense enteroendocrine cell nerve ending , give knowledge kind nutrient responsible secretion gut hormone involve satiety signal . So far little know distribution potential nutient sense receptor along gastrointestinal tract . The investigator interested intestinal part highly secrete CCK GLP-1 . By compare tissue , expect elucidate receptor important satiety signal intestine . Having information give rise reseach receptor stimulate secretion gut hormone . Moreover , know receptor involve satiety signal , give oppertunity target receptor increase satiety influence food intake . The investigator aim investigate distribution mention receptor , follow referred 'nutrient sense receptor ' , suggest involved satiety signalling , throughout intestinal tract . For receptor gene expression , localisation protein expression determine different location . This measure intestinal mucosal biopsy two location duodenum , terminal ileum , ascend colon , transverse colon descend colon .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion duodenal biopsy : Step 1 ( patient ask participation ) : 1 . Patients ( male female 18 65 year ) refer upper GI endoscopy ( functional complaint ) 2 . Based medical history previous examination , objection arises take extra biopsy gastroduodenoscopy . Step 2 ( patient agree participate biopsy take ) 1 ) Patients relevant endoscopic abnormality ( gastroduodenoscopy ) : patient without gastric duodenal ulcers/polyps/lesions suspect malignancy esophageal lesion varix . Inclusion criterion ileal colon biopsy : Step 1 ( patient ask participation ) : Patients ( male female 18 65 year ) refer colonoscopy ( screen colorectal cancer follow colonic polyp ) Based medical history previous examination , objection arises take extra biopsy colonoscopy Step 2 ( patient agree participate biopsy take ) Patients relevant endoscopic abnormality ( colonoscopy ) : patient without ileal and/or colonic ulcers/polyps/diverticula lesion suspect malignancy Ileum reach colonoscopy Exclusion criterion duodenal ileal colon biopsy : 1 . History severe cardiovascular , gastrointestinal/ hepatic , hematological/immunologic , metabolic/nutritional disease and/or laboratory assessment might limit participation study . The severity disease ( major interference execution experiment potential influence study outcome ) decide principal investigator . 2 . Use medication , could interfere normal coagulation ( anticoagulant , antiplatelet drug ) . 3 . Major abdominal surgery interfere gastrointestinal function ( uncomplicated appendectomy , cholecystectomy hysterectomy allow , surgery upon judgement principle investigator ) 4 . Excessive alcohol consumption ( &gt; 20 alcoholic consumption per week )</criteria>
