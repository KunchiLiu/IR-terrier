	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether measure change thickness retinal nerve fibre layer ( photosensitive layer back eye ) could predict someone would develop Alzheimer 's disease future . The measurement make OCT ( ocular coherence tomography ) , noninvasive relatively inexpensive test use light wave scan back eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness - Biomarker Early Detection Alzheimer 's Disease ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) degenerative neurological disorder characterize insidious onset progressive decline cognitive function . It common form dementia affect estimate 26 million people worldwide 2006 , number expect quadruple 2050 due anticipate increase life expectancy . Difficulty remember name recent event often early clinical symptom apathy depression . Later symptom include impaired judgment , disorientation , confusion , behavior change difficulty swallow walk . New criterion guideline diagnose Alzheimer 's publish 2011 recommend consider disease begin well development symptom . Brain change individual Alzheimer 's thought begin 10 year symptoms memory loss occur - asymptomatic preclinical phase AD . Researchers believe treatment slow stop progression Alzheimer 's preserve brain function effective administer early course disease . The pursuit biomarkers detect asymptomatic preclinical AD current issue potential biomarkers : brain volume , level glucose metabolism brain , level beta-amyloid tau CSF , detection apoptosing retinal cell ( DARC ) , investigate . In study would like propose measurement retinal nerve fiber layer thickness potential key biomarker detection asymptomatic preclinical Alzheimer 's Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . The eye consider window brain retina exist extension CNS . Changes occur retina visualized non-invasively directly increasingly sophisticated image technique . It possible detect change single neuron eye . Historically visual symptom report AD patient attribute neuronal damage visual pathway brain rather retina . However increase evidence show specific pathological finding brain occur retina also . The ocular manifestation AD first document Cogan 1985 , document deficit visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , colour vision motion perception . In recent study use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , peripapillary thin retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) demonstrate , occur initially superiorly cause inferior visual field loss . The use OCT non-invasive optical imaging technique become accept method assess thickness RNFL due reproducibility accuracy . Blanks et al . provide ultrastructural study show retinal ganglion cell degeneration post mortem retinas patient AD . He demonstrate AD extensive neuronal loss see throughout retina pronounce superior inferior quadrant loss central retina , great decrease neuron temporal foveal region . Results study C. Paquet , M.Boissonnot et al demonstrate abnormal RNFL thickness patient amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MMSE score 25 , subjective memory complaint ) , suggest involvement retina early event development Alzheimer 's . MCI generally define problem memory , language another essential cognitive ability severe enough show cognitive test interfere daily life . Studies show 10 -20 % people age 65 old MCI . 15 % individual MCI progress dementia year . No significant difference find RNFL thickness observe MCI patient mild AD patient . In light finding propose measurement RNFL could use enable early MCI diagnosis patient suffer subtle memory disturbance biomarker detect asymptomatic pre-clinical Alzheimer 's disease . In light finding study proposes take investigation one step see patient suffer subjective memory loss normal cognitive test abnormal RNFL test .</detailed_description>
