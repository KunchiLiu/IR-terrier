	<brief_summary>Ablation cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI ) right atrium currently therapy choice treatment typical atrial flutter ( 3,4 ) . It curative approach high success rate ( 5 ) . It recognize patient typical atrial flutter often complain atrial fibrillation ( 1,2 ) . Current clinical experimental study confirm close relationship atrial flutter ( AFL ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) raise question , arrhythmias different form common electrical phenomenon atrial fibrillation underlie clinical problem ( 6 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy Atrial Flutter Afib Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current clinical experimental study confirm close relationship atrial flutter ( AFlut ) atrial fibrillation ( Afib ) . After initiation Afib may organize special intrinsic condition due antiarrhythmic medication AFlut Afib may suppose underlie arrhythmia . Therefore successful ablation AFlut reentrant circuit longer possible Afib persists . After new occurrence Afib long diagnostic therapeutic marathon begin AF ablation end therapeutic effort . This double burden patient health system probably avoid directly effectively treat underlie arrhythmia AF .</detailed_description>
