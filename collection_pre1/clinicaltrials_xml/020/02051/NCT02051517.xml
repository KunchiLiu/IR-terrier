Sample human vitreous patient undergo vitrectomy surgery compare result metabolic chemistry panel subject . Allow research team extract .2ml sample .5ml - 1.0ml vitreous normally extract routine undiluted vitreous biopsy , standard procedure perform various indication .

	<detailed_description>The propose method obtain antemortem vitreous sample otherwise schedule vitrectomy surgery perform medically necessary indication . Virectomy surgery commonly perform eye surgery vitreous humor remove eye . Three port create sclera access eye . One port light provide illumination visualization , one port vitrector , simultaneously aspirate vitreous cut intrinsic fiber , one port infusion line keep eye inflated saline vitreous humor remove . typically aspiration perform automatically vitrectomy machine . For undiluted vitreous biopsy , standard procedure perform various indication , technique must slightly modify . In particular , infusion line turn initially avoid dilute specimen saline fluid . The vitrector aspiration line connect syringe instead vitrectomy machine , syringe use manually provide aspiration collect undiluted specimen . As soon adequate volume collect , infusion line turn aspiration line reconnected vitrectomy machine . Volumes 0.5 1.0 ml routinely collect technique . Subjects enrol adult patient already undergoing vitrectomy surgery various retinal condition . Only one eye per subject enrol enrollment target first year 50 subject . Specimens would obtain subject 's otherwise plan vitrectomy . The vitrectomy would start usual way , except standard modification would make undiluted vitreous biopsy discuss . A 0.2 mL sample would obtain vitreous biopsy . This small sample hospital laboratory analyze small typically obtain undiluted vitreous biopsy .</detailed_description>
