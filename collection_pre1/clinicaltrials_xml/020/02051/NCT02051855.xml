	<brief_summary>Circulatory failure affect 50 % premature infant admit neonatal intensive care . This heart muscle develop enough send blood vital organ brain . This lead severe short term problem kidney failure contribute poor long term development cerebral palsy . In addition baby bear early may need time adapt circulation relies placenta womb one self sufficient . Doctors need able accurately measure blood supply infant . However agreement best . This make decision treat infant difficult . Doctors may use drug dopamine dobutamine help baby circulation . However drug test properly baby older 33 week gestation . This study propose observe way baby older 33 week circulatory problem treat first three day life . In addition study look two new measurement baby blood supply see good measure infant need treatment . This involve ultrasound scan heart measurement child 's oxygen level probe place hand leg . The study also look drug dobutamine process baby . This do two small extra blood test . The aim study help clinician refine identification treatment circulatory failure premature baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NeoAdapt 2 : An Observational Study Investigating Novel Biomarkers Evaluation Treatment Neonatal Circulatory Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research show large difference doctor treat circulatory failure . This agree definition condition . By investigate new method assess baby circulatory status intend help create new definition circulatory failure turn help doctor create study identify infant circulatory failure find best way treat condition baby . So far research area confine baby bear less 33 week gestation . We intend extend knowledge area infant older 33 week gestation . Dobutamine drug license use premature infant . In future new drug need study child license give . In addition European Community encourage research undertaken look use old drug use baby . As mentioned previously little data show dobutamine handle baby study contribute new information drug give baby safely . This pilot observational study infant older 33 week gestational age . The population observe diagnostic measure use trigger treatment circulatory failure . Treatment decision make accord preference responsible doctor . The treatment decision document research team effect treatment diagnostic measure record . There additional sub study involve infant receive dobutamine . This study look baby handle drug . WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS Infants receive care infant admit neonatal intensive care unit . If attend medical team decide infant suffer circulatory failure receive treatment way baby involve study would . This may involve give fluid vein , use drug dobutamine . All infant admit neonatal intensive care unit standard test observation infant would . For baby include study first three day live included infant two specific measurement day . These know : - 1 . Superior vena cava flow assessment- This involve measure blood flow one large vein connect baby ' heart use ultrasound machine . It painless procedure well tolerated infant . 2 . Pleth variability index- This involve place small probe baby 's hand foot measure oxygen level . This do time superior vena cava flow assessment perform . Again painless procedure well tolerated infant . The study also record important relevant outcome routine test perform infant admit neonatal unit : 1 . Brain ultrasound appearance stay unit . 2 . Monitoring clinical parameter , observation laboratory test . 3 . Major clinical diagnosis . If infant receives dobutamine two small blood sample take investigate drug process baby . This do via method minimise pain distress infant involve study . This observational pilot cohort study aim improve definition circulatory failure neonates document current treatment strategy haemodynamic insufficiency transitional circulation infant great 33 week gestational age admit neonatal unit ( NICU ) intensive care . Inclusion criteria 1 . Neonates &gt; 33 week gestational age admit neonatal intensive care unit 2 . Postnatal age &lt; 72 hour ; 3 . Parental inform consent ; This population observe regard diagnostic measure lead treatment decision effect decision various diagnostic measure . Decision-making treatment base clinical guideline operation Trevor Mann Bay Unit clinician preference . The assessment SVC flow PVI do every 24 hour first 72 hour life baby . Primary Outcome Measure Values SVCF PVI neonates age old 33 week gestational age receive intensive care derive Echo-D plethysmographic study . Observed Clinical Outcome Measures Cranial US appearances The analysis find cranial ultrasound scan interpret light baseline scan , perform soon possible birth enrolment , avoid ascribe effect antenatal insult postnatal event . Treatments Circulatory Failure Infants receive treatment accord preference responsible physician . As common practice , dobutamine , dopamine and/or treatment ( include cardiovascular drug and/or volume replacement therapy normal saline ) administer . Dose administration The dose administration dobutamine discretion responsible physician . We envisage dobutamine typically start 2.5 5 mcg/kg/min increase step 5 mcg/kg/min maximum 20 mcg/kg/min give time frequency response see . Any change treatment strategy document responsible physician . Criteria Up-Titration Medication Dose escalation guide clinical judgment . Clinicians ask record criterion use order make decision . Criteria Down-Titration Dose reduction guide clinical judgment . Clinicians ask record criterion use order make decision . Further treatment If response dobutamine 20 mcgg/k/min clinical response consider attend physician inadequate , treatment discretion attend physician ask record reason change treatment strategy well additional treatment give patient . Concomitant therapy There per-protocol concomitant medication treatment . Accordingly , important co-interventions follow specific centre protocol record case record form . PHARMACOKINETICS ( PK ) SUB-STUDY Aim PK sub-studies The aim sub-study give preliminary information order try construct population PK model . Given uncertainty regard PK dobutamine infant receive intensive care shall assess elimination half life . This defined amount time quantity concentration fall half . Half-life sub-study We perform preliminary study infant include NeoAdapt 2 receive dobutamine treatment haemodynamic insufficiency . Two blood sample , 400 Î¼l , obtain patient . The first sample drawn end infusion , time dobutamine cease reach systemic circulation neonate , define time end ( te ) . The second sample take different study time point end infusion : 5 min te 15 min te 45 min te 2 hour te 6 hour te Two infant allocate time point . Sampling time assign randomly patient . Plasma sample send laboratory quantification dobutamine .</detailed_description>
