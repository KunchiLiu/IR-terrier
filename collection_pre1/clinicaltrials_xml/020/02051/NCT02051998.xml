	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause irreversible blindness industrial country . In late stage disease , neovascular change development geographic atrophy ( GA ) may induce severe visual loss . GA characterize development area outer retinal atrophy continuous spread time correspond visual field defect patient . The pathogenesis still incompletely understood . Despite break-through treatment neovascular AMD intravitreally administrate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor , yet treatment available slow halt disease process GA. We others demonstrate total GA area progression show large difference patient . Potential factor influence differential progression intensely study : While neither systemic genetic factor show influence GA progression , ocular characteristic GA baseline size phenotypic feature fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) abnormalities identify risk characteristic increase GA progression . While previous study mainly focus characterization total GA area progression , topographic directional spread analyze relevant predictive marker yet unknown . There may large difference local GA progression . The primary objective study identify specific characteristic , local GA progression . The knowledge risk factor may help good understand pathogenesis GA . The identification predictive marker allow well prognostic assessment individual disease process . The DSGA study extension trial FAM ( Fundus Autofluorescence Age-related Macular Degeneration ) study ( NCT00393692 ) .</brief_summary>
