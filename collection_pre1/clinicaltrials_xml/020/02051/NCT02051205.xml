	<brief_title>Parkinson 's Disease Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among degenerative neurological disease , PD second common disorder . Although wide range incidence prevalence rate exist review literature due consequence variation study methodology , crude prevalence rate 60 year-old 1 % . Increase age population lead increase PD patient . The PDR use facilitate understanding basic epidemiological feature disease , genetic non-genetic risk factor , co-morbidity , up-to-date treatment strategy related economic burden medical surgical treatment ( deep brain stimulation ) , develop new therapeutic protocol well healthcare policy , ultimately , improve quality life PD patient . PDR also serve data bank investigator field PD quickly identify notify research subject research study eligible . Patient register also sign consent future brain donation pass away . Methods : The 4 main Tzu Chi Hospitals Hualien , Da Lin , Taichung , Taipei serve representative pilot study National registry . This record-based , multi-center , nation-wide , cohort study . A user-friendly , yet , encrypt registration platform provide internet authorized personnel . The content PDR follow : demographic feature , risk factor , clinical profile diagnostic criterion , co-morbidity , image profile , treatment regimen detail , prognosis , health-related quality life , neuropsychological assessment battery . Expected result : 1 . To facilitate understanding demographic epidemiological feature PD . 2 . To find risk factor PD possible intervention toward disease prevention Taiwan . 3 . To find comorbidity disease , solution toward good treatment related outcome . 4 . Assess current treatment approach develop best-practice guideline . 5 . Tracking health-related quality life PD patient well care-givers economic impact different treatment regimens best medication versus surgical intervention ( neuromodulation / neuro-regeneration ) time time . 6 . Drive development innovative research project . 7 . Accelerate process inform patient research project may eligible .
