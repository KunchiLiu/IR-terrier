	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure require endotracheal intubation occur many 40 % critically ill patient . Procedural complication include fail attempt intubation , esophageal intubation , arterial oxygen desaturation , aspiration , hypotension , cardiac arrest , death common setting . While many important component successful airway management critical illness , maintenance adequate arterial hemoglobin saturation procedure initiation endotracheal tube placement paramount desaturation common factor associate peri-intubation cardiac arrest death . Interventions either shorten duration time require tube placement prolong period desaturation may effective improve outcome . The high rate complication lack exist evidence regard efficacy current airway management technique shorten time airway establishment prolonging time desaturation mandate investigation . The primary hypothesis video laryngoscopy superior direct laryngoscopy successful first attempt endotracheal intubation ( define confirm placement endotracheal tube trachea first laryngoscopy attempt ) medical ICU patient Pulmonary/Critical Care Medicine fellows control operator 's past number procedure equipment use . Also , investigator hypothesize provision apneic oxygenation endotracheal intubation procedure ( define nasal cannula 15 liter per minute oxygen flow place prior sedation neuromuscular blockade maintain completion procedure ) result high arterial oxygen saturation nadir ( define lowest noninvasive oxygenation saturation value observe administration sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade 2 minute successfully secure airway death ) compare apneic oxygenation .</brief_summary>
