	<brief_summary>1 1000 baby bear suffer lack oxygen . This know hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) . Infants condition suffer multiple organ problem . In particular affect heart pump blood around body thus leading poor blood supply part body brain . This known circulatory failure contribute poor long term outcomes cerebral palsy . To try prevent brain damage infant treat total body cooling , however treatment effect baby pump blood around body , also drug may use condition process . In order ass treat condition doctor need able accurately measure blood supply infant . However agreement best . This make decision treat infant difficult . Sometimes doctor may want use drug dobutamine adrenaline drug unlicensed baby . This study propose observe way baby circulatory problem treat baby HIE first four day life . In addition study look two new measurement baby blood supply see good measure infant need treatment . This involve ultrasound scan heart measurement baby 's oxygen level probe place hand . The study also look drug dobutamine process baby . This do two small extra blood test . The aim study help clinician refine identification treatment circulatory failure baby HIE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NeoAdapt 3 : Novel Biomarkers Evaluation Neonatal Circulatory Insufficiency Babies Suffering From Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current definition neonatal shock/circulatory failure outdated , inaccurate appropriate apply infant suffer hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy purpose research look old 33 week gestational age order fill knowledge gap help development new definition neonatal circulatory failure . The main research question : - 1 . To investigate new non-invasive method assess infant circulatory status infant suffer HIE . 2 . To gain initial data dobutamine process baby use circulatory failure . 3 . To observe physician decide treat circulatory failure infant suffer HIE . Research show 14 fold difference doctor assess treat circulatory failure . In infant suffer hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy complicate fact treatment total body cool interfere body pump blood around body . This complicated fact agree definition circulatory failure infant . By investigate new method assess baby circulatory status intend help create new definition circulatory failure turn help doctor create study identify infant circulatory failure find best way treat condition baby . So far research area concentrate baby bear less 33 week gestation . We extend knowledge area infant older 36 week gestation suffer hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy . Dobutamine drug license use infant . In future new drug need study child license give . In addition European Community encourage research undertaken look use old drug use baby . As mentioned previously little data show dobutamine handle baby contribute new information drug give safely . This observational pilot study , gain novel value SVC flow pleth value infant HIE treat total body cool . In addition population observe regard diagnostic measure lead treatment decision , especially regard haemodynamic stability , effect decision various diagnostic measure . Decision-making treatment base clinical guideline Trevor Mann Baby Unit clinician preference . The assessment SVC flow PVI do every 24 hour whist infant receive total body cool re-warming phase treatment . Primary Outcome Measure Values SVCF PVI neonates HIE admit total body cool derive Echo-D plethysmographic study . Observed Clinical Outcome Measures - MRI appearances - Cranial US appearance - CFM appearances The MRI report score accord system describe Rutherford et al aid predict long term outcome . This perform within first two week post-total body cool treatment keep national local guidance . The analysis find cranial ultrasound scan interpret light baseline scan , perform soon possible birth enrolment , avoid ascribe effect antenatal insult postnatal event . Those treat HIE total body cool additional daily neurological assessment cool re-warming phase treatment grade accord criterion set Sarnat et al . This routine treatment population infant . CFM recording make cool treatment phase infant . This standard observation child HIE associate long term outcomes infant . For purpose study CFM use discretion attend medical team . The analysis CFM follow use Toby Trial describe detail elsewhere . Treatments Circulatory Failure Infants receive treatment accord preference responsible physician . As common practice , dobutamine , dopamine and/or treatment ( include cardiovascular drug and/or volume replacement therapy normal saline ) administer . Dose administration The dose administration dobutamine discretion responsible physician . We envisage dobutamine typically start 2.5 5 mcg/kg/min increase step 5 mcg/kg/min maximum 20 mcg/kg/min give time frequency response see . Any change treatment strategy document responsible physician . Criteria Up-Titration Medication Dose escalation guide clinical judgment . Clinicians ask record criterion use order make decision . Criteria Down-Titration Dose reduction guide clinical judgment . Clinicians ask record criterion use order make decision . Further treatment If response dobutamine 20 mcgg/k/min clinical response consider attend physician inadequate , treatment discretion attend physician ask record reason change treatment strategy well additional treatment give patient . Concomitant therapy There per-protocol concomitant medication treatment . Accordingly , important co-interventions follow specific centre protocol record case record form . PHARMACOKINETICS ( PK ) SUB-STUDY Aim PK sub-studies The aim sub-study give preliminary information order try construct population PK model . Given uncertainty regard PK dobutamine infant receive total body cool shall assess elimination half life . This defined amount time quantity concentration fall half . Half-life sub-study We perform preliminary study infant include NeoAdapt 3 receive dobutamine treatment haemodynamic insufficiency . Two blood sample , 400 Î¼l , obtain patient . The first sample drawn end infusion , time dobutamine cease reach systemic circulation neonate , define time end ( te ) . The second sample take different study time point end infusion : - 5 min te - 15 min te - 45 min te - 2 hour te - 6 hour te Two infant allocate time point . Sampling time assign randomly patient . Plasma sample send laboratory quantification dobutamine .</detailed_description>
