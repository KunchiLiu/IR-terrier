	<brief_summary>Helicobator pylorus ( H. pylorus ) bacteria survive line stomach . An estimated 50 % world 's population infect H. pylorus . Developing economy , Southeast Asia , Indian subcontinent Latin America , prevalence rate high 90 % . H. pylori infection often go undiagnosed , many sufferer experience adverse symptom . Infection H. pylorus describe `` disease condition affect relative risk develop various clinical disorder upper gastrointestinal tract . ' Clinically relevant symptom could include peptic ulcer , melena secondary condition iron deficiency anemia vitamin B12 deficiency . There evidence probiotic beneficial gastrointestinal disease . Pylopass contain probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri , select anti-H. pylorus characteristic clinical trial show result reduction urease breath test value subject H. pylorus . The objective study evaluate ability Pylopass reduce H. pylorus load subject H. pylori positive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Helicobator pylorus ( H. pylorus ) gram negative , spiral shape bacteria colonize gastric mucosa . An estimated 50 percent world 's population infect H. pylorus . H. pylori infection necessarily result clinically relevant symptom . Ching Wong report case H. pylori asymptomatic . Moreover , Kusters et al state infection H. pylori `` disease condition affect relative risk develop various clinical disorder upper gastrointestinal tract '' ( Kusters , 2006 ) . Clinically relevant symptom could include peptic ulcer , melena secondary condition iron deficiency anemia vitamin B12 deficiency . The recent iteration Maastricht/Florence Consensus report outline diagnostic guideline treatment strategy H. pylorus ( Malfertheiner 2012 ) . Individuals certain risk factor , family history gastric cancer , bleed ulcer secondary disease iron deficiency anemia undergo eradication therapy . For functional dyspepsia , test treat strategy recommend . However , remain lack option volunteer either asymptomatic experience mild gastrointestinal symptom indicate eradication therapy undergo test treat strategy . There evidence probiotic beneficial gastrointestinal disease . A review Ritchie Romanuk succinctly summarize point write `` probiotic generally beneficial treatment prevention gastrointestinal disease '' ( Ritchie 2012 ) . In context H. pylorus infection , probiotic administer alongside conventional eradication treatment regimens lessen severity side effect improve tolerance . Francavilla et al studied impact Lactobacillus reuteri H. pylorus load level , measure urea breath test ( UBT ) value . The researcher find significant reduction H. pylorus load evidence significantly decrease UBT value . They also find decrease symptom score measure Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) ( Francavilla 2008 ) . Imase et al also study impact Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation H. pylorus infect individual find suppressive effect L. reuteri tablet UBT value ( Imase 2007 ) . These study indicate Lactobacillus reuteri exerts effect H. pylorus lower load . There many potential mechanism probiotic strain , Lactobacillus reuteri , could exert suppressive effect H. pylorus . One potential method stabilize strengthen gut mucosal barrier . Other mechanisms include sequestration H. pylorus , production antimicrobial substance competitive binding receptor gut ( Garcia , 2009 ; Lesbros-Pantoflickova , 2007 ) . The Pylopass strain Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) identify detailed , multi-year screening process . It select anti-H. pylorus characteristic culture collection 8,000 different food grade strain . The original commensal environment Pylopass strain L. reuteri human . L. reuteri consider one autochthonous lactobacillus human animal know scientific community . It isolate gastrointestinal tract human , pig , cattle dog ( Casas 2000 ) . It also isolate variety different food , milk product ferment rice noodle . Pylopass comprise Lactobacillus reuteri cell , suspend matrix spray dry . As , Lactobacillus reuteri cell metabolically inactive . However , vitro human study , show exert H. pylorus load lower effect . In vitro work find Pylopass specifically coaggregates H. pylorus acidic condition . Two human pilot study show oral administration Pylopass lead reduction UBT value volunteer H. pylorus ( Mehling 2013 ) . As cell Lactobacillus reuteri Pylopass need metabolically active exert benefical effect , provide tremendous advantage develop economy , many case antibiotic resistant H. pylorus . The advantage Pylopass Lactobacillus product product stability , specificity H. pylori stability gastric condition . As previously mention , high prevalence H. pylori develop economy , access adequate cold chain may reliable . As Pylopass comprise inactivated cell withstand environmental fluctuation , appropriate shipment require temperature control . Secondly , probiotic cater general gut health , Pylopass specifically bind H. pylorus acidic condition . Thirdly , mechanism action dependent binding site survival gastric environment . Probiotics beneficial may replace harmful bacteria gastrointestinal tract . However , uncertain whether living strain withstand acidic environment stomach . This concern challenge Pylopass coaggregation depend bind surface structure Pylopass H. pylorus . As advantage Pylopass traditional probiotic strain , goal study confirm result first two human trial hold true . Given challenge rise rate antibiotic resistance , delivery product relevant useful develop economy , development product withstand environmental fluctuation lack option H. pylori positive individual indicate eradication therapy , development Pylopass could important tool address challenge . To end , goal study assess impact four week supplementation period Pylopass marker Helicobacter pylori load volunteer meet full criterion eradication therapy outline Maastricht Florence Consensus report . The primary outcome study urease breath test ( UBT ) , widely validate non-invasive measure H. pylorus status . However , also recognize limitation use urease breath test . The primary limitation UBT serve proxy measure Helicobacter pylorus load level provide direct assessment health gastric mucosa H. pylorus load . By include subset volunteer gastric biopsy , degree inflammation directly assess H pylori load quantify . By perform biopsy two time point , supplementation active ingredient , effect supplement health gastric mucosa assess . Due small subset volunteer , information qualitative nature , provide scientific basis assess participant future study . As antibiotic resistance rise case Helicobacter pylorus , important continuously develop new adjunctive solution may help improve health gastric mucosa , best way ass directly use gastric biopsy .</detailed_description>
