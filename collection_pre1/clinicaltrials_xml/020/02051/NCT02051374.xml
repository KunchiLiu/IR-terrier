	<brief_summary>Lumbar Degenerative Spondylolisthesis ( LDS ) slippage one vertebra another cause degeneration facet joint , ligament intervertebral disc . Most patient suffer symptom related spinal stenosis , radiate pain low extremity , typically increase pain lower limb walk upright decrease bend forward . There moderate grade evidence whether patient achieve good outcome surgery decompression follow fusion . In theory , fusion follow decompression give stability operate level , thus less pain less progression olisthesis . On hand , fusion procedure , general , associate severe complication postoperative mortality decompression alone . In summary , still insufficient evidence perform fusion addition decompression patient LDS . The investigator plan trial main aim detect whether intervention-related difference outcome decompression alone ( DA ) decompression follow fusion instrumentation ( DF ) large enough justify use fusion procedure . The propose trial randomize , control , multicentre , non- inferiority trial two parallel group , 15 participate Norwegian hospital . The main analysis perform 2 year surgery long-term follow-up plan 5 10 year postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The aim study compare efficacy two principally different surgical method treat LDS investigate whether predictor associate intervention-related difference outcome two group . Methods : The Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) use primary outcome measure . Depending whether participant obtain substantial amount ODI- improvement operation 24 month operation , dichotomized success group ( patient successful outcome ) non-success group . The cutoff value successful outcome plan estimate data patient register Norwegian registry Spine Surgery ( NORspine ) solely operated LDS . If value NORSpine- data obtain , 12.8 use threshold . 12.8 point Copay et al find statistically clinically appropriate value minimal clinically important improvement ODI . The primary question whether proportion patient successful outcome DA group markedly less DF group , 24 month operation . Investigators predefined margin `` markedly less '' δ = 0.15 ( 15 % ) consistent between- group difference Blumenthal et al used power analysis similar Food Drug Administration- regulate non- inferiority RCT . With margin necessary treat 6.7 patient fusion addition decompression order obtain one patient successful outcome . The null hypothesis proportion patient successful outcome DF group ( nDF ) high proportion DA group ( nDA ) amount least 0.15 ( δ ) : H0 : nDF &gt; = nDA + δ H0 test form 95 % CI difference proportion H0 reject upper limit confidence interval ( CI ) less 0.15 . By reject H0 , alternative hypothesis accept : H1 : nDF &lt; nDA + δ By accept H1 , conclusion DA non-inferior DF hence good DF . In addition main analysis investigate whether follow predictor associate difference outcome measure 24 month operation : 1 . Treatment group 2 . Patient age 3 . Gender 4 . Comorbidity ( ASA group ) 5 . Body Mass Index 6 . Smoking 7 . Preoperative ODI score 8 . Preoperative NRS back pain 9 . Preoperative NRS leg pain 10 . The magnitude olistheses local kyphosis measure stand x-rays 11 . Segmental instability verify flexion/extension x-rays 12 . Presence foraminal stenosis 13 . Orientation facet joint level olisthesis 14 . Degree disc degeneration level olisthesis 15 . Disc height level olisthesis This publish separate article . Sample size : The sample size calculation base hypothesis 2-year result DA group least good DF group compare proportion responder group . The sample size compute use Blackwelder methodology . Based data Norwegian Spine Register , proportion responder whole treatment group expect 0.70 . Choosing type 1 error = 0.05 , power = 0.80 δ = 0.15 give sample size 116 . Considering assumption add 10 % possible dropout , total 128 patient require group . Statistical analysis : To determine whether randomization successful descriptive statistic use compare baseline characteristic group . Differences effect measure primary outcome ( proportion patient successful outcome ) , include Newcombe hybrid score confidence interval , estimate . It use mixed model analysis evaluate primary secondary outcome , evaluate effect efficacy variable time group ( follow-up measurement inclusion two year follow-up include ) . In mixed model patient exclude analysis efficacy variable variable missing , , time point baseline . If data one efficacy variable miss point baseline , multiple imputation perform data 10 % patient miss , otherwise complete case analyse do . A significance level 5 % use throughout . The statistical analysis do accord intention treat principle ( ITT ) . A sensitivity analysis conduct patient cross one treatment another receive last score crossover . To recommend DA , ITT sensitivity analysis require show non- inferiority . The analysis conduct independent statistician blind treatment . Interim analysis stop rule : When 75 patient group complete 12 month follow- , investigator interim analysis . Due ethical consideration inclusion patient terminate analysis reveals one following : 1 . The proportion patient successful outcome DF group high DA group amount 0.20 . 2 . The proportion patient need reoperation due condition operate level ( ) statistically significant high one group . The report trial base adapt Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) checklist report non- inferiority trial .</detailed_description>
