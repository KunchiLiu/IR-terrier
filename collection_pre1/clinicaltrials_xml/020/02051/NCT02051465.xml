	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer account 142,570 new cancer case 51,370 cancer death USA 2010 worldwide become third common cancer second lead cause cancer relate death . Colonic adenomatous polyp know precursor colorectal cancer endoscopic removal polyps prevents development colon cancer . Removal large polyp require special endoscopic techniques-endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , technically difficult perform , labor intensive , time consume carry high risk complication ( bleed , perforation , etc. ) . The purpose study determine effectiveness safety LumenR Retractor perform EMR ESD . It hypothesize use modify colonic overtube simplify colonoscopic removal difficult polyp , decrease time need complete procedure decrease rate complication post endoscopic removal large flat colonic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient present endoscopic removal difficult colonic polyp eligible study base inclusion exclusion criterion . All procedure explain Investigator subject undergo treatment review sign study Informed Consent prior procedure . Each subject randomly assign two group , Group 1 Group 2 , accord assignment , LumenR Retractor use procedure . Patient preparation , include intravenous sedation , Groups . Group 1 : A traditional pediatric colonoscope advance colon endoscopic removal polyp perform . Group 2 : A traditional pediatric colonoscope modify overtube preloaded endoscope advance colon . After polyp reach , overtube advance forward expand around polyp . Endoscopic removal polyp use commercially available graspers biopsy forceps insert overtube work channel perform . At conclusion procedure , size polyp , total procedure time , amount CO2 use colonic insufflation , amount fluid use submucosal injection , complication , include bleed perforation , record . At end procedure , necessary , result mucosal defect lesion removal close endoscopic clip endoscopic suture device . After completion procedure , subject recover accord standard recovery room protocol discharge home admit hospital necessary . Subjects follow 24 hour , 10 day post treatment complication post endoscopic removal polyp record . At 3 month post treatment , subject repeat colonoscopy evaluate post polypectomy site remove residual polypoid tissue find .</detailed_description>
