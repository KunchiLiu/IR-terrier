	<brief_title>Roflumilast Donepezil Reverse Scopolamine Induced Cognitive Deficits Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call roflumilast . Roflumilast test potential treatment Alzheimer 's disease . This study look roflumilast combined medication call donepezil , ability reverse mimic Alzheimer 's disease symptom bring administration drug call scopolamine . The study enroll 28 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one four treatment groupsâ€”which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) . All participant receive follow treatment vary time point throughout study : - Roflumilast Dose A tablets - Donepezil 10 mg capsule - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet capsule look like study drug active ingredient - Scopolamine 0.5 mg subcutaneous injection . All participant ask take 2 tablet 1 capsule receive scopolamine subcutaneous injection first day 4 separate study period . Participants assess scopolamine affect mental process whether study drug improve . This single-center trial conduct England . The overall time participate study 95 day . Participants make 7 visit clinic , include 4 separate period 2 day confinement clinic , follow-up assessment 14 day last treatment period .</detailed_description>
