	<brief_summary>In preterm infant , endotracheal mechanical ventilation well know cause various form lung injury include volutrauma , barotrauma oxytrauma - collectively know ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . As , move towards non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) recent decade . However , many infant place NIV mode fail require intubation . A relatively recent mode NIV non-invasive high frequency ventilation ( NIHFV ) . Studies modality scarce , suggest neonate ventilate effectively . However , efficacy comparison exist mode NIV remain unknown due lack appropriate study . The investigator hypothesize NIHFV superior NIV mode Biphasic Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( BP-NCPAP ) preterm infant prevent intubation follow NCPAP failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intubation mechanical ventilation long mainstay manage infant respiratory disease neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . However , recent decade , use endotracheal mechanical ventilation ( EMV ) implicate major cause ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) .Prolonged endotracheal intubation neonate link morbidity include bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , nosocomial pneumonia , air leak syndrome subglottic stenosis . Moreover , BPD link impaired neurodevelopmental outcome . There conscious effort amongst neonatologists reduce duration EMV minimize undesirable side effect . Non-invasive ventilatory support increasingly used effect recent year . Various form NIV include NCPAP , BP-NCPAP nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) become part ventilatory management neonate NICUs across globe . Originally describe early 1970s,9 use NCPAP see renew interest since 1990s significance VILI become apparent . In retrospective study , NCPAP show reduce rate bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . A recent multi-center prospective randomize control trial infant 25 28 week gestation show infant treat early NCPAP require few day ventilation reduce oxygen dependency 28 day ( although 36 week correct GA ) . A subsequent analysis patient show improved lung mechanic gas exchange . However NCPAP use without risk . Air leak syndrome , diminish cardiac output , gaseous distention nasal injury/excoriations well described complication use . Despite drawback , NCPAP remain efficacious modality help reduce endotracheal intubation limit VILI . Although successful reduce reliance EMV , also well know 43-80 % neonate moderate severe respiratory disease treat NCPAP fail require intubation . BiPhasic NCPAP NIPPV use increase frequency NICUs recent year help prevent re-intubation , limited evidence guiding use . BiPhasic-NCPAP , describe late 1980s form augment ventilation , provide two level non-invasive pressure support , typically cycle 20-30 time per minute upper level support usually last one second . As NCPAP , patient breathes around two level pressure provide . However , currently evidence suggest use BP-NCPAP offer advantage NCPAP . In recent randomize control prospective study investigator centre compare BP-NCPAP ( N=69 ) NCPAP ( N=67 ) , former show superior latter facilitate sustain extubation infant &lt; 1,250 gram ( 67 % vs. 58 % , P = 0.27 ) . Nevertheless , presume BP-NCPAP offer benefit NCPAP , remain use rescue mode NIV across many NICUs NCPAP failure . NIPPV yet another NIV mode , offer combination NCPAP superimpose ventilator provide peak inspiratory pressure ( PIP ) via non-invasive interface , design mimic augment spontaneous breathe neonate EMV . The PIP provide synchronized non-synchronized patient breath . However potential significant inaccuracy synchronization process . Furthermore , Infant Star ventilator Graseby capsule , one prototype ventilator capable provide synchronized NIPPV , longer available . Despite limitation , NIPPV remain use non-synchronized synchronize forms.8 At time , best investigator knowledge , study compare BP-NCPAP NIPPV directly . In fact , recently complete NIPPV trial Kirpalani et al BP-NCPAP NIPPV include arm , fail show reduction incidence BPD compare NCPAP arm . Based study conduct far firm consensus best non-invasive mode use modality choice remain individual decision depend preference experience specific unit . Noninvasive high frequency ventilation alternative relatively new mode NIV explore 4 clinical study far ( appendix A ) . In study 21 preterm term infant , patient switch NCPAP NIHFV promote carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) elimination continue mean 35 ( 2-144 ) hour . The author report partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) decrease use modality 8.3 7.2 kilo pascal ( KPa ) . The major limitation study include heterogeneity patient population , etiologies primary lung disease , small sample size lack control group . In recent study Colaizy et al , NIHFV use 14 subject period 2 hour trend towards decrease PaCO2 level note use modality . Limitations study include short duration NIHFV , small sample size lack control group . The randomized trial evaluate modality include 40 term infant clinically diagnose transient tachypnea newborn ( TTN ) conclude use NIHFV lead quick recovery TTN compare use CPAP . However assessment recovery subjective , study unblinded could ride bias . As well , many patient may require form NIV first place . Lastly study Czernik et al evaluate group 20 neonate high risk post-extubation failure prophylactically place NIHFV . Fourteen infant successfully wean NCPAP , control group compare result . None four trial report adverse effect relate use NIHFV , although power evaluate outcome . At two investigator centre ( Mount Sinai Hospital Hospital Sick Children ) NIHFV use rescue mode recent month NCPAP and/or BP-NCPAP fail . In review conduct [ unpublished time ] half instance use ( 21 total case ) due increase spell ( apnea , bradycardia and/or desaturations ) . In six hour precede six hour initiation NIHFV , number spell reduce average 5.2 ( ±3.5 ) 1.5 ( ±1.3 ) . The majority patient try NIHFV remain extubated , less third eventually require re-intubation . As yet , report harm directly link use NIHFV . Despite limited evidence , NIHFV hold promise alternate mode NIV . It may superior NCPAP/BP-NCPAP respect PaCO2 clearance lung also advantage require breath-synchronization , issue hinder widespread use NIPPV . However , definitive assessment efficacy NIHFV require prospective , randomize control trial . The goal study compare rate intubation use BP-NCPAP vs. NIHFV rescue mode NIV post NCPAP failure infant &lt; 1,250 gram .</detailed_description>
