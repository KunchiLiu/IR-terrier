	<brief_title>Pretreatment MRI Predicting Outcome After Radio-frequency Ablation HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent pathological , immunohistochemical molecular profile progressively reveal complex classification primary liver cancer result subclassification roughly separate mucinous cholangiocarcinomas mixed tumor `` pure '' hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . In addition , HCC classify keratin ( K ) 19 positive K19 negative . K19 biliary/hepatic progenitor cell ( HPC ) marker express subset HCC poor prognosis high risk early recurrence treatment ; particularly radio-frequency ablation ( RFA ) . These patient consequently show bad survival compare patient K19 negative HCC . A recent publication show value pretreatment biopsy K19 stain suggests role routine biopsy potentially curable HCC reconsider . However , currently , pretreatment biopsy rarely perform diagnosis HCC due excellent performance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detection , diagnosis stag cirrhotic liver . This progression MRI base technical refine three-phase contrast-enhanced imaging , development cellular marker sequence diffusion-weighted MRI ( DWI ) hepatospecific biliary contrast-agents . While pretreatment biopsy would incremental value treatment planning , routine application daily clinical practice face multiple problem . First , K19 evaluation histopathology - case - reliably perform whole resection specimen difficult biopsy . Second , routine biopsy would lead dramatic increase workload radiologists pathologist influence daily practice organization . Also , lesion always readily detectable ultrasound possibly eligible percutaneous biopsy require laparoscopy guide biopsy anesthesia . Third , risk tract seed remain controversial completely exclude . Previous publication indicate image pattern may associate bad prognostic tumoral parameter . The corona sign see CT arterial portography hepatic arteriography ( invasive imaging perform Japan ) associate presence microvascular invasion . However , sign yet describe MRI . Also MRI derive parameter may predict presence HCC express progenitor cell marker , include K19 . If MRI determine image parameter could indeed provide surrogate marker presence K19 and/or microvascular invasion potential important prognostic factor RFA HCC , image parameter may thus hold prognostic information towards RFA treatment possibly predict treatment outcome . The hypothesis lesion show feature correlate K19 positivity persistent ( rim ) enhancement rim like intensity DWI may correlate bad prognosis HCC n't express image feature . If confirm , MRI may first line modality adapt patient management ; either select patient actually would benefit biopsy identify patient invasive treatment necessary ( instance : surgical resection instead RFA child A patient ; ablation wider margin patient eligible surgery ) . However , perform prospective interventional study , experience need gain various possible imaging pattern , aim find significant correlation image parameter adverse prognosis . The purpose retrospective study thus evaluate MRI determine image parameter pretreatment MRI predictive value towards outcome ( disease free survival ) radio-frequency ablation hepatocellular carcinoma . If successful , pretreatment MRI parameter may use select patient high risk unfavorable outcome RFA select patient aggressive treatment surgical resection upfront transplantation .</detailed_description>
