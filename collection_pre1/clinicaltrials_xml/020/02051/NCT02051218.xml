	<brief_title>Prevention Symptomatic Skeletal Events With Denosumab Administered Every 4 Weeks Versus Every 12 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Denosumab , monoclonal antibody RANK-Ligand show superior zoledronic acid delay time first on-study skeletal related event ( SRE ) patient solid tumor , effect disease progression survival . Many SREs silent compression fracture find schedule imaging . The approved dose denosumab 120 mg s.c. every 4 week ( q4w ) . Although generally well tolerate , time-dependent increase osteonecrosis jaw 8 % patient . Cases fatal hypocalcaemia observe post marketing surveillance . The optimal dose schedule denosumab unknown . Denosumab associate considerable cost may add toxicity ; thus study de-escalation warrant . The aim trial test hypothesis benefit Denosumab maintain administer 120 mg q12w compare 120 mg q4w . The primary endpoint open-label randomized phase III non-inferiority trial time first on-trial symptomatic skeletal event ( SSE : i.e . clinically significant pathological fracture , radiation therapy bone , surgery bone spinal cord compression ) . With non-inferiority margin 1.2 hazard ratio , power 80 % type I error 5 % , total sample size 1380 . Secondary endpoint safety , time subsequent on-trial SSE , quality life , health economic outcome , change bone turnover marker . This study open international collaboration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient give write informed consent . Histologically confirm diagnosis breast prostate cancer randomization . Patient metastatic breast cancer ( stage IV , subtypes allow ) prostate cancer ( stage IV ) bone metastasis plan receive receiving antineoplastic treatment . Patients prostate cancer must evidence disease progression continuous androgen deprivation therapy ( CRPC ) . Patients must ≥ 3 bone metastasis ( lytic blastic mixed ) . The lesion must document radiological evaluation within 12 week randomization ( XRay , CT scan , PETCT , MRI scan bone scintigraphy ) . WHO performance status 02 Age ≥ 18 year . Corrected serum calcium ≥ 2 mmol/l ≤ 3 mmol/l ( medical treatment obtain serum calcium level normal range allow , far denosumab use . Maximally 1 dose bisphosphonates case hypercalcemia allow , bisphosphonate apply least 3 week first dose denosumab ) . Liver transaminases 1.5 x ULN 3 x ULN liver metastasis . Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( ≤ 2.0 x ULN case know Gilbert 's disease ) Women breastfeed . Women childbearing potential use effective contraception , pregnant agree become pregnant participation trial 12 month thereafter . A negative pregnancy test inclusion ( within 7 day ) trial require woman childbearing potential . Men agree father child participation trial 12 month thereafter . Definite contraindication denosumab ( e.g . hypocalcaemia [ Albumincorrected serum calcium &lt; 2.0 mmol/l ] ) . History current evidence osteonecrosis jaw . Nonhealed mucosa oral cavity ( surgery side effect treatment ) . Jaw dental condition require oral surgery surgery invasive dental procedure plan . Prior use denosumab bone metastasis ( dose 120 mg every 4 week ) bisphosphonates treat bone metastasis . Patients treat denosumab bisphosphonates osteopenia osteoporosis allow enter trial last dose 28 day randomization . Patients know osteoporosis ( Tscore ≤ 2.5 ) study entry ( since fracture osteoporosis difficult discriminated fracture bone metastasis ) . Radiotherapy surgery bone within last two week randomization plan within 6 week randomization . Presence history CNS metastases leptomeningeal disease . A MRI evaluation within 12 week randomization must perform case suspicious symptom . Psychiatric disorder preclude understanding information trial related topic , give informed consent , fill QoL form . Concurrent treatment clinical trial SSE SRE primary endpoint . Known hypersensitivity trial drug hypersensitivity component trial drug ( e.g . fructose ) . Any concomitant drug contraindicate use trial drug accord approve product information . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance trial protocol .</criteria>
