	<brief_summary>Freezing gait ( FOG ) disable episodic gait disturbance common among patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The symptom PD generally show asymmetric onset progression . In particular , impairment rhythmicity , symmetry , bilateral coordination report associated FOG episode . As maintenance gait depend precise alternate movement leg , irregularity rhythm , symmetry , bilateral coordination may impair gait sequence , potentially cause freeze . Results recent study strongly suggest bilateral uncoordinated gait mark gait asymmetry associate FOG . Moreover , recently hypothesize may lead degree asymmetric motor function , FOG parkinsonian patient trigger breakdown bilateral co-ordination underlie normal timing gait . Aim study evaluate modulation asymmetry physical therapy might improve gait FOG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient be'blind ' study protocol randomly assign one three study arm : 1 ) physiotherapy aim potentiate affect body side ( bad side improvement , WSI ) ; 2 ) physiotherapy aim potentiate less affected body side ( best side improvement , BSI ) ; 3 ) physiotherapy aim potentiate side equally ( standard treatment , ST ) . Each group undergo physiotherapy twice week three month . Each session duration one hour include first part warming , final part cool ( two part group ) active part ( different group group ) . The active part include exercise alike group number repetition different group group accord aim potentiating affected side ( WSI ) least affected side ( BSI ) side equally ( case number repetition side ; ST ) . Medical treatment keep stable study duration ; medication express levodopa daily dose equivalent ( LEDD ) .</detailed_description>
