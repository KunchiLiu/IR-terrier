	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) lead cause maternal morbidity mortality worldwide cause commonly poor uterine muscle tone delivery . The first line agent use prevention treatment PPH oxytocin , act bind oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) find myometrial cell cause uterine contraction . Women require augmentation labour oxytocin inadequate labour progression increase risk PPH receive intravenous oxytocin expose uterus ( OTR ) dose great would normally find without medical intervention . This exposure result OTR desensitization decrease uterine sensitivity oxytocin may lead use much high dos oxytocin ( 9x ) agent prevent treat PPH potential cause serious drug-related morbidity fatality mother . Currently , woman fail labour augmentation need Cesarean delivery , know would beneficial wait certain period time discontinue intravenous oxytocin proceeding operation . The goal wait time would allow OTRs recover resensitize uterus effect oxytocin avoid need high dos additional uterus-contracting agent . Our hypothesis positive correlation magnitude recovery myometrium 's response oxytocin time elapse desensitize oxytocin pretreatment ( simulated labour augmentation ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator previously establish vitro model labour augmentation myometrial desensitization use pregnant human myometrium isometric tension record device . The investigator propose use model order characterize time course recovery oxytocin-desensitized myometrium oxytocin sensitivity . These result help establish whether myometrial recovery occur within clinically relevant time period , much sensitivity recover , duration require . In clinical setting fail labour augmentation OTR desensitization , know beneficial wait certain period time discontinue intravenous oxytocin proceed Cesarean section allow resensitization myometrium oxytocin . The result study provide insight time course recovery myometrium use vitro model fail labour augmentation . Based oxytocin dose-response curve variable period time `` rest '' , investigator able determine degree recovery myometrial contractility time whether occur clinically relevant time period implementation clinical practice .</detailed_description>
