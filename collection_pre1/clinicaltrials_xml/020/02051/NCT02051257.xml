	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study high possible dose memory enrich T cell give follow standard stem cell transplant unmanageable side effect see patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma return previous treatment . A T cell type immune cell recognize kill abnormal cell body . Memory enrich T cell make patient 's T cell genetically modify laboratory . This mean T cell change insert additional piece deoxyribonucleic acid ( genetic material ) cell make recognize kill lymphoma cell . Memory enrich T cell may kill cell kill stem cell transplant may lower chance cancer recur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memory Enriched T Cells Following Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Recurrent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cellular immunotherapy product , cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19R ( EQ ) 28 zeta/truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFRt ) + central memory T cell ( Tcm ) ( Arm 1 ) CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ naive memory T cell ( TN/MEM ) ( Arm 2 ) , conjunction standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient high-risk intermediate high grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tempo , magnitude , duration engraftment transfer T cell product relate number cell infuse . II . To study impact therapeutic intervention development normal CD19+ B-cell precursor bone marrow surrogate vivo effector function transfer autologous CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ Tcm TN/MEM . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM 1 : Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing TCM-enriched T cell intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 2 3 follow HSCT . ARM 2 : Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing TN/MEM-enriched T cell IV 10 minute day 2 3 follow HSCT . Patients experience disease progression experience serious treatment-related toxicity great equal 100 day post T cell infusion allow receive optional second T cell infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 18-24 hour , 18-72 hour , weekly 1 month , monthly 1 year , 18 , 24 , 36 month , annually thereafter minimum 15 year .</detailed_description>
