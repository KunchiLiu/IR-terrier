	<brief_summary>This study investigate use tranexamic acid ( TXA ) patient pelvis and/or hip socket fracture require surgery . TXA FDA-approved patient hemophilia short-term use reduce hemorrhage need replacement blood tooth extraction . However , also use extensively severely injured patient major trauma elective hip knee replacement . Previous study indicate TXA may reduce blood loss need blood transfusion safe use patient . TXA fairly inexpensive easy obtain . The purpose study determine TXA make surgery patient pelvis and/or hip socket fracture safer cost efficient .</brief_summary>
