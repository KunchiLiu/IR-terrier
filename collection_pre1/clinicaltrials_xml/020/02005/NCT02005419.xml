	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer represent lethal common malignancy 5-year survival rate le 5 % . For patient eligible potentially curative resection , despite mortality morbidity rate surgery improve , recurrence rate 85 % within 2 year . Data clinical trial indicate adjuvant chemotherapy enhance 5-year survival ~25 % patient undergone surgery remove tumor ; gemcitabine standard regimen chemotherapy . Metformin first-line treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Literatures report metformin might inhibit tumor growth block enzyme need cell growth . Some retrospective study reveal diabetic patient take metformin less likely develop pancreatic cancer . Additionally , pancreatic cancer patient treat metformin show good survival without metformin . In study , researcher intend investigate activity safety combination gemcitabine metformin treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
