	<brief_title>Increasing Implementation Evidence-based Interventions Low-wage Worksites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer chronic disease lead killer disablers United States , low-income Americans high risk disease . Multiple evidence-based intervention ( EBIs ) exist improve chronic disease risk behavior , cancer screening , healthy eating , physical activity , tobacco cessation , yet EBI reach community setting poor . Among community setting reach low-income adult , worksites stand low-income adult employ , worksite implementation health-promoting EBIs low . Half American worker work small low-wage worksites , implementation EBIs readiness implement especially low . Even though decision-makers worksites often motivate promote worker health , usually dedicate wellness staff face three major barrier implement EBIs : 1 ) lack awareness potential benefit EBIs , 2 ) lack knowledge choose EBIs , 3 ) lack financial personnel resource implement EBIs . Non-profit organization others would assist worksites face barrier . Organizational readiness implement EBIs well understood , validate measure available , especially worksites . Without reliable valid measure worksite readiness , would assist difficulty : ) identify worksites ready , b ) help decision-makers get ready increase odds implementation success . The propose research address set barrier contribute dissemination implementation research test efficacy worksite EBI dissemination program , HealthLinks , develop partnership American Cancer Society , non-profit organization operate nationwide . HealthLinks base Greenhalgh 's diffusion innovation framework Rogers ' diffusion innovation theory address small low-wage worksites ' barrier provide free on-site information recommendation EBIs provide free on-site program temporary staff assist implementation . We test HealthLinks via 3-arm randomized control trial . Worksites receive either 1 ) HealthLinks , 2 ) enhance version HealthLinks address small worksites ' lack personnel add worker wellness committee , 3 ) serve delay control group receive HealthLinks study end . We measure worksites ' EBI implementation baseline , 12 month ( end intervention period ) , 24 month ( assess maintenance one year intervention end ) . This design test effectiveness HealthLinks worker wellness committee . We also measure effect worker ' health behavior baseline , 12 month , 24 month . Finally , develop , pilot-test , validate measure worksite readiness implement EBIs .</detailed_description>
