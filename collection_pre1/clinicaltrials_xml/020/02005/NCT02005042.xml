To knowledge study use objective ambulatory assessment data deliver EMI . This preliminary work demonstrate feasibility , test preliminary efficacy , use Bluetooth accelerometer provide real-time feedback smartphone increase objectively measured step ( i.e. , increase activity ) . A within-person design use , include assessment , intervention , follow-up phase . During assessment phase objective physical activity ( use accelerometer ) collect . In intervention phase participant also receive real-time feedback throughout day regard total step personalize step goal . Objectively measured step disease status measure use evaluate efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lack physical activity associate negative health outcome , include obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease . A myriad intervention aim increase daily physical activity ( PA ) exist . Increasing PA level show improve health among patient cardiovascular metabolic disease . Accelerometers pedometer useful tool intervention , particularly use provide participant individualized feedback progress toward PA goal . These program typically require participant set PA goal ( e.g. , number steps/day ) , wear pedometer , record daily activity level pedometer . This process rely heavily accurate self-reported information time- effort-intensive participant , thus limit acceptability longer-term viability intervention option . There increase trend health behavior research use mobile device , smartphones provide intervention . These method - know Ecological Momentary Interventions [ EMI ] - innovative allow researcher clinician offer information people specific time setting may need support . One way EMI tailor participant complete repeat self-report assessment mobile device smartphones ( know Ecological Momentary Assessment [ EMA ] ) , use material identify time people need intervention . Although study ( include recent study conduct member research team ) develop intervention use EMA create real-time intervention deliver daily life , knowledge study use objective ambulatory assessment data . Using objective data potentially advantageous utilizes passive data collection ( require little input participant ) , thus reduce participant burden potential concern regard accuracy self-reported data . The first aim study establish feasibility acceptability integrate Bluetooth-enabled activity monitor smartphones provide real-time feedback regard physical activity everyday life . We evaluate feasibility acceptability intervention method track intervention delivery participant compliance EMA . This information automatically record smartphone activity monitor . The second aim work provide preliminary evaluation efficacy deliver real-time feedback base objectively measure PA. Our primary outcome number objectively measured step . It expect participant increase baseline number step receive personalize feedback reminder smartphones .</detailed_description>
