Investigation : Extended oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , follow isoglycaemic intravenous glucose infusion ( IGII ) concurrent measurement plasma-glucose , -insulin , -C-peptide , -glucagon , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) fix time-points .</detailed_description>
