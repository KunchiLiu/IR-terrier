	<brief_summary>Cognitive dysfunction frequent patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) date , available treatment improve cognition patient population . Some evidence animal study small clinical trial suggest aerobic exercise might beneficially affect cognitive function MS . The aim randomized-controlled trial explore aerobic exercise training program enhance cognition MS . In addition , employ neuroimaging marker determine exercise alters measure brain structure function . Patients randomly assign either 3-months exercise program ( bicycle ergometry , 2-3 session per week ) waitlist control group . The primary endpoint study test verbal learn memory . Secondary endpoint include neuroimaging marker functional structural connectivity brain . We hypothesize exercise improve verbal learn memory beneficially affect measure brain connectivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cognitive dysfunction frequent patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) date , available treatment improve cognition patient population . Some evidence animal study small clinical trial suggest aerobic exercise might beneficially affect cognitive function MS . Aims : This study aim explore potential aerobic exercise program brain structure function MS single-blind , randomize control phase IIa trial . We hypothesize exercise improve verbal learn memory ( primary endpoint ) well induce change neuroimaging marker structural functional central nervous system ( CNS ) connectivity ( secondary endpoint ) . Tertiary outcome include walk ability , motor function coordination , well patient-based outcome ( depression , fatigue , health-related quality life ) . Design : This single-blind , randomize , control phase IIa trial parallel group design compare 3 month standardize aerobic exercise training ( bicycle ergometry ) waitlist control group ( superiority framework ) . The allocation ratio exercise waitlist control 1:1 sample size n=60 .</detailed_description>
