	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary objective : To evaluate effect retinal morphophysiology full scatter single target panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) versus full scatter multiple target panretinal photocoagulation ( combine intravitreous injection ranibizumab ) versus intravitreous ranibizumab ( IVR ) alone patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Primary outcome : The primary endpoint study mean change total area active retinal neovessels , measure fluorescein angiography leakage area , mm2 , baseline week 48 . Secondary objective : - To assess mean change best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) , mean change central subfield foveal thickness ( CSFT ) , mean change wave B amplitude oscillatory potential full-field electroretinogram ( ERG ) , mean change peripheral visual field static perimetry ( 30:2 strategy ) , baseline week 48 . - To assess incidence adverse event study . Strategic goal : In era anti-VEGF treatment retinal neovascularization 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , time determine would best association PRP + anti-VEGF proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) , still , intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment would even well regard morphologic ( new vessel area CSFT ) functional parameter ( BCVA , ERG response visual field ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Photocoagulation ( thermal laser ) first modality describe treatment PDR . Different type laser xenon , krypton , argon , red diode green diode use treatment . The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) show benefit early treatment PDR macular edema laser photocoagulation . However , several study report loss visual field laser photocoagulation bilateral full-scatter type ( PRP ) due expansion thermal injury , possibly even compromise ability drive automotive vehicle accord standard transit authority country . Thus , implies great impact quality life patient , especially young diabetic.6 The objective new laser photocoagulation technology provide treatment permit development regenerative response photoreceptors retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) minimum loss photoreceptors minimum cicatricial expansion thermal injury target RPE.7 The PASCAL photocoagulator ( OptiMedica , Santa Clara , California ) ( standard scan laser ) introduce 2005 retinal photocoagulation . The device function partially automated procedure mean short laser pulse ( short pulse strategy ) combine multiple simultaneous firing pattern , perform procedure within short period time less damage outer retina RPE , addition provide well patient comfort.8 Regarding combine therapy , combination intravitreous injection ranibizumab PRP ( ETDRS ) prove promising term improve visual acuity , stability macular thickness great regression rate neovessel area use PRP alone ( ETDRS ) patient high risk PDR.1 Thus , present study would like determine would best therapeutic combination laser anti-VEGF drug patient , whether treatment anti-VEGF drug alone would better term anatomical functional parameter propose .</detailed_description>
