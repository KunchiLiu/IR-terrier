	<brief_title>The Role Inflammasome Inflammatory Macrophage Mycobacterium Avium Complex-lung Disease Mycobacterium Abscessus-lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung disease ( LD ) due nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) become important clinical concern , incidence prevalence NTM-LD increase last decade . Among NTM-LD Taiwan , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) M. abscessus ( MAB ) frequent pathogenic specie . Because MAC MAB exist environment ubiquitously , clinical relevance MAC isolate sputum around 35~42 % , MAB around 33 % . According guideline American Thoracic Society , diagnosis MAC-LD MAB-LD base clinical , radiographic , mycobacteriologic criterion . For microbiology criterion , two set positive sputum mycobacterial culture NTM specie within one year require . Actually , mycobacteria culture neither timely efficient , need week wait result , especially slowly grow NTM . Moreover , nucleic acid amplification method discriminate true NTM infection solely colonization airway NTM colonization uncommon . Therefore , diagnosis true NTM-LD big challenge clinical practice . However , early diagnose start treatment NTM-LD important NTM-LD may rapid lethal critical status patient without early proper treatment . Hence , rapid accurate diagnostic test develop . The body inflammatory marker probably indicator differentiate true NTM-LD pulmonary colonization interferon-gamma ( IFN-g ) play critical role protective immunity mycobacterial infection . However , serum IFN-g poorly correlate diagnosis NTM-LD possibly due host attenuate cellular immunity presence IFN-gamma inhibitor . By contrast , macrophages first-line defense mycobacterial bacillus enter airway may play important role MAC/MAB infection . Macrophages polarize inflammatory type promotes type 1 immunity . In addition , inflammatory macrophage react inflammasome defense intracellular mycobacteria . However , inflammasome response inflammatory macrophage rarely investigate MAC-LD MAB-LD , either defense mechanism diagnostic aid disease form colonization . The investigator therefore conduct in-vitro inflammatory macrophage stimulation use MAC MAB bacilli observe difference inflammasome response MAC/MAB patient , colonizer , control .</detailed_description>
