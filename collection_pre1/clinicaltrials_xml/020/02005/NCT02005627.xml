	<brief_summary>About 45 million people Europe allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) - inflammation nasal passages cause sneeze , runny nose , nasal congestion , itch tear eye . In United Kingdom ( UK ) , seasonal hay fever due grass pollen allergy account approximately 7 time doctor ' appointment asthma . The standard treatment hay fever consist treat symptom nasal spray antihistamine . However , survey take UK general practice le 40 % patient hay fever report good symptom control standard treatment . For patient hay fever whose symptom well control treatment antihistamine nasal spray , subcutaneous immunotherapy ( SCIT ) - ( monthly injection grass allergen extract period 3-5 year ) effective alternative , approve UK name patient basis . More recently , allergen immunotherapy tablet ( AITs ) develop , include grass pollen allergen tablet . These show highly effective treatment hay fever , additional benefit convenient patient , give may take home . Grazax® ( manufacture Allergologisk Laboratorium København ( ALK ) -Abello , Denmark ) UK European Union ( EU ) license use treatment troublesome grass pollen induce hay fever . The aim research investigate effect AIT treatment immune system time - change take place course treatment . This provide insight complexity development allergen-specific immune tolerance - harmful allergic response innocuous substance grass pollen overridden .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Grass Pollen Allergen Immunotherapy Tablet ( AIT ) Time Course Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 44 month . We expect screen 70 atopic patient order enroll 50 suitable atopic participant ensure randomisation least 40 atopic participant follow baseline visit . Additionally , shall recruit 20 healthy , non-atopic volunteer . Individuals moderate severe grass pollen hay fever , without associate seasonal asthma , recruit screen pollen season September March 2014 . Atopic Participants undergo baseline assessment December 2013 March 2014 . All screening assessment complete eligible participant randomize active placebo treatment . Atopic participant begin AIT treatment February-March 2014 continue treatment 12 month . All atopic participant provide anti-allergic rescue medication ( antihistamine tablet , topical intranasal corticosteroid , eye-drop ) throughout pollen season . Clinical surrogate endpoint assessment specific time Points blood , nasal fluid nasal brush sampling , perform baseline ( January-March 2014 ) , 4 , 8 , 12 16 week start AIT , 6 12 month ( January-March 2015 ) treatment . Nasal mucosal biopsy take baseline , Peak pollen season , 12 month treatment . After 12 month treatment , unblinding take place . Those atopic participant receive active AIT treatment continue therapy another 12 month follow withdrawal phase 12 month . Blood sample nasal biopsy take participant 24 36 month initial start treatment . Those atopic participant placebo offer 24 month active treatment unblinding . 20 healthy , non-atopic participant also recruit studied single day nasal challenge one timepoint 12 month . They undergo clinical immunological measurement 46 randomised subject participate clinical trial . The healthy subject undergo therapeutic intervention serve control immunological measurement . The study receive monitoring : - sponsor , Imperial College London audit : - Medicines human use ( clinical trial ) regulation authority ( MHRA ) We assess clinical data paper case report form use Inform database order verify completeness data entry . The Inform database also include normal range parameter relevant . Standard Operating Procedures place regard clinical measure ( e.g . nasal allergen challenge , nasal biopsy etc . ) well data management ( e.g . Trial Master File ) , report adverse event data collection . All involved investigator inform procedure current Good Clinical Practice ( GMC ) instruction . Statistical analysis non-parametric statistic take account treatment effect baseline value visit number . Inclusion 20 participant per group give great 90 % power ( p=0.05 ) detect 40 % reduction early phase response ( EPR ) nasal challenge ( AUC TNSS first 60 minute challenge , 40 % reduction skin LPR , 50 % increase grass pollen allergen specific immunoglobulin G4 ( IgG4 ) AIT vs. placebo . Based recent nasal allergen challenge study ( Scadding et al , unpublished data ; mean 4.63 , standard deviation 1.65 AUC 0-60 minute post grass pollen nasal challenge 14 allergic volunteer ) , inclusion 13 patient per group provide 80 % power detect 40 % reduction AUC challenge , whereas inclusion 22 patient per group provide 80 % power detect 30 % reduction . Further base recent study ( Scadding et al , unpublished data ; mean 70.14 , standard deviation 14.17 cross-sectional area cm2 8 hour skin late phase response intradermal grass pollen injection ) , inclusion 7 participant per group provide 80 % power detect 30 % reduction , whereas inclusion 10 participant per group provide 90 % power detect 30 % reduction . Intent-to-treat ( ITT ) sample define randomized participant . ITT participant analyse group randomize , regardless medication actually receive . If participant drop post randomisation , invite complete study assessment throughout duration trial . Per-protocol ( PP ) sample define ITT sample participant remain study 12 month primary endpoint assess . Participants PP sample must compliant study medication , define take 75 % study medication duration study . Compliance study medication assess pill count return AIT/placebo . Participants PP sample analyse group randomize . The non-atopics also include PP sample . Safety sample ( SS ) define enrolled participant . Analysis study data conduct address objective trial interrelationship among data element interest investigator relevance objective study . Primary analysis treatment effect conduct intention-to-treat ( ITT ) principle eligible patient , whereby outcome data eligible patient include regardless treatment compliance . In addition analysis describe section , summary descriptive statistic provide follow manner : continuous data summarize descriptively mean , standard deviation , median , range ; categorical data present enumeration percentage . Analysis primary endpoint : The primary endpoint analyse use ITT PP sample . The analysis primary endpoint compare mean EPR nasal challenge record TNSS first 60 minute nasal challenge , 12 month therapy . Comparison active placebo group assess use ANOVA 0.05 level significance . Analysis secondary endpoint : All secondary analysis treat supportive . P-values present secondary endpoint adjust multiplicity interpret caution . Findings evaluate context available body knowledge respect finding .</detailed_description>
