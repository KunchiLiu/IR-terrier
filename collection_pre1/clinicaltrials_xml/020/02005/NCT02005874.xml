	<brief_title>A Study To Investigate The Effects Of A Low Humidity Environment And Visual Tasking On Tear Film Protein Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An investigational study , evaluate effect low humidity environment visual tasking tear film protein composition Screening Visit 1A : Subjects screen base medical history , symptom questionnaire ( e.g . OSDI ) full ophthalmic examination . Screening Visit 1A : Subjects screen base medical history , symptom questionnaire ( e.g . OSDI ) full ophthalmic examination include baseline measure include visual acuity biomicroscopic evaluation anterior segment ( i.e . Tear Break Up Time ( TBUT ) , corneal conjunctival staining , lid wiper epitheliopathy , conjunctival redness tear film evaluation ) . Post-screening , approximately sixteen ( 16 ) subject , meet inclusion exclusion criterion , ask participate study . Of enrolled study , approximately eight ( 8 ) subject mild moderate symptom sign dry eye syndrome approximately eight ( 8 ) subject sign symptom dry eye syndrome . On Visit IB , subject VA biomicroscopy perform . A basal tear sample approximately 5 µL collect via capillary tube outer canthus eye store dry ice place -80c ± 10°C freezer storage . Photographic assessment ocular surface may take . After wait 5 minute tear film stabilize , tear osmolarity may measure eye . Prior enter low humidity Environmental Exposure Chamber ( EEC ) , subject ask fill baseline symptom . Subjects enter remain EEC approximately 180 minute symptom diary card complete entry pre-specified timepoints . Throughout EEC visit , subject ask complete visual task digital screen ensure ocular surface expose airflow humidity level room . After approximately 180 minute exposure dry eye condition , prior exit chamber , basal tear collect via capillary tube eye store dry ice place -80°C ± 10°C freezer storage . Photographic assessment ocular surface may take . After wait 5 minute tear film stabilize , tear osmolarity may measure eye . After exit EEC , subject remain medical clinic additional 60 minute continue conduct visual task period . Symptom diary card complete pre-specified time point leave EEC . Following 60 minute clinic prior study exit , final collection basal tear via capillary tube take stored dry ice place -80°C ± 10°C freezer storage . Once photographic assessment may take . Biomicroscopy perform . The tear sample collect exposure chamber take ( -80°C ) freezer storage package dry ice shipment University Waterloo Centre Contact Lens Research ( CCLR ) analysis . A variety proteins cytokine analyze .</detailed_description>
