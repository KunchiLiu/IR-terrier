	<brief_title>Congenital Cytomegalovirus : Efficacy Antiviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands neonate routinely screen hear first week birth Otoacoustic Emissions ( OAE ) procedure . After second refer Automated Auditory Brainstem Response ( AABR ) perform . The parent newborn , bear ≥ 37 week gestational age , fail AABR Netherlands ( 550 yearly ) ask consent CMV-testing dry blood spot . Newborns diagnose congenital CMV confirm SNHL ( ≥ 20 dB ) eligible inclusion . After informed consent infant offer treatment age 13 week ( 6 week valganciclovir 32 mg/kg daily dose ; oral solution ) . Parents may decide participate trial control group ( antiviral treatment ) . Infants monitor leucopenia liver- kidney function . Inclusion continue least 1.5 year , least 40 infant include trial . At age 20 month hear child development assess follow-up . Hearing assess Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry Vivosonic Integrity . Child development assess Bayley Scales Infant Development III ( official Dutch translation ) parent fill Dutch Child Development Inventory ( NCDI ) give detailed information communicative development child . The hearing assessment developmental examination fulfil home visit . Viral load blood urine monitor antiviral treatment well twice control group . This study provide information percentage infant congenital CMV infection fail neonatal hearing screening . The trial show whether early treatment congenital CMV infect child hear impairment prevents deterioration hearing loss extent . The outcome may lead implementation congenital CMV test neonatal hearing screen program possibly newborn blood screening .</detailed_description>
