	<brief_summary>This open-label , randomize study compare efficacy GDC-0199 plus rituximab ( GDC-0199+R ) bendamustine plus MabThera/Rituxan ( Rituximab ) ( B+R ) patient relapse resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Patients randomize 1:1 two arm . Patients randomize GDC-0199+R give GDC-0199 daily ( oral , target dose 400 mg ) receive 6 cycle rituximab infuse intravenously ( IV ) Day 1 28-day cycle ( Cycle 1 : 375 mg/m2 ; Cycles 2-6 : 500 mg/m2 ) . Patients randomized B+R receive 6 cycle treatment consist rituximab infusion ( Cycle 1 : 375 mg/m2 ; Cycles 2-6 : 500 mg/m2 ) Day 1 bendamustine infusion ( 70 mg/m2 ) Days 1 2 28-day cycle . Patients GDC-0199+R arm continue GDC-0199 treatment disease progression 2 year since treatment start , whichever come first . Anticipated time study 5 year .</brief_summary>
