	<brief_summary>This study examine aphasia treatment response among Veterans non-Veterans live aphasia . It seek identify cognitive neural factor predictive positive response treatment target naming impairment aphasia . It also examine dose-response relationship name treatment . More broadly , seek determine aphasia therapy work best , much aphasia therapy sufficient achieve positive treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Language communicative impairment follow stroke ( aphasia ) affect 30 % stroke survivor , incidence 180,000 new case annually . The consequence aphasia far reach affect psychosocial adjustment , family role participation , vocational opportunity , ability function independently society . Recent estimate suggest VHA outpatient clinic see 2000 new case aphasia year , mean approximately 20,000 enrol VHA patient 100,000 United States Veterans currently live condition . In response need , VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System Geriatric Research , Education , Clinical Center ( GRECC ) initiate Program Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment Education ( PIRATE ) January 2009 . PIRATE clinical demonstration project provide approximately 100 hour cognitive-linguistically oriented aphasia treatment community dwell Veterans 4-week period . PIRATE currently serve 18 Veterans per year bi-monthly session . Resource limitation associate PIRATE aphasia treatment general require treatment offer cost-effective dos Veterans likely benefit . This treatment-effectiveness research study address issue examine dose-response relationship semantically-oriented naming treatment , identify cognitive , psycholinguistic neuroanatomical predictor treatment success . Study participant ( n=60 , 4-year period ) recruit nationwide Veterans enrol PIRATE . They name performance measure prior PIRATE entry , week treatment , program exit/follow-up . A battery cognitive measure structural magnetic resonance image brain also collect prior treatment . Participants ' performance train untrained lexical item standardize measure name performance compare across time interval specify therapy amount maximum treatment benefit achieve . Their treatment outcome also correlate specific cognitive test score location extent brain lesion identify cognitive neurological marker predictive positive treatment response . Treatment response also compare across participant different psycholinguistic profile , determine group patient show great benefit semantically-oriented naming treatment . This study provide answer two interlock question : aphasia therapy effective , much need optimize treatment outcome . These answer potential set transformative new standard aphasia treatment deliver within VHA stroke survivor aphasia broadly .</detailed_description>
