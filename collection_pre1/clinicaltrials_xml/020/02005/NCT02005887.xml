	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Preoperative chemotherapy enable breast-conserving surgery patient breast cancer , might advantageous several way . For example , response primary treatment may use prognostic marker , since demonstrate associated longer disease-free survival ( DFS ) compare response . In particular degree response ( pathological complete remission ( pCR ) ) predict overall outcome term DFS . However , pCR achieve minority patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive disease . Studies medical literature indicate pCR rate range 2 % 10 % patient whose tumor express ER suggest objective response decrease Ki67 must consider within subset tumor . The result phase II study randomize phase III trial clearly show preoperative endocrine therapy feasible safe option among patient hormone-receptor positive tumor . Letrozole show induce great rate clinical response breast-conserving surgery postmenopausal woman compare tamoxifen . In premenopausal woman ER progesterone receptor ( PgR ) positive breast cancer , preoperative endocrine therapy include combination gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue ( GnRH ) plus tamoxifen . Recent study suggest neoadjuvant endocrine therapy combination GnRH analogue aromatase inhibitor ( AIs : letrozole anastrozole ) effective select premenopausal patient . The GnRH analogue , also know luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist ( LHRH agonist ) LHRH analogue , synthetic peptide drug model human hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) . A GnRH analogue design interact GnRH receptor modify release pituitary gonadotropin , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) therapeutic purpose . Upon administration GnRH analogue , initial stimulate action hypophysis occur - term `` flare '' effect - eventually cause paradoxical sustain drop gonadotropin secretion . This second effect term `` downregulation '' observe 10 day . While phase reversible follow cessation medication , maintain GnRH agonist ' use continue long time . For select group patient , delay approximately 2-4 month downregulation gonadotropins observe . Degarelix ( INN ) degarelix acetate ( USAN ) ( tradename : Firmagon ) hormonal therapy approve treatment prostate cancer . Since testosterone , male hormone , promote growth many prostate tumor , reduction circulate testosterone low ( castration ) level often treatment goal management advanced prostate cancer . Degarelix , antagonist GnRH , immediate onset action bind GnRH receptor pituitary gland block interaction GnRH . The result fast profound reduction LH , FSH turn , testosterone suppression . Its activity suppress ovary premenopausal woman might therefore faster GnRH analogue , possibly several week . The probable difference onset action could significant clinical value patient candidate short-term neoadjuvant endocrine treatment . TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH A tumor block diagnostic core biopsy one final surgery collect banked central review future translational research IBCSG Tissue Bank host European Institute Oncology Milan , Italy . PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS The patient-reported symptom ( PRS ) assess use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Endocrine Subscale ( FACT-ES ) comprise 18 item ( score range 0 4 ) possible maximum total score 72 . Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) guideline use score interpretation FACT-ES total score . Patients ask complete PRS Form baseline ( prior randomization ) , day 1 cycle 2 , day 1 cycle 4 , prior surgery . The objective - To assess difference PRS score time two treatment arm - To correlate estradiol ( E2 ) level total PRS score measure day 1 cycle 2 day 1 cycle 4 triptorelin degarelix administration - To summarize 18 individual ( endocrine symptom ) item FACT-ES descriptively time proportion patient `` clinically significant '' symptom ( score 3 4 ) STRATIFICATION Stratification perform accord : - Age ( year ) : less equal 39 versus 40 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS To achieve primary objective , E2 level determine centrally sample take day 1 first treatment cycle administration first dose degarelix triptorelin ( baseline ) , thereafter 24 72 hour , 7 day 14 day first injection , day 1 cycle 2 6 administration degarelix triptorelin . For sample size calculation , assume cumulative percentage patient triptorelin arm achieving optimal ovarian function suppression ( define E2 ≤2.72 pg/mL ≤10 pmol/L ) 30 % within 2 week , 60 % within 4 week 75 % within 8 week , degarelix provide rapid suppression ( i.e. , 60 % within 2 week , 95 % within 4 week 100 % within 8 week ) . Enrollment 25 patient treatment arm provide least 90 % power detect difference time optimal ovarian function suppression two group , use two sample log-rank test two-sided significance level 0.05 . Randomized patient receive least one injection triptorelin degarelix include primary analysis . The primary endpoint compare two treatment arm use stratified two-sample log-rank test , age stratification factor . The distribution primary endpoint summarize use method Kaplan-Meier two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) difference proportion patient achieve optimal ovarian function suppression two treatment arm end 1st , 2nd 4th cycle also provide . The toxicity , change Ki67 expression level , Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index ( PEPI ) score time surgery , disease response , node-negative disease status surgery breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) rate also summarize difference assess treatment arm confidence interval . The primary endpoint patient-reported symptom ( PRS ) analysis total PRS score measure baseline , day 1 cycle 2 day 1 cycle 4 triptorelin degarelix administration , prior surgery . The difference PRS measurement two treatment arm time explore use repeated measure analysis base generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) model .</detailed_description>
