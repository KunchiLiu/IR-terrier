	<brief_summary>The best strategy prevent colorectal cancer ( CRC ) death lie early detection early treatment local disease status tumor . After curative resection tumor , 5~10 % stage I , 20~30 % stage II 40~50 % stage III patient suffer metastasis subsequent follow-up period . Although carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) widely use biomarker postoperative monitoring recurrence asymptomatic patient , difficult use CEA biological marker identify population high recurrent risk patient early-stage cancer lower half patient early-stage cancer CEA elevation . For improve survival patient early-stage CRC , need effort search useful biological marker predict risk tumor recurrence select patient high recurrent risk receive preventive adjuvant therapy . Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) blood play essential role cancer metastasis . Hence , detection CTCs subsequent analysis potentially revolutionize cancer care range screening , diagnosis , monitoring , drug selection . In past decade , many method use magnetic bead ( CellSearch ) , filtration ( RareCelletc ) , flow cytometry develop shortcoming low sensitivity , low purity , unable retrieve cell downstream molecular analysis cell culture . Recently , biomimetic affinity base microfluidic platform overcome abovementioned technical challenge . Importantly , use 2 ml peripheral blood , Sinica 's team show enumeration CTCs increase CRC disease progression , mean CTC count 3 , 15 , 29 60 per ml stage I , II , III IV , respectively . The result imply monitor CTC enumeration serially may serve prediction marker identify CRC patient high probability recurrence . The aim study toestablishing CTC platform standard operation protocol ( SOP ) lead certification ISO 13485 establish CTC criterion evaluate prediction power early detection colorectal cancer recurrence .</brief_summary>
