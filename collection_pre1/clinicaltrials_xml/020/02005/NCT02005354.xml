	<detailed_description>Patients bone marrow biopsy plan randomise one two group - control-TENS group TENS machine set low sensory threshold intervention-TENS group TENS machine set recognise analgesic level ( &gt; 50 Hertz ( Hz ) pain threshold patient ) ( Bennett et al . 2011 ) . The identity TENS type conceal patient doctor perform biopsy . The primary outcome pain record patient immediately procedure use validated numerical scale ( 0-10 ) . All patient receive standard pain relief ( ie . local anaesthetic without inhaled nitrous oxide ) . The benefit study establish whether TENS benefit patient additional , safe , non-invasive inexpensive method pain relief frequently painful procedure .</detailed_description>
