	<detailed_description>Background Fusion spine introduce 1911 management deformity currently use relieve pain restore function patient diagnose degenerative disc disease . Degenerative condition spine result functionally limit back pain neck , arm pain without extremity pain dysfunction major problem today 's world . Recommended treatment condition vary initially bed rest , exercise , traction , manipulation drug therapy eventual surgery . One common neck condition occur among people older 50 year cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ) . This may produce symptom cervical radiculopathy , myelopathy , . Over time , normal wear-and-tear effect age lead narrow spinal canal . This compress squeeze spinal cord . CSM cause variety symptom , include pain , numbness , weakness . When patient degenerative cervical disease require surgery , anterior decompression neural element reconstruction anterior column allograft , bone graft substitute autograft common . These type reconstruction surgery refer Spinal fusion . The objective spinal fusion eliminate motion vertebral body thereby relieve pain . An anterior cervical corpectomy , fusion instrumentation , usually perform patient pressure nerve spinal cord neck . This pressure lead pain , weakness numbness arm occasionally legs well . If non-operative treatment medication therapy ineffective , patient may require surgery order relieve pressure spinal cord nerve . Anterior cervical corpectomy ( ACC ) fusion perform patient symptomatic , progressive cervical spinal stenosis myelopathy . It perform remove large , arthritic osteophyte ( bone spur ) compress spinal cord spinal nerve . However , order generally involve remove nearly entire vertebral body disc , must replace piece bone graft bone graft substitute mend ( fuse ) together maintain stability . Neurosurgeons orthopedic surgeon perform bone grafting procedure frequently . Surgical application include treat bone defect , fracture fixation , spinal fusion revision fail total joint arthroplasty . According data collect American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons , 500,000 bone graft procedure perform annually United States . The common source bone graft use autograft , transfer small piece patient 's bone one site , usually iliac crest , another . However , amount harvest safely limited ; increase surgery time may complicate donor site morbidity . The use allograft , supply bone graft patient via bone bank , overcomes difficulty . However , demand allograft exceeds supply , small finite risk disease transmission , highly variable strength . These factor lead increase interest use synthetic bone graft substitute . This study assess fusion rate along clinical outcome use Actifuse Synthetic Bone Graft substitute mixed bone marrow aspirate autograft mixed demineralize bone matrix cervical spine fusion . Actifuse synthetic , porous , silicate-substituted hydroxyapatite show maximizes favorable bony response . Study Design This randomize study conduct prospectively . The clinical radiological outcome subject undergo anterior cervical corpectomy document . There total 40 subject enrol , 20 arm - Actifuse BMA versus autograft DBM . It anticipate study length 42 month base recruitment period 18 month follow 24 month post-operative follow-up period patient include study . Subjects randomize 1:1 per arm . Randomization establish study site seal envelope accessed time surgery . The sample size 40 patient allow statistical comparison 2 arm base postulated fusion rate 85 % . Given single center study recruitment 18 month , total 40 subject reasonable goal . Patient Population Subjects enrol study identify surgeon 's medical practice include subject fail conservative treatment identify physician require anterior cervical corpectomy , fusion instrumentation . Subjects suffer symptom primary diagnosis cervical spondylotic myelopathy cervical spinal stenosis one four contiguous level C3 T1 . Data Collection The clinical site 's research coordinator nurse complete case report form . Data collect prospectively , patient agree participate study sign consent form . Data collect patient 's medical record , departmental base electronic record radiographic report verify eligibility . Once patient verify eligible study , data collect source . Information capture case report form . The patient also complete questionnaire form . The information collect use study analysis result . Parameters To Be Assessed Demographics , medical history , X-ray result , quality life ( SF-36 ) , CT Scan result , Concomitant medication , adverse event , pregnancy test , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Concomitant therapy , diagnosis , comorbidities , fusion rate , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) Questionnaire , Neurological examination result , clinical assessment device malfunction , type duration surgery , OR room time , bone graft detail , blood loss , length hospital stay ( LOS ) , return work , revision surgery complication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject fail conservative treatment candidate spinal fusion surgery . The subject â‰¥18 year old legal age consent . The subject , investigator 's opinion , psychosocially , mentally , physically able fully comply protocol , include postoperative regimen , attend require followup visit , completion require form , able understand provide write informed consent . The subject skeletally mature ( epiphysis close ) . The subject voluntarily sign approve informed consent . The subject willing able participate postoperative clinical radiographic follow evaluation 2 year . No previous surgical intervention involve fusion level ( ) ; Women childbearing potential must pregnant nursing , agree get pregnant 1 year follow surgery Subject systemic infection infection surgical site . Subject medical condition would interfere postoperative assessment care ( i.e. , metabolic bone disease , neuromuscular disease , autoimmune disease , active malignancy , psychiatric disease , paraplegia , quadriplegia , etc. ) . Subject concurrent disease process would place subject excessive risk surgery ( i.e . significant circulatory pulmonary problem , significant cardiac disease ) . Subject history ( present past ) substance abuse ( recreational drug , prescription drug alcohol ) investigator 's opinion may interfere protocol assessment and/or subject 's ability complete protocol require followup . The subject pregnant/breastfeeding time enrollment , plan become pregnant course study . Subject participate another clinical study , could confound result . Subject ossification posterior longitudinal ligament ( OPLL ) level History osteoporotic fracture spine , hip wrist History endocrine metabolic disorder ( e.g. , Paget 's disease ) know affect bone mineral metabolism Taking medication may interfere bony/soft tissue heal include chronic steroid use Known allergy titanium , stainless steel , polyurethane , polyethylene , ethylene oxide residual Rheumatoid arthritis know autoimmune disease know systemic disorder HIV , active hepatitis B C fibromyalgia Severe obesity ( Body Mass Index &gt; 40 ) Physical mental condition ( e.g. , psychiatric disorder , senile dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , alcohol drug addiction ) would interfere patient selfassessment function , pain quality life . Involved current pending spinal litigation permanent disability benefit seek Incarcerated time study enrollment Diseases significantly inhibit bone healing ( osteoporosis , metabolic bone disease , uncontrolled diabetes , dialysis dependent renal failure , symptomatic liver disease ) Undergoing chemotherapy radiation treatment , chronic use steroid ( define 6 week steroid use within 12 month surgery , episodic use inhaled corticosteroid ) Subject severe osteopenia , osteoporosis , osteomalacia , spinal metastasis , metabolic bone disease would significantly inhibit bone healing OR level BMD T score 2.5 OR patient sustain vertebral compression nontraumatic hip wrist fracture .</criteria>
