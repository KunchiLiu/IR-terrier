	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well anti-cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 lenalidomide work treat patient relapse , refractory , previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia , small lymphocytic lymphoma , prolymphocytic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 lenalidomide may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II MOR00208 Combination With Lenalidomide Patients With Relapsed Refractory CLL , SLL PLL Older Patients With Untreated CLL , SLL PLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) 6 month patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) /prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) treat combination MOR00208 plus lenalidomide . II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) 6 month patient treatment-naive CLL/SLL/PLL treat combination MOR00208 plus lenalidomide . III.To obtain preliminary data toxicity profile efficacy combination MOR00208 plus lenalidomide patient Richter 's Transformation IV . To obtain preliminary data efficacy MOR00208 patient progressive disease ibrutinib monotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) 12 month patient untreated CLL/SLL/PLL relapsed/refractory disease treat combination MOR00208 plus lenalidomide . II . To determine complete response ( CR ) rate , nodular partial response ( nPR ) rate , partial response ( PR ) rate , stable disease ( SD ) rate patient untreated CLL/SLL/PLL relapse refractory disease treat combination MOR00208 plus lenalidomide . III . To summarize progression free survival ( PFS ) , time next treatment , overall survival ( OS ) two cohort patient treat regimen . IV . To evaluate toxicity regimen , include frequency severity toxicity , dose reduction requirement , adverse event require drug discontinuation . V. To perform baseline analysis patient enrol trial include fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , stimulate karyotype , zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 ( Zap-70 ) methylation , immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain ( IgVH ) mutational status describe relationship biomarkers ORR PFS two cohort regimen . VI . To determine effect regimen total immunoglobulin , CD4+ CD8+ T cell , natural killer ( NK ) cell , interleukin-21 receptor ( IL-21R ) expression CLL cell . VII . To determine whether NK cell T cell activate response MOR00208 alone combination lenalidomide . VIII . To estimate rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) patient achieve CR , whether correlate PFS . OUTLINE : Patients receive anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 ( day 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 ) lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 ( day 9-28 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
