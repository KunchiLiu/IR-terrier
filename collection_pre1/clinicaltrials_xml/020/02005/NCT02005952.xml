	<brief_summary>Still well resolved access , execution interpretation spirometry primary care medicine . This seriously affect quality care chronic respiratory disease . OBJECTIVE : To compare effectiveness two method quality control perform spirometry primary care team ( EAP ) participate `` Healthcare Process Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) '' ( multidisciplinary program primary care medicine hospital improve care COPD ) . METHODS : Randomized control trial cluster EAP participant ( n = 17 ) . The quality control spirometry EAP randomize three branch : 1 . Supervision pulmonary function laboratory Hospital ; computer . 2 . Program incorporate automated spirometer . 3 . Spirometric usual practice ( control group without support quality ) . Spirometry EAP participant include year follow-up study . All site use model spirometer receive previous training . In 2nd phase result implement effective method show 1st phase study . EXPECTED RESULTS : The method quality control effective obtain maintain quality spirometry . POTENTIAL IMPACT EXPECTED : performing spirometry quality EAP , improve early detection ( secondary prevention ) , diagnosis severity developmental control COPD .</brief_summary>
