	<brief_summary>Anti-TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) monoclonal antibody revolutionize management Inflammatory bowel disease . Their common feature include high efficacy also immunogenicity increase infection risk . Since 2013 , two generic biosimilars first anti-TNF register Europe , long lerm safety profile need yet establish . This prospective , multicenter , observational cohort study assess safety treatment anti-TNF monoclonal antibody inflammatory bowel disease patient Poland . Eligible consecutive patient anti-TNF start Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis January 1st , 2014 December 31st , 2015 . Data collect include demography , Montreal classification , indication treatment , previous treatment , operation , extraintestinal manifestation concomitant disease . Data response , tolerability safety anti-TNF concomitant treatment collect . Adverse event log complete . Majority IBD centre Poland , pediatric adult , academic regional , agree participate study . As result study , frequency adverse event cohort Polish IBD patient various anti-TNFs establish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . This prospective observational study aim register adverse event occur biological treatment inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient Poland . 2 . Eligible pediatric adult patient anti-TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) treatment start Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis , finance National Health Care System give inform consent participation study ( child consent parent require ) . 3 . The study data collect dedicated on-line data - base . 4 . Each centre participate study oblige screen study consecutive patient biological treatment start . If patient refuse consent , information must document data - base . 5 . Patient data collect start anti-TNF treatment include type anti-TNF , demographic data , type , extension location , course activity IBD , indication biological treatment , history previous treatment , operation , extraintestinal manifestation co-existing disease . As regard anti-TNFs , biosimilars categorise distinct drug order separately follow-up safety profile . 6 . Data response , tolerability safety anti-TNF concomitant treatment update follow visit . Adverse event log serious adverse event log complete necessary . 7 . Registration new patient ongoing Jan 2014 Dec 2015 . After time , centre may choose continue study . 8 . In addition , data health event enrol patient collect independently National Health Care System database , also on-site observation patient complete .</detailed_description>
