The pathogen associate severe disease Enterovirus 71 . In 2011 , Vietnam large outbreak Hand Foot mouth disease result 110,000 case 164 death . HFMD affect child early year child development , limited information potential long-term consequence . Small study suggest language cognitive difficulty severe disease evaluate large cohort . Internationally recognize standardized assessment tool available early childhood Vietnam . This project translate adapt Bayley Scales Toddler Infant Development 3rd edition ( Bayley III ) Movement ABC , 2nd edition ( MABC ) Vietnamese outcome measure . This study evaluate whether neurodevelopment difficulty follow severe HFMD . The study design prospective observational cohort study . Hospitalised child clinical diagnosis HFMD eligible enroll . Written parental consent require . Participants enrol assess 3 time 18 month discharge hospital study . Since standardization Bayley III MABC Vietnam , healthy cohort , age sex match least severe HFMD participant recruit . This healthy cohort follow assessment program 18 month .

	<brief_title>Neurodevelopment Outcomes Following Severe Hand Foot Mouth Disease Vietnam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Hand foot mouth disease outbreaks associate enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) unusual neurological manifestation . Since 1997 , Taiwan , Malaysia Vietnam experience large outbreaks EV71-HFMD . Neurological manifestation include meningitis , brainstem encephalitis , rare cardiopulmonary failure , think neurogenic origin . In Vietnam , child admit hospital show sign systemic disease . The Vietnam Ministry Health develop grade system stratify management intervention . Grade 1 solely typical rash palm hand , sol foot buttock ulcer mouth . Grade 2 systemic feature high fever , irritability myoclonus . Grade 2 split 2a parental report symptom 2b health professional observe neurological sign . Grade 2 onwards admit hospital . Grade 3 develop irregular breathing , persistent tachycardia , hypertension , feature autonomic disturbance due brainstem encephalitis . Grade 4 develop often fatal cardiopulmonary failure , believe consequence excessive unopposed sympathetic activation brainstem disease . Different country use different grade stag system HFMD . A study 142 EV71 suggest child affect young age onset disease might consequences verbal comprehension . In 63 child EV71 disease , 14 % cognitive motor deficit . Hypothesis Aims : The study aim identify neurological neurodevelopmental outcome follow severe ( hospitalise ) HFMD Vietnam . Study Design : Prospective observational cohort study . There two cohort study . The HFMD participant healthy child . All child hospitalize HFMD eligible participation . From preliminary review admission hospital , identify majority patient admit local district Ho Chi Minh City ( HCMC ) ( District 8 ) . All participant ask agree optional brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . We approach kindergarten district enroll healthy child , also approach participant another Oxford University Clinical Research Unit , HCMC study run local obstetric hospital enroll healthy infant . This healthy cohort age sex match least severe grade HFMD participant . HFMD neurological neurodevelopmental assessment carry 1 week discharge , 6 month later last assessment 18 month initial assessment . The Healthy cohort neurodevelopmental assessment enrollment . 6 month 18 month initial assessment . Primary Outcomes 1 . Comparison neurodevelopment score discharge , 6 18 month follow least severe HFMD child age sex match healthy comparison cohort . 2 . Comparison neurodevelopment score 1 week discharge , 6 18 month discharge child stratify HFMD disease grade . Other Outcomes 1 . Descriptive Brain MRI Changes accord severity HFMD Sample size analysis plan : We aim include 350 child HFMD grade 2a , 2b , 3 4 , 150 healthy child ( match Grade 2a ) follow enrolment , 6 18 month follow-up . The Bayley scoring system mean score 100 standard deviation ( SD ) 15 healthy American child . Based , assume SD approximately 15 5 study population . As little known within-child longitudinal change Bailey score time , power consideration base pair-wise comparison group time point separately . With sample size give , 80 % power two-sided 5 % significance level detect difference mean score - 7.4 large grade 2a 2b child compare grade 3 4 child , respectively . Statistical Methods Standard data summary median ( inter-quartile range ) continuous variable frequency ( % ) categorical variable together graphical summary ( histogram , box plot scatterplots ) use descriptive analysis study . Longitudinal profile development score time visualize line plot individual subject ' data overlaid smooth line average development score time within group . Modeling longitudinal profile time group comparison base standard method longitudinal data analysis linear mixed effect model . Potential Impact : To public health implication HFMD require evaluation long-term . If burden disease continue neurological impact significant proportion child , vaccine-based approach essential cost-effective . As intense effort underway vaccine development , research essential help clinician front line identify minority child may progress focus limited resource appropriately .</detailed_description>
