	<brief_summary>Phase II , open-label , non-randomized , international multicenter clinical trial two stratum ( SFT EMC ) . 8 site Spain , 5 site Italy 5 site France . Patients receive oral pazopanib 800 mg daily continuously . Patients continue receive treatment evidence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , non-compliance , withdrawn consent investigator decision . The main goal determine objective response rate ( ORR ) ( confirm complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) patient unresectable , locally advanced metastatic solitary fibrous tumor extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma , use Choi RECIST 1.1 criterion respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To estimate sample size stratum 1 ( SFT ) , Simon 's optimal 2-stage phase II design use , consider publish response rate base Choi criterion SFT patient correspond 40 % monotherapy . For design P0=0.40 , P1=0.60 ; α=0.1 β=0.1 . At first stage , 18 patient enrol study , few 8 response ( 7 less ) trial terminate conclude pazopanib sufficiently active . At second stage , another 28 patient ( total 46 patient ) would enrol study . To reject null hypothesis SFT stratum 23 response ( Choi criterion ) , 46 patient , need . To estimate simple size stratum 2 ( EMC ) , Simon 's optimal 2-stage phase II design use , consider scarce publish information response rate base RECIST criterion . For design P0= 0.05 , P1= 0.25 , α=0.1 β=0.1 . At first stage , 9 patient enrol study , responses trial terminate conclude pazopanib sufficiently active . If least 1 response first stage , trial continue second stage , another 15 patient ( total 24 patient ) would enrol study . To reject null hypothesis EMC stratum 3 response ( RECIST criterion ) , 24 patient , need . For variable follow binomial distribution ( e.g . response rate ) frequency percentage calculate , together correspond exact 95 % confidence interval . For time-to-event variable ( e.g . PFS OS ) Kaplan-Meier estimation use . To analyze reduction risk influence variable time-to-event variable Cox Regression apply . To correlate pharmacodynamics marker biomarkers clinical response standard method bivariate multivariate regression correlation use .</detailed_description>
