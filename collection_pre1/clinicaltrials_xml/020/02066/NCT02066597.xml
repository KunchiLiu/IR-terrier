	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) common condition occur clot develop one vein . It affect 5 % population third common circulatory condition heart attack stroke . People experience clot vein significant long term problem swell discomfort . The investigator call post thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . They also increase risk another clot occur . People ilio-femoral clot likely severe leg swell pain clot small vein . They also likely problem return normal daily routine may need hospital visit . The current standard care involve treat patient anticoagulant ( blood thinner ) low risk bleeding risk inexpensive . Blood thinner prevent clot grow big body dissolve clot time . The type clot severe form DVT . Some expert advise early removal clot - result symptom relief sooner possibly reduce risk PTS . This addition standard treatment blood thinner . There currently two option physically remove clot . One method involve place intravenous catheter leg inject medication directly clot situate . This dissolve clot . This method call Catheter Directed Thrombolysis ( CDT ) . The second method , Percutaneous Mechanical Thrombectomy ( PMT ) , involve place intravenous catheter leg break clot mechanically suction vein - create good blood flow leg . Both method require injection contrast dye special x-ray machine see clot ensure entire clot remove . CDT expensive increase risk major bleeding . PMT much less expensive low risk bleeding . The doctor The Ottawa Hospital typically recommend CDT , commonly perform PMT patient population . The investigator would like enroll 26 participant ilio-femoral DVTs perform PMT see achieve good outcome routine treatment blood thinner . The investigator conduct study The Ottawa Hospital , General Campus . They follow progress participant 6 month . The device investigator use ( Angiojet Ultra Thrombectomy System ) already approve Health Canada procedure .</brief_summary>
