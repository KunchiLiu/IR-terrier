	<brief_summary>Hypothesis The study aim demonstrate least equivalence , non-significant difference TS US woman dense breast screen negative 2D Mammography . If equivalence TS US demonstrate , US may substitute TS great benefit patient healthcare resource . Aims 1 . Assess TS may detect additional cancer dense breast approximate US detection capability less false positive finding US . 2 . If TS detect new cancer dense breast similarly US ( approximate rate marginally low rate ) , evaluate true positive/false positive ratio . 3 . Cost-analysis . In case le false positive detect TS , true-positive / false positive trade-off might strongly favour TS great potential cost reduction .</brief_summary>
