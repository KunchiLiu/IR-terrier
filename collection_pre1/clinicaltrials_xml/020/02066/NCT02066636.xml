	<criteria>For information regard BMS clinical trial participation , please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com 1 . Target Population Subjects histologicallyor cytologicallydocumented NSCLC [ squamous ( SQ ) nonsquamous ( NSQ ) ] present Stage IIIB/Stage IV disease ( accord version 7 International Association Study Lung Cancer Staging Manual Thoracic Oncology ) , recurrent progressive disease follow multimodal therapy ( radiation therapy , surgical resection definitive chemoradiotherapy locally advanced disease ) Subjects must experience disease progression recurrence least one systemic therapy advance metastatic disease Each subsequent line therapy must precede disease progression . A switch agent within regimen order manage toxicity define start new line therapy Maintenance therapy follow platinum doubletbased chemotherapy consider separate regimen therapy Subjects receive platinumcontaining adjuvant , neoadjuvant definitive chemoradiation therapy give locally advanced disease , develop recurrent ( local metastatic ) disease within 6 month complete therapy eligible Subjects recurrent disease &gt; 6 month platinumcontaining adjuvant , neoadjuvant definitive chemoradiation therapy give locally advanced disease , also subsequently progress platinum doubletbased regimen give treat recurrence eligible Subjects nonsquamous histology must test Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation ( include , limited , deletion exon 19 exon 21 [ L858R ] substitution ) Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement test previously perform . Subjects progressive disease EGFR ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) regimens eligible . Subjects eligible genetic test result indeterminate tumor tissue available accessible test long receive one prior systemic therapy Experimental therapy give separate regimen consider separate line therapy Subjects must measurable disease CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion ( radiographic tumor assessment perform within 28 day first dose study drug ) clinically apparent disease investigator follow response per RECIST 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Arm ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) PS 0 1 PS 2 1 . Target Disease Exceptions Subjects active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases excluded Subjects carcinomatous meningitis 2 . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Subjects history interstitial lung disease Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease Subject participate either arm follow clinical trial CA209017 , CA209057 , CA209026 , CA184104 receive prior treatment antiprogrammed death 1 ( PD1 ) antiprogrammed deathligand 1 ( PDL1 ) experimental agent 3 .
