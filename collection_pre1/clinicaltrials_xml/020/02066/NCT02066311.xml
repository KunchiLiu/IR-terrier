	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) chronic autoimmune disease body 's immune system attack different part body . SLE characterize inflammation lead tissue damage different organ system . Any organ system may involve , include skin , joint , kidney , nervous system , heart , lung , blood . The exact cause SLE know . Patients SLE often elevate level anti-double strand DNA antibody . These level often associate disease flare disease severity . These antibody bind tissue lead organ damage . Preventing antibody bind target may help decrease disease activity . Protease inhibitors medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treatment HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) . Nelfinavir ( also call viracept ) one protease inhibitor . Separate anti-viral effect , protease inhibitor find decrease inflammation . These medication show interfere bind anti-double stranded DNA antibody target may decrease inflammation SLE . This research study test whether protease inhibitor , nelfinavir , decrease anti-double stranded DNA antibody bind decrease disease activity .</brief_summary>
