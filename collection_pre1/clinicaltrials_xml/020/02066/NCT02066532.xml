	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety efficacy Ruxolitinib combination Trastuzumab treatment HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer . Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment myelofibrosis ( disease bone marrow ) , safety efficacy breast cancer patient know . Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) FDA-approved treatment HER2 positive breast cancer . The safety efficacy treatment give combination know . It hypothesize Ruxolitinib combination Trastuzumab demonstrate efficacy treat Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer subject , tolerable safety profile patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Combination With Trastuzumab Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common female cancer second common cause cancer death woman . Approximately 1,150,000 case 410,000 death breast cancer occur annually worldwide , , U.S. , estimate 184,450 new case 40,480 death breast cancer every year . The vast majority patient die breast cancer succumb metastatic disease . The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 gene ( HER2 ) amplify 20 % 30 % breast cancer . HER2+ breast cancer associate early recurrence short overall survival associate adverse prognostic marker , high tumor grade , high rate cell proliferation , increase nodal metastasis , relative resistance certain type chemotherapy . The HER family receptor group relate transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases regulate normal cell survival , proliferation , differentiation , migration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast locally recurrent metastatic disease . Locally recurrent disease must amenable local treatment curative intent . Metastatic disease must demonstrate either radiographically histologically . Primary tumor and/or metastatic lesion must demonstrate HER2neu overexpression , per 2013 recommendation , i.e . immunohistochemistry ( IHC 3+ ) amplification situ hybridization base following : 1 . Singleprobe average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell 2 . Dualprobe HER2/Chromosome 17 centromere ( CEP17 ) ratio ≥2.0 average HER2 copy number ≥4.0 signals/cell 3 . Dualprobe HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 average HER2 copy number &lt; 4.0 signals/cell 4 . Dualprobe HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt; 2.0 average HER2 copy number &gt; 6.0 signals/cell Patients progress least two line HER2directed therapy metastatic setting , prior therapy metastatic disease include pertuzumab adotrastuzumab unless contraindicate decline patient . There upper limit number prior therapy Patients may measurable disease , nonmeasurable disease , ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Concomitant treatment bonetargeted therapy Receptor activator nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( RANKL ) inhibitor bisphosphonates allow . It anticipate patient measurable disease , give behavior HER2+ metastatic breast cancer . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ruxolitinib combination trastuzumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Women men race ethnic group eligible trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 ( Karnofsky equal great 60 ) Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal 50 percent transthoracic echocardiography multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) within 28 day prior first dose study drug . The subject baseline correct QT interval less equal 480ms . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : 1. leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL . 2. absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL . 3. platelet great equal 100,000/mcL . 4. hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL . 5. total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . 6 . Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST/SGOT ) / Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal . 7 . Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal calculated creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min . Women childbearing potential men must use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Contraception continue use minimum 5 mean halflives last dose study drug ( mean Trastuzumab halflife 6 mg/kg 16 day ; mean halflife Ruxolitinib : 3 hour ) Patient able swallow , retain , absorb oral medication . Informed Consent . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent receive investigational agent within 2 week 5 halflives compound active metabolite , whichever long first dose study treatment . Patients previously treat IL6 , Janus kinase ( JAK ) Signal Transducers Activators Transcription ( STAT ) inhibitor indication , ruxolitinib tocilizumab . The subject untreated , symptomatic , progressive brain metastasis . History Central Nervous System ( CNS ) metastases cord compression allowable patient clinically stable least 6 week since completion definitive treatment steroid without symptom least 28 day . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ruxolitinib trastuzumab . The effect ruxolitinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) inhibitor agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform principal investigator immediately . Patients receive medication substance strong inhibitor cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) 3A4 isoenzyme ineligible . Patients must strong inhibitor least 1 week prior deem eligible . Patients may uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement . Patients must clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure ) , uncontrolled clinically significant atrial ventricular cardiac arrhythmia , follow within past 6 month : myocardial infarction , new evidence transmural infarction electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , unstable angina , coronary angioplasty . Pregnant woman exclude study ruxolitinib Class C agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ruxolitinib , breastfeed must discontinue mother treated ruxolitinib . These potential risk also apply trastuzumab , cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman . Active Infections . Patients know active infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) , hepatitis B ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection consider trial . HIV+ patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction ruxolitinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Testing HIV hepatitis require .</criteria>
