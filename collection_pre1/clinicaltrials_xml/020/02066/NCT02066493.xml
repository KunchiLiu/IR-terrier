	<brief_title>Giant Intracranial Aneurysm Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Definition aim , eligibility patient data flow In August 2009 steer committee appoint first meeting take place Berlin . Here aim registry define follow : 1 ) To generate detailed insight therapy conduct . 2 ) To document natural history patient follow year diagnosis . 3 ) To follow image data giant aneurysms year diagnosis , whether treat conservatively . 4 ) To expand register several discipline ( invite neuroradiologic neurologic center join ) internationally . Inclusion criterion ) diagnosis giant intracranial aneurysm CT , MRI regular angiography , b ) age 18 year old c ) inform consent . There exclusion criterion . If patient able give inform consent due clinical situation , legal representative patient ( e.g . family member ) inform ask sign consent form behalf patient . Patients recruit consecutively responsibility center . In addition prospective part retrospective part patient include admit January 2006 . Data gather admission , discharge 1/3/5 year discharge . Starting February 2010 9-month pilot phase conduct order identify correct possible problem data acquisition . Development study protocol Relevant variable discuss basis exist literature giant intracranial aneurysm . All variable choose determined routine clinical context even small center minimal technical equipment . Data collection decide carry use modular structure , consist basic module additional module specific research question . The steer committee decide content mandatory basic data collection center . This basic module design keep amount variable minimum data collection conduct safely quickly possible physician discipline . It focus clinical course initial presentation discharge also include data patient history , risk factor possible prior aneurysm therapy . A neurological examination cranial nerve function , motor capability speech conduct initially , discharge 3 mandatory follow-up examination . At examination patient ' physical condition record use internationally accept reliable grade system . The investigator ask record clinical diagnosis , epileptic seizure incidental finding , also use image data produce radiological diagnosis characterize aneurysm regard location , size , shape structure . The mode therapy document choose conservative , surgical endovascular option combination thereof . Possible complication record well radiologic result intervention . Each center give option take part additional extra module , serve basis spin-off project result discussion within study group . This comprise example image module lead well understanding giant intracranial aneurysm develop time . It monitor change aneurysm configuration flow dynamic use 3D-imaging data . A cost module integrate data treatment expense make possible compare cost mode therapy . An external review study protocol conduct ensure high methodological quality wide acceptance result . For purpose preliminary work report forward 4 independent expert field neurovascular research . The reviewer ask comment appropriateness method , practicability variable coverage relevant aspect giant intracranial aneurysm care . The comment external reviewer gather discuss within steer committee . Based recommendation external reviewer , final revision study protocol take place . Primary hypothesis , study outcome statistical analyse The primary hypothesis study conservative , endovascular surgical therapy result equal aneurysm rupture rate . Therefore primary outcome aneurysm rupture rate 5 year follow . The sample size calculation base estimate 5-year cumulative rupture rate patient unruptured giant aneurysm give ISUIA-Trial . According result assume 5-year rupture rate 0.30 irrespective specific treatment apply . Because lack data special rupture rate regard patient treat three consider method , sample size calculation do one proportion base precision analysis . Consequently , two-sided 95 % confidence interval width equal 0.10 achieve sample size 320 patient . For outcome death rupture correspond survival function 95 % confidence interval estimate Kaplan-Meier method . The null-hypotheses equal survival curve two treatment group test Log-Rank test . With documented date rupture event sample size 320 calculate sufficient detect moderate effect possible predictor rupture Cox proportional hazard regression within secondary analysis . Furthermore model logit rupture 5 year binary logistic regression detect possible moderate considerable effect predictor . Therapy ( conventional , surgery endovascular ) main factor interest multivariable analysis . Patient recruitment / Data storage / Quality assurance In 2008 patient recruitment begin Charité Berlin , one year later data center include well , initially Germany , later throughout Europe Japan . Patient data store use pseudonym . Centers either use fax-based data inclusion form web-based entry form . All data store Charité - Berlin . For quality assurance monitor visit 7 most-including center conduct 2013 .</detailed_description>
