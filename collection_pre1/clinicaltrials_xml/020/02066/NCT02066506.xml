	<detailed_description>Right ventricle ( RV ) sub-aortic position rare situation , mainly two congenital heart defect : congenitally correct transposition great artery complete transposition great artery palliate atrial switch . In patient , increase afterload lead hypertrophy late RV dilatation . The stress exercise RV wall could play role adaptative mechanism systemic afterload . Beyond remodelling threshold , could cause fibrosis damage RV systolic failure . Magnetic resonance imaging , major potential estimation RV remodelling , wall stress fibrosis , could shed light RV adaptation systemic afterload evolution towards failure . Systemic RV remodelling function could also depend neuro-hormone secretion mechanical arterial property , direct influence patient afterload . The first purpose study determine adaptative mechanism RV systemic afterload , mechanism RV failure , patient congenital heart disease subaortic RV , use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) .The mechanism evaluate measure RV remodelling RV wall stress use CMR . Second objectives evaluate mechanism use echography , arterial property study neurohormonal level</detailed_description>
