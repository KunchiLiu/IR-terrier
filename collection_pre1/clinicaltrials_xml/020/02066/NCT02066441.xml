	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare vitamin D deficient vitamin D sufficient elderly individual examine effect vitamin D dietary supplement serum vitamin D level , bone formation , resorption , mineral density , flexibility , balance , general inflammation , quality life . Enhancing nutritional status necessary prevent continue proliferation chronic disease , e.g. , bone disease chronic disorder think relate low level vitamin D , lead disablers killer Americans . Americans also difficulty compliance prescription medication due toxicity side effect . This study aim learn vitamin D nutritional supplement may improve nutritional status enable body normalize system functioning , may improve quality life people vitamin D deficiency . The result research use determine vitamin D beneficial overall health among elderly individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study two part observational ( first part ) experimental ( second part ) design . The purpose first part study cross-sectional investigation relationship among vitamin D status , vitamin D intake sun exposure , physical performance 130 community dwell old adult ( ≥55 year old ) . The purpose second part study 6-month , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate effect vitamin D supplementation ( Bio-D-Mulsion Forte® ) improve physical performance , serum level 25-OH-vitamin D , PTH , bone formation ( osteocalcin ) , bone resorption ( type 1 cross link C telopeptide ( CTX ) ) , bone mineral density ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry sub-sample 20 participant ) 40 participant ( ≥55 year age ) vitamin D insufficiency baseline ( &lt; 30 ng/ml serum 25 ( OH ) D ) . Secondary outcome include body composition , low back/hamstring flexibility , balance , gustatory response treatment , general inflammation , quality life , depression , fear fall , history fall , food security . Information sun exposure , vitamin D calcium intake , physical activity level , reflectance calorimetry also collect . Participants assess baseline 6-months follow-up . This part study consist two treatment arm : ( ) vitamin D dietary nutritional supplement ( b ) placebo . The primary risk placebo group show improvement serum level 25-OH-vitamin D , bone formation , bone resorption , bone mineral density , secondary outcomes associate vitamin D supplementation . However , restrict way receive vitamin D sunlight exposure food . Each participant placebo group also receive 6-month supply vitamin D supplement ( Bio-D-Mulsion Forte® ) conclusion participation study . Additionally , risk placebo also offset knowledge gain actually receive serum level 25-OH-vitamin D score baseline 6-months follow-up , typically assessed average provider . Finally , short-term period study increase long-term health risk associate study , study utilize placebo-controlled trial vitamin D deficient adult previously observe adverse effect . Normal serum level 25-OH-vitamin D achieve within 2-5 month accord literature . The health risk associate consume vitamin D dietary supplement inconclusive . Hypercalcemia one potential adverse effect , accord one review increase mean calcium level occur high vitamin D intake test controlled trial 100,000 IU per day . For single case hypercalcemia randomize controlled trial , case mild hypercalcemia report 2 28 study , resolve repeat fast sample one study actually frequent placebo group study . Additionally , hypercalcemia mostly find case person serum level 25 ( OH ) D great 240 nmol/L . An increase risk nephrolithiasis find one randomize control trial ( Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) ) , test 400 IU vitamin D combination 1000 mg calcium . The reason nephrolithiasis study unclear ; factor include : ( 1 ) study may large enough detect small risk nephrolithiasis vitamin D supplementation ; ( 2 ) nephrolithiasis cause calcium supplement intake take combination vitamin D part protocol ; and/or ( 3 ) nephrolithiasis cause additional calcium vitamin D supplement take majority participant outside study protocol . The low dose vitamin D use WHI argue causal role increase risk nephrolithiasis . Based epidemiologic data , high vitamin D intake independently associate nephrolithiasis one large cohort consistent finding recent study 18 healthy postmenopausal woman vitamin D deficiency vitamin D supplementation increase urinary calcium excretion . On hand , calcium supplementation associate 20 % increase risk nephrolithiasis Nurses Health Study I . The issue vascular calcification also note potential risk vitamin D supplementation . However , report literature continue restrict extremely high dos vitamin D3 administration active hormonal form , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 and/or relate analogue , report animal , human . No credible evidence exist support notion oral vitamin D dose even exceed 10,000 IU per day associate vascular calcification human , include dialysis patient , basis exists identify vascular calcification critical effect . Participants may experience discomfort answer questionnaire undergoing venipuncture , may stop assessment time . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report IRB . The vitamin D dietary supplement harmless without food allergy sensitivity . No episodes side effect report Biotics Research Corporation , manufacturer , consumer previous 5 year . A toxicology search component reveals unique toxicity characteristic material . As reported Biotics Research Corporation , thousand people currently use Bio-D-Mulsion Forte® , Biotics Research Corporation unaware significant toxicity . A major concern raw natural product presence contaminant . Biotics Research Corporation operate accordance D-SHEA regulation , Bio-D-Mulsion Forte® make high purity , quality , potency . Biotics Research Corporation manufacturer product strict GMP guideline FDA-registered facility , license Texas Department State Health Services Regulatory Licensing Unit Food Non-prescription Drug Manufacturer , license Health Canada ( Site License ) consider compliance GMP requirement Natural Health Products Regulations . Biotics Research Corporation conduct multiple quality control test product . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study , although may undergo psychological physical discomfort sometimes . The process interview assessment may cause discomfort . Discomfort fatigue may also experience complete assessment battery . Alternatives study include prescription medication , sun exposure , exercise , dietary modification , nutritional supplement . The risk medication significant , include life-threatening , risk take nutritional supplement totally understood , since regulate FDA . Medications nutritional supplement , part change lifestyle behavior , may also prove beneficial improve serum vitamin D level , long-term use unknown consequence . The information obtain study help determine efficacy use dietary supplement improve serum vitamin D level . By participate study , subject may experience improved serum vitamin D level , bone formation , bone resorption , bone mineral density accord DEXA scan , flexibility , balance , quality life , reduce risk disease . The risk participate study reasonable improvement serum vitamin D level , bone formation , bone resorption , bone mineral density , flexibility , balance , gustatory response treatment , general inflammation , quality life associate improved nutritional status enhance . The investigator look old population due change outcomes typically associate age . No consensus exist age consider elderly , investigator choose 55 wider age range . Other investigator use non-elderly participant similar high dose vitamin D supplementation .</detailed_description>
