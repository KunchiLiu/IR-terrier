	<brief_summary>EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) - ie , erlotinib , gefitinib , recommend first option EGFR-mutated IIIb/IV NSCLC serial trial prolong patient ' progression-free survival . The OPTIMAl trial indicate received TKI chemotherapy whole treatment window survive long . Unfortunately , previous study ( INTACT , TRIBUTE et al ) concurrently combine TKI cytotoxic regimen fail improve survival unselected patient . To avoid potential synergistic antagonism , FAST-ACT II trial commit sequential strategy find superiority combination arm upon chemotherapy even EGFR-mutated group . However , pharmaceutically , continuous administration EGFR-TKI subsequent chemotherapy FAST-ACT II could obviate effect cytotoxic agent due erlotinib-induced G1 arrest . On basis study , investigator hypothesize well sequential combination strategy EGFR-TKI chemotherapy ( add EGFR-TKI wash-out window chemotherapy ) would efficacious chemotherapy alone . In study , investigator investigate efficacy ( PFS : progression free survival ) , safety , adverse-event profile chemotherapy plus intermittent maintenance erlotinib , drug use first-line treatment non-squamous lung carcinoma EGFR gene mutation China .</brief_summary>
