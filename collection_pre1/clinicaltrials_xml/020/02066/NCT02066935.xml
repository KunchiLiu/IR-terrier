	<detailed_description>Kidney transplant ( KTx ) consider best therapeutic option patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , base medical reason , also socioeconomic ones1 . One important determinant kidney transplant survival adherence immunosuppressive drug . Adherence may define patient ` behavior agreement regard prescribe treatment , include extent person take medication , follow diet and/or implement lifestyle change prescribe health care provider . In set transplantation , recent consensus conference state nonadherence ( NAd ) `` deviation prescribed medication regimen sufficient adversely influence regimen 's intend effect '' . Risk factor NAd , categorize WHO five dimension : socioeconomic factor , disease , treatment factor , patient condition health care team health system characteristic . 2 Looking vascularize transplant recipient , KTx patient report like non-adherent.3 In Brazil , currently second country absolute number TxR , two study prevalence NAd , lack representativeness Brazilian scenario4,5 . In 2012 , 5.385 TxR perform , clear regional difference activity : localize mostly South Southeast region , perform big service high transplant activity transplantation . In context , approach NAd fundamental importance view influence results.6 The scientific literature recommend use one method assess adherence therapeutic regimen . Each method advantage disadvantage , method actually consider gold standard . On hand , combination measure maximize accuracy diagnostic NAd.7,8 We intent identify prevalence NAd immunosuppressives Brazilian kidney transplant patient , use appropriate methodology triangulation . As secondary objective design differences center region country well risk factor NAd . SAMPLE , SETTING AND DATA COLLECTION Sample , Setting : The sample size define base data 2012 Brazilian Registry Transplant ( 2012 RBT ) 6 available Brazilian Association Transplantation ( ABTO ) . The total number patient transplant Brazil 2000 2012 59,001 , 20,504 patient register monitored transplant center contribute register . Using OpenEpi stats program , sample calculate study population frequency , consider hypothetical 50 % confidence interval 5 % design effect range 2.0 3.0 . The obtained sample size range 755 1130 patient . Selection center participate study : According 2012 RTB , 123 active transplant center Brazil , distribute 22 state , perform 5.385 KTxs year . We arbitrarily divide center two region , accord transplantation activity : Region 1 high activity , include center South Southeast region , Region 2 low / moderate activity accomplish center North , Northeast Midwest . To ensure representativeness characteristic center also take account characteristic : transplantation activity , university , presence multidisciplinary team . We arbitrarily make pre-selection center , consider question , invite participate study . The number patient per center set relation number patient follow . Patients randomly select regular office visit use routine computerize method previously define . Data Collection : Data collect 6-12 month directly register Research Electronic Data Capture ( RedCap ) system regular office visit transplant service , train professional . The RedCap safe internet program , create Vanderbilt University , design exclusively capture storage data power remotely trained people . The Federal University Juiz de Fora part consortium institution authorize use program . It allow data collect , organize stored action , make process data analysis ( http : //www.project-redcap.org/ ) . VARIABLES AND MEASUREMENTS We measure immunosuppressant NAd , use three method : self-report , blood assay , health care worker collateral reports.7,8 Associated condition collect medical file questionnaire Non-adherence immunosuppressive drug : 1 . Self-reported non adherence : It measure use four-item validate self-report The Basel Assessment Adherence Scale Immunosuppressive ( BAASIS ) recently validate Brazilian Portuguese group5 . 2 . Collateral report : In addition , use qualitative method measure adherence - collateral report . We ask nurse medical assistant directly responsible follow-up care KTx recipient score patient ' adherence one three category : good , fair poor . `` Good '' `` fair '' answer one professional classify patient non-adherent.8 3 . Blood assay : Patients´ adherence also measure check trough blood level immunosuppressive drug within therapeutic range.9 Composite adherence score : In order increase diagnostic accuracy , composite adherence score calculate base finding BAASIS , collateral report blood assay . Overall NAd define indication NAd one three methods.7,8 Risk factor NA : All five WHO dimension evaluate : socio-economic ( age - year ; gender ; race - self-defined , white ; high level education ; employment ; marital status - marry ; family income - per month ; patient-related ( smoke alcohol intake - yes , social , ability identify immunosuppressant use ) ; condition/disease-related ( time dialysis - month , dialysis modality - peritoneal hemodialysis preemptive transplant , post transplant time - month , previous acute rejection - record file , creatinine , actual chronic kidney disease ( -CKD ) stage , estimate CKD-EPI study formula ) , therapy/treatment-related ( donor - decease , living-related , living-unrelated donor graft ; number prescribed medication , number dose time ) healthcare system/healthcare worker-related factor ( city origin-same different transplant´s center , distance transplant center -in mile , private insurance - yes , subjective evaluation health worker ( physician nurse ; satisfy ) . Data collect medical file directly complementary questionnaire . STATISTICAL PROCEDURES Baseline characteristic describe continuous variable mean ± standard deviation median range whenever appropriate . Categorical variable represent frequency . For check normality sample , Kolmogorov-Smirnov Shapiro-Wilk test conduct . T-Test , Mann-Whitney Chi-square Fisher´s Tests use ass association explanatory variable adherence status . Multivariate Logistic Regression analysis perform assess association variable outcome adherence . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software v.19.0 Windows ( EUA , Chicago ) . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
