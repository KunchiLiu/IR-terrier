	<brief_title>Trabectedin First Line Therapy In Unfit Sarcoma Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue sarcoma group rare aggressive disease , comprise hundred different histological subtypes mainly originate embryonic mesoderm . Today , represent le 1 % adult cancer , incidence 3/100000/year median age diagnosis 65 year . Despite progress do last decade , approximately 50 % STS patient still develop distant metastasis within 3 year diagnosis die disease . Doxorubicin ( epirubicin ) ifosfamide prove active treatment STS widely use , alone combination , first line therapy locally advance metastatic patient . However , response rate combination regimen non-pretreated patient exceed 30-40 % , large randomize clinical trial fail demonstrate advantage survival combination compare single-agent treatment . Trabectedin ( Yondelis® ) marine-derived anticancer agent approve European Union single agent treatment STS patient failure standard chemotherapy ( doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide ) unsuited receive agent . Even response rate soft tissue sarcoma exceed 10 % , trabectedin provide significant clinical benefit , arrest disease progression almost 50 % treated patient , progression-free survival rate 20 % 6 month . Trabectedin find particularly active treatment myxoid liposarcoma uterine leiomyosarcoma , good result obtain term response rate survival , suggest histotype driven activity . The toxicity profile trabectedin give second line therapy widely assess clinical study largely manageable , majority adverse event grade 1 2 toxicity , generally reversible , dose time dependent noncumulative . The good tolerability profile observe trial seem confirm also everyday clinical practice . Conversely , data available moment tolerability profile patient treat trabectedin first line medical condition contraindicate use standard agent . The aim phase II study ass describe trabectedin toxicity profile subset negatively select advanced inoperable STS patient .</detailed_description>
