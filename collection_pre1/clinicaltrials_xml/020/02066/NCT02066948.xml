	<brief_summary>About two-thirds adult United States overweight obese likely adverse health consequence . A Moderate weight loss diet exercise recommend improve health . We interest know whether eat dietary protein different time day influence change body composition , muscle index health . The purpose study examine effect within-day pattern dietary protein intake ( even vs. skew ) energy-restriction resistance training-induced change body composition , muscle size , appetite , clinical health ( include blood glucose blood pressure ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>About two-thirds adult United States overweight obese . Obesity associate increase risk chronic disease metabolic syndrome reduce physical functioning capacity , contribute disproportionately high healthcare expenditures premature mortality . A moderate dietary energy restriction high protein diet recommend weight loss prevent improve medical complication associate obesity well improve body composition , include preserve lean body mass . Emerging research indicate consumption multiple high protein meal daily may superior consume one high-protein meal ( typically dinner ) stimulate muscle protein synthesis throughout day . This concept base research show pattern energy protein intake influence muscle protein synthesis whole body composition protein retention . Very limited research exist regard effect protein intake skeletal muscle size weight loss , currently , longitudinal study evaluate effectiveness consume even vs. skew distribution protein intake across meal phenotypic change skeletal muscle size longer-term . Recent study also suggest evenly distribute protein patterning may promote satiety improve blood glucose response healthy adult men woman . However , need control , longer-duration trial investigate effect daily protein distribution appetite , glucose response metabolic syndrome weight loss overweight obese adult . The goal propose research evaluate effect within-day pattern dietary protein intake ( even vs. skew ) energy-restriction resistance training-induced change body composition , skeletal muscle size , appetite , glucose response , metabolic syndrome parameter .</detailed_description>
