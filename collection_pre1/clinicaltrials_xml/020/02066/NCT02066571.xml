	<brief_summary>Since droxidopa approve Japan treat freeze gait Parkinson 's disease patient , confirm investigate safety efficacy use similar dose . The possible beneficial effect cognition mildly cognitively impaired Parkinson 's disease patient also test , since problem Parkinson 's disease may associate decreased brain synthesis norepinephrine ( neurotransmitter associate multiple brain function ) . During 11 week study , droxidopa slowly titrate 600 mg daily . Walking freeze gait evaluate rat . Cognitive function evaluate computer-based program .</brief_summary>
