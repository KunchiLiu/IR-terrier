	<brief_title>A Phase I Randomized Placebo-Controlled , Double-Blind Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity AERASâ€‘404 Administered Different Amounts Antigen Adjuvant Combinations HIV-Negative BCG-Vaccinated Adults Without Evidence Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This ia Phase I , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study three group healthy adult male sterile female BCG-vaccinated , HIV-negative , evidence tuberculosis infection . Sixty-four subject assign one eight treatment group receive one four different antigen/adjuvant combination study vaccine , placebo control . Within study group , subject randomize receive either single-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen study vaccine ( vaccination study vaccine Study Day 0 follow vaccination placebo control Study Day 56 ) two-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen study vaccine ( vaccination study vaccine Study Days 0 56 ) . All subject follow safety immunogenicity evaluation 182 day . The sample size specify study group select judged adequate preliminary safety immunogenicity evaluation Phase I study rather statistical reason . If SAE observe among 56 subject receive active study vaccine , approximation upper 95 % confidence bound rate SAE occurrence would 5.4 % .</detailed_description>
