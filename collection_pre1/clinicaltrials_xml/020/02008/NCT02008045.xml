	<detailed_description>In last two decade , major advance make clinical care premature term infant , include management sepsis respiratory compromise contribute neurological disability survivor . The incidence classic cystic periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) decline diffuse non-cystic pattern cerebral white matter injury predominant . Although multiple pathology occur premature infant , principal variety accounting predominance neurodevelopmental disability PVL . This disability low birth weight infant ( VLBW ) ( &lt; 1500 gram ) include cognitive/behavioral deficit 25-50 % cerebral palsy 5-10 % . Neuroimaging study VLBW survivor suggest cerebral palsy related focal necrotic lesion PVL , whereas cognitive/behavioral deficit correlate diffuse cerebral white matter injury . PVL define damage immature cerebral white matter periventricular focal necrosis ( `` focal '' component ) association diffuse reactive gliosis microglial activation surround white matter ( `` diffuse '' component ) . Of note , PVL occur late preterm infant term infant , particularly case congenital heart disease . The pathogenesis perinatal white matter injury currently think relate complex interaction maternal/fetal infection , cytokine hypoxia-ischemia result generation reactive oxygen specific agent ( oxidative stress ) , apoptotic oligodendrocyte cell death , axonal injury . In long-term survivor PVL , neuroimaging study often demonstrate reduced cerebral white matter volume , impaired myelination , ventriculomegaly reduce volume cerebral cortex , thalamus/basal ganglion cerebellum . In many long-term study , preterm child study normal cranial ultrasound . Cranial ultrasound , however , adequate assess non-cystic focal diffuse white matter injury . To date , longitudinal MR study preterm congenital heart disease infant correlate advanced neonatal MR image technique long-term neurodevelopmental outcome advance MR technique perform childhood period .</detailed_description>
