	<brief_title>Esophageal String Test Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) increasingly recognize rare disease child adult characterize symptom include nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , dysphagia food impaction occur conjunction esophageal eosinophilia . To date , method make EoE diagnosis follow treatment response EoE invasive endoscopy biopsy . While endoscopy generally safe , accurate , less invasive , inexpensive , comprehensive durable test urgently need determine therapeutic efficacy . To address need , investigator use novel application exist technology , Enterotestâ„¢ ( string-based test use detect intestinal Giardiasis ) , measure esophageal inflammation ( herein term Esophageal String Test - EST ) . The investigator supportive Preliminary Data provide proof-of-principle ability ESTs capture esophageal inflammatory mediator luminal sample patient affect EoE . The investigator prospective study demonstrates : ( 1 ) level eosinophil-derived granule protein ( MBP1 , EDN , ECP , EPX , CLC/Gal-10 ) esophageal mucosal biopsy correlate level quantitated EST-captured sample , i.e. , level luminal secretion capture EST correlate mucosal inflammation , ( 2 ) luminal biomarkers eosinophilic inflammation significantly correlate EoE disease activity . These finding provide strong support use ESTs novel minimally invasive instrument monitor therapeutic efficacy EoE . The global objective project therefore bring `` Esophageal String Test '' ( EST ) commercialization , use monitor therapeutic efficacy child adult EoE . The investigator hypothesize ESTs capture EoE Biomarker Panel ( EBP ) reflective disease activity . The Specific Aims : ( 1 ) Identify EoE Biomarker Panel ( EBP ) improve sensitivity specificity EST monitoring disease activity ( 2 ) Validate ability EST EBP monitor therapeutic efficacy 1-hour sampling time . The investigator supportive Preliminary Data demonstrate feasibility use ESTs child adult EoE measure disease activity ( esophageal inflammation ) overnight ( 12-hour ) test , short time period , currently perform schedule endoscopy biopsy . In project , The investigator propose shorten time frame 1-hour test , clinically relevant time point markedly facilitate use potential impact outpatient clinic setting . Public Health Relevance/Impacts : At least four major impact result study : ( 1 ) Identification EBP permit monitor esophageal inflammation EoE ; ( 2 ) EBP relevant follow disease progression , treatment response , management pathogenesis EoE , ( 3 ) validation EST EBP enable development rapid inexpensive assay follow treatment response , thus reduce number follow-up endoscopy biopsy currently perform , ( 4 ) provide device monitor EoE disease activity endoscopy biopsy may available affordable .</detailed_description>
