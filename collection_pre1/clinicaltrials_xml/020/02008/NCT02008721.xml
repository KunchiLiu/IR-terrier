	<brief_title>Progression Rate MSA Under EGCG Supplementation Anti-Aggregation-Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5 Introduction Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) slowly progress neurodegenerative disease characterize ) hypokinetic movement disorder defines MSA parkinsonian type ( MSA-P ) ii ) cerebellar symptom define MSA cerebellar type ( MSA-C ) . In types movement disorder accompany vegetative symptom orthostatic hypotension . In contrast Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , effect dopaminergic medication parkinsonian symptom limit . In spite several effort , disease modify therapy identify far . Several line evidence include epidemiological , vitro , vivo data , suggest Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) might able delay disease progression MSA modify several aspect pathogenesis MSA protein aggregation , oxidative stress iron accumulation . Therefore , study design investigate influence EGCG disease progression patient MSA . To assess effect disease progression , clinical evaluation MR-imaging apply bi-center , prospective , placebo-controlled , double-blind randomized phase III trial . The primary outcome measure change motor symptom V1 V7 measure UMSARS-ME compare placebo- vs. verum-treated patient . The secondary efficacy endpoint change V1 V7 total UMSARS score , CGI score MRI parameter ( global regional atrophy / iron deposition ) compare placebo- vs. verum-treated patient . 5.1 Background The disease : MSA synucleinopathy suitable various reason model disease investigate disease-modifying effect α-synuclein ( aSyn ) -dependent neurodegeneration . The disease progression rapid compare PD therefore allow observation clinically relevant effect short observation period . As potent symptomatic treatment MSA currently available , influence symptomatic active substance clinical data limit placebo use comparator . This solve potential ethical problem deprive patient symptomatic treatment study underline high medical need symptomatic treatment . Another important argument neuroprotection study MSA three independent study EMSA , NNIPPS , MEMSA similar disease progression observe defined period time , enables precise power analysis sample size follow-up period suitable investigator initiate trial ( IIT ) . The therapeutic target : An increase amount data suggest toxic oligomers misfolded , disease-specific protein play potentially important role neuronal cell death neurodegenerative disease . Specifically MSA , oligomeric aSyn aggregate specie appear crucially involve pathogenetic mechanism . The pharmacological compound : Epidemiological data suggest ingredient tea may neuroprotective synucleinopathies man . Regular consumption tea reduces risk contract PD 50 % . Also MSA , clear trend sense positive effect tea consumption risk disease development observe ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI : 0.22-1.5 , p = 0.09 ) . EGCG , polyphenol example find green tea , inhibit formation toxic aSyn oligomers vitro transforms aSyn oligomers direct interaction alternative , non-toxic oligomer specie . Furthermore , EGCG show neuroprotective effect 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin ( MPTP ) mouse model PD . In addition , EGCG antioxidant iron chelator therefore potential beneficial effect synucleinopathies . The pharmacokinetic property EGCG test human serum rodent serum organ , include brain detail . It find repeated oral application dose EGCG result significant increase serum level healthy adult compare single dose . The propose daily dose 1200 mg EGCG comparable 15 30 cup green tea ( depend mode preparation ) ( Prof. F. Paul , Berlin , pers . comm. ) . Animal experiment rodent show single i.v . dose EGCG , substance find brain significant quantity . 5.2 Trial Rationale MSA rapidly progressive disorder average survival time 7 year first clinical manifestation . No potent symptomatic treatment currently available . A disease-modifying therapy exist either . The grow understanding recent year underlie pathological mechanism disease allow development new treatment option modify effect disease progression . Therefore , treatment urgently require effect central underlying pathological mechanism , appear intracellular aggregation toxic oligomers aSyn . EGCG , polyphenol find green tea , show inhibit formation toxic aSyn oligomers vitro show transform aSyn-oligomers non-toxic oligomer specie . There also evidence neuroprotective effect MPTP-mouse model PD antioxidant iron chelator . There currently 63 clinical study EGCG apply various indication , Multiple Sclerosis , various form cancer Huntington 's disease . All show good tolerability safety apply dos EGCG 1200 mg per day , demonstrate safety drug control clinical condition . These data provide solid rationale test clinical trial supplementation EGCG interfere core disease mechanism MSA consequently retard clinical progression MSA-related disability . 5.3 Side effect Risk Benefit Assessment 5.3.1 Side effect In clinical trial investigate oral intake green tea/EGCG various dos pharmacological form , EGCG show good safety tolerability daily dose 1200 mg period 6 month . Side effect report application EGCG usually mild occur often placebo ( flatulence , headache , nausea , vertigo , abdominal cramp muscle pain ) . Other report side effect ( arterial hypertension , palpitation , headache , polyuria , tremor , sleep disorder , nausea/vomiting ) due caffeine part green tea due EGCG , study use pure EGCG report side effect . No relevant persistent change extensive clinical serum test find far ; also influence vital parameter report use EGCG . Only minimal transient change blood pressure , echocardiography , liver function test serum lipid report . In study Chow et al . healthy subject give 800 mg EGCG Polyphenon E ( mixture several green tea extract 50-75 % share EGCG ) daily 400 mg twice daily versus placebo period 4 week . Only mild side effect occur several subject ( flatulence , abdominal pain , nausea , headache , dizziness muscle pain ) occur often placebo . The SuniMS study , NCT ID : 00525668 , record SUSAR 120 patient remitting-relapsing MS , administer 800 mg Sunphenon/ EGCG per day . They also able show excellent tolerability . Only 15 patient show mild , clinically insignificant elevation liver function test , necessarily cause study medication . The ongoing SUPREMES study , NCT ID : 00799 , far record SUSAR 60 patient progressive MS 1200 mg EGCG/day 48 month . In study Chen et al significant protective effect orally apply EGCG could demonstrate mouse toxic liver failure cause tetrachlorohydrocarbons . Otherwise , single case hepatotoxicity follow application various form green tea polyphenols know . In period 1999 2008 , 34 case report publish , 29 show positive de-challenge 7 show positive re-challenge . The clinical pathological symptom include mild elevation liver function test , cholestasis , cholangitis , hepatocellular inflammation hepatocellular necrosis . The symptom usually completely reversible stop medication . One patient die liver failure . Signs liver toxicity record day 9 5 month begin therapy dose 187,5 -468,75mg EGCG/day ) . The withdrawal green tea extract Spain France ( Exolise® ) couple year ago needs mention . After application medication case severe hepatotoxicity report . Symptoms like icterus , massive elevation transaminase occur later 12 week begin treatment extract capsule completely reversible week stop medication . The exact underlying mechanism completely work . Possibly due SAE specific Exolise® , connect manufacturing process ( hydro-alcoholic extraction technique ) . For reason , distribution Exolise® stop respective authority , distribution green tea extract ( see also follow publication WHO ) : www.who.int/entity/medicines/publications/restrictedpharm2005.pdf It yet find part polyphenols metabolite responsible hepatotoxic effect . Even though case mixture green tea polyphenols administer suspect , EGCG main component green tea extract show hepatotoxic potential . In favor hypothesis fact , report elevate transaminase treatment EGCG man interaction substance . EGCG known bind α- β-estrogene receptor increase 17 β-estradiol-induced reaction mouse . EGCG known inhibitor Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) catalyse degradation exogenous endogenous substance . It suspect , biotransformation green tea catechines , COMT play important role . COMT polymorphisms low activity COMT could result elevate plasma level toxic EGCG metabolite . The cytotoxicity EGCG hepatocytes seem low vitro dose high multiple compare dos use clinical study lead liver necrosis animal model . Also , extremely low bioavailability man consider . On basis recent study use green tea extract EGCG report persistent severe influence physiological system ( blood circulation , respiratory system , central nervous system urinary tract ) . Still singular case report hepatotoxic effect context intake green tea extracts/ EGCG . As conclusion , data favor good tolerability substance . For detail see investigator 's brochure ( Polyphenon E ) . 5.3.2 Risk Benefit Assessment The report data suggest safe pharmacological profile apart individual case hepatotoxicity control routine serum liver parameter . The preclinical data suggest molecular mode action EGCG appear target core pathological mechanism active MSA . In absence effective symptomatic , protective curative intervention devastate disorder , risk benefit evaluation justifies conduct propose clinical trial .</detailed_description>
