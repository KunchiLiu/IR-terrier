	<brief_title>A Phase II Study EVEROLIMUS Patients With Primary Relapsed Chondrosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chondrosarcomas ( CHS ) represent 25 % bone sarcomas second frequent primary malignant type bone tumor . No effective systemic treatment identify advanced adjuvant phase CHS . As CHS relatively resistant chemo- radiotherapy , surgery remain primary treatment tumor type . The aim tumor resection obtain complete removal malignant lesion adequate margin take account tumor control functional reconstruction . However , consider particular localization CHS , wide resection ( i.e . R0 clear margin ) rarely achieve . Unfortunately , therapeutic option limit patient incomplete resection . In context , new therapeutic strategy need slow tumor progression reduce tumor size surgery . Increasing knowledge signal transduction pathway involve oncogenesis lead speculation component signal pathway could envisage novel target cancer therapy . Mammalian Target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) , lie downstream Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/B kinase protein ( PI3K/Akt ) pathway , play central role regulation cancer cell growth , suggest mTOR could attractive target anti-cancer therapy . The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal pathway intimately implicated sarcoma development progression . Indeed , mutation and/ overexpression one several component PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway often observed sarcoma . These alteration , locate upstream downstream mTOR , lead dysregulation mTOR pathway . mTOR inhibitor evaluation anticancer agent begin rapamycin analogue ( call rapalogs ) . Currently , mTOR inhibitor clinical development include temsirolimus ( CCI-779 , Torisel® , Wyeth Pharmaceuticals ) , everolimus ( RAD001 , Afinitor® , Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) , ridaforolimus ( AP23573 , ARIAD Pharmaceuticals ) . mTOR inhibitor find efficient various preclinical cancer model , example preclinical mouse model follicular thyroid cancer , everolimus induced significant decrease proliferation cancer cell . Two set recent data suggest inhibition mTOR pathway could effective systemic treatment chondrosarcoma . The first one case report describe impressive tumor response patient myxoid chondrosarcoma treat rapamycin combination cyclophosphamide . The second one concern nonclinical data generate institution . Using orthotopic rat chondrosarcoma model , show monotherapy everolimus inhibit chondrosarcoma proliferation evaluate Ki67 expression significantly reduce tumor volume . Importantly , give `` pseudo-adjuvant '' set follow R1 resection implant tumor , everolimus significantly delay tumor recurrence . These preclinical data provide strong rationale evaluate therapeutic potential everolimus neo-adjuvant adjuvant setting patient chondrosarcoma . In context , proposal investigator perform multicenter , randomize , Phase II study patient primary relapsed chondrosarcoma neo-adjuvant setting</detailed_description>
