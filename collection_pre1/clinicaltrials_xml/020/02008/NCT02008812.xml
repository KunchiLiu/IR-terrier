	<brief_summary>To develop real-time diagnostic technique Ad sensor Adenovirus detection , investigator conduct prospective clinical study . In comparison result direct sequence Adenovirus , investigator evaluate performance Ad sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . With technique , investigator hope make early diagnosis give Adenovirus patient early treatment reduce complication case-fatality rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ad Sensor-based Real-time Diagnosis Adenovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Sample acquirement： At National Taiwan University Hospital Taiwan , enroll patient Adenovirus infection . We take three throat swab patient : one viral isolation , one RT-PCR last Ad sensor - base real-time diagnosis . 2 . Ad sensor diagnosis： Ad sensor ( structural chip-based optosensing virus probe system ) , rapid sensitive detection viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics anti-Adenovirus Adenovirus antigen present patients'and normal sample . 3 . Gold standard： viral isolation RT-PCR</detailed_description>
