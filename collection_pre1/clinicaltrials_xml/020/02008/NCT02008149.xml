	<brief_summary>Following complete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , individual experience progressive bone loss , especially legs , 70 % person SCI sustain fracture point lifetime . Fractures follow SCI costly treat half patient experience medical complication , require extend hospitalization , result substantial impact quality life . To reduce incidence fracture , effective rehabilitation strategy prevent bone loss need . The goal research determine bone health preserve use indoor rowing exercise program leg muscle electrically stimulate use several , small surface electrode pad place skin front back thigh muscle . An encouraging case study recently show remarkable bone preservation one individual SCI participate electrical stimulation row program , however , whether individual SCI achieve benefit currently unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study investigator expect enroll total 10 participant SCI . Five participant assign Standard-of-Care ( control ) group five participant assign FES-rowing intervention group . Group assignment partly base preference potential participant willingness make necessary time commitment require participation give group , add goal , extent possible , match two group age , gender time since injury . Only individual strong desire participate regular exercise program express willingness travel VA Palo Alto necessary number time per week perform FES-rowing potential candidate inclusion row group . Bone density measurement Standard-of-Care group FES-rowing group perform use Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography ( pQCT ) . The Standard-of-Care group undergo research procedure . The muscle condition program accomplish electrical stimulation quadriceps hamstring muscle use 4-channel electrical stimulator applies stimulation use surface electrode adhere use gel skin overlie quadriceps hamstring muscle . The muscle strengthen initially take place three time per week , sixty minute per session , progress five session per week , approximately 8 week . The muscle strengthen program ensures subject sufficient muscle strength endurance embark row program . Following 8-week muscle strengthen program , subject begin FES-rowing , three session per week , thirty minute per session follow 28 week . In FES-rowing group , investigator measure isometric knee extension strength start week 0 , end week 12 , 24 36 . For row group , investigator capture 3D kinetics kinematics motion capture laboratory FES-rowing end week 12 , 24 36 . Kinematics row collect fifty passive retro-reflective marker place participant capture position orientation 12 interconnect body segment use represent subject .</detailed_description>
