	<brief_summary>There three part phase I study : 1 ) Combination Dose Finding cohort ; 2 ) Combination Expansion cohort ; 3 ) Monotherapy MET Amplified cohort . In Combination Dose Finding cohort Combination Expansion cohort , combine cabozantinib panitumumab patient KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . In Monotherapy MET Amplified cohort , screen least 50 patient MET gene amplification ( `` MET amplification '' ) . Patients MET amplification receive cabozantinib ( monotherapy ) . The primary objective open-label phase Ib trial : 1 . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose combination cabozantinib panitumumab patient KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer 2 . To identify objective response rate ( ORR ) cabozantinib monotherapy patient prospectively identify MET amplify metastatic colorectal cancer . The secondary objective : 1 . To describe non-dose limit toxicity cabozantinib panitumumab . 2 . To describe clinical activity ( ORR , PFS , OS ) cabozantinib panitumumab . 3 . To describe safety tolerability cabozantinib monotherapy patient MET amplify colorectal cancer . 4 . To describe clinical activity ( PFS , OS ) cabozantinib monotherapy patient MET amplify colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
