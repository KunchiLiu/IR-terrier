	<brief_summary>Genes basic `` instruction book '' cell make body make DNA . Many research study do find best possible way treat patient cancer . Recently great deal interest develop new anticancer agent target patient 's individual genetic information , well disease cause defect person 's gene . Identification precisely treatment use specific patient 's tumor challenging . In study , four cutting-edge technology use identify genomic ( information get DNA RNA ) proteomic ( information get protein ) target treatment tumor . These four test use together gather information tumor give doctor scientist well understanding structure tumor best treatment combination treatment may . The therapy receive treat tumor base medical history , previous treatment disease applicable , current state health , finding four test . The therapy ultimately receive select doctor consultation panel expert cancer cancer genomics ( Treatment Selection Committee ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Using Genomic &amp; Proteomic Profiling Influence Treatments Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DNA contain genetic information act blueprint part body make work , determine thing eye hair color . DNA make long strand repeat letter form code . The order letter write precise . In way spell mistake word could change mean entirely ( example , mean meat ) , single change sequence DNA lead change body work , may lead disease . Currently , researcher doctor know genetic change may result disease , know genetic change cause disease . Proteins basic building block body . The part body muscle , skin , organ make mostly proteins . DNA provide plan , instruction , protein make . If change DNA , may change protein make . Sometimes change lead disease . To make protein , cell body take DNA make copy call RNA . The cell read RNA make protein . DNA think original master plan RNA photocopy plan . The number copy RNA determine amount protein make . If body need protein , make RNA need less protein , also shred RNA read . The amount particular RNA protein also important body work . Too much little particular protein also lead disease . Understanding relationship DNA , RNA proteins important know cause disease treat . Identification precisely treatment use specific patient 's tumor challenging . In study , four cutting-edge technology use identify genomic ( information get DNA RNA ) proteomic ( information get protein ) target treatment tumor . These four test use together gather information tumor give doctor scientist well understanding structure tumor best treatment combination treatment may . The therapy receive treat tumor base medical history , previous treatment disease applicable , current state health , finding four test . The therapy ultimately receive select doctor consultation panel expert cancer cancer genomics ( Treatment Selection Committee ) . The purpose study examine impact target therapy breast cancer base upon proteomic genomic profile use four different method analysis . - Reverse Phase Protein Microarray use determine often specific protein could make tumor susceptible resistant treatment . - Immunohistochemistry look specific marker disease DNA . - RNA sequencing use help doctor scientist understand gene work . - Low pas whole genome exome sequencing use help identify variant DNA . The goal study enroll least 25 woman receive therapy influence result derive genomic proteomic profiling . Up 30 woman receive treatment suggest identified target 10 woman receive treatment subject doctor choose . The actual treatment disease base upon multiple factor , include current physical condition , prior therapy applicable , standard lab test , physician 's preference . The result genomic proteomic profiling add available information use aid u decide upon course therapy .</detailed_description>
