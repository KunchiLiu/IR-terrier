	<brief_title>MDMA-assisted Therapy Social Anxiety Autistic Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies suggest autistic adult great risk social anxiety . Social anxiety condition characterize fear scrutiny avoidance social interaction . Social anxiety frequently compound considerable social challenge experience autistic adult . There currently FDA-approved pharmacologic treatment autistic adult , although off-label prescription selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) rise population . Based known effect MDMA , well individual report autistic adult , exploratory study focus enhance functional skill underserved population , tend experience great anxiety , depression victimization typically develop adult . The main objective study collect safety data examine whether MDMA-assisted therapy tolerate estimate effect size symptom reduction social anxiety psychiatric symptom common adult autistic population evaluate standard clinical measure . The primary outcome measure change social anxiety level measure Lieberman Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) . Secondary measure include social anxiety , anxiety , depression , stress , self-esteem , emotion label recognition , empathy , quality life , blood level hormone oxytocin , arginine vasopressin cortisol . Each 12 subject participate two blind experimental session , assist either MDMA placebo last seven hour within brief course non-drug therapy . The non-drug therapy include three hour-long preparatory session start study three hour-long integrative session month experimental session two week interval . This study design dose escalation study assist exploration safety find effective dose population . Subjects assign MDMA group receive two three different dos , either 75mg , 100mg , 125 mg MDMA . Overall , eight subject ( 66.7 % ) randomize MDMA group four subject ( 33.3 % ) randomize placebo group . During study , maximum 24 experimental session MDMA , eight session dose group , eight experimental session placebo . Observations , , experimental session compare group equal size explore effect MDMA-assisted therapy first double The Principal Investigator evaluate subject confirm autistic status . In addition , autistic status confirm gold-standard diagnostic measure autism adult . Upon enrollment , subject meet study therapist three 1-hour preparatory session schedule within month prior first experimental session discus expect experimental session . In-person visit occur private room research facility . All in-person session video record . Video recording use research training purpose study . During experimental session , period structure unstructured interaction . The structured interaction select base element therapeutic intervention currently use population treatment social anxiety . An overnight stay hotel locate close site offered subject , accompany support partner , live 30 mile site night follow experimental session . Subjects attend 1-hour follow-up integrative therapy session day experimental session . Two additional integrative session conduct two week apart follow experimental session . During integrative session subject receive support integrating experience insights experimental session . The second experimental session schedule approximately one month first experimental session , outcome assessment complete . Biomarker level analyze determine MDMA-assisted therapy cause change modulators social behavior population previously demonstrate typically develop adult . Biomarker level analyze persist effect one month 6 month treatment . Blood sample obtain subject measure plasma OT , AVP CORT , use explore potential surrogate endpoint baseline , two hour drug administration second experimental session , one month second experimental session , 6-month follow-up . Social anxiety measure interview blind Independent Rater . Questionnaires measure anxiety , depression , self-esteem , emotion labeling , emotion recognition , stress , self-esteem give baseline throughout treatment . Quality life assess interview baseline 6-month follow .</detailed_description>
