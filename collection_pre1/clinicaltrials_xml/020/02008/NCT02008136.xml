	<brief_summary>This protocol prospective , open label , pilot study examine utility three establish pain questionnaire ( Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire two novel pain scale devise PI ) well relationship three novel quantitative tool measure effect botulinum toxin injection neck pain back pain . The three novel method measure neurotoxin effect : muscle twitch pattern use surface electromyography ( sEMG ) , cervical lumbar range motion use neck low back inclinometer , skin surface temperature reading use infrared imaging camera .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Approaches Evaluating Patients ' Response Botulinum Toxins Treatment Chronic Neck Pain Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Botulinum toxins well-established group neurotoxin wide variety FDA approve clinical us include muscle relaxation , headache prevention bladder control . Despite abundance anecdotal evidence support use pain management , double blind placebo control study examine efficacy botulinum toxins treatment chronic neck back pain report mixed finding . Several small study show significantly positive outcome study find efficacy neurotoxin compare placebo . The exist literature reveals negative outcome study base Visual Analogue Scale , purely subjective measure . We propose objective set measure might better reflect patient ' deficit level discomfort . Our proposal prospective , open-label , pilot study examine chronic neck back pain among veteran . Our primary specific aim test three novel method evaluate clinical deficit patient chronic neck back pain : electromyographical ( EMG ) activity ( primary outcome ) cervical/lumbar range motion ( CROM &amp; LROM ) ( primary outcome ) well skin surface temperature ( thermography ) ( secondary outcome ) . Our hypothesis patient chronic neck back pain significantly sustain muscle spasm . As result , patient may exhibit surplus EMG activity affect area due spontaneous muscle twitch . And consequently , may show sign decrease range motion due increase muscle tone . They may also experience rise skin surface temperature due excess heat production sustain muscle contraction . We measure three phenomenon use three different biophysical measurement tool . Electromyographic data collect surface EMG device , cervical lumbar range motion gravity inclinometer . Skin surface temperature assess medical grade digital thermography camera . The second specific aim study examine efficacy botulinum toxin reverse anomaly measure parameter : reduce excessive electromyographic activity , increase range motion cervical lumbar joint reduce elevate skin surface temperature . We measure outcomes 60 study subject ( 30 neck pain 30 low back pain ) treat botulinum toxin follow 1 month , 2 month 3 month . We also correlate finding commonly use pain function scale : Visual Analogue Scale , Neck Disability Index Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale .</detailed_description>
