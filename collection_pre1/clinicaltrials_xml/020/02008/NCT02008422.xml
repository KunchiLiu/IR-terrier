	<brief_summary>The primary objective control , single-center clinical study EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX protocols treat advanced gastric cancer evaluate clinical response rate Endostar injection concomitant SOX patient advance gastric cancer , observe progression-free survival time ( PFS ) tumor evaluate safety tolerance Endostar injection , secondary objective observe influence Endostar injection chemotherapy-induced adverse reaction evaluate overall survival time EndostarTM injection concomitant SOX patient advance gastric cancer evaluate response rate ( RR ) clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Endostar Injection Concomitant With SOX Protocols Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple pre-clinical study indicate dozen animal tumor model human tumor-metastatic mouse tumor model , effective rate Endostar 47 % ～91 % daily dosage 10～100mg/kg , cover human commonly see malignant tumor , lung cancer , gastric cancer , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , hepatic cancer , malignant melanoma non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , etc.. The development progression gastric cancer association angiogenesis . An animal research observe influence Endostar tumor strain nude mouse gastric cancer , result show tumor size shrunk rapidly expression VEGF , bFGF , VEGF-C , VEGFR-3 , bcl-2 PDGF decrease significantly treatment experimental group , demonstrate Endostar could reduce angiogenesis , increase tumor cell apoptosis inhibit tumor growth gastric cancer . An investigation small-sample Endostar concomitant chemotherapy patient advance gastric cancer primarily indicate efficacy feasibility Endostar concomitant chemotherapy treat gastric cancer . With expanded application Endostar clinic , also obtain certain effect treat patient lung cancer colorectal cancer . The safety , efficacy , evaluation relationship benefit risk common special population well modify dosage administration Endostar wide application explore provide sufficient scientifical basis safety , efficacy , applicable rule special population investigation optimal administrative protocol Endostar wide application . This control , single-center clinical study EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX protocols treat advanced gastric cancer conduct explore feasibility , efficacy safety Endostar concomitant SOX protocol , provide evidence-based medical basis clinical application Endostar .</detailed_description>
