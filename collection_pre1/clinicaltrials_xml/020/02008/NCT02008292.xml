	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure sensitivity NCFHEB binding change endogenous acetylcholine level healthy smoke nonsmoking subject , schizophrenic smoking nonsmoking subject . We hypothesize physostigmine-induced elevated ACh level lead reduction availability nicotinic receptor bind radioligand . We hypothesize great increase ACh level ( great reduction radio tracer bind ) smoking compare nonsmoking subject . We hypothesize great increase ACh level ( great reduction radio tracer bind ) smoking compare nonsmoking subject schizophrenia , extent change different control . We also measure sensitivity PHNO binding change dopamine level healthy smoke nonsmoking subject amphetamine challenge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Magnetic resonance image . Within approximately two week PET study , anatomical MRIs acquire Yale University MRI Center . Subjects take ferromagnetic metal detector enter scan room . The purpose MRI scan direct region interest placement low resolution PET image . The T1 weight image acquire 3 Tesla Siemens Scanner . There also additional rest state scan subject scanner , eye open , fixate cross . - Physostigmine challenge Physostigmine administer follow . Glycopyrrolate , cholinergic antagonist central side-effects , administer prior physostigmine challenge block physostigmine peripheral side-effects ( e.g . nausea ) . Subjects receive 200 mcg /ml x 1 ml glycopyrrolate IV . Physostigmine administer i.v . short half life 20 min peak plasma level 20-30 min post administration . The dose physostigmine administer preliminary data : 1.5 mg/hr 1 hr . Vital sign , include systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate respiration rate , monitor physostigmine 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 min begin infusion hourly end study day . Subjects question , , physostigmine challenge potential adverse reaction typical medication ( nausea , upset stomach , etc. , Risks section ) . [ If significant persistent drop subject ' heart rate ( &gt; 15 % least 1 min ) , IV physostigmine infusion stop subject continue monitor discharge discretion study doctor . In emergency situation , PET center protocol follow accordingly ( file HIC ) . - Amphetamine challenge On PHNO PET day , subject baseline PHNO scan receive amphetamine mouth ( 0.5mg/kg ) . Approximately 2.5 hour amphetamine administration , subject scan PHNO . - Positron emission tomography PET scan may perform High Resolution Research Tomograph ( HRRT , 2-3 mm resolution ) another similar camera . Venous catheter use i.v . administration radiotracer , venous blood sample AChE activity , administration glycopyrrolate physostigmine . A radial artery catheter insert experienced physician PET scan draw arterial blood sample metabolite analysis determination fraction plasma radioactivity unbound protein . At begin scan , subject 's head immobilize transmission scan obtain attenuation correction . PET scan acquire use bolus bolus infusion administration 10 millicurie NCFHEB PHNO . Dynamic image radioactivity concentration reconstruct correction attenuation , normalization , random event , scatter , deadtime . Subject motion correct automatically event-by-event basis Vicra motion track system . Vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse respiration ) collect prior PET scan . Urine pregnancy test administer PET scan day prior initiation imaging procedure . Smoking abstinence , appropriate , also confirm smoking subject prior PET scan . PET scan proceed follow aim : Aim 1 . Subjects ask come PET center two separate day participate one NCFHEB PET scan time assess test retest reproducibility bind parameter measure radiotracer . Aim 2 . Subjects participate one PET scan day . Aim 3 . Subjects Aim 2 able continue smoke abstinence ask come back another PET scan 6-8 week smoke abstinence . Aim 4 . Baseline NCFHEB PET image conduct followed administration physostigmine . Preferably , do day . However , time enough radiotracer subject able tolerate longer scan day . Therefore , subject may complete study two separate day ( preferably within 1 month apart base availability PET scan time subject 's schedule ) . Aim 5 . Baseline NCFHEB PET image conduct followed administration physostigmine . Preferably , do day . However , time enough radiotracer subject able tolerate longer scan day . Therefore , subject may complete study two separate day ( preferably within 1 month apart base availability PET scan time subject 's schedule ) . Control subject may participate 1 aim . For example , nonsmoking subject may complete Aim 1 chose , participate Aim 4 . Thus , subject may participate 4 PET scan protocol . Aim 7 . Subjects Aim 4 ask participate 2 PHNO PET scan amphetamine administration .</detailed_description>
