	<brief_title>A Safety Pharmacokinetics Study CNTO 3157 Healthy Japanese Caucasian Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither participant study staff know identity assign treatment ) , placebo-controlled study ( one study medication inactive ) investigate pharmacokinetics ( ie , body absorbs remove study drug ) safety subcutaneous ( administered skin ) ( SC ) CNTO 3157 ( drug currently investigate treatment asthma ) Japanese Caucasian men . Additionally , open-label cohort ( participant study staff know identity assign treatment ) Caucasian men investigate pharmacokinetics safety single intravenous ( vein ) ( IV ) infusion . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase , treatment phase ( comprise 2 day 1 night study center ) follow-up period ( comprise approximately 11 visit study center ) . During double-blind SC treatment period , participant randomly assign 1 3 treatment group : group 1 receive single SC injection 100 mg CNTO 3157 placebo ; group 2 receive 2 SC injection CNTO 3157 ( make total dose 300mg ) placebo ; group 3 receive 4 SC injection CNTO 3157 ( make total dose 600 mg ) placebo . Group 4 ( open-label cohort ) receive single IV infusion 300 mg CNTO 3157 . Participants enrol SC dose group sequentially low high dose level . The study sponsor study doctor review test result ( term safety tolerability ) group dose participant next treatment group ; review carry blinded manner . An equal number Japanese Caucasian participant assign SC treatment group form 2 subgroup within group ( group 1A , 1B , 2A , 2B , 3A 3B ) . Within SC treatment group , 10 participant randomly assign 4 1 ratio receive CNTO 3157 placebo . Only Caucasian participant enrol IV treatment group ( group 4 ) . For treatment group , blood urine sample take various time point study . Each participant take part study approximately 85 day . Participant safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
