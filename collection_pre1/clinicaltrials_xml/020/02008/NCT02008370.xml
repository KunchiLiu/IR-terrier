	<detailed_description>Title Study : Evaluation Efficacy EXPAREL Delivered Into Thoracotomy Chest Tube Sites After Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery Hypothesis : There difference , use analgesic length analgesia use Exparel infiltration compare regular bupivacaine . Objectives : The investigator presently use Exparel patient undergo minimally invasive cardiac surgery . The primary objective study assess efficacy EXPAREL deliver thoracotomy chest tube site provide prolonged postoperative analgesia patient undergo minimally invasive cardiac surgery . Efficacy assess : effectiveness analgesia measure subject 's overall postoperative pain score postsurgical analgesic use . The safety EXPAREL assess occurrence postsurgical adverse event serious adverse event Day 30 . Methodology : This prospective , open-label , non-randomized study evaluate effectiveness analgesia use 266 mg EXPAREL deliver thoracotomy chest tube site wide local infiltration . All patient study undergo minimally invasive cardiac surgery . The total dose EXPAREL thoracotomy chest tube sit 20 study subject . : 266 mg EXPAREL ( 13.3 mg/mL bupivacaine base ) . EXPAREL administer site . This total dose Exparel exceed subject . The thoracotomy chest tube site study perform immediately follow surgery . Fentanyl opioid permit intraoperatively . Post-operatively pain medication administer per standard care anesthesia care team need control patient 's pain . Patients access variety rescue analgesic appropriate route administration breakthrough pain ( e.g . opioids , acetaminophen , ketorolac , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ) accordance hospital stand order postsurgical pain management . Subject report pain record surgery 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 hour thoracotomy chest tube site infiltration ) , generally standard schedule post-hospital discharge visit approximately 10±5 day surgery . ( Subjects discharge hospital contact telephone record schedule pain assessment ) . Physician/healthcare professional assess pain record patient intubate unable communicate . Pain also assess time hospital discharge last assessment ( 10±5 day ) subject also ask overall satisfaction postsurgical analgesia Patients also ask report possible adverse event experience since hospital discharge . If Day 10±5 Day 30 , investigator make aware adverse evevts occur period time , also record case report form investigator feels event may relate study drug .</detailed_description>
