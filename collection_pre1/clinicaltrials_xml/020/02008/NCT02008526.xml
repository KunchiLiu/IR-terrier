	<brief_summary>Participants receive culturally relevant specifically tailor text message base behavioral change theoretical construct Social Support Theory , Health Belief Model , Social Cognitive Theory . Participants randomize one three condition 8-week intervention period : Group 1 : culturally relevant theory-based text message interactively transmit peer health educator ( TXT-PHE ) ; , Group 2 : culturally relevant theory-based text message transmit automation ( TXT-Auto ) ; , Group 3 : assessment-only ( AO ) control theoretically base text message . Participants three condition receive brief weekly text-message assessment methamphetamine use HIV sexual behavior previous seven day . Data related intervention cost well relative exposure theoretical construct examine determine cost- mechanism-effectiveness , respectively . The randomized three-group design use repeated assessment baseline , end 8-week intervention period , 3- , 6- , 9-month post randomization follow-up . This study determine differential immediate sustain effect transmit theory-based text message PHE ( TXT-PHE ) versus automation ( TXT-Auto ) , compare assessment-only ( AO ) control condition among out-of-treatment , methamphetamine-using MSM reduction methamphetamine use HIV sexual risk behavior . It hypothesize significantly great reduction methamphetamine use HIV sexual risk behavior text message transmit PHE text message transmit automation , turn produce significantly great reduction AO condition ( PHE &gt; TXT &gt; AO ) . In addition , study determine cost-effectiveness TXT-PHE vs. TXT-Auto compare AO reduce methamphetamine use HIV sexual risk behavior . The investigator hypothesize TXT-PHE intervention prove cost-effective TXT-Auto reduce methamphetamine use HIV sexual risk behavior , TXT-Auto condition prove cost effective AO condition reduce outcome ( PHE &gt; TXT &gt; AO ) .</brief_summary>
