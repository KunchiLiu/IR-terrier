	<brief_summary>The purpose study use Advisory/Automated Adaptive ( AAA ) Control system insulin delivery adult Type 1 Diabetes ( T1DM ) outpatient set evaluate system 's ability significantly improve blood glucose level . This protocol represent culmination prior clinical trial development AAA control system benefit synthesis component .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Feasibility Study Adaptive Advisory/Automated ( AAA ) Control Type 1 Diabetes ( Italy )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overall goal evaluate feasibility AAA control system compare , randomize cross-over study , three stage AAA Control ( Advice , Automation , Adaptation ) state-of-the art Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) -augmented insulin pump therapy supervise home-like setting . To achieve goal , study take place outpatient setting . To test feasibility `` bedside '' closed-loop control use approach comprise standard sensor-augmented pump therapy day use off-the-shelf device overnight closed-loop control use experimental device supervise outpatient setting . We hypothesize AAA control system prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia increase time within target ( 80-140 mg/dl ) overnight 5 consecutive night compare 5 consecutive night CGM-augmented pump alone . Additionally exploratory hypothesis overnight control lead improve time target day .</detailed_description>
