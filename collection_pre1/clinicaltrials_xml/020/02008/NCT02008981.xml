	<brief_title>Effect Herbal Products Platelet Function Clotting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct proper study provide evidence commonly use `` blood activating '' herbal preparation fact affect blood clot interfere platelet function clot mechanism potentiate antiplatelet activity Aspirin . These assumption base TCM theory , laboratory experiment animal study lead general statement medical literature herb increase bleed risk patient take Aspirin anti-platelet drug . This result advice herbal product take patient Aspirin , common drug take many patient . We hope prove disprove theoretical concern measurement platelet clot function healthy volunteer take herbal product , alone combination Aspirin . This help answer question whether safe patient take common `` blood -activating `` herbs alone together Aspirin . Healthy volunteer consecutively enrol 3 arm , study one herbal product 25 volunteer . The design involve take 3 follow combination : aspirin + placebo , herb + placebo , aspirin + herb , 3-week period , randomize order , 2 week wash-out 3-week period . Platelet function coagulation profile assayed</detailed_description>
