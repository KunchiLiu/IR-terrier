	<brief_summary>An emerge cause heart attack young woman dissection ( tear ) coronary artery . Many young woman continue chest pain long tear heal think due problem small blood vessel heart ( microcirculation ) . We want determine whether commonly use medication coronary artery disease include statin ( cholesterol ) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( blood pressure ) reduce chest pain improve small vessel function patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Statin Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor Symptoms Patients With SCAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient spontaneous coronary artery dissection ( SCAD ) , many continue ongoing sign symptom ischemia dissection heal . Further , 1 5 woman experience recurrent SCAD long-term follow-up . To date , study investigate pathophysiologic mechanism behind ongoing symptom recurrence SCAD , microvascular coronary dysfunction ( MCD ) suggest . Coronary reactivity test ( CRT ) invasive procedure currently do MCD patient gold standard technique . In particular , coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) &lt; 2.5 show diagnostic condition prognostic 2 fold increase risk cardiac event . Please see detailed description CRT . In brief , dual temperature pressure sensor tip wire Radi Medical Systems ( St Jude Medical , St Paul , MN ) place dissect non-dissected coronary artery patient . This measure CFR thermodilution also allow measurement index microcirculatory resistance ( IMR ) . IMR find correlate well true microvascular resistance . In addition lack diagnostic strategy , paucity research therapeutic strategy . Most woman conservatively manage medication , however , consensus pharmacologic therapy use . Case report suggest benefit antiplatelet agent ( e.g . aspirin ) beta-blockers ( reduction arterial wall shear stress ) . To date study investigate effect statins Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ( ACEIs ) SCAD patient . Both agent study MCD population find reduce angina frequency improve CFR 16 week . Purpose : To measure CFR IMR 40 SCAD patient ongoing chest pain least 3 month dissection determine proportion microvascular dysfunction investigate prospectively whether addition ACEI statin usual care patient ongoing chest pain CFR &lt; 3.0 improves chest pain frequency Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) 16 week compare placebo . Hypothesis : We hypothesize average CFR patient least 3 month SCAD &lt; 2.5 IMR abnormal . Further , hypothesize addition either ACEI and/or statin improve chest pain frequency least 20 point SAQ 16 week compare placebo .</detailed_description>
