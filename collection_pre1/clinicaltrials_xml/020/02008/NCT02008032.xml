	<brief_title>Comparison Stationary Breast Tomosynthesis 2-D Digital Mammography Patients With Breast Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit assistance refer physician patient undergo routine mammography breast image clinic . All eligible woman contact letter and/or phone call prior schedule mammography appointment identify would interest participate research study . On day conventional mammographic imaging , study explain , offer opportunity participate . Consent happen private room mammography clinic . Once consent sign , urine sample collect woman still become pregnant order complete pregnancy test . Women pregnant unable participate study . Women consent study escort research coordinator dress room , subject change gown . The research coordinator research technologist escort participant dedicate study room image exam . The patient SDBT study perform similar manner conventional mammography mediolateral oblique cranio-caudal plane . The participant stand mammography research technologist , ensure patient comfort , assist position breast breast tomosynthesis unit standard compression . Once position , total scan time approximately 10 second . Both leave right breast image . The length time position examination subject 's breast may vary expect entire imaging procedure take 5-10 min , include positioning time . The breast tomosynthesis scan acquire dose equal less diagnostic mammogram dose . Upon completion breast tomosynthesis exam , research assistant provide short survey complete patient ( less 5 minute ) . The survey include question comfort level s-DBT compare standard mammography . The research SDBT exam NOT interpreted prior patient leave clinic . However , since theoretically possibility detect additional lesion see conventional mammography , image review within week qualify breast image specialist . If lesion concern , discuss refer surgeon patient 's primary physician . After completion patient acquisition , reader study perform five qualified radiologist .</detailed_description>
