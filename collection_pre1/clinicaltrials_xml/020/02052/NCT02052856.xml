	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate incidence degree bone tunnel widen two group undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery . The two group undergone different graft fixation method : interference screw/suspensory button fixation hybrid technique , all-inside suspensory method fixation . Tunnels create time surgery graft placement fixation , know enlarge post-operatively . Little study relatively new all-inside technique . X-rays operative knee use assess tunnel width . Secondary outcome include clinical evaluation outcome scoring questionnaire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Tunnel Widening Comparing All-inside Interference Screw Fixation Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose The purpose study compare cohort patient undergone anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstructive surgery perform use either interference screw fixation suspensory button fixation hybrid technique , another cohort patient undergone all-inside suspensory method fixation . We plan evaluate incidence degree bone tunnel widen two group . This consist two x-rays operative knee anteroposterior lateral view , 1 2 year follow-up . 2 . Hypothesis Our hypothesis all-inside technique use suspensory button fixation result less tunnel widening compare hybrid technique use interference screw suspensory button fixation . With all-inside technique use anatomic anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) position less potential `` bungee-cord effect '' `` windshield-wiper effect '' previously see vertical transtibial tunnel technique . Using technique , short tunnel closer fixation point result less graft motion cause tunnel widening . This contrast interference screw technique feel enlarge tunnel size mechanically upon insertion . 3 . Justification There many describe technique anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction surgery . This include graft option , tunnel position fixation method . Over last year , placement femoral tibial tunnel evolve isometric position anatomic position . The fixation method vary interference screw fixation , suspensory button fixation trans-fix pin fixation . What see isometric tunnel position issue tunnel widen . This associate graft failure increase knee laxity . Tunnel widen also lead insufficient bone stock complicate revision surgery potentially require 2-stage procedure bone graft . Tunnel widen show interference screw endobutton fixation past . More recently , new instrumentation all-inside technique utilized institution potential benefit include prevention tunnel widening . 4 . Objectives The primary outcome study radiographic assessment tunnel width femoral tibial tunnel . X-rays take anteroposterior lateral view assess tunnel width . X-rays take 1 2 year follow-up follow surgery . Tunnel width measure perpendicular tunnel base sclerotic margin . 3 separate measurement , space 5 mm apart , take AP lateral view . The centre measurement base location great width . An average measurement calculate used calculate bone tunnel enlargement . 5 . Research Methods We plan review last 60 patient undergone anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstructive surgery ( 30 study arm ) perform either technique 3 orthopedic surgeon subspecialty train arthroscopic knee surgery use similar technique . All surgery perform one center November 2012 present . All patient anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) surgery institution enter data registry include : patient demographic anterior cruciate ligament Quality life outcome score . We plan analyze data include surgical data graft tunnel size , fixation method post-operative radiograph . Post-operative radiograph take one two year follow-up ass tunnel width . Clinical assessment , knee ligament arthrometry ( KT-1000 ) measurement , outcome measure score , anterior cruciate ligament ( Quality Life ) , Lysholm International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) also take visit . Written , inform consent obtain patient prior enter study .</detailed_description>
