	<brief_title>Egg Ingestion Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Inclusion egg diet individual Type 2 diabetes mellitus improve glycemic control , anthropometric measure overall diet quality . Restriction dietary cholesterol , thus avoidance restriction egg intake , routinely recommended patient increase risk CVD , include diabetes . However , relative importance dietary cholesterol serum lipid role egg ingestion cardiovascular risk increasingly suspect . Further , exclusion egg diet may lead increased consumption high-glycemic carbohydrate food particular potential harm individual diabetes . The examination food-specific recommendation translate effect food choice overall diet quality , turn health effect , neglected area research . Eggs provide complete profile amino acid array micronutrient , low total fat . Although epidemiological clinical study largely suggest lack association egg intake harmful effect , evidence somewhat ambiguous regard glycemic control diabetes , risk CVD among individual diabetes . Our prior work show adverse effect egg ingestion healthy adult , hyperlipidemic adult , adult establish coronary artery disease . As satiate protein-rich food , eggs potential foster calorie weight control , reduce dietary glycemic load , offer potential advantage Type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
