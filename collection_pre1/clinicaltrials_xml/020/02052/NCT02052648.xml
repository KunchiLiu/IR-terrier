	<brief_summary>In study , investigator conduct phase I/II trial recurrent ( temozolomide resistant ) glioma patient . The overall goal study provide foundation future study indoximod test newly diagnose glioblastoma patient radiation temozolomide , combination vaccine therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study IDO Inhibitor Temozolomide Adult Patients With Primary Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study identify safety profile recommend dose phase 2 study combination indoximod ( portion 1 , phase 1b study ) . Investigators evaluate tolerability preliminary activity patient recurrent GBM three different situation : - Combination indoximod temozolomide ( bevacizumab-naive patient ) - Combination indoximod temozolomide bevacizumab - Combination indoximod temozolomide stereotactic radiation . Ancillary study conduct assess correlation intra-tumoral IDO expression serum biomarkers ( immune monitoring ) treatment efficacy . If current study show acceptable safety profile suggest preliminary evidence activity , provide justification subsequent randomize phase 2 study refractory glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme ( WHO grade IV glioma ) gliosarcoma . In addition , Phase 1b cohort include patient progressive WHO grade III glioma . There must image confirmation ( without gadolinium contrast ) tumor progression regrowth . Patients eligible original histology lower grade glioma subsequent diagnosis glioblastoma gliosarcoma make . Unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression MRI . It understand patient may resect prior enrol onto protocol Patients must complete course radiation therapy least 2 adjuvant cycle temozolomide phase 2 component . Patients enrol onto Cohort 2b take bevacizumab must least 28 day washout previous administration bevacizumab . It prefer patient fail bevacizumab prior trial entry remain bevacizumab trial . Prior temozolomide require phase 1 component ; prior radiation require phase 1 arm . It suggest ( require ) patient least 3 month post radiation reduce chance pseudoprogression . Patients must steroid dose less equal 2 mg dexamethasone daily ( equivalent ) , dose must increase least 14 day prior obtain enrollment . ECOG performance status ≤1 Karnofsky ≥70 % . Age 16 Normal organ function , include adequate : Bone marrow function define follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Renal function ( creatinine level within normal institutional limit , creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal ) . Liver function ( AST/ALT ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal , Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN , INR within 1.5 time ULN ( receive anticoagulant therapy INR ≤ 3.0 allow concomitant increase PT aPTT ≤ 2.5 × control ) . Must 28 day administration investigational agent prior cytotoxic therapy follow exception : Must 14 day administration noncytotoxic agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab ( except COHORT 2b ) , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , etc. ) . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy , Gliadel wafer , stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation progressive disease , rather radiation necrosis , PET scanning , Thallium scanning , MRI spectroscopy , surgical documentation . The effect indoximod develop human fetus unknown . For reason indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance fetus , sexually active woman childbearing potential must agree use two form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Use contraception abstinence continue minimum 1 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , discontinue study drug inform treat physician immediately . Also men discourage father child treatment . Prior invasive malignancy lowgrade glioma , highgrade glioma , glioblastoma , gliosarcoma ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) unless patient disease free therapy disease minimum 3 year . Patients phase 2 portion study may 2 prior regimen recurrent disease glioblastoma/gliosarcoma . Patients phase 1 portion study may 3 prior regimen . Active systemic infection require treatment , include HIV infection toxoplasmosis . Systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 2 mg dexamethasone daily ( equivalent ) study enrollment . Baseline QTc interval &gt; 470 study entry patient congenital long QT syndrome . Systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 2 mg dexamethasone daily ( equivalent ) study enrollment Patients significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol must legally authorize representative ( LAR ) willing participate support patient throughout trial . Affected patient without LAR exclude participation . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Active history autoimmune disease Pregnant woman exclude study , pregnancy confirm positive serum hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) ; breastfeed discontinue . Patients know autoimmune thyroid disease positive antiTPO antibody ( antiThyroid Peroxidase ) time screen .</criteria>
