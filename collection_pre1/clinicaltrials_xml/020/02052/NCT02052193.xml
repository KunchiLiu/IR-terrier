	<brief_summary>The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib vemurafenib belong two new class potent anti-cancer drug highly efficacious tumor harbor BRAF V600E mutation . Both drug seem equally efficacious ; however , toxicity profile seem differ . Serious phototoxicity observe ~ 30 % patient treat vemurafenib ~2 percent patient treat dabrafenib . These phototoxic reaction develop spite informing patient possible adverse event instruct protect . Manifestation phototoxic reaction depend patient 's habit exposure effort protect . The true frequency photosensitivity establish systematic photo-testing . In dermatology , standard test procedure different UV-wavelengths dosage establish primary goal study clarify true rate photosensitivity two BRAF-inhibitors . Furthermore , systematic experience collect best protect patient phototoxic event . Dabrafenib Vemurafenib commercially available consider standard care BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma Germany . As number patient allow conclusion regard efficacy safety vemurafenib , patient randomize vemurafenib part 2 remain study completion phototesting .</brief_summary>
