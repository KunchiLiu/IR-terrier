	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see difference African-American Caucasian girl Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) body respond type sugar , call glucose , body 's main source energy . PCOS one common endocrine disorder among female . Features include anovulation ( egg release ovary ) result irregular menstrual period , excessive amount androgenic ( male ) hormones result acne hirsutism ( excessive hair growth face body ) , polycystic ovary ( small sac-like structure [ cyst ] ovary ) see ultrasound . Girls PCOS also high level insulin body ( call hyperinsulinism ) able use insulin well ( call insulin resistance ) result increase risk diabetes . Diabetes high level glucose ( sugar ) blood . Many study look body respond glucose show compare Caucasians , healthy African-Americans produce much insulin ( hyperinsulinism ) able use well ( insulin resistance ) childhood , adolescence , adulthood . Insulin hormone help glucose move blood muscle body use energy . PCOS associate increased level insulin ( hyperinsulinism ) able use well ( insulin resistance ) . So want see difference insulin production ( secretion ) insulin resistance African-Americans Caucasians girl PCOS . To , look blood glucose insulin level response give glucose African-American Caucasian girl PCOS . The result study may ultimately help effectively target treatment therapy individual PCOS increase insulin secretion and/or increase insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Differences Between African-American Caucasian Female Adolescents With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCOS common endocrine abnormality reproductive-aged woman United States , affect approximately 5 million woman ( 1 ) . The exact prevalence PCOS adolescent population unknown mainly attribute diagnostic challenge PCOS present characteristic normal puberty overlap sign symptom PCOS ( 2 ) . The key feature PCOS include menstrual irregularity , hyper¬androgenism , polycystic ovarian morphology ultrasound . However , clinical presentation may vary . It complex heterogeneous condition life-long psychological , reproductive , metabolic manifestation impact woman 's health throughout lifespan . PCOS associate major metabolic consequence include hyperinsulinism ( i.e . increase insulin secretion ) , insulin resistance ( i.e . decrease insulin sensitivity ) , obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease , endothelial dysfunction , defective fibrino¬lysis , well endometrial carcinoma ( 3 ) . Particular disease process show predilection certain racial ethnic group . African-American [ AA ] adult increase risk obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease mortality , hyper¬tension compare Caucasian [ CA ] adult . Past study ( 4-9 ) find AAs increase insulin secretion decrease insulin sensitivity compare CA counterpart adolescence adulthood even childhood . These finding secondary combination increase insulin secretion resistance decrease insulin sensitivity clearance note African-Americans . It combination alter glucose metabolism place AAs increase risk cardiovascular metabolic morbidity . It propose hyperinsulinism increase insulin secretion compensatory response pancreatic β-cell increase insulin resistance . However , also speculate insulin resistance compensatory response occur response insulin hyper-secretion cause pancreatic β-cell dysregulation ( 10-11 ) . Hyperinsulinism insulin resistance know inherent feature PCOS . Several study demonstrate significant hyperinsulinism insulin resistance lower insulin sensitivity adolescent adult PCOS compare BMI-matched healthy control subject ( 12-18 ) . Marked difference insulin sensitivity/resistance PCOS phenotype report adult different races/ethnicities PCOS ( 19-23 ) , however ; study refute claim ( 24-27 ) . The objective study examine difference insulin secretion AA CA adolescent PCOS . We also examine difference insulin sensitivity/resistance AA CA adolescent PCOS . Primary Aim : To determine influence racial/ethnic background insulin secretion adolescent female PCOS . Secondary Aim : To determine influence racial/ethnic background insulin sensitivity/resistance adolescent female PCOS . Hypothesis : AA adolescent female PCOS increase insulin secretion decrease insulin sensitivity ( i.e . increase insulin resistance ) compare CA adolescent female PCOS . To address hypothesis , utilize one gold standard endorse American Diabetes Association satisfactorily assess insulin secretion insulin sensitivity/resistance . The method utilized study frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test minimal model analysis ( MINMOD FSIVGTT ) ( 28-32 ) . Using data gather part primary secondary aim , also conduct exploratory analysis examine influence PCOS phenotype insulin secretion insulin sensitivity/resistance influence racial/ethnic background PCOS phenotype .</detailed_description>
