	<brief_title>Reducing Inappropriate Prescribing Psychiatric Patients Using Nurse-led Medication Reviews</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies indicate potential inappropriate prescribing ( PIP ) associate high number admission , increase morbidity mortality medication review might decrease prevalence PIP . PIP investigate elderly population , knowledge , never psychiatric , general population . There grow body evidence effect medication review little research effect medication review psychiatric population . Medication review time consume task require extensive clinical knowledge individual patient well pharmacology . Healthcare system across world look improve quality safety few economic resource medication review introduce obligatory hospital institution . This call alternative use exist resource . Nurses direct patient contact study investigate potential role nurse improve medication quality medication safety . Administration af drug observation effect sideeffects drug already important aspect nursing . Therefore purpose study evaluate effect nurse-led medication review control interventional study . Outcome measure include prevalence , type severity identify PIP well proportion identify PIP lead change prescription physician . Definitions In study PIP define - The use drug know risk en adverse drug event evidence less risky , equally effective drug treat condition exists . - PIP include use drug higher frequency long duration indicate , concurrent use drug know drug-drug interaction interaction drug underlying disease . - PIP also include omission drug clinically indicate contraindication know . Design Prospective , control before- study 2 acute psychiatric ward select intervention control . Ahead intervention nurse receive pharmacological training instruction perform medication review . The patient include consecutively . Data The nurse interventional ward perform medication review patient see attend physician thus receive usual care . This procedure choose patient admit one ward . With medication review nurse fill structure paper form observation . The nurse also register whether intervention physician base - part base - nurse observation Data analysis Primary outcome difference proportion patient receive PIPs two ward . Two senior clinical pharmacologist also perform medication review include patient . These medication review serve golden standard quality nurse-led medication review evaluate . Secondary outcome analysis proportion PIPs identify nurse proportion PIPs end intervention prescribe physician . Power calculations The investigator anticipate prevalence PIP 30 % among psychiatric patient expectation reduction 15 % PIP due nurse-led medication review . Based assumption need 120 patient group order sufficiently identify difference ( risk type 1 error - 5 % power 80 % )</detailed_description>
