	<brief_summary>This methodology study examine quantification GSK2634673F binding human , aim characterise robust , non-invasive method quantify specific bind signal alpha ( V ) beta6 protein human tissue . This first time micro-dose ligand administer human . The study consist three part ; Part A , Part B Part C. Healthy subject recruit Parts A B study order gain experience GSK2634673F positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligand optimise scan procedure prior administration IPF patient Part C .</brief_summary>
