	<brief_summary>Activated macrophage , present excess natural inflammatory response , bear potential kill eradicate cancer cell . Macrophage activation demonstrate require serum-borne vitamin D binding protein ( know Gc protein ) , well B T lymphocytes . However , various cancer patient Gc protein deglycosylated serum α-N-acetyl galactosaminidase ( Nagalase ) secrete cancer cell . This deglycosylated Gc protein , lack N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharide , convert form Macrophage Activating Factor , lead immunosuppression rather Macrophage activation cancer cell . Efranat develop cancer immunotherapy base Macrophage Activating Factor produce natural Gc protein extract FDA approve healthy human plasma . In phase I study , treatment give Intramuscular , once-weekly injection EF-022 , two course , course comprise 4 injection . The investigational treatment expect enhance immune response , thereby , improve patient 's well , quality life disease control . Primary objective : 1 . To determine safety tolerability EF-022 define maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) potential administration . 2 . To identify Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) EF-022 . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine 'Recommended Phase 2 Dose ' ( RP2D ) base MTD data , immunological pharmacodynamics marker 2 . To explore preliminary efficacy EF-022 advance solid tumor accord 'Response Evaluation Criteria modify Solid Tumors ' ( RECIST 1.1 ) blood level tumor-related marker know reflect tumor burden . Exploratory objective : 1 . To assess level immune-related factor peripheral blood ( determined FACS analysis ) , reflect induced immunological activity , include limit , natural killer ( NK ) , monocyte ( M1 M2 ) T cell subpopulation ( effector v regulatory , CD4+ CD8+ cell ) , B cell ( CD20 ) , myeloid dendritic cell etc . 2 . To assess change serum level protein biomarkers blood . 3 . To immunohistochemically assess compare tumor derive tissue sample Pre post treatment . To analyze infiltration different population cell tumor bed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study EF-022 ( Modified Vitamin D Binding Protein Macrophage Activator ) Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 : Eligible subject assign , successively order accrual , one three cohort , receive intramuscular ( IM ) injection EF-022 , weekly two course treatment . Each course consist 4 injection one week interval ( total : 8 week treatment ) . Dose escalation proceed absence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) course 1 . For purpose , cohort begin first course EF-022 cohort precede successfully complete first 4-week treatment course without sign DLT . During first course , 1/3 patient experience DLT , dose escalation next cohort authorize ; next cohort receive dose one preceding . If 2 patient patient treat give dose develop DLT , dose escalation halt patient treat DLT dose . The value MTD define EF-022 dose dose DLT see least 2 subject . Upon determination MTD , additional cohort open ( confirmatory cohort ) treat two course dose . Part 2 : During expand cohort , 24 Patients allocate receive either 100ng , 500ng 1000ng weekly treatment detail : The first 18 patient assign alternate dos either 100ng 500ng sequential manner ( patient assign single dose ) , caveat give indication assign equally , much possible , two dos . Interim analysis perform 12th patient reach Day 57 CT result well PD analysis available least 12 patient , least 18 patient begin study treatment . A decision regard add 1000ng dose cohort vs. continue 100ng 500ng dos base discussion interim analysis result . Each patient receive 2 course treatment , i.e . weekly injection total period 8 week , follow follow-up period 12 month start treatment ( Day 1 ) . Continuation treatment second course discretion investigator . Patients continue extend treatment post course 2 keep weekly injection dosage mode continue therapy disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , non-compliance , inter-current illness prevents treatment continuation , withdrawal consent , change subject condition render subject unacceptable treatment . All study patient complete least two course treatment follow 12 month day 1 treatment .</detailed_description>
