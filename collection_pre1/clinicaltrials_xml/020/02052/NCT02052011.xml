	<brief_title>Ranolazine Microvascular Angina PET Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Yale Chest Pain Center ( CPC ) unique clinical lab provide integrated interdisciplinary research team , access high volume chest pain patient largely free coronary disease ( 93 % ) well state art diagnostics include cardiac PET sophisticated system serum processing banking facility . The CPC cohort represent unique population unrecognized microvascular disease often accessible ED . We propose one-year pilot study understand mechanism angina relief Ranolazine ( n=20 ) patient microvessel disease ED population compare control ( n=10 ) baseline 1-month . In addition , change pain score function measure Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) , recidivism cost measure correlated change coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) . Serum sample obtain banked future marker analysis intermediate surrogate outcomes . Primary aim : To compare change coronary flow reserve measure cardiac PET patient receive Ranolazine versus control . Secondary aim : To determine Ranolazine change Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) score association change Coronary Flow Reserve ( CFR ) versus control . Exploratory aim : To compare composite rate return visit ( office , emergency department hospitalization ) chest pain within 4-weeks enrollment patient without Ranolazine .</detailed_description>
