	<brief_summary>In endotracheal intubation , essential trachea intubate esophagus . In suboptimal situation ( outside operating theatre ) , malpositioning endotracheal tube occur frequently often fatal . The diagnostic tool available operate theatre appropriate out-of-hospital situation several reason . Moreover , method mostly take time provide desire information n't optimal specificity sensitivity . In order allow fast diagnosis potentially fatal complication , develop fully-automatic detection device diagnose endotracheal tube malpositioning within 2 second . A high sensitivity/specificity algorithm waveform-analysis demonstrate healthy patient patient pulmonary disease ( decrease pulmonary compliance ) . A new stand-alone device integrate sensor microprocessor develop give immediate diagnosis , store data subsequent research purpose . This device evaluate perioperative situation demonstrate high sensitivity specificity patient clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The fundamental algorithm waveform analysis unchanged , additional detection algorithm incorporate improved detection ventilation effort . In addition , sensor integrate , automatic feedback electronics improve , device make user friendly appropriate out-of-hospital situation demand environment . In addition , waveform record later analysis evaluation diagnostic value thoracic push ( gentle push sternum ) detect tube position .</detailed_description>
