	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety TAS-120 determine appropriate dose subsequent phase 2 safety efficacy study patient advance solid tumor multiple myeloma genetic abnormality . The progression cancer cause complex series multiple genetic molecular event leading change patient DNA . The fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGF/FGFR ) signal pathway important normal organ , vascular skeletal development . However , FGFR gene abnormality link various cancer . TAS-120 highly potent , selective small molecule inhibitor FGFR therefore study therapy cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Finding Study Followed Safety Efficacy Study Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Multiple Myeloma With FGF/FGFR-Related Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale study : - Activating fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) gene abnormality report various cancer include non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( FGFR1 amplification ) , breast ( FGFR1 2 amplification ) , gastric ( FGFR2 amplification ) , bladder ( FGFR3 activate mutation gene translocation ) , endometrial ( FGFR2 activate mutation ) , multiple myeloma ( FGFR3 gene translocation ) , rhabdomyosarcoma ( FGFR4-activating mutation ) . - TAS-120 novel , highly potent selective small molecule FGFR inhibitor . Phase 1 Dose Escalation : Primary • To investigate safety determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) TAS-120 patient advance solid tumor without FGF/FGFR abnormality available therapy likely convey clinical benefit . Secondary - To investigate clinical pharmacokinetics ( PK ) TAS-120 . - To investigate clinical pharmacodynamics TAS-120 . - To determine preliminary antitumor activity observe TAS-120 . Phase 1 Expansion Phase 2 : Primary •To investigate efficacy TAS-120 RP2D patient advance solid tumor multiple myeloma , FGF/FGFR abnormalities available therapy likely convey clinical benefit . Secondary •To investigate safety TAS-120 .</detailed_description>
