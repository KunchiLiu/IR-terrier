	<brief_summary>In study compare health effect two different meal pattern . In one subject consume food accord 'irregular meal pattern ' ( 3-9 meals/day ) 'regular meal pattern ' ( 6 meals/day ) two week . The energy requirement subject calculate maintain body weight study . Participants provide food consume study . Initially , subject attend screen visit complete questionnaires medical health , eat habit physical activity . Height , weight waist circumference measure visit . Thereafter , subject assign 2-wk period follow one two meal-patterns . There 2-week period two intervention subject consume normal diet end , participant undertake next meal pattern . During two phase participant ask wear armband , detect movement measure heat loss , assess energy expenditure blood glucose monitoring device wear three day . Before 2-week intervention , subject come lab give test drink blood sample obtain evaluate health effect meal pattern . Energy expenditure measure indirect calorimetry . They offer ad-libitum meal ask eat feel comfortably full . During 2-week period , participant ask record food intake record appetite sensation specific day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Constancy Daily Meal Pattern Energy Balance , Glucose Profiles Appetite Healthy Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Previous work laboratory show potentially important negative health consequence associate irregular eating . Greater fast level total-cholesterol LDL-cholesterol , decrease meal induced thermogenesis , great insulin response test drink , observe healthy woman follow two-week period irregular meal pattern ( variable number daily meal ; 3 9 ) ; contrast regular pattern six daily meal . In addition great energy intake self-reported irregular compare regular meal pattern . Subsequent study confirm effect overweight subject also provide evidence alteration subjective appetite may influence ad-libitum food intake . The present project study normal weight subject , incorporate energy expenditure measurement free living condition use novel technique ( SenseWear armband , SWA ) , continuous glucose monitor , obtain detailed information appetite food intake . Aims : To investigate effect regular irregular meal pattern energy expenditure , energy intake , , Glucose profile subjective appetite healthy normal weight woman . Experimental protocol method : Normal weight woman ( BMI 18.5-25 ) otherwise healthy study early phase menstrual cycle ( first week ) . Subjects initially screen complete 7 day food diary participating study last total 6 week . During first 2 week participant adopt one two meal pattern , follow two-week washout period habitual diet meal pattern , undertake second 2-week intervention follow second meal pattern . The meal pattern 1 ) regular - 6 daily meal snack 2 week , 2 ) irregular - different number ( 3 9 ) meals/snacks every day . All food consume weeks1 , 2 , 5 6 provide free charge , comprise food commonly consume British diet amount design keep body weight constant study . Participants complete food diary study period . Subjects wear SenseWare device ( attach upper arm ) allow physical activity energy expenditure estimate weeks1 , 2 , 5 6 . Subjects attend lab 6th day intervention phase continuous glucose monitoring probe insert subcutaneous tissue abdomen attach small monitor . Subjects also need measure blood glucose four time day use fingerprick obtain droplet blood analyse pocket glucose analyser . After three seven subject ask come back device remove . Subjective appetite ( hunger , fullness , etc . ) assess use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) intervention ( end first second week ) Before intervention period , participant visit laboratory fasting overnight . At 8:30 cannula insert hand vein , hand place heating box , subsequent blood sampling . Indirect calorimetry perform determine energy change thermic response milkshake test drink provide 10 kcals/kg body weight , comprise 35 % energy fat , 15 % protein , 50 % carbohydrate . The SWA place upper leave arm estimate energy expenditure . Subsequent blood sample obtain every 15 minute next 3 hour indirect calorimetry SWA measure concurrently . Fasting blood sample use measure total- , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose insulin . Blood sample obtain test drink use measure glucose , insulin hormone relate appetite . After , test meal ( pasta ) provide ad-libitum meal subject ask fill VAS ass subjective appetite sensation .</detailed_description>
