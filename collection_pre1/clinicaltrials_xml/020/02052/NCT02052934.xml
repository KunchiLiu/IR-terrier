	<detailed_description>Despite public health burden Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) traveler , deploy soldier , significantly , young child develop world , licensed vaccine ETEC enteritis.This Phase 1 study healthy adult determine safety immunogenicity ETEC candidate vaccine , attenuate recombinant dmLT ETEC , administer SL ( Sublingual ) Oral Immunization . The study subject population 52 healthy adult male female subject , age 18 45 . Subject participation duration approximately 8 month study duration approximately 1.5-2 year , include 6-7 month follow-up . Potential risk include subject could develop vary degree diarrhea gastrointestinal symptom ( nausea , abdominal pain cramping , gas , decrease appetite ) . Blood drawing may associate pain bruise site rarely , faint seizure . There direct benefit subject participate study potential benefit child adult may receive future beneficial vaccine base result trial justify minimal risk subject participate trial . The primary objective ass safety tolerability dmLT vaccine administer three dos sublingually range dosage healthy adult subject . The secondary objective assess long-term safety follow-up immunization Month 7 post vaccination , follow three SL dose dmLT vaccine range dosage compare three dos comparable dosage oral vaccine .</detailed_description>
