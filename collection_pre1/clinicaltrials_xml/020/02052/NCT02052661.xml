	<criteria>Subjects ' parent ( ) /LAR ( ) , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol ( e.g . completion diary card , return followup visit ) . A male female age 12 13 ( include 12th birthday , exclude 14th birthday ) time enrolment . Subjects document evidence previous vaccination four consecutive dos Infanrix hexa part routine vaccination Germany : three dos primary vaccination receive 9 month age one booster dose receive 11 18 month age . Written inform consent obtain parents/LAR ( ) subject . In addition inform consent sign parents/LAR ( ) , write informed assent subject seek . Healthy subject establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Child care . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine within 30 day precede dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug time study period ( e.g . infliximab ) . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within six month prior vaccination . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Administration chronic drug therapy continue study period . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day end 30 day HBV challenge dose , exception tetanus toxoid , reduce diphtheria toxoid acellular pertussis ( dTpa ) vaccine , give part routine vaccination practice . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational vaccine/product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . Evidence previous hepatitis B booster vaccination since administration fourth dose Infanrix hexa booster second year life . History intercurrent hepatitis B disease . Hepatitis B vaccination birth . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , base medical history physical examination ( laboratory testing require ) . Family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine . Major congenital defect serious chronic illness include thrombocytopenia bleeding disorder . History neurological disorder seizure . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment . Fever define temperature ≥ 37.5°C oral , axillary tympanic route , ≥ 38.0°C rectal route . The preferred route record temperature study axillary . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may , enrol discretion investigator . Acute chronic , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month precede dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution .</criteria>
