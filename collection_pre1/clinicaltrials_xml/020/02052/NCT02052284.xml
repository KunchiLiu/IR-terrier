	<brief_title>The Application Sterile Water Skin Extremely Low Birth Weight ( ELBW ) Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants significant transepidermal water loss immediately birth . This significant fluid loss relate proportionally large extracellular pool fluid , immaturity skin barrier , relatively large surface area expose evaporation . Water depletion population associate development significant electrolyte imbalance form hypernatremia , hyperkalemia , hyperglycemia hyperosmolarity . In order compensate loss , clinician progressively increase fluid intake . Excessive fluid intake first day life associate worsen patent ductus artriosus ( PDA ) , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) mortality . Also skin integrity important protect skin infection secondary sepsis . Based recent study relevant data , risk sepsis ELBW 40 % nationwide , 25 % GWUH Water application benign treatment routinely apply skin premature baby show decrease skin colonization . The current practice GWUH clean body premature infant use piece damp cloth warm water . This perform birth consequently every day . The study group receive frequent standardize application . The investigator hypothesize application sterile water ELBW infant associate decreased fluid requirement first week life . As secondary outcome , investigator hypothesize sterile water application associate improved skin integrity , decrease incidence BPD increase incidence skin systemic infection .</detailed_description>
