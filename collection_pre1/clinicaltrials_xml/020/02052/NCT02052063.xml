	<brief_summary>The stapled transanal rectal resection ( STARR ) recently recommend patient obstructed defecation syndrome ( ODS ) cause rectocele rectal wall intussusception . The aim STARR correct mechanical outlet obstruction use stapler device endorectal resection distal rectum . This technique significantly improve constipation . However , several report new-onset faecal incontinence STARR urgency identify major side-effect procedure . Although technique become important surgical option treatment obstructive defaecation syndrome , impact continence problematic objective data parameter predict result yet available One study evaluate anal function surgery 30 patient . In study , urgency incontinence complain 26 % patient . No sonographically demonstrable sphincter fragmentation notice endoanal exam perform follow-up . No significant difference observe anorectal manometry . Even data statistically significant , rest squeeze pressure low patient satisfied . Currently , anal canal pressure measurement use ano-rectal manometry common mean assessment sphincter function . Some study look concept distend sphincter region well measure performance . The functional lumen image probe ( FLIP ) novel technique ability provide real-time image function human gastrointestinal sphincter distension . This distensibility technique provide important new way study anal canal hence may role test sphincter competence patient disorder STARR procedure . Twenty-eight patient enrol study period 36 month . Preoperative assessment include - clinical examination - Wexner Incontinence Score Faecal Incontinence Quality-of-Life Index ( FIQL ) rate anal incontinence - video defecography , anorectal manometry , anal ultrasound ( AUS ) measure anal sphincter distensibility use endoFLIP Follow-up evaluation schedule 3 month surgery , include symptom evaluation ( use standard questionnaire incontinence ) , clinical examination investigation use anal ultrasound endoFLIP . If demonstrate surgical technique cause anal lesion decrease sphincter competence , may lead modification surgical technique especially patient risk develop postoperative anal incontinence .</brief_summary>
