	<detailed_description>Background : Colorectal cancer third common cancer consider gender . Musculoskeletal alteration describe related technique use surgery , produce inhibition deep abdominal muscle . These muscle charge lumbopelvic stabilization muscle link reduced ability maintain independence daily activity life could affect quality life Objective : The aim objective evaluate short long-term effect physical activity program muscle stabilization . Methods : 20 colorectal cancer survivor recruit Department Oncology Cl√≠nico San Cecilio Hospital . Patients randomized physical activity program group usual care group . Physical activity group receive eight week program form improve muscle stabilization . Discussion : Researchers attempt increase fitness level reduce musculoskeletal disorder colorectal cancer survivor physical activity intervention focus muscle stabilization .</detailed_description>
