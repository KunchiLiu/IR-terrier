Females childbearing potential must become pregnant study . A female non child bear potential , include : Females surgically sterile document hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy ; Females document tubal ligation . If procedure do hysteroscopically , effectiveness tubal occlusion must document hysterosalpingogram post procedure ( typically 3 month procedure ) ; Females postmenopausal , define amenorrhoeic great 1 year . For woman whose menopausal status doubt , document previous confirmatory blood sample folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit per milliliter ( MIU/mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter ( &lt; 140 picomole per liter ) would need confirm require use one contraception method . The subject diagnosis ABSSSI suspect document caused Grampositive pathogen require intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic treatment subject willing receive treatment inpatient set least 2 days.. ABSSSI define one following : Wound infection ( traumatic postsurgical ) : infection involve skin subcutaneous tissue , characterize purulent drainage wind surround redness , edema , and/or induration minimum surface area 75 square centimeter ( cm^2 ) ( e.g. , short distance redness , edema , and/or induration extend least 5 centimeter ( cm ) peripheral margin wound ) ; Major cutaneous abscess : infection characterize collection pu within dermis deep accompany redness , edema , and/or induration minimum surface area 75 cm^2 ( e.g. , short distance redness , edema , and/or induration extend least 5 cm peripheral margin abscess ) . Cellulitis : diffuse skin infection characterize spread area redness , edema , and/or induration minimum surface area 75 cm^2 Note : For subject one type eligible lesion/wound multiple lesion type , investigator must clearly identify lesion evaluate study purpose . The identified lesion must consistently choose assessment ( include digital imaging ) throughout study . Incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) lesion permit prior first dose study medication allow , per protocol , 24 hour start first dose study medication . The subject least 1 additional sign symptom skin infection : fluctuation , heat/localized warmth , pain/tenderness . The subject least 1 systemic marker infection time screening : Lymphadenopathy ( proximal within drainage wound ) ; Fever ( &gt; =38 degrees Celsius ) ; white blood cell ( WBC ) elevation ( &gt; 10000 /cubic millimetre [ mm^3 ] &gt; 10 % immature neutrophils regardless WBC count ) ; Creactive protein &gt; upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Note : Systemic marker infection require subject &gt; 70 year age know suspect ( base blood glucose level ) diabetic . The subject provide write , date , informed consent willing able comply study protocol . The subject pregnant nursing . The subject immunecompromising illness ; include know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , organ ( include bone marrow ) transplant recipient , hematological malignancy , immunosuppressive therapy , include highdose corticosteroid ( e.g. , great 40mg prednisone equivalent per day great two week ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; = 40.0 kilogram per square meter . The subject serious underlying disease could imminently lifethreatening , unlikely survive duration study period . The subject medical condition require medication may aggravate inhibition acetylcholinesterase , : subject poorly control asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease baseline , , opinion , investigator stable current therapy ; subject acute severe pain , uncontrolled conventional medical management ; subject active peptic ulcer disease ; subject parkinson 's disease ; subject myasthenia gravis ; subject history seizure disorder require medication control . include history childhood febrile seizure ; subject evidence mechanical obstruction urinary digestive tract . The subject diagnosis C. difficile infection ( CDI ) within 90 day screen The subject history seizure disorder require medication control . This include history childhood febrile seizure . The subject chronic abuser alcohol illicit substance jeopardize ability comply protocol History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation The subject PR Interval &lt; 120 &gt; 220 millisecond ( msec ) Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450msec QTc &gt; 480msec subject bundle branch block . Note : The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord either Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , another method , machine manual overread . The QTc base single average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period . It essential method calculate QTc use subject baseline visit use subject subsequent visit . The subject QRS duration &lt; 70 &gt; 120 msec . The subject preexisting grade II atrioventricular block high , history significant vasovagal and/or syncopal episode , episode symptomatic bradycardia . The subject recent acute major blood loss sign hemodynamic instability . The subject liver function test : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x ULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . The subject current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Subjects stable Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C eligible meet liver function test criterion criterion ( ALT &gt; 2 × ULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN ) . Note : All subject screen Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , result use determine subject eligibility subject continuation study enrollment . The subject skin condition skin infection list : Secondarily infect animal/human bite ; Infected burn ; Infections chronic ulcerative lesion ( include diabetic foot infection peripheral vascular disease ) likely polymicrobial nature , cause Gramnegative anaerobic organism unlikely Grampositive pathogen causative agent , ( Note : Subjects diabetic foot infection peripheral vascular disease eligible qualify ABSSSI diabetic foot infection eligible lesion investigation ) ; An underlying skin disease , preexist eczematous dermatitis , clinical evidence secondary infection ; Suspected confirm osteomyelitis ; Suspected confirm septic arthritis ; Uncomplicated ABSSSI simple abscess , impetiginous lesion , superficial cellulitis , furunculosis , carbunculosis , folliculitis ; Infected abdominal wound unable surgically close ; Necrotizing fasciitis , rapidly necrotizing infection , gangrenous process , decubitus ulcer ; An exist abscess drain wound require significant surgical intervention perform within 48 hour initiation study treatment ; Skin infection know suspect due fungal , parasitic viral pathogen ; know suspect due anaerobic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( include ecthyma gangrenosum ) , Gram negative pathogen contribute pathogen ; Skin infection complicate presence prosthetic material remove central venous catheter , permanent cardiac pacemaker battery pack , joint replacement prosthesis . The subject receive treatment systemic and/or topical antibacterial within 4 day study entry ; EXCEPT follow condition : The subject receive single dose shortacting antibacterial ( halflife le 12 hour ) drug prior first dose study treatment ; The subject fail previous ABSSSI regimen ( i.e . least 48 hour treatment ) document lack microbiological clinical response therapy . A subject enrol failure previous antibacterial treatment regimen must EITHER : Show worsen lack improvement worsen sign symptom infection , include continued worsen purulence , erythema without induration , fluctuation , heat/localized warmth , pain/tenderness and/or continue worsen systemic marker infection OR show microbiological evidence failure ; The subject recently complete treatment course antibacterial drug infection ABSSSI drug antibacterial activity bacterial pathogen cause ABSSSI . ( Note : topical antiseptic , chorhexidine , alcohol soap wind care permit ) . For purpose criterion , information may obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ; information obtain via verbal interview must record subject 's medical record . The subject know suspect severe impairment renal function , include calculate creatinine clearance ( calculate use CockroftGault method ) less 30 millilitre per minute ; requirement peritoneal dialysis , hemodialysis , hemofiltration ; oliguria ( less 20 millilitre urine output per hour 24 hour ) . The subject know suspected chronic neutropenia due suppression neutrophil production , anticipate develop neutropenia course study ( ie . new chemotherapy subject ) , absolute neutrophil count less 1000 cells/mm^3 ( subject neutrophil count low 500 cell/mm^3 eligible reduction due entirely acute infectious process ) . The subject previously enrol study , previously treat GSK2140944 . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever long</criteria>
