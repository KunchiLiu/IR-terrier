	<brief_title>Maintenance Chemotherapy Versus Consolidative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Plus Maintenance Chemotherapy Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) : A Randomized Phase II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol randomize phase II trial maintenance chemotherapy versus consolidative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) plus maintenance chemotherapy patient Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Prior accrual trial , patient Stage IV NSCLC treat standard first-line chemotherapy . Patients achieve partial response stable disease image criterion few equal six sit oligometastatic disease randomize maintenance chemotherapy consolidative SBRT sit disease ( followed maintenance chemotherapy medical oncologist 's discretion ) . Choices first line maintenance chemotherapy determine medical oncologist base clinical appropriateness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must biopsy proven metastatic NSCLC ( Stage IV ) . 2 . Patients must receive first line chemotherapy , 46 cycle , achieve stable disease partial response . 3 . Patients receive firstline erlotinib , gefitinib , crizotinib EGFR mutantpositive EML4ALK positive NSCLC exclude . 4 . Age ≥ 18 year 5 . Patients must measurable disease baseline . 6 . Patients 6 discrete active extracranial lesion ( ≤3 liver ≤3 lung ) identify PET scan also see correlative plain film , CT scan , MRI within 8 week prior initiation SBRT . 1 . For patient receive prior radiotherapy primary site lung , residual PET activity difficult interpret consider site active disease CT appearance stable improve interval least three month 2 . Patients previously receive radiotherapy primary site ineligible CT evidence disease progression within past 3 month . 3 . Patients previously unirradiated primary site potentially eligible , special consideration apply . 4 . Up 2 contiguous vertebral metastasis consider single site disease . 7 . Patients must KPS &gt; 60 8 . AST , ALT &amp; Alkaline phosphates must ≤ 2.5X upper limit normal . Total bilirubin must within limit normal . 9 . Patients adequate bone marrow function define peripheral granulocyte count ≥1500/mm³ . 10 . Patients adequate renal function ( serum creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN ) . 11 . Females childbearing potential negative pregnancy test . 12 . Patients would receive SBRT lung tumor know suspect treat radiation oncologist compromise lung function must document forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 1L . 13 . Patients must provide verbal write informed consent participate study . 14 . Total bilirubin : within normal institutional limit 1 . Patients previously receive radiotherapy primary site CT evidence disease progression primary site within 3 month follow initial radiotherapy . 2 . Patients either untreated brain metastasis brain metastasis treat within past three month ineligible 3 . Patients serious , uncontrolled , concurrent infection ( ) . 4 . Significant weight loss ( &gt; 10 % ) prior 3 month . 5 . Because tolerance dose SBRT gastrointestinal tract establish , patient metastatic disease invade esophagus , stomach , intestine , mesenteric lymph node eligible . 6 . Patients cutaneous metastasis NSCLC . 7 . Treatment carcinoma within last five year , except cure nonmelanoma skin treat insitu cancer . 8 . Patients 6 discrete extracranial lesion . 9 . Participation investigational drug study within 4 week precede start study treatment . 10 . Unwillingness participate inability comply protocol duration study . 11 . Patients pregnant . Patients reproductive capability need use adequate contraception time participation study</criteria>
