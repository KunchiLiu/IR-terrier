	<brief_summary>The purpose study use non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan investigate venous insufficiency , brain iron level white matter hyperintensities ( WMHs ) determine direct correlation Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease ( IPD ) . Idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( IPD ) second common neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer 's disease affect roughly 0.1 % 0.3 % population . The risk IPD increase age median onset age 60 year . The etiology IPD remain unknown . Generally , Parkinson 's patient show reduction dopamine level deep grey matter brain time . Many clinically diagnosed case IPD associate white matter hyperintensities ( WMH ) elevate brain iron level . Furthermore , last year increase interest role vein neurodegenerative disease . More attention pay extracranial vein potential source venous hypertension . The obstructed vein think cause venous insufficiency . By use MRI technique , investigator obtain qualitative vascular information also quantitative arterial venous blood flow measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental plan : All patient control consent subject study . Data collect Siemens Skyra 3T scanner University Saskatchewan use 16 channel head/neck coil arrangement . The investigator main approach research collect MR data vasculature brain neck , iron content brain , standard anatomical scan 20 patient idiopathic Parkinson 's disease 10 age match normal subject . MR venography , flow quantification susceptibility weight image use . Anatomic MR venography ( MRV ) : Contrast enhance MRV widely regard optimal method evaluation disease involve dural venous sinus . It accurate , reliable robust method assess sino-venous pathology thrombosis tumor invasion . MRV also able demonstrate pathology involve large cerebral vein . The investigator able record anatomic variant well stenosis . Extracranially , investigator look significant variant stenosis affect jugular venous system , vertebral venous system azygous system . Data analyze separately display evaluate structure arteries vein head neck . The maximum intensity projection ( MIP ) whole series generate coronal view . The major artery evaluate well major vein interest structural analysis include transverse sinus , internal external jugular vein , vertebral vein deep cervical vein usually serve collateral case flow abnormality jugular vein . Cross sectional area ( CSA ) suspicious stenotic region also measure validate whether variation see CSA vein stenosis . Flow quantification ( FQ ) : Pathological change cerebrospinal venous drainage reflect upstream disturbance venous flow . Phase contrast MR flow technique allow investigator interrogate venous flow . By apply FQ technique dural venous sinus , investigator hope characterize interplay anatomic venous obstruction pathologically alter drainage . By understand relationship , investigator gain deep insight mechanism cerebrospinal venous insufficiency interacts iron homeostasis mechanism ultimately pathogenesis Parkinson 's disease . Dural sinus hemodynamics study non-invasively phase contrast FQ . The phase contrast flow quantification ( PCFQ ) image use analyze through-plane cerebral spinal fluid neck ( C2/C3 level ) , well blood flow neck ( C2/C3 C6/C7 level ) , superior sagittal sinus ( SSS ) , leave right transverse sinus , straight sinus , extra cranial jugular vertebral vein Dural Sinus . Areas interest drawn around vein artery interest flow calculate full cardiac cycle . Thirty time point collect cardiac cycle use retroactive pulse trigger . The vessels interest include : internal external jugular vein ( IJVs , EJVs ) , vertebral vein , deep cervical vein , common carotid artery vertebral artery . The investigator evaluate integrated flow , average velocity , volume flow rate , well negative positive flow rate . This assessed cervical artery compare inflow outflow brain . Abnormalities may identify stress system , i.e. , breath hold . Finally large number quantitative measure make artery vein neck assess individual variant total flow brain . Measuring Iron basal ganglion thalamus use Susceptibility Weighted Imaging ( SWI ) : A presence iron lesion , importantly basal ganglia thalamus show IPD patient . The latter show iron build confluence drain vein area . SWI run show iron deposition several area interest within brain . SWI high spatial resolution optimal method study small internal cerebral venous system . The ability measure amount non-heme iron brain facilitate well understanding disease progression may help predict treatment outcome . Iron deposition evaluate SWI image . To measure iron content grey matter , investigator look iron follow eight region : caudate nucleus , globus pallidus , putamen , thalamus , pulvinar thalamus ( appear affect much rest thalamus ) , substantia nigra , red nucleus dentate nucleus . For deep gray matter structure , two major region interest analyze : entire object draw manually region-of-interest much high iron content . The investigator provide follow information region : iron content abnormal part structure ( investigator refer high iron content region ) ; area region ; average iron per pixel region ; also investigator quote three value total iron structure .</detailed_description>
