	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis advance malignancy , refractory intolerant standard therapy longer likely respond therapy . 2 . Tumor ( tissue , bone marrow , blood ) must express IGF1R , define 10 % high cell express IGF1R IHC , 0.1 % high IGF1R expression flow cytometry ( blood bone marrow aspirate ) . Parafinembedded tissue section stain antibody IGFR1 accord manufacturer 's recommended protocol . IHC stain perform Pathology Department University Illinois Cancer Center . 3 . Measurable evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 criterion solid tumor &amp; lymphoma . 4 . Multiple Myeloma : Confirmed diagnosis MM relapse refractory disease . 5 . Lymphoma : Previously treat , histologically confirm lymphoma ( RECIST 1.1 ) exception lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 6 . Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia : Confirmed diagnosis relapsed/refractory disease , measurable disease define atleast one lesion single diameter great 2cm CT bone marrow involvement great 10 % malignant cell immunoglobulin ( IgM , IgG , IgA ) great 1000mg/dL . 7 . Hematologic malignancy include MDS , leukemia : Confirmed histologic diagnosis relapse refractory disease ; measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criterion require . 8 . Age ≥ 18 year . 9 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 ( appendix IV ) . 10 . Prior systemic chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy and/or surgery allow ; however prior use methotrexate allow . Time since prior therapy first dose study drug : At least 2 week since prior radiation , non cytotoxic small molecule drug ( e.g. , tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib hormonal agent letrozole ) , prior major surgery ( surgery ( define surgery involve risk life patient ; specifically : operation upon organ within cranium , chest , abdomen , pelvic cavity ) , prior systemic FDA approve therapy At least 3 week since prior antineoplastic therapy At least 4 week since exposure monoclonal antibody ( chimeric fully human ) At least 6 week since prior nitrosureas mitomycinC 11 . Patient must recover acute toxic effect ( ≤ grade 1 CTCAE v4 ) previous anticancer treatment prior study enrollment ; exception grade 2 neuropathy permit 12 . Adequate organ function within 14 day study registration define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 X 109/L Hemoglobin1 &gt; 9 g/dL Platelets1 &gt; 100 X 109/L Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Alkaline Phosphatase , AST ALT &lt; 3 X ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN acceptable liver tumor involvement ) Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 60 ml/min [ GFR &gt; 60 ml/min 24 Hr . Urine Creat Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ] Note : Patient may transfusion within 7 day blood draw . 13 . Negative urine serum pregnancy test female . Male female patient reproductive potential must use approved contraceptive method appropriate ( example , abstinence , oral contraceptive , implantable hormonal contraceptive , double barrier method ) 3 month last dose 765IGFMTX . 14 . Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . 1 . Untreated symptomatic CNS metastasis . 2 . Radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow . Whole pelvic radiation consider 25 % . 3 . ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy within 14 day enrollment . 4 . Systemic infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 7 day precede first dose study drug , severe infection . 5 . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . 6 . Pregnant breastfeed methotrexate Pregnancy Category X report cause fetal death and/or congenital abnormality . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum Betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( BetahCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . 7 . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define Hemoglobin A1C≥ 7 % patient prior history diabetes , 28 day prior study enrollment . 8 . Serious concomitant systemic disorder ( e.g. , active infection , uncontrolled diabetes ) psychiatric disorder , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study . 9 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment study . 10 . Recent ( within 6 month ) arterial thromboembolic event , include transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , unstable angina , myocardial infarction ( MI ) . 11 . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intra abdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment . 12 .
