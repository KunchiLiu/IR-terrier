	<brief_title>Healing Rate Leg Wounds Treated With Contact Noncontact Ultrasound : The VIP Ultrasound Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study design evaluate clinical effectiveness wound care ultrasound treatment protocol sub-acute chronic wound low extremity etiology . The Viana-Pompeo ( VIP ) ultrasound protocol consist high intensity , low frequency , contact ultrasound therapy ( Sonoca-180 ) follow low intensity , low-frequency , noncontact ultrasound therapy ( MIST Therapy ) . Previously publish heal rate ultrasonic therapy modality use comparison . The Physical Therapist perform initial assessment treatment , devise individualized plan care involve contact ultrasound follow noncontact ultrasound . Subjects may remain study 12 week , end study criterion meet . Transition contact mode noncontact mode happen : - Wound sufficiently clean â‰¤ 20 % necrotic tissue adherent slough . OR - &gt; = 80 % soft slough easily remove wound bed mechanical selective debridement treatment OR - Wound bed quality fail progress 3 consecutive contact ultrasound treatment For purpose study , treatment perform 3 time week . Treatment time dependent wound area , least 20 sec/cm2 , per standard protocol . Only wound present Physical Therapy ( PT ) initial assessment include research . If patient develop new wound course research , patient receive appropriate treatment , wound part study . Patients wound clinic setting allow perform home dressing change order physician addition dress change perform therapist wound clinic nurse clinic visit day . Patients and/or caregiver train dress change technique must understand procedure prior perform dress change . In addition ultrasonic treatment dressing change , wound debridement may perform visit need . Digital photography wound measurement also perform weekly need . End PT wound therapy may , , end study period . The begin MIST therapy depend individual characteristic wind need . A minimum 4 MIST treatment must complete patient 's data include data analysis acute care set . A minimum 2 treatment per week ( goal 3 per week ) must reach 12 week period patient 's data include data analysis . Study Endpoints Primary endpoint : - Wound area reduction - Percent granulation tissue - Length study ambulatory subject : 12 week Start Contact Ultrasound therapy - Length study acute care subject : From Start Contact Ultrasound therapy 12 week patient discharge hospital . Secondary endpoint : - Wound closure point within length study - Failure note improvement wound area , and/or wound volume , and/or wound bed quality 4 consecutive week treatment . - 3 consecutive miss visit , total 7 miss visit</detailed_description>
