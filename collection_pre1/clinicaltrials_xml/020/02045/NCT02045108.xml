	<brief_summary>The overarch goal study determine whether combined cognitive training Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) reduce drink high-risk drinker . To end , specific study purpose : 1 ) replicate previous finding cognitive retraining reduces drinking level , 2 ) test whether cognitive retraining enhance tDCS , 3 ) investigate neural change result cognitive retraining tDCS . We hypothesize participant receive alcohol avoidance cognitive training great reduction drink . In turn , participant receive high level apply tDCS alcohol avoidance response training well avoidance learning , well , large reduction drink behavior . Finally , participant receive high level apply tDCS neuronal response associate alcohol avoidance brain imaging session .</brief_summary>
