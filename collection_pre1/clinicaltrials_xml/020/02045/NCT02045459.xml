	<brief_summary>For part study , collect information patient experience symptom mention . We take information create chest pain registry follow trend compare different patient similar symptom . We hope gain insight quality life , symptom , cardiac event similar symptom . The type information collect include : demographic , quality life , level anxiety relate angina pain cardiac event occur within 2 year period time . In addition , perform cardiac stress MRI research purpose look blood flow small vessel heart . During stress cardiac MRI , give medication call Regadenoson ( Lexiscan ) `` stress '' heart dilate blood vessel heart . This drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) purpose . We able measure myocardial perfusion reserve ( MPR ) measure blood flow small blood vessel see abnormal MPR small blood vessel disease associate increase risk cardiovascular event , heart attack . At point , specific therapy small vessel disease . In addition phase II study determine exercise intensive medical therapy together compare intensive medical therapy alone improve pain heart improve overall quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac angina major source morbidity , affect 5 % U.S. population.2 It lead 1.5 million hospitalization $ 190 billion cost yearly.3 Obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) common cause angina . However , obstructive CAD find elective coronary angiography 50 % cases.4 , 5 These patient angina obstructive CAD heterogeneous group . Some noncardiac explanation angina nonobstructive epicardial abnormality coronary spasm . However , many patient angina obstructive CAD microvascular dysfunction endothelial dysfunction microvascular obstructive disease cause . These patient microvascular angina . The coronary microvasculature responsible 70 % coronary resistance thus play key role regulate blood flow match demand.6 Microvascular dysfunction occur set dilate , hypertrophic , restrictive cardiomyopathy . However , commonly see set atherosclerotic risk factor idiopathic.6 , 7 Microvascular dysfunction manifest insufficient stress myocardial blood flow and/or reduce myocardial perfusion reserve ( MPR ) , ratio stress flow rest flow , response stress vasodilator administration . Absolute myocardial blood flow MPR assess noninvasively high precision accuracy cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image Reduced MPR patient angina associate significant morbidity , include high risk cardiac event , high medical cost , decrease quality life.Despite poor prognosis population , therapeutic option reduce angina improve MPR well study . Preliminary analysis show statin may improve endothelial function . ACE-inhibitors beta-blockers improve symptom Syndrome X , related disorder patient angina , obstructive CAD , ischemic change good prognosis . Therapeutic exercise also use Syndrome X population , improve exercise tolerance endothelial function reduce symptom severity.Improvements MPR could expect exercise due reduce rest flow increase MPR see healthy volunteer improve endothelial function increase nitric oxide bioactivity patient probable microvascular dysfunction . However , study examine effect medication synergism exercise MPR , aerobic capacity , anginal symptom , quality life patient angina reduce MPR . Identification effective therapy improve symptom prognosis would dramatic impact highly prevalent patient population . The primary goal study characterize patient angina obstructive CAD reduce MPR test effectiveness intensive medical therapy plus 12-week supervised exercise program versus intensive medical therapy alone improve MPR , aerobic capacity , patient-centered outcome cardiac event , angina severity , quality life population microvascular angina .</detailed_description>
