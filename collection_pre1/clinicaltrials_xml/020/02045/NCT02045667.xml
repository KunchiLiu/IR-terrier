	<brief_summary>The main objective study explore whether multiple trial individual patient ( N-of-1 trial ) produce reliable evidence base coverage decision clinical cost-effectiveness drug treatment patient rare disease . As case study , study clinical cost-effectiveness Mexiletine patient Non-Dystrophic myotonia . The result analysis compare result obtain recently publish international , multi-centre , randomize , placebo-controlled trial Mexiletine patient Non-Dystrophic Myotonia ( clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00832000 ) . The secondary objective proposal ass whether mexiletine improve myotonia measure ( quantitatively qualitative ) patient non-dystrophic myotonia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined N-of-1 Trials Mexiletine v Placebo Patients With Non-Dystrophic Myotonia ( NDM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : A current problem context coverage decision use mexiletine NDM patient lack sufficient evidence base . An innovative trial design could facilitate establish evidence base small group rather heterogeneous patient . As 7000 rare diseases Europe USA suffer similar lack treatment evidence , experience innovative trial design would helpful . Study design : A double-blind , randomize placebo-controlled combined N-of-1- trial use Bayesian statistical approach . Study population : Non-dystrophic myotonia ( NDM ) patient , least 18 year old , genetically confirm diagnosis . Intervention : Each N-of-1 trial consist minimum one , maximum 4 treatment set , comprise 4-week period active treatment ( Mexiletine ) 4-week period treatment placebo , random order , one week wash-out . Within mexiletine period , treatment dosage mexiletine build 200 mg 1 time day PO first day first week , 200 mg 2 time day second day first week , desire dosage 200 mg 3 time day PO third day first week throughout remain day 4-week treatment period . A similar build-up scheme use within placebo period . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome measure study decrease prominent clinical symptom : stiffness . Stiffness quantify Interactive Voice Response System ( IVR ) patient rate mean daily IVR participant-assessed severity stiffness ordinal scale ( 1-9 ) . The secondary outcome measure include change pain , weakness , fatigue IVR , Individual Neuromuscular Quality Life ( INQoL ) , Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey ( SF-36 ) patient-reported survey patient health , blood plasma level mexiletine , clinical myotonia assessment , quantitative handgrip myotonia , biceps force test needle-electromyography ( EMG ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : In screen phase , electrocardiography ( ECG ) EMG recording , laboratory value baseline blood plasma level mexiletine test . Medical history write consent also obtain phase . Patients ask visit department Neurology 4-16 visit ( depend number treatment set necessary obtain enough evidence ) study enrolment . Each visit approximately cost 2 hour ; within visit two questionnaire ( INQoL , SF-36 ) need fill , blood plasma level mexiletine measure clinical electrophysiological myotonia test need perform . Furthermore , ECG EMG record end treatment placebo period . In addition , patient call interactive voice response system report mean daily IVR participant-assessed severity stiffness week every first second week daily every third fourth week treatment placebo period .</detailed_description>
