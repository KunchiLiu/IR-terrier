	<brief_title>Supplementation With Polyphenol-Rich Foods Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Rationale : An open heart surgery ( OHS ) induce injury vessel wall characterize post-operative complication . Post-operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) major cause morbidity mortality cardiac surgery . Both systemic inflammation oxidative stress play role initiation POAF cardiac surgery . Consumption polyphenol-rich food ( PRFs ) , fruit vegetable , beverage derive plant , cocoa , red wine tea , may represent beneficial diet term cardiovascular protection . Indeed , epidemiological study demonstrate significant inverse correlation PRFs consumption cardiovascular risk , due antioxidant , vasorelaxant antithrombotic property polyphenolic component . In particular , procyanidins grape seed principal vasoactive polyphenols red wine protect endothelial cell oxidative damage . However , study address relationship PRFs consumption prognosis patient undergoing OHS . 2 . Aim study . The main objective project evaluate association effect polyphenol-rich food supplementation post-operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) patient undergo OHS . 3 . Study design : Multicentre , randomize , placebo-controlled double-blind trial 2 parallel arm : soluble corn flour high content anthocyanins placebo . Placebo consist soluble corn flour rich anthocyanins . The treatment start hospital admission one day cardiac surgery , continue ( 4 day ) extubation patient reallocate eat . 4 . Study Population recruitment : A total 350 consecutive CAD patient undergo CABG VR recruit . Participants identify Department Cardiovascular disease clinical center . Eligible subject recruit first surgical consultation subsequently refer research investigator . The research staff charge recruitment pre-screen participant basis inclusion/exclusion criterion explain study time . The main inclusion criterion : age 18 year old , presence sinus rhythm screen electrocardiogram , first-time elective open heart surgery . Exclusion criterion : absence sinus rhythm screening , know allergy intolerance gluten anthocyanin compound , regularly consume anthocyanin antioxidant supplement , currently pregnant , exist plan cardiac transplant use ventricular assist device , unable unwilling provide inform consent , know history hepatic renal disease , cancer subject history substance abuse . Once sign informed consent , subject eligible study accord inclusion/exclusion criterion , he/she include trial randomise , use prepared envelope blind study investigator , receive daily high-anthocyanin supplement placebo . Subjects start dietary intervention hospital admission one day cardiac surgery . Then continue supplementation soon reallocate eat next 4 day surgery . Each patient ask answer electronic questionnaire collect personal information medical history ( social status , previous disease surgical intervention , risk factor family history cardiovascular disease , drug use ) . Other relevant clinical data well measure clinical outcome collect medical record . A 1-year food frequency questionnaire use investigate dietary habit . Electrocardiographic , blood pressure , anthropometric measurement collect use standardized method . During hospitalization , time intensive therapy , post-surgical course , specific drug therapy , post-surgical complication , fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event , re-intervention revascularization bypass occlusion record . Venous blood ( max 30 mL ) collect PRFs/placebo supplementation 24 h 72 h cardiac surgery . The patient undergo OHS accord indication good practice procedure normally apply Department Cardio-surgery participant clinical center . All patient receive pharmacological therapy lifestyle change advice accord best clinical practice specific disease surgical intervention . 5 . Evaluation criterion : The primary end point occurrence postoperative AF least 30 second ' duration document rhythm strip 12-lead ECG treat pharmacological electrical cardioversion . 6 . Power calculation : Fixing alpha=0.05 , beta=0.2 , incidence POAF =38 % sample size N=350 CABG patient ( half randomize PRFs supplementation ) 22 % drop-out , observe relative risk &lt; 0.64 reduction POAF intervention group . 7 . Statistical analysis . All analysis perform use statistical analysis software SAS ( SAS , 9.1.3 Windows , Cary , NC : SAS Institute Inc.1989 ) . All individual enrol included analysis . Descriptive summary present individual , subgroup individual . Statistical test carry exploratory purpose , appropriate . The descriptive analysis nominal/ordinal data comprise tabulation frequency percentage . Chi-square test ( Fisher exact test presence small frequency ) use compare category . The descriptive analysis continuous data comprise mean , standard deviation , median , extreme value , 95 % confidence interval . OHS patient randomize receive short term supplementation PRFs placebo ( J Nutr 2008 ) , follow scheme control randomised double-blind clinical trial . POAF occurence compare PRFs supplement control group assess efficacy safety intervention . The `` intention treat '' principle adopt analysis combine endpoint .</detailed_description>
