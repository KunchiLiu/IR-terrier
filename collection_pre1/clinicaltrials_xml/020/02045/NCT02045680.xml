	<brief_summary>The use laparoscopic surgery continue increase colorectal resection expect reach 80 % next 10 year . Although laparoscopic ( keyhole ) minimally invasive surgery lead faster recovery also put significant stress patient 's heart cause fluctuation blood pressure due extreme headdown position abdominal insufflation carbon dioxide gas . We perform several surgical case deep neuromuscular block allow surgery operate lower abdominal pressure ( 14 8 mmHg ) . This put less strain heart allow high cardiac output . This study look whether deep neuromuscular block beneficial patient 1 . Increasing oxygen delivery , measure use oesophageal doppler monitoring cardiovascular variable intraoperatively 2 . Allowing surgery low abdominal insufflation pressure deep block 3 . Reducing patient 's analgesic requirement postoperatively recovery 4 hour</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design pilot study , single arm control study Hypothesis Deep neuromuscular blockade provide intraoperatively patient undergo laparoscopic colorectal surgery increase oxygen delivery measure haemodynamic data use oesophageal doppler . Secondary hypothesis Deep muscular blockade provide surgical operating condition low abdominal inflation pressure . The patient experience less pain postoperatively due less forced distension peritoneum demonstrate less analgesic requirement . Patients therefore spend less time recovery able mobilise earlier.Participants Recruitment Patients assess preassessment clinic clinical nurse specialist eligibility provide patient information sheet . On morning plan surgery patient eligible wish include study consent study accordance International GCP guideline anaesthetic researcher , give form sign . Sample size We estimate 30- 40 participant require demonstrate statistical significance . Our unit carry approximately 4 laparoscopic colorectal resection per week . Assuming 30 % patient may consent participation meet inclusion criterion predict take less 6- 12 month enrol necessary number participant . Preoperatively Participants already standardise Enhanced Recovery Programme . Intraoperatively An oesophageal Doppler probe insert orally nasally ( standard practice unit haemodynamic monitoring ) titrate fluid use stroke volume optimisation protocol ( per normal practice ) . Cardiovascular variable ( heart rate , stroke volume , blood pressure correct flow time ) collect prior commencing surgery provide baseline data set throughout procedure accordance routine observation anaesthesia , together calculate oxygen delivery . Abdominal pressure measure continuously insufflation maintenance pneumoperitoneum ( per standard practice ) . Abdominal insufflation pressure gradually reduce low possible ensure standard surgical access operate condition . Following completion surgery neuromuscular blockade reverse use standardise dose sugammadex 4mg/ kg accord manufacturer guideline accord neuromuscular monitoring return double burst stimulus normal . Postoperatively Immediately recovery area analgesia provide accordance enhanced recovery guideline . Morphine Sulphate titrate effect patient control analgesia pump give patient , record quantity demand morphine use . .The standard enhance recovery pathway continue discharge home . Outcome measure Data collection primary endpoint collect haemodynamic data capture theatre use anaesthetic chart record oesophageal doppler . Data secondary endpoint pain score recovery 4 hour post operatively . Other secondary endpoint collect standard Enhanced Recovery Nurse . These include : length operation , time spent recovery area surgery , time take mobilisation .</detailed_description>
