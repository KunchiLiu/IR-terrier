	<brief_summary>Acute viral bronchiolitis extremely common childhood disease , responsible approximately 17 % childhood admission hospital per year , annually cost reach U $ 500 million . Despite well know disease among pediatrician , , , effective treatment option apart oxygen supplementation adequate hydration . The purpose study determine wether nebulized hypertonic saline ( 3 % ) effective normal saline ( 0,9 % ) use repeat dos first 24 hour in-hospital treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute viral bronchiolitis lower airway infection , cause manly Respiratory Syncytial Virus . Near 1 % child 2 year age get sufficient severity warrant hospital admission , annual cost U $ 500 million US , superior , instance , cystic fibrosis annual cost . Despite physiopathology clinical course well know among pediatrician , therapeutical option adequate hydration oxygen supplementation proven effective Corticosteroids effective bronchodilator controversial , treatment still mostly empiric lack evidence . In last year , grow interest use nebulized hypertonic saline ( HS ) promise approach . The rational HS would help reduce edema mucus viscosity , enhance rheologic property . Recent study suggest HS could reduce 1 day ( 25 % ) time discharge admit patient . In Emergency Department , HS superior form treatment , study lack power similarity draw conclusion . Also , time treatment ideal interval dos know yet . To knowledge , study assess patient intermediary ( 24h ) time stay , namely short stay ward attach emergency department . Thus , endeavour determine repeat dos nebulized HS superior nebulized normal saline ( NS ) first 24 hour treatment , consider : rate admission , time discharge , time attain discharge criterion , rate readmission discharge . Furthermore , study use HS associate bronchodilator , theoretical possibility HS alone could induce bronchoconstriction worsen respiratory symptom . However , recent study show HS use without bronchodilator cause worsen symptom bronchiolitis patient . Therefore , propose study effect HS alone , without add bronchodilator , would minimize bias treatment group .</detailed_description>
