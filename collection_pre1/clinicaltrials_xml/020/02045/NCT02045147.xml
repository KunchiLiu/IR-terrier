	<brief_summary>There overwhelming evidence patient multiple chronic illness need good self-management skill . Discharge hospital may opportune time teach patient self-management skill . There several different care transition model use across country ; however know every patient need type amount intervention . The purpose pilot study examine effect deliver home base care transition intervention ( HBCTI ) four different group tailor cognition level patient activation compare usual care ( UC ) outcomes health care utilization ( HCU ) health outcome : patient-reported health status , assessment care chronic condition , quality life adult patient multiple chronic disease dismiss home acute care facility . Our work hypothesis patient HBCTI group compare UC group lower HCU improve outcome ( patient-reported health status , assessment care chronic condition , quality life ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One five Medicare patient discharge hospital experience readmission within 30 day . Too often , hospital readmission result inadequate transition hospital home discharge . Care transition complicate high patient acuity , multiple comorbidities , decrease length stay , multiple clinician involvement increase number handoff . With decreased length stay , many patient comprehend feel confident instruction discharge , thus management chronic illness difficult . Most formal care transition program standardize every patient receive similar strategy intervention . However , well documented patient cognitive problem decrease activation high risk re-hospitalization relate impaired self-management . We believe assessment cognition patient activation patient 's hospitalization provide valuable information discharge intervention . Data related cognition activation use tailor discharge planning help determine type many resource need individual patient hospital discharge . The purpose feasibility study examine effect deliver home base care transition intervention ( HBCTI ) four different group tailor cognition level patient activation compare usual care ( UC ) outcomes health care utilization ( HCU ) health outcome : patient-reported health status , assessment care chronic condition , quality life adult patient multiple chronic disease discharge home hospital . We test intervention follow aim : Aim 1.To evaluate effect HBCTI health care utilization . We measure HCU ( number ED visit , number unplanned clinic visit , number readmission ) 1 , 2 , 6 month discharge . Our work hypothesis patient HBCTI group compare UC group lower HCU time ( 1 , 2 6 month ) ; Aim 2 . To evaluate effect HBCTI follow health outcome : patient-reported health status ( PROMIS-29 ) , assessment care chronic condition ( PACIC ) , quality life ( EuroQol ) . Our work hypothesis patient HBCTI group compare UC group improve patient-reported health status , assessment care chronic condition , quality life ( EuroQol ) 1 , 2 , 6 month discharge . The finding study potential change paradigm three way : 1 ) gain well understanding role cognition patient activation promote self-management enhance outcome ; 2 ) . innovative approach , considers unique need patient base level cognition patient activation advance new concept care transition program ; 3 ) good understand vary intensity visit , level provider , type amount strategy administer . This practical model care transition could serve model within large health care delivery system could result significant cost saving .</detailed_description>
