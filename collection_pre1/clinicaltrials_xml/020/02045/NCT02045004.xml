	<brief_title>Cohort Study Investigate Association Between Changes Brain Volume Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Anesthesia care elective surgery patient seventy eighties ever-growing entity clinical practice , give demographic development many country Western world . Cognitive decline variable degree frequently observe major surgery elderly patient . A potential association anesthesia development dementia brain atrophy elderly patient controversial . However , uncommon preoperative visit anesthesiologist , patient express fear suffer sort cognitive decline operation , raise concern psychological neurological long-term adverse effect ( e.g . memory loss ) relate anesthesia . Clinicians identify problem decade ago , add postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) list frequent complication anesthesia elderly patient ; yet , lack prospective clinical data poor understanding pathophysiology POCD , preventive strategy treatment describe far . One study report incidence postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) 41 % surgical patient 60 year age , old . In previous study conduct group , many 47 % patient 65 year present POCD one week surgery . In many patient , transient problem , patient retain permanent deficit , increase mortality important consequence socioeconomic situation . An association surgery long-term cognitive decline establish yet ; however , patient develop postoperative delirium ( transient , particularly severe form POCD ) increase risk develop dementia year follow surgery . However , cohort follow-up study , diagnosis POCD represent significant risk factor dementia . The pathophysiology postoperative cognitive decline remain unclear . However , study animals show systemic inflammatory response elicit surgical procedure associate microglial activation postoperative cognitive impairment . Furthermore , volatile anesthetic show neurotoxic cell culture , animal experiment exposure clinical concentration volatile anesthetic associate postoperative cognitive decline . A recent retrospective analysis cohort data suggest surgery may associate decrease brain volume patient . However , due methodological limitation study , analysis potential link atrophy cognitive function make . Study Design : Prospective cohort study Study Groups : Two group patient investigate . Seventy patient undergo major surgical procedure recruit study , 30 healthy study participant ( surgical intervention ) recruit serve control . In patient , baseline cognitive function structural MRI image include determination gray matter volume relevant cognitive function ( hippocampus ) perform . - Group 1 : Surgery group Sevoflurane ( n = 70 ) - Group 2 : Control group ( n = 30 ) Recruitment : Study participant Surgery group Sevoflurane ( Group 1 ) recruit patient Basel University Hospital , tertiary medical care center Basel , Switzerland , associate University Basel , Switzerland . Study participant Control group ( Group 2 ) recruit randomly . Endpoints : Targeted primary endpoint study difference change hippocampal volume time patient POCD patient without POCD . Secondary endpoint correlation change cerebral volume change cognitive function . Anesthetic Management : Anesthesia standardize ( general anesthesia use sevoflurane fentanyl maintenance , thiopental induction atracurium rocuronium neuromuscular blockade ) . Intraoperatively , dose anesthetic control use EEG derive index ( depth anesthesia monitoring ( Bispectral Index ( BIS ) , Aspect Medical Systems ) , end-tidal sevoflurane concentration monitoring ) . Furthermore , intraoperative bilateral cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitoring ( NIRO-200 , Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) apply . Data download directly monitor anesthesia machine ( Dräger Perseus ) use ICM+ software . Neuropsychological Assessment : The cognitive assessment test battery CERAD-Plus consistent Consortium Establish Registry Alzheimer 's Disease - Neuropsychological Assessment Battery ( CERAD-NAB ) , Trail Making Tests A+B , phonetic fluency ( s-words ) , well Test Attentional Performance ( TAP ) develop analyze different aspect attention , perform preoperatively , 7 day , 3 month 12 month postoperatively . Training study personnel supervision cognitive test carried Memory Clinic Basel University Hospital . Cognitive function quantify use CERAD total score , demographically correct form . A correction short-term practice effect carry base previous work . Blood Samples : Blood sample take study participant preoperatively , 12h postoperatively , day 2 7 , determine level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . Blood sample store 1 year allow additional determination . Demographic , Procedural Subjective Patient Data : - Age , sex , year education . - Cognitive testing outline : CERAD-Plus ( CERAD-NAB , Trail Making Tests A+B , phonetic fluency ( s-words ) ) , Test Attentional Performance ( TAP ) , preoperatively , 7 day , 3 month 12 month postoperatively . - Charlson Comorbidity Score preoperatively , 3 month 1 year postoperatively - Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) preoperatively , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) preoperatively , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) preoperatively , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - ASA physical status , type duration anesthesia , type duration surgery . - Postoperative delirium ( Confusion Assessment Method ; CAM ) , repeat surgery postoperative infection . - Subjective grading cognitive function VAS scale ( 0-10 ) preoperatively , 7 day , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - Subjective grading change cognitive function five-point Likert scale ( much bad , bad , equal , well , much good ) 7 day , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - Subjective grading successful surgery ( Yes/No ) 7 day , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . - Subjective grading pain VAS scale ( 0-10 ) preoperatively , 7 day , 3 month 1 year postoperatively . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) : MRI perform preoperatively , 3 month , 12 month postoperatively day cognitive function test . Training study personnel MRI evaluation , and/or supervision MRI evaluation , carry Division Neuroradiology Basel University Hospital . Imaging perform use institutional SIEMENS 3T TimTrio™ MRI scanner . The image sequence use whole brain quantitative MRI protocol comprise multi-parameter mapping base 3D Fast Low Angle Shot ( FLASH ) MRI 1 mm isotropic resolution ( clinical standard University Hospital Basel ) . For initial MRI analysis , assume region relevant describe mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , region interest ( ROI ) analysis perform . In second step , perform whole brain analysis . For multi-parameter mapping , 3 multi-echo datasets acquire T1- , PD- , MT-weighting impose choice repetition time ( TR ) flip angle ( T1 : 18.7 ms/20° ; PD MT : 23.7 ms/6° ) , apply off-resonance Gaussian-shaped radio frequency ( RF ) pulse ( 4 m duration , 220° nominal flip angle , 2 kHz frequency offset ) prior nonselective excitation , respectively . Alternating gradient echo acquire 6 equidistant echo time ( TE ) 2.2 m 14.7 ms T1- MT-weighted acquisition 8 equidistant TE 2.2 m 19.7 ms PD-weighted acquisition . A high readout bandwidth ( BW ) = 425 Hz/pixel use minimize off-resonance artifact . To speed data acquisition , Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions ( GRAPPA ) image acceleration factor two apply phase-encoding ( anterior-posterior ) direction 6/8 partial Fourier partition ( left-right ) direction . The total acquisition time 3 FLASH datasets approximately 20 min . The rationale detail design criterion protocol previously publish . The multi-parameter mapping provide good sensitivity classically use T1-weighted imaging . The main advantage allow quantitative assessment change myelin content , tissue water iron ( transferrin , ferritin ) . Statistical Analysis : All MRI image pre-processing analysis conduct Statistical Parametric Mapping software SPM8 . Multivariate analysis conduct Multivariate Methods ( MM ) toolbox SPM8 . Comparisons ( preoperatively 3 month postoperatively ) hippocampal volume result voxel-based volumetry medio-temporal lobe lateral association area temporal parietal lobe perform use ROI analysis . The quantitative imaging result correlate CERAD-Plus total score performance obtain day scan . The relationship change volume ( present ) intraoperative depth anesthesia ( BIS ) administer dose sevoflurane express age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) equivalent multiply time administration calculate . The relationship change gray matter volume ( present ) determine voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) peak value ( postoperative day 2 ) inflammatory marker ( CRP , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) determine . We also use multivariate approach ( voxel-wise multivariate analysis ( MANOVA ) classification/prediction procedure ) multi-parameter MRI data order build optimal composite predictor patient ' neuropsychological outcome . In whole brain analysis , use multiple regression repeat measure ANOVA whole brain voxel-wise analysis SPM8 correlate estimate modulated gray matter volume neuropsychological score . Sample Size Calculation : Assuming 41 % operate patient develop POCD , standard deviation hippocampal volume change 0.45 patient POCD without POCD , total sample size 56 subject may detect difference 0.4 mm3 hippocampal volume power 90 % two-sided significance level 5 % . To compensate high loss follow-up unfortunately typical study POCD , estimate 20 % , recruit 70 patient surgery group .</detailed_description>
