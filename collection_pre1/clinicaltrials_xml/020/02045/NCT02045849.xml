	<brief_summary>This study conduct three part ( Part 1 , Part 2 Part 3 ) . Part 1 study evaluate relative bioavailability single dose GSK2140944 tablet formulation compare reference capsule formulation fast condition . The effect food pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single dose tablet formulation also assess . Part 2 evaluate effect repeat dos itraconazole pharmacokinetics GSK2140944 follow single dose . A decision make whether use current capsule formulation new tablet formulation Part 2 base upon safety PK data obtain Part 1 . Part 3 conditionally base upon progression tablet formulation Part 1 evaluate effect food safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics tablet formulation follow multiple dos elderly healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator feels document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Part 1 2 : Male female 18 64 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Part 3 : Male female subject least 65 year age old time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . To confirm postmenopausal status , blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliInternational Units ( MIU ) /milliliter ( mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 147 picomoles [ pmol ] /liter [ L ] ) confirmatory . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication final followup visit . Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 19 31 kg/meter square ( m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Alanine amino transferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xUpper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Any clinically significant central nervous system ( e.g. , seizure ) , cardiac , pulmonary , metabolic , renal , hepatic gastrointestinal condition history condition , opinion investigator may place subject unacceptable risk participant trial may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug . History photosensitivity quinolones . Use systemic antibiotic within 30 day screen Previous exposure GSK2140944 Confirmed history Cdifficile diarrhea . History tendon rupture . History drug abuse within 6 month study . History smoking use nicotine containing product within 3 month screen , positive urine cotinine indicative smoking screening . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 gram alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( clinical research unit use heparin maintain intravenous cannula patency ) . Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . A screening Day 1 urinalysis positive protein glucose ( great 1+ finding protein glucose ) . A serum creatinine value increase 0.2 milligram ( mg ) /deciliter ( dL ) ( 15.25 micromoles/L ) screen Day 1 . For Part 3 Only : Neutrophil count &lt; 2000 cells/microliter ( single repeat allow eligibility determination ) . A positive urine test drug abuse alcohol ( alcohol breath test ) screen Day 1 . Exclusion criterion screen baseline ECG ( single repeat allow eligibility determination ) follow : Heart rate : &lt; 40 &gt; 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) males &lt; 50 &gt; 100 bpm female ; PR Interval : &lt; 120 &gt; 220 millisecond ( msec ) ; QRS duration : &lt; 70 &gt; 100 msec ; QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) interval &gt; 450 msec . Evidence previous myocardial infarction ( include ST segment change associate repolarization ) . Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , atrioventricular ( AV ) block [ 2nd degree high ] , Wolf Parkinson White [ WPW ] syndrome ) , sinus pause &gt; 3 second , nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( &gt; =3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) significant arrhythmia , opinion principal investigator GSK medical monitor , interfere safety individual subject . Other Criteria Donation blood excess 500 mL within 12 week prior dose participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Unwillingness commit avoid excessive exposure sunlight ( exposure tan bed ) would cause sunburn reaction first dose include followup visit .</criteria>
