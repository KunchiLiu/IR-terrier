	<detailed_description>Iodine essential trace element human health integral component thyroid hormone . Thyroid hormones regulate normal growth development , particularly brain . Iodine deficiency result low level thyroid hormone impair brain development low intelligence . Infants small iodine store birth entirely dependent iodine provide breast milk infant formula . However , exact amount daily iodine infant need healthy development poorly understood insufficient data define Estimated Average Requirement ( EAR ) age group . The current recommendation dietary iodine intake 0-6 month ( mo ) old infant 110 µg/day adequate intake ( AI ) , absence EAR . This AI base iodine intake breast fed infant breast milk iodine concentration ( BMIC ) measure U.S. woman period overall iodine intake U.S. population excessive . The AI sharply disagree current WHO recommendation assessment infant iodine nutrition base excretion iodine urine . The discrepancy make assessment monitor iodine status age problematic lead major confusion interpret adequate iodine intake optimal iodine status . The objective study measure daily iodine retention dietary iodine define physiological iodine requirement ( EAR ) first six month life . The study hypothesis AI set high use assess iodine intake status overestimate prevalence iodine deficiency infant . The study metabolic balance study breast milk consumption three dose-response cross-over arm iodine enrich infant formula milk 60 healthy 2-3 mo old infant ( 30 breast feed 30 formula feed ) . Breast feed infant exclusively unrestrictedly breast fed mother breast milk consumption monitor 4 day weigh infant feed session . Formula feed infant randomly allocate three 11 day cross-over period exclusive consumption infant formula milk ( IFM ) provide 60 µg I/day , 110 µg I/day 220 µg I/day . The iodine intake monitor record amount infant formula milk feed infant . The iodine excretion measure complete collection urine feces 4-day period arm . The iodine retention calculate difference measure iodine intake excretion . Analytical determination iodine content biological sample do mass spectrometry digestion iodine extraction . The sample size base estimate dose-response different level dietary iodine iodine excretion .</detailed_description>
