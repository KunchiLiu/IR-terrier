	<brief_summary>Health effect fish consumption demonstrate epidemiological study control intervention study number different population group , however , randomize controlled study effect fish consumption elderly sparse . Many study focus n-3 fatty acid instead fish food therefore , many health effect related effect n- 3 fatty acid . The elderly heterogeneous population group therefore difficult study . In order reduce heterogeneity , advisable focus elderly specific need . Elderly experienced hip fracture serve model advance age process , patient typically experience huge inflammatory response , immobilisation reduction muscle mass . Increased fish intake believe effect towards inflammation reduction muscle mass . Therefore , want test whether increase fish intake positive health effect elderly experience hip fracture . Main hypothesis : Increased fish intake ( salmon , cod , pelagic fish ) , comparison meat , increase mobility , muscle strength mobility frail elderly . Objectives 1 . To evaluate health effect fish consumption frail elderly The effect dietary intervention fish mobility , muscle mass strength elderly experience hip fracture show . 2 . To demonstrate feasibility dietary intervention elderly We want show dietary intervention fish control meal feasible elderly . The meal ( 4 portion fish per week control portion meat ) deliver home . Description work role participant This randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) effect fish consumption mobility elderly experience hip fracture . Elderly experience hip fracture able walk without support person fracture , receive , randomize two group , fish meat use cold warm meal 4 day per week period 16 week . Measurements take baseline ( patient leave rehabilitation center ) , 4 week 16 week . Measurements 4 16 week inclusion home outpatient clinic .</brief_summary>
