	<brief_title>Effect Compression Garments Exercise Performance Following Acute High Intensity Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Eighty recreationally active ( 1-5 hr per week ) healthy participant age 18 - 35 visit Neuromuscular Research Laboratory 6 separate occasion , 4 occasion also require visit Health service blood draw . Procedures ( method ) : During pre-screening , participant complete inform consent document , health history questionnaire , stature body mass assess . A familiarization session conduct separate day participant practice strength assessment , eccentric isokinetic protocol , ultrasound assessment . Participants assign 1 4 treatment group base initial maximal isometric strength value use matched-participants design . The first experimental session begin 2-10 day later , participant perform repeat eccentric exercise protocol ( 10 set 15 eccentric contraction 210 deg/sec 3 min rest set ) non-dominant leg follow 60 min rest period wear apparel perform 5 min warm-up cycle ergometer . Follow-up blood draw strength ultrasound assessment obtain 24 48 hour post-exercise . Each participant also complete visual analog scale baseline , 24 , 48 , 72 hour post-exercise examine perceive muscle soreness .</detailed_description>
