	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause disability United States approximately 795,000 new recurrent stroke per year . An estimated two third patient post-stroke incorporate affect upper extremity ( UE ) activity daily live . In addition , stroke survivor experience 60 % decrease cardiovascular capacity , contribute disability diminish quality life . Developing rehabilitation technique optimize motor recovery improve cardiovascular endurance would benefit stroke population . Animal study use force exercise ( FE ) paradigm , rodent exercise motorize treadmill rate great voluntary rate , indicate endogenous increase neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) glial-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) . These neurotrophic factor think underlie neuroplasticity motor learning . It hypothesize patient stroke , due decrease motor cortical output , sustain high rate voluntary exercise necessary trigger endogenous release neurotrophic factor ; therefore , forced-exercise necessary augment voluntary effort superior voluntary exercise facilitate motor recovery . When coupled repetitive task practice ( RTP ) UE , effective form UE rehabilitation , FE prime brain neuroplasticity . We develop safe effective method deliver forced-exercise Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient ( NIH R21HD056316 ) . Clinical image data PD patient indicate forced-exercise , voluntary exercise , trigger neurophysiologic response central nervous system result global improvement motor non-motor functioning increase cortical subcortical activation . The aim project conduct preliminary trial compare effect force voluntary exercise couple RTP promote recovery motor function patient stroke .</detailed_description>
