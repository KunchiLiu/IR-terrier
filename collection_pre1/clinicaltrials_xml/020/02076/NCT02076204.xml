	<brief_summary>Adverse birth outcome result significant emotional economic cost family community . Research suggest poor birth outcome influence variety social , psychological , behavioral , environmental , biological factor . Home visit program represent promise mean impact area . The Mother Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation - Strong Start ( MIHOPE-Strong Start ) evaluate effectiveness two evidence-based home visiting model improve birth outcome woman enrol Medicaid CHIP . The two model study - Healthy Families America ( HFA ) Nurse-Family Partnership ( NFP ) - show evidence improve birth outcome prior research . The overall goal study determine whether home visiting program improve birth outcome reduce health care cost child 's first year . In addition , evaluation design investigate feature local program home visitation lead great effect birth outcome health care cost . The study include impact analysis measure difference home visiting program make maternal prenatal health health care use , preterm birth birth outcome , infant health health care use . It also include implementation analysis describe family participate examine program model operate local state context . The primary data use study expect survey complete family home visit staff , Medicaid CHIP data , vital record , program service record . Among family eligible study , random assignment use select family enrollment home visiting service . Those select home visiting service form program group , select form comparison group . The research team monitor group time see difference emerge outcome area mention . Although study affect family enroll home visiting service , few family serve result study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study 's conceptual framework three broad aspect : ( 1 ) input ( factor influence service delivery ) , ( 2 ) output ( service deliver ) ( 3 ) outcome family . Each site MIHOPE-Strong Start use either NFP HFA home visit model . Community resource provide foundation program operate consider input influence service provide family . In particular , determine outside referral service available home visiting program opportunity available family program control group . By connect pregnant woman service , home visiting program change mother ' health care use , health behavior , health status , turn lead improvement birth outcome . In community service limit , however , home visiting program may limit capacity improve mother ' connection support . Furthermore , program 's ability improve outcomes influenced `` treatment differential , '' difference service receipt among family receive home visiting family receive home visiting . The control group member receive service similar provide HFA NFP , small `` treatment differential . '' Community context also include community characteristic could affect norm toward use social service health care , influence control group help-seeking program group responses home visiting program . These contextual factor affect program impact positive negative direction . The service model define program plan . It include information intend goal home visit program ; expect frequency , duration , content home visit ; intend linkage service . The MIHOPE-Strong Start implementation study document extent two evidence-based model local counterpart define clear , coherent , well-specified service plan help parent obtain prenatal care , service need reduce risk poor birth outcome , infant health care first year life - critical prerequisite delivering service could affect outcome . In MIHOPE-Strong Start , `` service model '' define two level : service model define national evidence-based model may refine adapted agency operate local program . It important clearly understand HFA NFP define model since model show efficacy prior research . At time , local program often deliberately adapt model fit local context . Given inconsistent impact birth outcome past study , fact , adaptation could one path improvement program impact . There multiple organizational influence home visit program defines service model implementation system . These organization include local program operator , purveyor evidence-based model adopt ( HFA NFP ) , state MIECHV ( Maternal , Infant , Early Childhood Home Visiting Program ) grantee ( site participate MIECHV ) , community organization local agency collaborates . The implementation system include resource carry service model . It incorporate policy procedures staff recruitment , training , supervision evaluation ; assessment tool , protocol curricula guide service delivery ; administrative support ; organizational climate regard fidelity use evidence-based practice ; available consultation address issue beyond home visitor 's skill expertise ; program 's relationship organization facilitate referral service coordination . Other program characteristic affect service deliver include attributes staff give program . NFP specify home visitor register nurse minimum baccalaureate degree nursing . HFA give local site considerable discretion regard . Moreover , individual staff person 's psychological well-being influence approach work family . In addition global attribute , staff may vary degree focus , confidence , competence carry responsibility respect particular outcome , due variation staff training supervision . The implementation study therefore design understand extent service model , also implementation system individual staff , focused activity expect improve birth outcomes maternal infant health care use . The attributes family enroll give home visit program also affect program 's opportunity affect birth outcome . HFA NFP specify characteristic family program serve , yet even within national model , local program sometimes vary family target either community characteristic , vary process family recruitment . Baseline attribute family enroll , turn , influence service staff expect tailor service family 's strength , need , concern ; family vary understand program benefit likely derive ; parent vary capacity , whether psychosocial material resource , engage service offer . These input - service model , implementation system , characteristic home visitor family - affect output , service family receive . Because home visiting program rely heavily referral community organization meet family ' need , output include service provide directly home visit staff referral service . NFP HFA program design affect mother ' prenatal outcome , include use recommend level prenatal care , prenatal health behavior related birth outcome smoke use alcohol substance , mother ' prenatal health . These prenatal outcome may influence birth outcome , birth outcome may directly affect infant health outcome , health care use cost . By improve birth outcome , parent behavior may also improve . Furthermore , home visiting service may indirectly improve infant health health care use regardless impact birth outcome improve parent behavior . Based framework , MIHOPE-Strong Start address follow broad research question : - What impact home visit program use one two evidence-based model birth outcome , maternal infant health , health care use first year postpartum ? How impact vary key subgroup , smoker young mother ? - What impact program use evidence-based model outcome MIHOPE Strong Start ? The design also intend provide information would allow actuary Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) estimate effect program Medicaid cost . The implementation study MIHOPE-Strong Start document key feature HFA 's NFP 's service model implementation system ( national local level ) expect affect birth health outcome . The implementation research answer specific question : - How evidence-based service model — HFA NFP — define ? - How local home visiting program specify adapt service model relative national model affiliate ? - To extent local service model implementation system focus preterm birth relate outcomes ? - What dosage service family actually receive local program much differ intend dosage ? - What kinds referral provide community service could affect birth outcomes child 's mother 's health ? - How program ' input ( two evidence-based model , extent focus birth outcome , family characteristic , staff attribute , community characteristic ) relate achieve output ( particular , dosage service receive referral provide ) ? Finally , study examine intersection impact implementation answer research question : - How home visiting program use two evidence-based model achieve result ? To provide unbiased estimate effect home visit program , family recruit study randomly assign either program group receive home visiting service control group use service available community . Although feasibility carry random assignment must assess community-by-community , discussion state local program thus far indicate need home visiting service far exceed capacity local program place , allow ethical creation control group . Other home visiting service program participate MIHOPE-Strong Start , control group member receive service available community would normally eligible . Control group member receive referral service . After child reach one year age , assign control group able receive home visiting service , eligible local program . The evaluation adhere ethical standard program evaluation undergone human subject review MDRC Institutional Review Board . An impact analysis estimate effect home visit prenatal health care use , birth outcome , infant health , maternal infant health care use infant one year old . The analysis start analysis full sample , evidence-based model ( HFA NFP ) , key subgroup . In three case , result present `` intent-to-treat '' analysis compare program group members—regardless whether actually receive home visit services—with control group member , may receive home visit outside MIECHV program . State Medicaid vital record data collect 18 state provide follow-up data , well baseline data sample member . An implementation study , design complement impact study , collect information community context , influential organization , service model , implementation system , home visitor , family , actual service delivery . The propose evaluation rely multiple source data understand home visiting program implement factor affect quality implementation . These data include information model 's management information system , interview home visitor program manager local site , interview state administrator , community characteristic information U.S. Census . Collecting basic implementation data across large number site enable MIHOPE-Strong Start provide evidence program variation effective improve birth outcome maternal infant health care use . It also provide information program design best improve outcomes future .</detailed_description>
