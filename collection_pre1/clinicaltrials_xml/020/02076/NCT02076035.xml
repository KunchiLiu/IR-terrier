	<detailed_description>It still unknown pathogenesis low back pain lot hypothesis discuss long time . Because non-invasive imaging modality greatly underestimate prevalence epidural pathogenesis endoscopic examination epidural space advocate diagnostic therapeutic modality . It seem immune-inflammatory factor play substantial role pain status . Myeloscopic investigation show morphological picture epidural area patient chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) much complex heterogeneous identify traditional investigation suggest biochemical involvement . Endoscopy epidural space ( epiduroscopy ) minimally invasive technique , use directly visualize pathological feature inside lumbar spinal canal locate tissue responsible elicit pain realize effective therapeutic approach lot different CLBP status due spinal stenosis fail back surgery syndrome . Minimally invasive endoscopic exploration lumbar epidural cavity patient suffer chronic low back pain use identify presence pathological structure within vertebral channel , fibrous adherence , inflammatory process , severe fibrosis and/or stenosis . The need visually inspect epidural space originally arise conventional imaging , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , show significantly less sensitive identify epidural pathology compare direct visualization . In cohort fail back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) patient , 80 % severe epidural fibrosis diagnose epiduroscopy normal MRI examination . More , use identify exact spinal level painful pathology , neither clinical examination MRI evaluation strongly correlate endoscopy finding . The combination disposable easily steerable small video-guide , high-resolution optic specifically design tool mechanical dissectors , electric knife graspers , make technique valid option diagnose treat epidural pathology lumbar region . To deepen molecular cause interindividual variability epiduroscopy outcome term decrease pain , useful analyze DNA variant encode IL6 IL1 cytokine relate gene expression level cytokine dosage . By technique , possible collect biopsy epidural tissue ( usually perform epiduroscopy ) analyze specific expression cytokine : already evidence inflammatory factor may involve genesis LBP . At regard , would really important compare systemic cytokine level epiduroscopy detect immediately post procedure one month , understand cytokine could play key role biomarker epiduroscopy outcome . Concerning DNA polymorphism , demonstrate , many disease-state meta-analyses IL6 variant rs1800795 affect IL6 gene transcription influence IL-6 level ensure statistical robustness association . Moreover , interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) major factor control inflammatory response . The IL-1 gene family include IL-1α , IL-1β IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) gene mediate immune inflammatory response . The IL-1Ra molecule show powerful anti-inflammatory agent inhibit activity IL-1 α IL-1β . Moreover , SNPs IL-1α , IL-1β IL1Ra modify bone mineral density promote intervertebral disc disease ( IDD ) . Literature data show simultaneous carriage IL-1bT3954 IL-1Ra A1812 alleles significantly enhances risk low back pain ( LBP ) occurrence , number day pain , number day limitation daily activity due pain . The investigator try identify correlation success epiduroscopy approach term freedom pain genetic cytokine expression pattern . Finally , investigator compare cytokine gene expression DNA methylation status IL6 promoter patient favorable outcome responder , study role gene expression . In fact , recent study suggest first time methylation status single CpG site IL6 promoter relate IL6 messenger RNA level low methylation contributes risk develop Rheumatoid Arthritis . This study address detect genetic variability might use near future clinical setting , predict success epiduroscopy . The main aim study consist identify whether particular genotype associate inflammation able detect patient positive epiduroscopy outcome , term decrease pain . To achieve , investigator investigate frequency IL1 IL6 gene polymorphism : analyze compare IL1β , IL1Ra , IL6 IFNγ blood cell gene expression ( , immediately post epiduroscopy one month ) obtain epiduroscopy biopsy cell . The investigator also measure IL1β , IL1Ra , IL6 IFNγ level patient serum epiduroscopy , immediately post procedure 1 month .</detailed_description>
