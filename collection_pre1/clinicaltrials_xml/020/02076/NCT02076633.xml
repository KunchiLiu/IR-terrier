	<brief_summary>This Phase II study uncontrolled , multicenter , prospective study patient malignant melanoma skin clinical stage III stage IV M1a . Twenty Patients treated mixture L19IL2 L19TNF weekly 4 week . The dose distribute among lesion via multiple intralesional injection . The proportion patient complete response week 12 calculate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intratumoral Administration L19IL2/L19TNF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>L19IL2 recombinant fusion protein compose fully human recombinant monoclonal antibody ( L19 ) human recombinant interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . IL2 , potent stimulator immune response . It central role regulation T cell response effect immune cell natural killer cell , B cell , monocyte/macrophages neutrophil . IL2 induce tumor regression ability stimulate potent cell-mediated immune response vivo . L19TNF recombinant fusion protein compose fully human recombinant monoclonal antibody ( L19 ) human tumor necrosis factor-alpha , primary mediator immune regulation inflammation . As anti-tumor agent , TNF exert major effect via preferential toxicity endothelial cell tumor-associated vasculature increase antitumor immune response . Given sufficient dos ( e.g . intratumorally ILP set melphalan ) , TNF cause significant tumor shrinkage solid cancer subject . This phase II signal generating study design test efficacy safety intratumorally administer mixture L19IL2 + L19TNF patient suffer metastatic melanoma . It well document intratumoral administration IL-2 lead high response rate unexpectedly favorable longtime outcome several tumor response observe clinical trial Philogen , use intratumorally administer L19IL2 L19TNF ILP set . Preclinical data produce within Philogen group suggest intratumoral administration mixture L19IL2 L19TNF could even effective . After one intratumoral administration mixture L19IL2 L19TNF tumor disappear completely neither L19IL2 L19TNF monotherapy nearly effective .</detailed_description>
