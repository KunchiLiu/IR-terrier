	<brief_summary>This randomize , parallel group , non-blinded phase III trial . Patients advance ( locoregional metastatic ) gastric cancer previously treat chemotherapy stage randomize 1:1 ratio receive low-TOX ( arm A ) EOX ( arm B ) . Randomization stratify performance status ( ECOG 0 1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Tox Vs Eox In Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable Or Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although incidence adenocarcinoma stomach slowly decreasing , gastric cancer represent second worldwide cause cancer death lung cancer . In patient advanced disease , chemotherapy improves survival quality life . Combinations two three drug include platin derivative ( cisplatin oxaliplatin ) , fluoropyrimidine ( 5FU capecitabine ) anthracycline ( usually epirubicin ) demonstrate superiority compare single double agent therapy current standard . As today publish study compare anthracycline-based taxane-based three-drug regimen . The objective present study compare EOX evaluate REAL-2 low-TOX regimen consist docetaxel , oxaliplatin capecitabine . Low-TOX expect well tolerate original DCF regimen . The study perform HER2 negative patient .</detailed_description>
