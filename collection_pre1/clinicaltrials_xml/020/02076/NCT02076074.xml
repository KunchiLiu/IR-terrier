	<brief_summary>This phase I/II clinical trial study side effect deliver radiation therapy single session instead multiple treatment several week see well work treat patient low-risk stage 0-I breast cancer . Partial-breast irradiation , type radiation therapy focus part breast cancer , give low dose standard whole-breast radiation therapy . Single fraction high-gradient partial-breast irradiation may cause few side effect , help prevent breast cancer come back , improve appearance breast quality life patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I/II study evaluate complication rate , local control , cosmetic result , quality life single fraction high gradient partial breast irradiation ( HG-PBI ) use sole method radiation therapy patient pathologic stage 0 ( = &lt; 2 cm ) I carcinoma breast treat partial mastectomy histologically assess negative surgical margin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AJCC 7th Edition stage 0 I ( TisN0 ≤ 2 cm T1N0 ) histologically confirm carcinoma breast , treat partial mastectomy . Axillary sampling require case invasive cancer . Tumor size determine pathologist . Clinical size may use pathologic size indeterminate . Patients invasive cancer must positive axillary lymph node least 6 axillary lymph node sample negative sentinel node . Negative histologic margin partial mastectomy reexcision specimen . Margins generally positive invasive noninvasive tumor ink resection margin , close negative tumor within 2 mm ink margin negative tumor least 2 mm away inked edge . Invasive ductal , lobular , medullary , papillary , colloid ( mucinous ) , tubular histology , mixed histology ( lesion ≤ 2 cm ) estrogen progesterone receptor positive exhibit HER2/neu gene amplification OR ductal carcinoma situ ( lesion ≤ 2 cm ) . Systemic therapy , plan , must adjuvant nature schedule begin least 4 week completion HGPBI . Good candidate treatment per protocol judgment PI and/or treat physician follow simulation . Postmenopausal status . Age ≥ 50 year diagnosis . Able understand willing sign IRBapproved write informed consent document . English speaker . Presence distant metastasis . In situ lobular carcinoma nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma . Proven multicentric carcinoma ( tumor different quadrant breast , tumor separate least 4 cm ) clinically radiographically suspicious area ipsilateral breast unless confirm negative malignancy biopsy . Premenopausal status . Histologically confirm positive axillary node ipsilateral axilla . Palpable radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , internal mammary node , unless histologic confirmation node negative tumor . Prior nonhormonal therapy present breast cancer , include radiation therapy chemotherapy . Diagnosis systemic lupus erythematosis , scleroderma , dermatomyositis . Diagnosis coexist medical condition limit life expectancy &lt; 2 year . Diagnosis psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent . History malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Paget 's disease nipple . Skin involvement , regardless tumor size . Unsatisfactory breast HGPBI determine treat physician . For example , little breast tissue remain skin pectoralis muscle surgery , treatment HGPBI technically problematic . Partial mastectomy extensive cosmetic result fair poor prior HGPBI determine treat physician . Surgical margin microscopically assess positive pathological evaluation . Time final definitive breast procedure HGPBI simulation great 8 week . Inclusion Women Minorities Women member race ethnic group eligible trial . Because breast cancer occur rarely men , men recruit participation .</criteria>
