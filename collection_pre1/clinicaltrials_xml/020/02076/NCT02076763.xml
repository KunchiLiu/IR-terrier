	<brief_summary>This observational prospective study allow evaluate clinical laboratory parameter evolution least eight patient AIP . This study allow establish baseline evaluation eight patient plan include gene therapy clinical trial ( AAVPBGD-AIP-001 ) AIP treatment use rAAV5-AAT-cohPBGD expression . Patients fulfil study inclusion criterion undergo clinical laboratory evaluation minimum 6 month ( one inclusion visit , one final visit least two visit follow ) maximum 24 month inclusion subsequent clinical trial . A complete evaluation clinical ( symptoms quality life assessment ) laboratory ( blood urine ) data collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Acute Intermittent Porphyria Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Intermittent Porphyria ( AIP ) inherit autosomal dominant disorder heme biosynthesis pathway . AIP cause genetic defect porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) key enzyme heme synthesis . AIP characterize acute episode asymptomatic period . Neuropathic symptom predominantly attack , may relate toxic effect produce precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) porphobilinogen ( PBG ) , accumulate enzyme deficiency . It occur low prevalence ( 1 50,000 ) , figure prevalence base clinical manifestation ( i.e. , acute attack ) greatly underestimate number patient latent AIP . Abdominal pain common symptom , sometimes constipation . Paraesthesias paralysis also occur , death may result respiratory paralysis . Many phenomenon , include seizure , psychotic episode , hypertension , develop acute attack ( Kadish 1999 , Anderson 2007 ) . Acute attack rarely occur puberty . They may precipitate porphyrogenic drug barbiturate , progestogen sulfonamide , know induce first rate-controlling step heme synthesis , ALA synthesis . Other known precipitant alcohol , infection , starvation , hormonal change ; attack common woman . This pre-treatment observational study design collect clinical laboratory data later compare baseline post-treatment variable future clinical trial ( AAVPBGD-AIP-001 ) AIP treatment use recombinant adeno-associated virus vector liver-specific promoter PBGD expression ( rAAV5-AAT-cohPBGD ) . The PRIMARY OBJECTIVE observe change PBG ALA urinary level AIP patient . The SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To observe document frequency acute attack , nature frequency symptom , medication hospitalization requirement , neurological involvement , psychological involvement health-related quality life AIP patient . - To record use concomitant medication AIP patient . At least eight patient fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion include . No sample size assessment take account due study nature , number patient consider sufficient meet study objective .</detailed_description>
