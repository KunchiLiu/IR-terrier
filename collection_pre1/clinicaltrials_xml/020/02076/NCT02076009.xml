	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Daratumumab , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone With Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( participant assign chance study treatment ) , open-label ( participant study personnel know identity study treatment ) , active-controlled ( none study treatment placebo ) , parallel-group ( treatment arm run time ) , multicenter study . In study , daratumumab , lenalidomide , low-dose dexamethasone ( DRd ) compare lenalidomide low dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) participant relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio receive either DRd Rd . The study include Screening Phase , Treatment Phase ( involve treatment cycle approximately 28 day length ) , Follow-up Phase . The Treatment Phase extend administration first dose study medication disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Participants also discontinue study treatment : become pregnant ; dose hold 28 day ( 3 consecutive plan dos daratumumab miss reason toxicity ) ; safety reason ( example , adverse event ) . The Follow-up Phase begin end treatment continue death , loss follow-up , consent withdrawal study participation , study end , whichever occur first . Eligible participant Rd group sponsor-confirmed disease progression offer option treatment daratumumab monotherapy ( 28 day cycle ) . The primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Analysis primary endpoint anticipate perform approximately 18 month last subject randomize . Study end anticipate approximately 5 year last subject randomize . Blood urine sample obtain time point study , together bone marrow aspirates/biopsies skeletal survey . Participant safety assess throughout study .</detailed_description>
