	<brief_title>MR-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Pediatric Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) -guided high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) innovative technique allow non-invasive thermal ablation tissue . Advantages conventional local tumor control surgery , radiation , radiofrequency MR-HIFU completely non-invasive , non-ionizing , enable ablation large tumor volume avoidance adjacent tissue injury . This study evaluate safety feasibility MR-HIFU ablative therapy child refractory relapse solid tumor locate bone soft tissue close proximity bone . Children ≤ 21 year age refractory relapse solid tumor measurable target lesion locate bone soft tissue close proximity bone eligible . Tolerability define 28 day follow MR-HIFU ablation . Patients continue follow tumor response secondary outcome one year post ablation treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AGE : ≤ 30 year age . DIAGNOSIS : Histologically confirm malignant solid tumor , may include limited rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor , osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma , Wilms ' tumor , hepatic tumor , germ cell tumor . TUMOR LOCATION : Target lesion ( ) must locate bone soft tissue close proximity bone . Target lesion must reachable within normal safety margin HIFU specify instruction use . TARGET LESION ( S ) : Radiographically evaluable measurable solid tumor target lesion ( ) . THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS : Malignant Tumor : The patient 's cancer must relapse failed respond frontline curative therapy must potentially curative treatment option available . Curative therapy may include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , combination modality . PRIOR THERAPY : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . No limitation number prior chemotherapy regimen patient may receive prior study entry . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : The last dose myelosuppressive anticancer drug must least 3 week prior study entry . Immunotherapy : The last dose immunotherapy ( monoclonal antibody vaccine ) must least 4 week prior study entry . Biologic ( anticancer agent ) : The last dose biologic agent treatment patient 's cancer ( retinoids tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) must least 7 day prior study entry . Radiation therapy : The last dose radiation 25 % marrow contain bone ( pelvis , spine , skull ) must least 4 week prior study entry . The last dose local palliative ( limited port ) radiation must least 2 week prior study entry . Stem Cell Transplantation . At least 2 month postautologous stem cell transplant least 3 month postallogeneic transplant recover toxicity without evidence graft versus host disease stable dos immunosuppressive medication require . Growth Factors . The last dose colony stimulate factor , filgrastim , sargramostim , erythropoietin , must least 1 week prior study entry , last dose longacting colony stimulate factor , pegfilgrastim , must least 2 week prior study entry . CONCURRENT THERAPIES : No anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy ) permit HIFU treatment post treatment follow tolerability ( see section 3.3 ) . PERFORMANCE STATUS : Patients &gt; 10 year old must Karnofsky performance level ≥ 50 % , child ≤ 10 year old must Lansky performance level ≥ 50 % ( See Appendix I ) . Patients unable walk paralysis motor weakness , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION : 1 . Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥750/µL 2 . Platelet count ≥75,000/µL ( may receive transfusion ) RENAL FUNCTION : Ageadjusted normal serum creatinine OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . ADEQUATE PULMONARY FUNCTION : Defined dyspnea rest , pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % room air clinical indication determination . Normal PT , PTT INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( include patient prophylactic anticoagulation ) Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection , hepatic , renal organ dysfunction , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate general anesthetic require procedure . Target lesion pulmonary primary tumor metastasis . Implant prosthesis scar tissue within path HIFU beam . Target &lt; 1 cm nerve plexus , spinal canal , bladder , bowel Target contact hollow viscera Lesion skull Inability undergo MRI and/or contraindication MRI Inability tolerate stationary position HIFU Patients currently receive anticancer agent . Patients currently receive investigational agent .</criteria>
