	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy use radiation treat lung tumor metastases mediastinum . In order irradiate precise possible , order evaluate effect radiation treatment , important depict lung tumor lymph node metastasis accurate possible . Currently , radiation oncologist use PET-CT purpose . However , PET-CT drawback , partly , large volume irradiated current treatment . The investigator believe MRI use improve depiction tumor lymph nodes motion . However , currently MRI protocol available aim improve radiotherapy . In study , investigator want select optimal MRI setting depiction lung tumor , lymph node metastasis movement . The investigator plan first examine 10 healthy volunteer , follow 20 patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Optimization Study Stage III NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : - Patients stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) poor survival due inadequate loco-regional control . Increasing dose lead well loco-regional control survival . However , current treatment planning strategy , increase dose would result intolerable toxicity organ risk ( OARs , healthy tissue surround tumor ) . Therefore , new treatment planning strategy develop improve local control therefore overall survival patient stage III NSCLC . Currently , radiation oncologist use combination image modality delineation lung tumor lymph node : four-dimensional ( 4D ) - compute tomography ( CT ) scan , CT-scan intravenous contrast positron emission tomography ( PET ) -CT fluorodeoxyglucose radioactive tracer . However image modality disadvantages.In current clinical practice , large treatment volume irradiate . This result increase dose OARs . Consequently , increase dose tumor would result intolerable toxicity . The investigator believe MRI use improve visualization tumor lymph node characterize motion , base promising result recent literature . MRI potentially use obtain accurate ( thus small ) treatment volume . This lead small dose OARs enable safe dose escalation . Unfortunately MRI protocols literature available aim radiotherapy lung cancer . The objective study twofold . The investigator would first like use MRI volunteer select appropriate technique motion compensation . Furthermore , MRI setting seek use image lung mediastinal parenchyma . Second , investigator would like ass MRI sequence find volunteer visualization tumor lymph node patient stage III NSCLC . Furthermore , investigator would like ass MRI use ( automatic ) motion characterization tumor , lymph node organ risk . The sequence find study use future study add value MRI radiotherapy treatment planning stage III NSCLC , MRI also compare PET-CT . Objectives : - To select appropriate technique image lung mediastinal parenchyma . Furthermore , MRI setting seek use motion compensation . - To optimize validate MRI visualization motion characterization tumor , lymph node mediastinal parenchyma patient stage III NSCLC . Study design : Observational study . Study population:10 healthy volunteer 20 patient pathologically proven stage III NSCLC lymph node metastasis ( i.e . exclude T4N0 ) refer department Radiation Oncology . Procedure : Healthy volunteer undergo MRI scan without intravenous contrast . Patients undergo contrast-enhanced MRI scan . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : - Healthy volunteer undergo MRI scan maximal duration 45 minute . One visit hospital ( last approximately 75 minute ) require healthy volunteer receive gift voucher value 25 euro . MRI-safety screening require MRI scan , consist routine screen accord clinical guideline determine Department Radiology UMCU . - Patients undergo MRI scan maximal duration 45 minute . The total visit department ( include patient preparation , change clothes etc . ) last approximately 75 minute . For determination renal function , recent value Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) ( ≤21 day ) available . After proper screening , use MRI safe . The use gadolinium contrast ( Gadovist ) low risk contrast induce allergy . For patient include study individual benefit .</detailed_description>
