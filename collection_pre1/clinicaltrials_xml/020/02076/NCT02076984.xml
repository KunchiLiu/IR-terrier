	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND During past 50 year , incisional ventral hernia repair surgery evolve direct suture repair use synthetic mesh order obtain tension-free repair ( 1-3 ) . Finally tension-free concept apply laparoscopic surgery . Laparoscopic repair ventra/incisional hernia gain increase popularity , since many study recent meta-analysis consensus conference report encouraging result , term wind infection , hospital stay post-operative pain recurrence rate comparable open approach ( 1-7 ) . Patient selection ( age , sex , comorbidities , obesity , hernia site size , eventual recurrence type previous abdominal surgery ) , choice mesh ( bio-materials , size shape ) fixation method ( titanium tack , absorbable tack , fibrin glue ) consider crucial issue prevent recurrence complication well patient compliance acceptance ( 4-5 , 8-9 ) . The choice mesh implant paramount importance , open well laparoscopic approach . During last decade , many mesh fixation device propose tested tool enhance primary incisional/ventral hernia repair ( 10-11 ) . Light-weight mesh propose order reduce mesh and/or mesh fixation relate complication ( 12 ) . Decreasing density non-absorbable material reduce `` foreign-body response '' postulate , result improve abdominal wall compliance , less mess shrinkage , thus allow good integration host tissue ( 13-14 ) . The `` lightweight approach '' also base result study concern abdominal wall biomechanics ( 15-16 ) suggest characteristic `` ideal mesh '' ( elasticity , tensile strength pressure resistance ) similar normal abdominal wall . The ideal mesh , elastic enough comply movement elongation different area abdominal wall , yet rigid enough avoid herniation mesh , strong resist position , without degradation , deformation ( shrinkage ) creation defect , life-long . Among great amount mesh material utilized laparoscopic repair , macropore lightweight polypropylene demonstrate efficient material ( include heavy weight polypropylene ) term inflammatory response mesh integration host tissue ( 17-21 ) . The crucial issue inlaparoscopic repair choice mesh fixation method : commonly use include metal spiral tack set double crown configuration ( 22-26 ) . Absorbable tack recently introduce ( 27 ) order improve biocompatibility , reduce risk endoperitoneal adhesion due presence metallic tack , reduce mid- long-term postoperative pain . The rationale use absorbable tack laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repairusing lightweight macropore polypropylene mesh biochemical biomechanical mesh feature , since mesh become well integrated abdominal wall need permanent fixation device . To date , two retrospective study deal clinical use absorbable tack lightweight macropore polypropylene mesh publish ( 28-29 ) . The author report similar result compare absorbable v non absorbable tack term intraoperative early post-operative result ( 29 ) . These study pitfalls retrospective evaluation small series patient , report result still need validated large series prospective study . THE PRIMARY END POINTS prospective multicentric randomize study : - compare mid long-term result use metallic tack absorbable tack fix lightweight polypropylene mesh laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair , term hernia recurrence , order establish safety effectiveness absorbable tack ; - compare intraoperative early port-operative outcome , term surgical complication , post-operative stay , return normal life activity pain management . METHODS/STUDY DESIGN The prospective randomize multicentric trial involve 6 Surgical Unit large experience laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair use lightweight polypropylene mesh metallic absorbable tack ( learn curve ) . The Referral Centre ( General Surgery Unit , ICOT Hospital , Latina , Italy ) , coordinate study responsible data analysys interim evaluation ( 12 month ) . 200 patient include study ( see inclusion criterion table 1 ) , divide two group base real-time randomization : - Group A : patient candidate laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair lightweight polypropylrne mesh fix metallic tack ; - Group B : patient candidate laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair lightweight polypropylene mesh fix absorbable tack . Blind Randomization guarantee dedicate website restricted access password surgical unit participate study . All patient evaluate clinical examination , abdominal CT scan US scan , order evaluate size number defect ( ) . All device use study ( mesh tack ) : - Physiomesh™ ( Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Johnson &amp; Johnson , Inc ) lightweight polypropylene mesh double face absorbable layer make place peritoneal surface prevent adhesion visceral structure ; - Protack™ ( Covidien surgical , Mansfield MA , USA ) , permanent titanium spiral tack ; - Securestrap™ ( Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Johnson &amp; Johnson , Inc ) , `` U '' -shaped absorbable tack make polydioxanone , completely absorb within 12-18 month implant . All procedure carry use surgical technique implant fix mesh ( overlap defect least 3 cm side ) , tack set double crown configuration distance 1,5 cm , use transfixed suture glue . After surgery , compressive dressing place 4 week . A record form ( included bottom ) fill patient , send coordinate centre patient discharge . Follow schedule : - 1 week ( clinical evaluation ) - 4 week ( clinical evaluation dress removal ) - 6 month ( clinical evaluation phone interview ) - 12 month ( phone call eventual clinical evaluation ) - 24 month surgery ( phone call eventual clinical evaluation ) - 36 month surgery ( phone call eventual clinical evaluation ) The following parameter evaluate : - Patients characteristic ( sex , age , comorbidities , personal therapy ) - Hernia feature ( location size ) - Mesh size - Type tack - Number tack - Operating time - Post-operative course - Post-operative complication ( accord Clavien-Dindo classification ) - Acute Post-operative pain ( use Visual Numeric Scale pain classification ) - Return life activity - Recurrence rate - Chronic pain Data represent continuous variable ( Age , operate time , etc . ) express arithmetic mean +/- standard deviation . Because skewed nature , data , length hospital stay , pain evaluate Visual Numeric Scale , express geometric mean +/- 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Other data , wound infection , hernia recurrence event low incidence , express number percentage occurrence group . Statistical significance analysis indicate p value 0.05 less . Analysis perform dedicate software ( SAS late release Windows ) .
