	<detailed_description>In clinical trial 3-6 patient assign L19TNFalfa one follow sequential dose level ( 10.4 µg/kg , 13 µg/kg 17 µg/kg ) combination fix dose doxorubicin . The RD define follow traditional 3+3 design . The dose escalation continue MTD find , least two patient among cohort three six patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) .</detailed_description>
