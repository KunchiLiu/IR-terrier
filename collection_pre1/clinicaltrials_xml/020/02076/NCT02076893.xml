	<brief_summary>Tonsillectomy common pediatric surgical procedure perform US , 530,000 procedure perform annually child 15 year ( Baugh et al. , 2011 ) . The postoperative period particularly painful . A recent clinical consensus acknowledge standard analgesic protocol , call research compare postoperative pain medication ( Baugh et al. , 2011 ) . Tramadol find effective codeine report side effect recent double-blinded , controlled trial conduct investigator Children 's Hospitals Clinics ( CHC ) , currently prescribe postoperative setting . However , despite effectiveness pain control , child continue report pain 10-day follow-up period . In response , investigator conduct randomize , double-blinded control trial determine whether add schedule gabapentin schedule tramadol + `` need '' ( PRN ) ibuprofen regimen provide good pain control tramadol + ibuprofen PRN alone post-tonsillectomy period . Using 10-day take-home diary , caregiver ask record daily information child 's postoperative pain core outcome domains recommended recent consensus statement put forth Pediatric Initiative Methods , Measurement , Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ( IMMPACT ) ( McGrath et al. , 2008 ) . This study offer new information regard efficacy side effect associate add schedule gabapentin postoperative pain management protocol pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Tramadol/Gabapentin/Ibuprofen Versus Tramadol/Placebo/Ibuprofen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses H1 : Children receive schedule tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h schedule gabapentin ( 3 mg/kg/q6h dose ) PRN ibuprofen experience well pain relief child receive schedule tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h PRN ibuprofen follow tonsillectomy . H2 : Children receive schedule tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h schedule gabapentin PRN ibuprofen report few side effect child receive schedule tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h PRN ibuprofen follow tonsillectomy . This prospective study include child age 4 15 schedule undergo tonsillectomy ( without adenoidectomy ) procedure CHC 's Minneapolis campus one three Children 's Ear , Nose , Throat Facial Plastic Surgery surgeon . The three surgeon perform standardized surgical technique . The study prospective , randomize , double-blinded . Neither patient /caregiver ( ) person ( ) evaluate patient postoperatively know whether patient assign Group 1 Group 2 . A random number list generate assign sequential patient Group 1 Group 2 order eliminate selection bias due group assignment post-operative evaluation . To minimize potential risk associate either tramadol gabapentin administer obese child ( i.e , child 85th percentile BMI high ) medication dose cap rate represent 85th percentile child 's age , sex height . Caregivers advise administer schedule tramadol five day along schedule gabapentin ( placebo ) five day . PRN dose ibuprofen may administer throughout 10-day study period . For postoperative day 6-10 , group advise switch PRN regimen ibuprofen tramadol . Caregivers advise NOT administer study medication child show sign over-sedation ( respiratory rate lower normal , slurred speech , etc . ) vomit result study drug , AND ask call Ear Nose &amp; Throat group case severe pain side effect ( 24/7 contact information provide ) . If patient display sign severe over-sedation ( breathe rate le 12 breaths/minute , difficulty inability arouse ) parent advise call 911 . If doubt , caregiver ask call 24/7 ENT group phone number . For adverse event arise study period , non-urgent urgent , first point contact family Children 's Ear Nose &amp; Throat Facial Plastic Surgery . If family contact Children 's pharmacy question related dosing side effect , pharmacy staff either contact Children 's Ear , Nose &amp; Throat Facial Plastic Surgery refer family . For severe adverse event ( respiratory depression , sedation , seizure , etc . ) and/or child see physician due potential drug side effect , pharmacist authorized break blind . If doubt , pharmacist call Children 's Ear , Nose &amp; Throat Facial Plastic Surgery guidance . Staff Assessment Caregiver Diary The following patient clinical information collect research staff : patient 's age , gender , race , diagnosis ( apnea chronic tonsillitis ) , concomitant medication use , postoperative pain , tonsil size rat scale 1 4 ( see Appendix I ) . The choice outcome domains measure study base consensus paper develop Pediatric Initiative Methods , Measurement , Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ( PedIMMPACT ) expert panel ( McGrath et al. , 2008 ) . Acute pain domain include caregiver diary study . A daily diary complete caregiver use track patient 's pain symptom , side effect , adverse event , recovery first 24 hour ten day post-surgery . This diary develop modify base feedback received diary use recent clinical trial ( Friedrichsdorf , unpublished ) . In addition , research coordinator contact caregiver every second day collect data insure diary complete . The patient /caregiver data compare response provide telephone call order validate diary entry . Intensity pain discomfort due pain measure utilizing several method include : validate pain scale , documentation use analgesic rescue medication , wake sleep , time ability eat solid food , time return normal activity . Other outcome measure include : fluid intake , general satisfaction treatment , economic impact recovery ( e.g. , need additional outpatient care throat and/or ear pain , bleeding , nausea , poor eating ) . In study , pain self-assessment child adolescent include Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) ( anchor 0=no pain 10=highest pain imaginable ) child age 4-10 ( Hicks et al. , 2001 ) , NRS-11 ( anchor 0=no pain 10 = high pain imaginable ) child age 11-15 ( note : child age 8-10 year ask choose either FPS-R NRS-11 , scale validate use child middle age range ) . The designated caregiver participate study receive training pain scale administration . The study coordinator research associate call caregiver every two day follow-up period remind complete diary return postage-paid envelope provide research staff . Data Requirements Data Maintenance All paper form store lock file cabinet locate Pain Palliative Care department office . Data enter Excel secure , password-protected Children 's server export SPSS analysis . The study coordinator maintain paper electronic data . Risks/Benefits Risks There additional medical risk associate post-surgical pain management beyond usual risk . Neither tramadol gabapentin pose know additional safety risk . However , little publish pediatric literature two medication application postoperative setting , researcher form small Data Safety Monitoring Committee comprise Children 's staff member part study . This committee responsible review serious adverse event request researcher ( e.g. , pharmacist , pain expert , etc. ) . As study , risk loss confidentiality due possibility people outside study ( e.g. , staff , family ) may become aware child 's participation study . The researcher make every effort ensure patient ' privacy use private room research-related activity . Paper research form store Pain Palliative Care office lock file cabinet , electronic data store password-protected file Children 's server . Benefits There possibility child receive tramadol plus gabapentin PRN ibuprofen recovery period report well pain control , few side effect , child receive tramadol plus PRN ibuprofen . Future child family may benefit knowledge gain study term improve pain management post-tonsillectomy recovery period . Analysis Analysis Plan The following outcome measure two , four 24 hour post-surgery , daily duration follow-up period : - Pain : Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS-11 ) - Postoperative pain : Parents ' Postoperative Pain Measure ( PPPM ) - Pre/Postoperative medication use , include rescue medication - Patient- caregiver-reported side effect - Sleep : difficulty fall asleep difficulty wake - Fluid intake - Number patient require outpatient care complication tonsillectomy include , limited : throat and/or ear pain , bleeding , nausea - Parent global satisfaction treatment , record 0-10 ( 0=Very Dissatisfied 10=Very Satisfied ) visual analog scale . Descriptive statistic use describe participant measurement result include frequency distribution categorical data gender sleep problem ( Yes/No ) , mean ( standard deviation ) median ( range ) continuous data age , fluid intake , pain intensity score parent global satisfaction child 's recovery . The number day pain intensity score great 4 compare tramadol/ibuprofen group tramadol/gabapentin/ibuprofen group use two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney test . The PPPM score parental global satisfaction child 's recovery two group compare use two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney test well . Eta correlation coefficient calculate examine relationship PPPM score pain intensity score . Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use compare categorical data two group percent patient postoperative office visit due pain/bleeding/nausea side effect happen postoperative 10 day . A logistic regression model fit 'patients &gt; 2 day pain score &gt; 4 ' dependent variable factor patient age , procedure , medication independent variable order identify clinical factor predictive postoperative pain follow tonsillectomy child . Sample Size Group sample size 30 30 achieve 80 % power detect difference 2 day pain score &gt; 4 Tramadol group Gabapentin group estimate group standard deviation 2.7 significance level 0.05 use two-sided two-sample t-test . Assuming 20 % dropout , least 36 patient need group . The researcher plan enroll least 80 parent . Environment The study take place Children 's Minneapolis campus . Data store Pain , Palliative Integrative Medicine office , currently locate Medical Doctor 's Building . This study make use CHC 's outpatient pharmacy service order ensure proper dispense blinding .</detailed_description>
