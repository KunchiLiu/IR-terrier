	<brief_summary>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , ibuprofen , excellent medication provide pain control child fracture surgery correct bony deformity require bone cut ( osteotomy ) realign . There data suggest type medication adversely affect bone heal adult patient broken bone spine fusion surgery . There little data regard medication effect bone heal child . With project , investigator ' goal determine NSAIDs delay otherwise adversely effect bone heal demonstrate medication adequately control pain child break bone osteotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect NSAID Use Acute Phase Skeletally Immature Bone Healing : A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) effective control post-operative pain pain associate orthopaedic injury , particularly pediatric population . Additionally , use NSAIDs pain control set avoids use narcotic pain medication , adverse effect well know . Recent research suggest possible association use NSAIDs impair fracture heal skeletally mature , adult , population . Several adult mammal study demonstrate inhibition bony repair administration NSAIDs . Yet , adult animal study fail find effect . Clinical data adult population similarly conflict , study show inhibition bone heal posterior spinal fusion , large study find correlation . The data investigating effect NSAID use adult fracture osteotomy even less clear study demonstrate high rate non-union NSAID administration others find significant effect bone healing . The research investigate outcome skeletally immature population limit ; one study compare administration ketorolac versus normal saline 7 , 14 21 day juvenile rat model stabilize tibia fracture . They find significant difference strength , stiffness histological characteristic fracture callus two group . Clinical retrospective study pediatric population regard use NSAIDs posterior spinal fusion fail reproduce finding inhibitory effect bone healing . Similarly , two retrospective study find case delay union non-union pediatric patient receive perioperative ketorolac around time operative fixation fracture , osteotomy . Given result , way degree NSAIDs perturb inflammatory mileu acute phase heal potentially distinct effect bone heal skeletally mature . There clinical prospective , randomize study evaluate effect , , NSAIDs bone heal skeletally immature patient population . The investigator hypothesize NSAID administration acute phase bone healing , whether fracture osteotomy , result delay union non-union compare patient take acetaminophen pain control time period .</detailed_description>
