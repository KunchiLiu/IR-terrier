	<brief_summary>Background - Aortic valve stenosis ( AS ) common heart valve disease among adult Western world prevalence 3 % people older 75 year age . AS usually deteriorate time lead heart failure , high mortality aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) perform . Thus optimal timing AVR crucial , challenge . Increasing life expectancy society augment therapeutic socio economic impact AS disease health care system . Therefore , new technique monitor asymptomatic AS patient need . A potential approach monitoring LV myocardial efficiency ( mechanical work/oxygen consumption ) . These measure suggest involved progression non-valvular heart failure closely related prognosis , never apply large population patient AS . At present recognize pharmacological treatment AS . It known beta-blocker treatment non-valvular systolic heart failure reduce heart rate , improve LV myocardial efficiency reduces mortality . However , patient AS , effect beta-blockers unknown . Hypotheses - Treatment beta-blocker metoprolol succinate patient asymptomatic moderate severe AS beneficial effect LV myocardial oxidative metabolism , myocardial efficiency contractile function . Objectives - To investigate beta-blocker treatment patient moderate severe , asymptomatic AS beneficial effect LV myocardial efficiency , contractile function physical performance . Design - A randomized double blind placebo control intervention trial . 40 patient asymptomatic AS randomized either per oral metoprolol succinate ( N = 20 ) placebo ( N= 20 ) 22 week . Primary objective - Changes myocardial efficiency Secondary objectives - Myocardial oxygen consumption , Myocardial perfusion rest , LV myocardial function , LVmass , Aortic valve area transaortic valve velocity , 6 minute walk distance , N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide , Quality life ( estimate Minnesota live heart failure questionnaire ) , LV wall stress Methods - Patients undergo echocardiography ( rest exercise ) , [ 11C ] acetate PET cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .</brief_summary>
