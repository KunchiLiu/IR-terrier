	<brief_summary>This double-blind , mask , compare placebo clinical trial healthy volunteer without tuberculosis infection . This trial aim study effect probiotic Nyaditum resae® level specific Regulatory T cell ( Treg ) memory cell one week first administration global tolerability treatment . Nyaditum resae® preparation form drinkable vial contain heat-killed environmental mycobacteria . The overall objective study effect Nyaditum resae® immunity , could reduce risk develop active tuberculosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence tuberculosis still problem first magnitude . Every year 1.5 million people die ; 10 million case illness 100 million new infect . The grow problem multiresistance add , remain prevalent : 700,000 patient , figure increase annually 100,000 people . Prevention tuberculosis currently difficult disease cause bacillus ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) transmit air : No risk factor become infect identify still prophylactic vaccine prevents infection . One characteristic aspect tuberculosis majority ( 90-95 % ) people without immunity alteration develop disease infect . As people develop disease , still know develop . A group researcher Institut Germans Trias Pujol recently discover mechanism explains trend . In short , happen certain people create strong inflammatory response tuberculosis bacillus , end create massive destruction tissue around bacillus brings characteristic lesion tuberculosis : tuberculous cavity . This group researcher devise way `` reeducate '' immune system bacillus make aggressive . And use two instrument . The first one , environmental mycobacteria , namely bacillus family mycobacteria tuberculosis , usually live water drink , great less extent investigator already intestinal flora . The second , induce tolerant response , like investigator eat food . To induce tolerant response , low repeat dos product make immune system digestive duct `` use '' presence . Thus , become find product , immune system reacts light balance manner , avoid excessive inflammatory response . The clear example fact immune system `` use '' feed proteins generates rejection answer find intestinal mucosa . Hence come probiotic Nyaditum resae® , preparation form drinkable vial , contain heat-killed environmental mycobacteria thus generate cross-immunity tuberculosis bacillus . By give low repeat dose generate tolerant response , happen infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis , balance immune response trigger able reduce risk develop active tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
