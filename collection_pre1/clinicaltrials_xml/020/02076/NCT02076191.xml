	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety tolerability ruxolitinib different dose level combination decitabine effectiveness ruxolitinib combination decitabine patient accelerate blast phase Myeloproliferative Neoplasm ( MPN ) , group diseases bone marrow excess cell produce . Ruxolitinib drug approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient advance forms myelofibrosis . It inhibit Jak protein often abnormal MPN . A recent clinical study show ruxolitinib treatment could put patient disease remission . Decitabine chemotherapy , approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) , use treat acute leukemia . It work patient , patient accelerate blastic MPN respond treatment . Ruxolitinib decitabine combine study find dose two medicine safe together . Using Ruxolitinib combination Decitabine experimental . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad patient disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At time , standard medical treatment MF-BP MF-AP . The investigator believe combination ruxolitinib DEC candidate approach treatment MF-BP/MF-AP worthy exploration base current understanding biology disease emerge preclinical data . The molecular pathogenesis MPN progression blast phase almost certainly due complex combination gene mutation ( JAK2V617F , MPL ) epigenetic alteration ( IDH1/2 , IKZF1 , EZH2 , TET2 ) culminate emergence leukemic clone . Recent evidence indicate JAK2V617F protein localize nucleus influence global DNA methylation pattern may lead genomic instability disease progression . The inhibition JAK-STAT mediate cell proliferation survival conjunction reversal DNA hypermethylation tumor suppressor gene would predict least additive synergistic effect induce apoptosis cell belong malignant myeloid clone . Correlative study conduct within trial Private Confidential MPD-RC 109 Ruxolitinib + Decitabine combination JAK2 inhibitor DMNT1 inhibitor patient MPN-BP would explore effect methylation status various gene promoter well influence gene expression chromatin related proteins ultimately leukemic cell survival . The sequential administration JAK2 inhibitor follow DNMT inhibitor would also potentially serve overcome JAK2-independent effect epigenetic lesion lead MPN-BP . In addition , murine model leukemic transformation describe . In model , bone marrow obtain Tp53 null mouse retrovirally transduce Jak2V617F , transplant donor C56BL/6 mouse . The transplanted mouse develop MPN progress AML . In vitro drug study utilize bone marrow leukemic mouse demonstrate exposure decitabine ruxolitinib inhibits colony formation methylcellulose colony-forming assay . Importantly , combination decitabine ruxolitinib assay significantly reduces colony formation compare either drug alone ( Rampal et al . ASH 2012 oral abstract 808 ) thus provide pre-clinical evidence combination study propose .</detailed_description>
