	<brief_title>DEtect Long-term Complications After icD rEplacement : Multicenter Italian Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based positive outcome numerous randomize , control trial , implantable defibrillator include current European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) American College Cardiology / American Heart Associations ( ACC/AHA ) guideline standard care select patient , thus ICD use currently increase worldwide . In year initial implantation , device replacement may become necessary battery depletion upgrade complex multi-lead ICDs . The increase generator lead advisory recall contributes patient consider replacement . The determination procedural adverse event complex , require monitor short-term complication long-term patient outcome . Previous retrospective series examine complication ICD replacement . Moreover , recent REPLACE registry prospectively collect 6-month complication rate patient undergoing pacemaker ICD generator replacement 72 private practice academic site United States . This study examine broad range major minor complication find ICD replacement associate notable complication risk , particularly transvenous lead addition revision require . Previous retrospective series examine complication ICD implantation Italian clinical practice , show frequent intervention system revision demonstrate association adverse event complexity implant device ( i.e . Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy CRT-D versus single- dual-chamber ICD ) . Moreover , show device replacement procedure associate significantly high risk infection . Nonetheless , detailed data complication ICD replacement current Italian clinical practice unavailable . This information would particularly important ICD replacement-related event may associate bad clinical outcome , also incremental cost healthcare system . The analysis adverse event would permit study new preventative strategy significant clinical well financial benefit . Moreover , quantification complication rate ICD replacement would permit estimate actual long-term cost ICD therapy , assess impact ICD longevity cost-effectiveness therapy . This study design prospectively estimate long term complication rate ( 12-months 5-years ) patient undergo ICD generator replacement . The study also evaluate predictor complication , patient 's management replacement procedure clinical practice estimate cost related use health care resource . All consecutive patient standard indication ICD generator replacement enrol In study . The decision perform generator replacement upgrade exist device make accord investigator ' clinical assessment patient . The study mandate specific surgical implantation technique venous access , use temporary pacemaker , surgical site choice . Any commercially available generator lead include . Patients follow 60-month period periodical in-hospital visit remote ICD interrogation via remote patient monitoring ( RPM ) system , accord standard hospital practice physician 's discretion .</detailed_description>
