	<brief_title>Amp 30 : Autologous Fat Grafting , Amputation Sites Pain : Randomized</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize autologous fat graft provide minimally invasive therapy facilitate enable technology specialize instrumentation effectively mitigate pain syndrome amputation site , introduce volume stable subcutaneous tissue bony prominence peripheral nerve trunk , thereby avoid surgical revision preserve limb length . We hypothesize enrich fat graft autologous adipose stromal cell utilizing Tissue Gensis Cell Isolation System ( CIS ) , regenerative medicine approach , lead improve retention fat graft time result favorable outcome . Specific Aims : 1 . Treat painful amputation sit 30 patient fat graft provide additional subcutaneous tissue pad bony structure nerve trunk . Limb anatomy heal graft time , along stability/persistence new tissue , assess high resolution CT scan 3D reconstruction . Patients follow 24 month treatment define long term outcome . The primary outcome measure pain amputation site improve ability tolerate prosthesis . Patients randomize receive either standard fat grafting ( 15 patient ) cell enrich fat grafting ( 15 patient ) . Patients enrol pain amputation site limit function and/or interferes ability use prosthesis . 2 . Assess biologic property cell within fat graft correlate clinical outcome . This include adipose stem cell yield per volume fat tissue , cell proliferation , capacity adipogenic differentiation , lipolysis , cell sub-population analysis multiparameter flow cytometry . Results assay correlate graft volume retention search predictor good clinical outcome relate variation adipose biology subject . 3 . Measure quality life patient autologous fat graft use validated psychosocial measure . This include , among tool , SF 36 , Beck inventory , instrument design assess limb function . Study Design : Single center site , prospective , randomize , pilot outcome study treatment perform University Pittsburgh . The primary outcome measurement : 1 ) fat graft retention amputation site ; 2 ) improve ability tolerate prosthetic device . This study examine fat graft cell enrichment use Tissue Gensis Cell Isolation System , ( CIS ) demonstrate increase fat retention decrease pain compare standard fat graft alone . Clinical Impact : This study significantly impact military trauma care validate minimally invasive cell base technique alleviate pain amputation sit improve function prosthesis . Importantly , goal reach without invasive surgery , increase risk , prolonged recovery . Given high amputation rate current conflict , work highly relevant care wound warrior . A major goal study transfer technique knowledge gain physician throughout Department Defense healthcare system .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Aged 18 year older able provide inform consent Has amputation pain limit fit use prosthesis , despite maximal attempt refit prosthesis and/or change design prosthesis and/or Have amputation pain limit use assistive device ( ) despite maximal attempt change design use device Be least 3 month postinjury postsurgery ( trauma procedure ) acute edema resolve Soft tissue deficiency note amputation stump cover intact skin Willing able comply follow examination , include radiographic study Subjects , opinion Investigator , able understand study , comply study design willing return clinic research require followup visit Subjects residual limb problem include upper low limb loss , and/or individual partial hand , partial foot proximal injury . Subjects Intolerability may include appropriate soft tissue padding , soft tissue coverage , pain n't allow consistent wear prosthetic socket . ( This may include excessive pain , inability achieve adequate suspension prosthesis individual , continual skin breakdown , excessive pressure/shear skin , soft tissue , nerve , scar , etc . ) and/or Subjects Intolerability limit use assistive device ( ) aid mobility daily living activity involve functional use affect limb . Subjects unable consistently wear prosthetic socket must receive minimum 3 month unsuccessful prosthetic fitting trial . This include minimum least 5 different socket adjustment . This include recast residual limb , provide pressure relief within socket , change alignment prosthetic component alter ground reactive force , add padding pressure sensitive area . Likewise , subject use assistive device must receive minimum 3 month unsuccessful assistive device adjustment . This information pertain history prosthetic fit attempt may receive referral physician , prosthetics and/or orthotics direct report and/or subject selfreport and/or medical record review . Subjects approximate range defect volume 5cc much 300cc . defect local soft tissue deficiency pressure point . ( The volume defect correlate moderate severe intolerability prosthesis ) Subjects must current relationship prosthetist and/or Assistive device Technician . Subjects history cancer affect limb result surgical amputation maybe eligible . Subjects history embolus affected limb result surgical amputation maybe eligible Age le 18 year Patient inability provide inform consent process . Amputated limb area intend treatment open wound tunnel Active drainage active infection unresolved one course antibiotic treatment Active infection anywhere body Diagnosed cancer within last 12 month /or presently receive chemotherapy radiation treatment Known coagulopathy symptom /diagnosis Systemic disease would render fat harvest injection procedure , along associate anesthesia , unsafe patient ( e.g. , scleroderma , lupus , vasculatures , collagen disease etc . ) Pregnancy History Diabetes Mellitus History severe peripheral arterial disease Subjects Axis I DSMIV diagnosis ( e.g. , Schizophrenia , Bipolar disorder ) find clinically ( i.e . medically ) unstable baseline . Individuals manifest either : 1 ) evidence currently active alcohol psychoactive drug abuse dependence SCID interview , 2 ) GAF score 40 low due acute psychiatric symptomatology ( e.g . suicidality , psychosis , severe depression mania ) review CoI Psychosocial Assessment PI determination possible medical instability . Final determination medically unstable status make PI basis overall medical status appropriateness medical procedure ; patient may consider ineligible study participation per Physician 's discretion . Subjects abnormal blood biochemistry abnormal laboratory find consider clinically significant would deem subject inappropriate surgical procedure . This criterion help exclude subject severe nutritional deficiency , anemia , coagulopathy , renal liver dysfunction , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , determine investigator ( i.e . CBC Differential , platelet , comprehensive metabolic panel include electrolyte , bun/creatinine , liver function test coagulation test ) . As general safety measure , exclude patient lab value list : Hct le 30 % INR great 1.8 Creatinine great 2.0 Liver function test ( ALT , AST , Bilirubin ) great 2 time upper limit Albumin Less 2.0 Platelets less 70 Subjects per clinical discretion investigator , would appropriate study . ( e.g . potential medication and/ medical diagnosis capture exclusion , could render subject 's participation study unsafe , would adverse effect fat metabolism fat healing ) .</criteria>
