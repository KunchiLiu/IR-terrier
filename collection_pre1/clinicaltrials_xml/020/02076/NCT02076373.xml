	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Repair Cerebral Injury Very Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide , 1 % infant born preterm less 32 week gestation , 2 month expect date delivery . If small infant suffer addition prematurity second hit , intraventricular hemorrhage parenchymal infarction , high risk learn disability , mental retardation , cerebral palsy later life . Intraventricular hemorrhage parenchymal infarction occur 12 % preterm infant , mostly small within first day birth , record cranial ultrasound . Except shunt insertion divert cerebrospinal fluid infant posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus possibly removal blood clot , treatment establish intracerebral bleeding , medical therapy exist ameliorate neurodevelopmental sequela . Apart stimulate production red blood cell bone marrow , recombinant human erythropoietin ( Epo ) show exert neuroprotective action variety animal model clinical study . Epo administration find beneficial safe randomize control trial ( RCT ) involve adult infant patient . Observational data suggest Epo administer preterm infant order prevent anemia improve long-term cognitive outcome school-age especially infant suffer intracerebral bleeding . These data , however , observational therefore allow firm conclusion recommendation . The hypothesis generate data call confirmation refutation RCT design address question .</detailed_description>
