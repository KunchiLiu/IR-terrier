	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator use FMISO-PET MRI scan explore delivery bevacizumab blood vessel patient 's recurrent glioblastoma treatment . Bevacizumab approve U.S. Food Drug Administration use patient recurrent glioblastoma . It work target specific protein call VEGF , play role promote growth spread tumor blood vessel . Since anti-VEGF agent also affect normal blood vessel brain , inhibit way drug use combination bevacizumab deliver tumor . In PET scan , radioactive substance inject body . The scan machine find radioactive substance , tend go cancer cell . For PET scan research study , investigator use investigational radioactive substance call FMISO . `` Investigational '' mean role FMISO-PET scan still study research doctor try find . FMISO go area low oxygenation part tumor enough oxygen see . In addition , vascular MRI use evaluate change tumor blood flow , blood volume , receptive blood vessel . This scan performed time FMISO-PET scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study add additional treatment patient malignant glioma already schedule receive bevacizumab monotherapy . All treatment decision discretion treat physician . There change diagnosis management patient base procedure test carry part study . If participant chooses take part research study treatment cycle last 28 day . - Day 1-The participant follow procedure do receive bevacizumab : - An assessment participant 's tumor Vascular MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) FMISO-PET scan - Blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . - Day 14 : The participant follow procedure do receive bevacizumab : - An assessment participant 's tumor Vascular MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) FMISO-PET scan participant receive bevacizumab - Blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . - Day 28 : The participant follow procedure do receive bevacizumab : - An assessment participant 's tumor Vascular MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) FMISO-PET scan participant receive bevacizumab - Blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . FMISO-PET Scans : - The participant scan perform Charlestown , MA Martinos Center . The participant inject two separate intravenous ( IV ) injection ( list ) . Intravenous mean need inject vein participant 's arm . - FMISO PET scan contrast dye MRI scan - Drawing blood ass radioactivity FMISO - The PET scan take approximately 60-75 minute . The participant receive one injection FMISO . Following injection radiotracer , blood sample take second IV line . The tracer give vein ( IV ) travel participant 's blood collect organs tissue . The participant need wait nearby tracer absorb body . This take 90 minute . Then , participant lie narrow table slide large tunnel-shaped scanner . The PET pick signal tracer computer change signal 3D picture display monitor participant 's study doctor read . MRI Scan : - MRI scan last 60-75 minute . This occur time PET scan . The participant inject contrast dye twice MRI scan . The participant 3 MRI scan ( prior start treatment , day 1 treatment day 14 treatment ) would routinely perform participant participate study . - Blood sample collect scan order measure participant blood vessel process radiotracer FMISO well deliver tumor tissue . - The participant assess side effect via clinic visit phone call 24 hour visit . Planned Follow-up : The investigator would like call participant every 3 month three year 28 day visit see participant experience side effect . If participant remove study due unacceptable side effect , participant follow resolve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm glioblastoma evidence recurrence . Patients lowgrade tumor progress glioblastoma eligible . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Only patient neurooncologist plan give bevacizumab monotherapy eligible study Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use FMISO participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial . Life expectancy great 3 month . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . Patient must able undergo MRI PET scan . Patients must maintain stable corticosteroid regimen 5 day prior MRPET scan . The effect FMISO develop human fetus unknown . For reason radiopharmaceutical agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition temozolomide FMISO . Participants already receive antiVEGF experimental antiangiogenic therapy glioblastoma . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study FMISO radiopharmaceutical agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother radiopharmaceutical agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated radiopharmaceutical agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction FMISO . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients suitable undergo MRI use gadolinium contrast due : Claustrophobia Presence metallic object implant medical device body ( i.e . cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , tattoo near eye , steel implant ) Sickle cell disease Renal failure Reduced renal function , determine creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min base serum creatinine level obtain within 28 day prior registration</criteria>
