	<criteria>Nonreactive HIV test screen enrollment . Males 18 65 year old time signing informed consent . At risk acquire HIV , define least one casual sex partner past 24 month . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring time screen . If participate sexual activity female childbearing potential , men must agree use condom . Subjects sexual partner females child bear potential must also agree practice acceptable method contraception duration study , double barrier ( male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm ) female partner use hormonal contraception , intrauterine device ( IUD ) method publish data show low expected failure rate le 1 % per year . All subject participate study must counsel safe sexual practice include use effective barrier method minimize risk HIV transmission . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Willing undergo require study procedures One reactive HIV test result screen enrollment , even HIV infection confirm . Negative HIV Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) must also document screening . Assessed Investigator Record designee `` high risk '' HIV infection . This may include one follow : The negative partner HIV serodiscordant couple Men exchange sex good money Men engage unprotected receptive anal intercourse within past 6 month Men great 3 sexual partner within past 3 month Men sexually transmit disease within past 6 month Any behavior assess investigator `` high risk '' Coenrollment HIV interventional research study ( provide selfreport available documentation ) prior enrollment receipt active arm ( i.e. , NOT placebo ) HIV vaccine trial ( provide available documentation ) . Use antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy ( e.g. , Post exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) Pre exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) past 30 day , five halflives , twice duration biological effect apply treatment ( whichever longer ) prior study enrollment . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History drug alcohol consumption opinion Principal Investigator interfere study participation . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Any following laboratory value screen period . Positive Hepatitis C antibody result Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Hemoglobin le 11 gram ( g ) /deci liter ( dL ) Absolute neutrophil count le 750 cells/mm^3 Platelet count less equal 100,000/mm^3 Presence coagulopathy define INR great 1.5 PTT great 45sec Calculated creatinine clearance le 70 mL/minute use CockcroftGault equation A single repeat test allow Screening period verify result , exception HIV test . Subjects alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) bilirubin great equal to1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin great 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin le 35 % ) . History follow cardiac disease : myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , document hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , sustain ventricular tachycardia . The subject 's systolic blood pressure outside range 90160mmHg , diastolic blood pressure outside range 4590mmHg heart rate outside range 45100 beat per minute ( bpm ) . Exclusion criterion screen ( ECG ( single repeat allow eligibility determination ) Male Subjects : Heart rate ( A heart rate 100 110 bpm rechecked within 30 minute verify eligibility ) less 45 great 100 bpm . QRS durationgreater 120 msec . QTc interval ( B F ) great 450 msec . Evidence previous myocardial infarction ( include ST segment change associate repolarization ) . Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , AV block [ 2nd degree high ] , Wolf Parkinson White [ WPW ] syndrome ) . Sinus Pauses great 3 second . Any significant arrhythmia , opinion principal investigator medical monitor , interfere safety individual subject . Nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( great equal 3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) . Ongoing intravenous drug use episodic use use past 90 day exclusionary ( assessed study investigator ) . The subject tattoo dermatological condition overlie gluteus region may interfere interpretation ISRs . Use high dose aspirin anticoagulant antiplatelet medication would interfere ability receive intramuscular injection . Active skin disease disorder ( i.e. , infection , inflammation , dermatitis , eczema , drug rash , psoriasis , urticaria ) . Mild case localize acne folliculitis mild skin condition may exclusionary discretion Investigator Record Medical Monitor ) .</criteria>
