Alternative , non-pharmacological intervention , mirror therapy , gain increase recognition treatment phantom limb pain . In context , telerehabilitation play important role support long-term self-management autonomy patient . In developmental phase project , user-centred design apply . Patients well physical occupational therapist interview concern preference need respect design content telerehabilitation . Additionally , two focus group five participant conduct . Subsequently , prototype telerehabilitation develop base user preference , available evidence , expert opinion already exist system . This prototype test usability technical performance phase three use thinking-aloud-method data logging . Accordingly , multicenter , randomize control trial conduct evaluate cost-effectiveness telerehabilitation .</detailed_description>
