	<detailed_description>LCPUFAs essential fatty acid find cell body , particularly brain , retina nervous tissue . LCPUFAs find naturally seed , nut , fish human breast milk . The body also make LCPUFAs shorter-chain fatty acid precursor . The researcher study previously find LCPUFA supplementation infancy beneficial effect vision development early year life . However , researcher feel grow need good understand structural and/or functional change brain explain benefit . It also important understand change development still present later childhood .</detailed_description>
