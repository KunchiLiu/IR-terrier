	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Anagrelide Retard non-inferior anagrelide immediate release form treatment essential thrombocythemia . Essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) myeloproliferative neoplasm characterise sustained increase platelet count normal value ( &gt; 450 x 109/L ) increase megakaryopoiesis bone marrow , without secondary cause thrombocytosis . Anagrelide hydrochloride selectively reduce platelet number inhibit megakaryocyte development maturation human , without affect cell lineage . Anagrelide Retard new , prolonged release ( PR ) tablet formulation anagrelide develop AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG . The rationale develop new formulation base assumption well tolerability maintain efficacy comparable immediate release formulation . The effect Anagrelide Retard Thromboreductin® compare term mean platelet count measure central laboratory/centralized method 3 time point maintenance phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise , multicentre , double-blind , active control study compare efficacy safety two different anagrelide formulation patient high-risk essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) . 100 patient , either Anagrelide-treated Anagrelide-naïve , indication receive Thromboreductin® treatment , randomize one two investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) group ( Anagrelide Retard Thromboreductin® ) . Treatment allocation balance within stratum ( treated/naive ) age class central randomization . Naive patient start dose level 2 IMPs ( i.e. , 1 mg Thromboreductin® 2 mg Anagrelide Retard ) . Anagrelide-treated patient switch dose level close pre-study anagrelide dose study start . Dose modification titration phase do weekly basis ( maximum 12 week ) `` stable platelet count '' two consecutive visit achieve . The period study participation per patient follow : - Screening ( 7 day prior randomization ) , end randomization/first IMP dose ( Baseline Visit ) - Titration period ( weekly visit 12 week ) : achieve `` stable platelet count '' two consecutive measurement ( i.e . weekly visit ) - Maintenance period ( weekly visit 4 week ) : primary endpoint relevant period . The maintenance period patient start visit second successive platelet count ≤400 G/L ( &lt; 600 G/L , dose increase due intolerance maximal dose allow already reach ) second platelet value measure lie range within ± 30 % value measure previous visit . - End study ( EoS ) safety follow-up visit ( 28 day last maintenance visit/EoT early termination ) .</detailed_description>
