	<detailed_description>The purpose study Given significant illness burden associate somatic symptom related disorder , give mark reduction ED visit severity symptom follow form short-term treatment , urgent need directly examine patient attend initial consultation fail complete treatment . This population complex consider high risk . Currently , insufficient information know specific baseline characteristic , short- long-term outcome two sub-samples patient initiate complete treatment . Objectives - First , examine outcome patient receive Medical Care As Usual ( MCAU ) follow 8-week wait-list ISTDP versus MCAU plus ISTDP without wait order establish efficacy treatment somatic symptom disorder . - Second , identify specific patient variable predict outcome order identify characteristic patient less optimal outcome treatment failure . - Third , conduct preliminary examination process underlying symptom change ISTDP . - Finally , optional sub-study explore patient ' experience service provide MUS clinic , order uncover specific variable associate clinical benefit . Specific goal Through project , therefore , generate new knowledge directly translatable goal improve outcomes great percentage refer patient . This population complex consider high risk . There press need reach great number patient SSRD , order alleviate suffering reduce cost associate repeat health care use . METHOD Design Using randomize control trial design study examine efficacy ISTDP patient Somatic Symptom Related Disorders ( SSRD ) . Participants randomly allocate either MCAU plus ISTDP MCAU . The primary outcome measure somatic symptom severity score ( SOMS-7 SS ) 5 T1 ( 8 week ) . After 8-weeks MCAU condition participant crossover ISTDP necessary . Setting study sample Eligible participant new referral Capital District Health Authority Medically Unexplained Symptoms clinic emergency department physician assessment possible treatment unexplained somatic symptom . Referrals accept physician two local emergency ward ( Halifax Dartmouth ) . Participants adult outpatient , age 18-65 year , meeting study inclusion exclusion criterion . Psychiatric Diagnoses Psychiatric diagnose establish use SCID 5-RV13 administer trained research assistant . The assessment include administration SCID 5-RV overview evaluate medical , psychiatric personal history , also information demographic factor ( age , gender , marital status , education , professional occupation ) . Co-occurring therapy At time point participant ask self-report use concurrent treatment , intervention management strategy e.g. , pain medication , psychiatric medication ( antidepressant medication ) , consultation family physician , specialist clinic appointment . Change process measure Trained researcher review videotape recording ISTDP rate therapist patient behavior include follow scale : ( ) Achievement Therapeutic Objective Scale ( ATOS ) , measure degree patient achieve in-session treatment objective ( e.g. , Affective Experiencing ) ; ( b ) Comparative Psychotherapy Process Checklist ( CPPS ) , include two scale rating characteristic therapist ' intervention Psychodynamic-Interpersonal versus Cognitive-Behavioural treatment ; ( c ) ISTDP Process Scale , measure assess degree mobilization unconscious process , consistent ISTDP theory . Statistical Power In order detect average between-group effect size = .70 , significance level alpha = .05 two group participant , total sample 68 participant require achieve 80 % power . Assuming loss follow-up rate 15 % , expect need recruit 78 participant achieve goal . Analysis The primary analysis population intention-to-treat ( ITT ) sample . Secondary analysis calculate observed-cases sample , consist patient complete observe data available . Sub-analyses examine three definition ISTDP treatment : Completed 20 session deliver termination treatment occur mutual consensus base symptom remission and/or agreement adequate treatment dose deliver ; Partial Treatment 2 session attend ; Trial attend . For analysis , miss data replace multiple imputation approach possible . Initially group difference examine use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) ass efficacy ( SOMS-SSI ) 8-week post allocation . Clinically significant change somatic symptom examine first calculate Reliable Change Index ( RCI ) ass psychometrically reliable change patient level . Next , post treatment test score examine determine whether fall clinical cut-off , within 2 SD normative mean . Patients meet criterion consider achieve clinically significant change . Finally , overall effectiveness ISTDP examine use whole treat sample two time point ; final treatment session 6-month post treatment . Separate analysis include number treatment session covariate outcome . Process analyse A series regression analysis conduct examine change putative moderator mediator variable predict group ( ISTDP v. MCAU ) treatment efficacy ( SOMS-SSI ) . Hypothesized process change somatic symptom severity across ISTDP session examine use parallel process latent growth curve model .</detailed_description>
