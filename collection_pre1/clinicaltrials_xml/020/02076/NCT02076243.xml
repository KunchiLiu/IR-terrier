	<brief_summary>This investigator initiate phase II study ass efficacy chemotherapy call nab-paclitaxel first line cytotoxic chemotherapy subject unresectable locally advanced metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . All subject receive treatment vein weekly receive dose treatment . The risk develop cutaneous SCC approximately 10 % lifetime . The vast majority treat surgically recur . However small percentage become unresectable time metastasize distantly body . Unresectable metastatic cutaneous SCC poor prognosis oncologist often choose whole body therapy without benefit prospective efficacy data . Very little prospective investigation efficacy specific chemotherapy regimens function line therapy perform patient population . Nab-paclitaxel type chemotherapy demonstrate activity type cancer lung head neck cancer . The primary objective study determine response rate ( percentage subject tumor shrinkage ) nab-paclitaxel treatment subject cutaneous SCC receive cytotoxic chemotherapy unresectable metastatic settings.. Secondary objectives progression free survival ( time tumor start grow ) , safety , assessment percentage subject whose tumor express protein call SPARC , correlate expression SPARC response treatment . To determine tumor express SPARC part prior standard biopsy perform establish diagnosis SCC use . SPARC protein overexpressed range different cancer type may alter environment around tumor possibly way may make SCC responsive treatment nab-paclitaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Nab-paclitaxel Cutaneous SCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-melanoma skin cancer represent common type cancer United States cutaneous SCC comprise 20 % malignancy . The risk develop cutaneous SCC approximately 10 % lifetime . This risk increase age varies accord latitude one live . The incidence rate United States increase result multiple factor include altered sun exposure pattern population age . Early detection critical vast majority cure definitive localized therapy overall 5-year cure rate great 90 % . Although vast majority cutaneous SCCs treat surgically curative intent estimate case fatality rate range 1-5 % depend report study . If regional lymph node involve standard treatment approach lymphadenectomy follow consideration adjuvant therapy ( radiation +/- chemotherapy ) . However subset patient ultimately develop unresectable distantly metastatic recurrence . Unresectable SCC treat use systemic approach usually encompass cytotoxic chemotherapy . However clinical investigation determine efficacy specific agent limited study rigorous fashion . Efficacy data stem largely case report limit case series small number phase II trial . As targeted therapy , treatment cetuximab demonstrate limited activity ( RR 11 % ) 36 patient phase II trial . Many oncologist tend treat platinum agent , taxanes 5-FU base regimen . However standard exists . As need explore systematically efficacy specific chemotherapeutic agent goal develop standard treatment approach . Nab-paclitaxel intriguing option use treatment give demonstrate efficacy malignancy SCC histology . In clinical practice many oncologist use paclitaxel despite lack rigorous clinical investigation . The use paclitaxel limited toxicity associate solvent Cermaphor EL . Nab-paclitaxel albumin bound form paclitaxel . In malignancy breast cancer nab-paclitaxel associate improved response rate time progression relative paclitaxel . Nab-paclitaxel base chemotherapy demonstrate efficacy malignancy SCC histology include head neck carcinoma NSCLC . SPARC ( secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ) , also know osteonectin BM-40 , 43kD secrete extracellular matrix glycoprotein first identified 1984 note high bind affinity albumin . SPARC affect angiogenesis interact growth factor VEGF basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . It bind platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) inhibit bind receptor . SPARC interact bFGF inhibits migration endothelial cell . Overexpression SPARC find many tumor type include breast , melanoma , brain , colon , skin several others associate increased tumor invasion metastasis . For example , melanoma SPARC expression clinically correlate aggressiveness metastatic phenotype . In melanoma model SPARC associate decreased E-cadherin increase N-cadherin expression , suggest may regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition earlier stage malignant transformation . SPARC expression also associate increase breast cancer cell invasiveness . The absence SPARC show suppress development UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma mouse model . Another tumor promote mechanism SPARC interaction inflammation . There evidence SPARC may play role dampen immune response tumor cell . Melanoma cell lack SPARC expression induce neutrophil recruitment , increase chemotactic factor IL-8 , GRO , leukotrienes result tumor cell rejection . This observation decrease neutrophil recruitment presence SPARC also note model include SPARC null versus wild type mouse . SPARC may regulate apoptotic pathway neutrophil involve Fas ligand . SPARC able affect tumor progression several level . It play role epithelial-mesenchymal transformation . It promote tumor growth metastasis inhibit immune surveillance promote angiogenesis correlate metastatic cell aggressiveness . The overexpression SPARC many tumor tumor microenvironment high binding affinity albumin make albumin-bound drug delivery attractive . Via gp60 caveolae-mediated albumin transport pathway albumin transport blood vessel tumor . Albumin-bound paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel ) approve FDA January 2005 treatment metastatic breast cancer . Nab-paclitaxel take advantage transport carry paclitaxel tumor cell . There may preferentially retain tissue overexpressing SPARC . SPARC show overexpressed squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( 61 % , versus 0 % normal head neck tissue ) . The use intra-arterial nab-paclitaxel examine locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck response rate 75-78 % . A retrospective analysis show SPARC upregulation tumor tissue associate increase response 16 patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck receive intra-arterial nab-paclitaxel . This single arm phase II study assess efficacy treatment nab-paclitaxel ( abraxane ) administer weekly ( day 1,8 , 15 28 day cycle ) patient unresectable locoregional distantly metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . A Simon 2 stage design use . If response see first 12 patient conclude response rate great 3 % trial stop futility end stage one . Otherwise trial enroll 9 patient total 21 . In summary , development unresectable locally advance distantly metastatic cutaneous SCC confers poor prognosis . While various type systemic therapy use oncologist choice base anecdotal experience limit number case series small phase II study . Nab-paclitaxel demonstrate significant anti-tumor activity several malignancy SCC morphology . Taxanes often use systemic treatment unresectable cutaneous SCC . This study allow prospective evaluation activity abraxane first line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy ( defined line cytotoxic therapy ) treatment advance SCC . The hypothesis phase II study abraxane demonstrate significant anti-tumor activity define primary endpoint best overall response rate . It hypothesize increase SPARC expression correlate response nab-paclitaxel treatment serve biomarker treatment response .</detailed_description>
