	<brief_summary>Pediatric cancer patient ask take part study cancer treat high dos drug methotrexate ( MTX ) . In addition , patient either significant side effect methotrexate past doctor think high risk side effect receive methotrexate . Methotrexate cancer-fighting drug important treatment leukemia . In study , investigator test new method give high dose methotrexate cancer patient may reduce chance level methotrexate blood high . When level high think lead increase side effect . Side effect unintended unwanted result treatment . The initial ordered amount methotrexate period methotrexate give change current standard care ( mean usually do doctor , would likely do patient study ) . This study test new method monitoring potentially adjust final amount methotrexate patient end receive base level methotrexate blood first 24 hour order try prevent side effect patient previous history side effect methotrexate high risk side effect . On study investigator check methotrexate level blood 2 hour patient start receive drug investigator lower dose methotrexate need . Investigators thing 6-8 hour later . Investigators also collect optional blood sample patient investigator want study genetic ( DNA ) difference involve body process methotrexate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study participant receive drug methotrexate patient hospital . High dose methotrexate give 24-hour infusion part care determine necessary doctor . Infusion mean drug give use needle tubing insert vein ( also call IV ) . The standard care patient receive high dose methotrexate give entire dose methotrexate , without adjustment , check concentration methotrexate blood end infusion . Most patient level methotrexate blood good treat cancer keep side effect minimum . However , patient level methotrexate end 24-hour infusion high think lead increase side effect . In study , investigator test method give methotrexate may reduce chance level methotrexate blood end infusion high . This do checking methotrexate level blood two time 24-hour infusion reduce dose methotrexate give level think correct range ( level high ) . Reducing dose may result patient receive low total dose methotrexate initially order . However , may also result preferred concentration methotrexate blood end infusion . It possible past patient 's doctor may choose reduce amount methotrexate give patient side effect . In study , patient start receive standard dose methotrexate . Therefore , participate study , amount methotrexate order start infusion may higher patient receive previously . Before patient receives high dose methotrexate , patient receive IV fluid . In order minimize side effect , methotrexate level also closely monitored infusion patient receive supportive medicine need . The patient receive drug Leucovorin ( administer mouth every 6 hour minimum 3 dos ) . The monitoring supportive care patient receive end methotrexate infusion , amount IV fluid , dose duration Leucovorin receive do base standard guideline part study . After receive 24-hour high dose methotrexate , individualize monitoring plan end management patient 's methotrexate level continue accord standard guideline . High dose methotrexate may give patient multiple time discretion doctor . While study , patient receive methotrexate use method study ( however , blood drawn one time optional DNA testing ) . The patient , his/her parent , doctor may decide withdraw patient study time think patient 's best interest continue receive methotrexate manner investigate study . STUDY RELATED TESTS AND PROCEDURES At study entry , follow occur : - The patient physical exam - Collection blood sample routine blood test research blood test . Approximately 1-2 teaspoon blood take research blood test . - Review patient 's medical medication history collect information . During treatment treatment follow occur : - Collection blood sample routine blood test research blood test . Approximately ½ teaspoon blood take times 2 , 6 ( 8 ) , 24 , 36 , 42 , 48 hour . The blood collect 2 6 ( 8 ) hour research blood test . - Review patient 's medical medication history collect information . The research blood test do see much methotrexate body , body handle drug , DNA study . The DNA test look small change call Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNP ) . These small change sometimes explain different people different reaction drug . The total amount blood draw research study approximately 3 teaspoon .</detailed_description>
