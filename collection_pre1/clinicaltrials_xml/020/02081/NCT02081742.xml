	<brief_summary>Summary Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) represent second lead cause cancer death Spain ( 11,000 death per year ) . Screening population 50 year age significant history ( intermediate risk ) recommend , screen method best promote adherence type patient well establish . There currently two screen method less invasive conventional colonoscopy seem high sensitivity test faecal occult blood ( FOBT ) . These two method colon capsule , consist ingest capsule take photographs colon , virtual colonoscopy , radiological technique . Objectives : 1 . To demonstrate virtual colonoscopy colon capsule effective CRC screen technique intermediate risk population , diagnostic rate comparable conventional colonoscopy ( concordance ) . 2 . To compare diagnostic rate colon capsule virtual colonoscopy respect size characteristic lesion visualise . 3 . To compare participation rate screen strategy identify factor influence participation ( individual , family , socioeconomic factor well relate doctor ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Colon Capsule Virtual Colonoscopy ( VICOCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based fact CRC important healthcare issue enough evidence show disease , diagnose early , curable reasonable cost , European Community Council , 2003 , issue directive member state would make population screen CRC priority healthcare planning . Thus , Spain 's Ministry Health Consumer Affairs include population screen CRC National Healthcare Plan priority action within Comprehensive Plan Cancer ( PICA ) , require implement year 2007 . The screening tool currently ideal either , like test faecal occult blood ( FOBT ) , evaluated date , sensitive enough , like conventional colonoscopy , risk-free . All mean population adherence limit . In study , wish compare two new diagnostic technique CRC ( colon capsule virtual colonoscopy ) , although recently introduce healthcare system , sufficient scientific evidence confirm effective possibly cost-effective technique . The population concern study healthy populationâ€”men woman 50-69 year age significant history . Therefore , screen method offer must least invasive comfortable method possible good compliance achieve . This mean technique painless essentially harmless comparison conventional colonoscopy . If observe high concordance technique conventional colonoscopy term detect lesion , would use latter strictly therapeutic reason population , thereby significantly reduce complication associate . Objectives Main objective : 1 . To demonstrate virtual colonoscopy colon capsule effective CRC screen technique intermediate risk population , adenoma diagnostic rate comparable conventional colonoscopy . 2 . To compare diagnostic capability colon capsule virtual colonoscopy conventional colonoscopy respect size characteristic lesion ( especially lesion flat small 6 mm ) . 3 . To analyse population 's participation rate screen strategy identify factor influence participation ( individual , family , socioeconomic factor well relate doctor diagnostic procedure ) . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate rate minor major complication screen strategy . 2 . To analyse rate false positives false negative colon capsule virtual colonoscopy comparison conventional colonoscopy . Methodology Type study Randomised , control study . Study subject Inclusion Criteria : The main objective study compare two non-invasive technique study colorectal cancer . When calculate sample size observe need 1000 patient per group . In moment study expensive feasible . Our proposal include population high prevalence lesion : individual positive FIT ( fecal immunochemical test ) prevalence lesion 60 % . In case , sample size reduce considerably . The eligible population men woman , 50-69 year old , know risk factor positive FIT . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Individuals symptom suggestive colorectal disease ( rectorrhagia , change bowel movement frequency , constitutional syndrome , anaemia ) . 2 . History inflammatory bowel disease , colorectal polyposis , colorectal adenoma CRC , total partial colectomy . 3 . History familial adenomatous polyposis hereditary polyposis syndrome ; hereditary colorectal cancer associate polyposis ( diagnose presence germinal mutation DNA repair gene and/or fulfilment Amsterdam II criterion ) ; 4 . Severe co-morbidity carry poor short-term prognosis ( disease average life expectancy le 5 year ) chronic illness involves significant limitation physical activity . 5 . Contraindication undergo colon capsule virtual colonoscopy . Study group randomisation : All patient recruit meet inclusion criterion randomise two study group : Group I : Screening via virtual colonoscopy subsequent conventional colonoscopy ( within 1 week ) . In group patient , performance conventional colonoscopy delay ensure bowel preparation comparable two study group . Group II : Screening colon capsule subsequent conventional colonoscopy ( within hour , since patient already complete bowel preparation first screen test ) . When conventional colonoscopy do , pertinent therapeutic procedure perform , necessary . Subsequently , two group patient follow visit hospital instruct approach follow time . Sample size When calculate sample size observe need 1000 patient per group . In moment study expensive feasible . Our proposal include population high prevalence lesion : individual positive FIT ( fecal immunochemical test ) prevalence lesion 60 % . In case , sample size reduce considerably . Adenomas detection rate ( ADR ) patient positive FIT colonoscopy ( gold standard ) 60 % ( NEJM 2012 ) . We assume colon capsule detect number lesion gold standard , difference 15 % virtual colonoscopy clinically significant . We need 187 patient per group , significance level 5 % statistical power 80 % . The calculation perform use Study Size Granmo program .</detailed_description>
