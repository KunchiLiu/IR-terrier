	<brief_summary>This study prospective Phase IV study determine use Everolimus result low liver tumor recurrence improve patient graft survival liver transplant hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The immunosuppressive comparators Everolimus Tacrolimus therapy compare Tacrolimus Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil . Primary outcomes data disease free survival ( time randomization HCC recurrence death ) . Secondary outcome rate recurrence Hepatitis C , problem relate wound healing , hernia repair within first 12 month , hepatic arterial thrombosis , renal function , acute cellular rejection , post-transplant diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population consist approximately 336 patient ( 224 Everolimus Tacrolimus 112 Tacrolimus Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil ) . Initial screen criterion includethe presence hepatocellular carcinoma explant determ patient 18 year old candidate receive primary orthotopic liver transplant ( deceased living donor ) . Within 7 - 12 day post-transplant , patient re-evaluated eligibility randomization . The criterion include : pre-transplant imaging show HCC disease exceed Milan criterion ; pathology review tumor burden and/or presence microvascular invasion ; AFP &gt; 200IU/mL ; pre-transplant ablation resection HCC recurrence ; progression new tumor ; evaluation rule hepatic vessel complication . Subjects remain study treatment Month 12 time subject investigator determine prefer immunosuppressive regimen . Subjects follow additional 24 month outcome data described .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening Have diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) high risk HCC recurrence Able provide write informed consent Male female patient race , 18 year old De novo recipient primary orthotopic liver transplant decease live donor Patients willing comply study requirement Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree use effective method ( ) contraception treatment post treatment followup period Screening Past present malignancy within last 5 year . Severe infection consider local site investigator unsafe study participation . Use investigational drug time screen within last 30 day . Patients schedule combined transplant ( liverkidney ) , previous solid organ , bone marrow , autologous islet cell transplant . Recipients donor/recipient ABO incompatible graft . Recipients organs human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) HBsAg positive donor . Macrovascular tumor invasion . Proteinuria great 2 gram . Conditions result impaired absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion study treatment . Patients noninfectious pneumonitis . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) laboratory test . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) practice effective method ( ) contraception . Patients receive sirolimus ( RapamuneÂ® ) part transplant immunosuppression regimen Randomization Screening Inclusion Criteria : For patient history hepatic vessel thrombosis , occlusion , stent placement , major revision liver vessel , must Doppler ultrasound prior randomization rule hepatic vessel complication , include hepatic arterial thrombosis ( HAT ) . Randomization Patients receive sirolimus ( Rapamune ) time prior randomization withdrawn study . Patients develop clinically significant systemic infection require active use IV antibiotic time prior randomization . Wound heal problem , per Investigator 's assessment , would make patient ineligible study randomization Confirmed presence thrombosis major hepatic artery ( ) , major hepatic vein ( ) , portal vein inferior vena cava via Doppler ultrasound image obtain prior randomization . Proteinuria great 2 gram Consideration investigator , reason , subject unsuitable candidate receive everolimus randomize study .</criteria>
