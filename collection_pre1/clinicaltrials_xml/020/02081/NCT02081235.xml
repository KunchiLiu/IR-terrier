Previous study report incidence AKI patient undergo surgery congenital heart disease high 42 % AKI increase patient mortality , intensive care unit stay hospital stay . Previous study report several risk factor AKI congenital heart surgery , however , perioperative variable include anesthesia-related factor evaluate fully . In addition , neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , report marker systemic inflammation associate prognosis cardiac cancer patient might able predict development postoperative AKI . Therefore , investigator attempt assess independent risk factor regard perioperative variable include transfusion-related parameter , preoperative anemia , preoperative hypoalbuminemia , pulmonary hypertension , use nitric oxide , use hydroxyethyl starch , perioperative medication , hemodynamic variable perioperative NLR .</detailed_description>
