	<detailed_description>Materials Methods : Patient Selection : Patients undergo IVF cycle Cleveland Clinic Reproductive Endocrinology Infertility clinic plan transfer embryo ( ) offer opportunity participate study . We would like total enrollment 300 patient 150 group . The patient exclude undergoing pre-implantation genetic test and/or chromosome screening . Study Design This prospective randomized control trial patient agree participate randomize embryo selection transfer base solely conventional criterion alternatively conventional criterion conjunction morphokinetic criterion . Enrollment : Patients enrol Beachwood IVF center REI physicians time IVF consultation . They sign inform consent study time sign consent IVF treatment , do IVF nurse . Informed consent study keep patient chart Beachwood IVF center along IVF consent . Randomization : Patients randomize 1:1 Conventional embryo selection vs. Embryoscope selection use computer generate random number sequence . Group assignment write piece paper place consecutively numbered opaque envelope research personnel involve embryo selection . Each patient randomize assign next consecutive number embryo selection criterion reveal time oocyte retrieval . Patients , REI physicians staff , sonographers blind embryos select . Only embryologist lab staff aware group patient randomize . This ensure place group computerize medical record clinical chart , laboratory chart research database . Sample Size Justification Little publish data available time-lapse imaging human embryo selection transfer . No publication randomize controlled trial available EmbryoScope . Statistician Benjamin Nutter consult sample size estimation . Initially , base 2012 outcomes pregnancy rate 49 % . For power 80 % , order detect increase 55 % pregnancy rate new selection guideline , would need randomize 1088 patient . To see increase 60 % pregnancy rate , would need randomize 320 patient . In study , focus patient blastocyst available transfer since blastocyst embryos need assistance selection . The pregnancy rate subset patient currently 70 % detect increase 80 % would require randomization 231 patient . Based number feel reasonable start goal 300 patient study patient make retrieval , fertilization embryo progress transfer . Starting goal 300 patient hopefully give u large enough sample preliminary analysis embryo result clinically evident pregnancy define positive fetal heart rate . Given outcome study pregnancy rate ass data collect six month evaluate clear difference group . If significant difference time , study may terminate allow patient benefit superior method . Research Procedure The basic IVF laboratory protocol utilized use patient . Oocytes recover transvaginal aspiration follicle ultrasound guidance . Oocytes inseminate intracytoplasmic sperm injection co-incubation sperm . The next morning , normally fertilize oocyte identify move individual well slide chamber place EmbryoScope . Those randomized classic evaluation embryo grade base conventional daily evaluation specify daily time point . These criterion encompass timely development specific benchmark 20 , 26 , 44 , 68 , 92 , 116 140 hour post-insemination . The image EmbryoScope , static time span across time range . Embryos grade select transfer accord laboratory 's conventional criterion . Those randomized classic evaluation plus morphokinetic parameter embryo evaluation perform defined interval use data analysis software capture time-lapse image include time mitotic interval , cleavage plane , time compaction cavitation embryo lead blastocyst formation . Patients elect participate study would still embryos cultured EmbryoScope conventional embryo selection criterion would apply identify embryos fro transfer .</detailed_description>
