	<brief_title>A Study DOXIL/CAELYX Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Malignancies Including Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single dose , 2-cycle , crossover ( method use switch participant one treatment arm another clinical study ) , bioequivalence ( biological equivalence two formulation study medication ) study DOXIL/CAELYX participant advance refractory solid malignancy ( include least 24 participant ovarian cancer ) . This study adaptive 2-stage design . Bioequivalence base encapsulate doxorubicin test end Stage 1 use data least 24 participant ovarian cancer . An interim analysis free doxorubicin perform end Stage 1 use data 42 participant cancer type . The study may continue Stage 2 additional participant cancer type ; final evaluation bioequivalence free doxorubicin perform end Stage 2 . The study include screen phase ( within 28 day first study medication administration ) follow treatment phase consist 2 doxorubicin treatment cycle ( 28 day ) end-of-treatment visit Day 58 . Participants may enter optional extension phase 2 cycle . Safety evaluate assessment adverse event , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory testing , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( measurement percentage blood leave heart time contract ) throughout study . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis obtain participant specify time 29 day start study drug administration Cycles 1 2 determination plasma concentration encapsulate free doxorubicin .</detailed_description>
