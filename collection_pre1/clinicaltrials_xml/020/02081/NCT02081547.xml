	<brief_summary>Risk local recurrence rectal surgery nationally 8 % curative surgery 5 % . Local recurrence rate curative surgery vary 3-7 % variety region country . It well known surgical technique total mesorectal excision ( TME ) lead improved prognosis rectal cancer surgery . TME surgery difficult perform different factor affect quality TME preparation . Injuries mesorectal fascia report 20 % patient underwent TME surgery surgeon agree may important recurrence . However , unclear extent damage mesorectal fascia relate worsen prognosis patient rectal cancer . Adjuvant oncological treatment form chemotherapy surgery , offer patient unfavorable tumor base pathological examination . Patients favorable tumor ( less advance ) offer chemotherapy , even surgical technique optimal , ie . damage mesorectal fascia , evidence lacking . The presence intraperitoneal cancer cell ( IPC ) relate histopathological tumor stage colorectal cancer . Incidence IPC intraperitoneal tumor ( rectal cancer patient tumor peritoneal reflection ) unclear . Assessment IPC status cytology immunohistochemistry technically easy could TME surgery identify patient increase risk tumor recurrence . In positive IPC status , patient would possibly benefit either postoperative radiotherapy patient receive preoperative therapy , postoperative oncological chemotherapy . Tumour cell may lysed sterile water , surgeon rinse abdominal cavity bowel distally tumour . Neither rinse abdomen rectum colorectal cancer routinely occur clinical benefit establish . The value rinse abdomen TME-surgery could also study IPC status . The study hypothesis IPC status dependent surgical quality specimen TME-surgery rectal cancer patient , presence lead increase risk local recurrence .</brief_summary>
