	<detailed_description>The study consist screen period approximately 1 week , wash period 3 week , exist phosphate lower medication withheld , 4-week treatment period follow-up period 2 week , patient put back pre washout phosphate lower medication . The wash period either 1 week , 2 week 3 week depend increase s-phosphate level . There 7 parallel treatment arm study bid od treatment regimen . Laboratory efficacy endpoint safety assessment evaluate various time throughout study . The target population study : male female patient , above18 year age End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) chronic maintenance hemodialysis ( HD ) 3 time week minimum 3 month .</detailed_description>
