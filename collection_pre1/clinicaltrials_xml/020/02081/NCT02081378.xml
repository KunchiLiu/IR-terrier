	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Oral ABL001 Patients With CML Ph+ ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-human trial ABL001 dose escalation study whose primary purpose estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend dose expansion ( RDE ) single agent ABL001 CML Ph+ ALL patient , combination either Nilotinib Imatinib Dasatinib Ph positive CML patient . The safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile ABL001 ABL001+Nilotinib , ABL001+Imatinib ABL001+Dasatinib assess together evaluation pharmacodynamic ( PD ) change peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) bone marrow aspirate data may contribute assessment RDE . An understanding MTD/RDE , safety profile , PK/PD relationship , preliminary evidence anti-CML ALL activity use inform future development adult CML Ph+ ALL . By virtue distinct pharmacological profile preclinical pharmacological study demonstrate additive effect , combination ABL001 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) potential achieve deep molecular response high proportion CML patient compare single agent TKI therapy . Such combination add advantage target ABL kinase domain two distinct location , theoretically prevent single point mutation-associated treatment resistance . The prediction nilotinib+ABL001 , imatinib+ABL001 and/or dasatinib+ABL001 combination increase percentage patient achieve complete molecular response ( CMR ) decrease time CMR , thereby increase possibility achieve sustain treatment-free remission patient . In addition , patient may intolerant therapy TKIs may develop mutation promote resistance TKI therapy . In patient , ABL001 may provide novel therapeutic option .</detailed_description>
