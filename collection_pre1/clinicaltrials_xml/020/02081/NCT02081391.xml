	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Tapentadol Treatment Post-operative Acute Pain Requiring Opioid Treatment Pediatric Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , multi-site , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo compare study medication test whether study medication real effect clinical study ) , parallel group ( group participant treat time ) , multiple oral dose study . This study consist enrollment phase ( 28 day ) , treatment evaluation phase ( 4 day ) , follow-up phase ( 10 14 day first dose IMP ) . A dose regimen 1.25 mg/kg use first 24 hour treatment study child age 6 month le 18 year old . After 24 hour start study medication , base clinical judgment , dose may either continue 1.25 mg/kg may decrease 1.0 mg/kg . A decision maintain alter dose depend effectiveness analgesia ( pain killer ) adverse event profile observe child first 24 hour dose period . The dos participant age less 6 month old define base forthcoming pharmacokinetic ( body medication ) data . The supplemental opioid medication reflect standard care available patient nurse control intravenous morphine hydromorphone . This supplemental opioid medication give control pain , need , treatment placebo group . In exceptional case , participant unbearable pain despite use NCA/PCA , additional bolus ( defined clinician bolus ) morphine hydromorphone may administer . The clinician bolus give either use NCA/PCA pump system intravenous bolus injection . The opioid give clinician bolus NCA/PCA intravenous line fail must use NCA/PCA pump system . Dosing Investigational Medicinal Product stop : - A switch exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication indicate accord local standard care . - Opioid analgesic medication longer need . - Investigational Medicinal Product administer 72 hour . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , vital sign , laboratory parameter , electrocardiogram , specific scale ass suicidal ideation . The maximum study duration participant 42 day .</detailed_description>
