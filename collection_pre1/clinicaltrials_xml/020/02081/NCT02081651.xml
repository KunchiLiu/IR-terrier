	<brief_summary>Cow 's milk allergy common food allergy child . The scenery clinical epidemiological cow 's milk allergy significantly change last decade . The severity clinical manifestation still rise , cow 's milk allergy become leading cause hospitalization food -induced anaphylaxis country . In addition , overall prevalence cow 's milk allergy increase gradual reduction ability acquire immunological tolerance cow 's milk protein first year life . These mutation dictate need identify strategy stimulate acquisition immunological tolerance child affect cow 's milk allergy . The mechanism acquire immunological tolerance yet fully define . The current view suggest existence dynamic mechanism , consist various cellular compartment , set crucial environmental factor arise mainly diet effect intestinal microbiota . These acquisition contribute definition new concept field human nutrition : immunonutrition . The immunonutrition ability , intake specific nutrient immune system interfere directly indirectly modulation composition function intestinal microbiota . The proponent group recently show possible stimulate rapid acquisition immunological tolerance child affect CMA administration extensively hydrolyse casein contain probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) ( Berni Canani et al . J Pediatr 2013 ) . Several line evidence suggest effect induce combination direct immunomodulatory action exert small peptide derive beta - casein action lactobacillus GG . It 's well know Lactobacillus GG able adjust composition function microbiota child CMA directly adjust immunological mechanism involve pathogenesis condition . At time group demonstrate possibility high percentage patient IgE-mediated CMA able tolerate food contain hydrolyze cow 's milk proteins different process . It also speculate strategy facilitate acquisition immune tolerance patient cow 's milk allergy . One food Parmigiano -Reggiano cheese , characterize ' extensive hydrolysis proteins cow 's milk , degrade casein present generate large amount peptide free amino acid presence appreciable quantity Lactobacillus GG sample mature high . In recent study show 58 % patient suffer IgE-mediated CMA able tolerate daily intake normal amount food , especially absence sensibilization IgE specific beta lactoglobulin . These new finding allow u hypothesize use Parmigiano REggiano cheese possible strategy immunonutrition stimulate acquisition immune tolerance patient CMA .</brief_summary>
