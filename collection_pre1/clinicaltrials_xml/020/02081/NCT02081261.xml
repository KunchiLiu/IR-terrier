	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) cardiac surgery major complication cardiac surgery report associated adverse outcome . There many study report risk factor acute kidney injury cardiac surgery , influence perioperative variable relate anesthesia perioperative medication evaluate fully . The investigator attempt evaluate influence preoperative medication , preoperative albumin level , uric acid concentration , NL ratio , anesthesia technique , use hydroxyethyl starch , blood glucose level , intraoperative medication , perioperative cardiac function ( systolic diastolic ) hemodynamic variable surgery incidence acute kidney injury coronary artery bypass graft . Preoperative postoperative diastolic dysfunction may associate postoperative AKI . In addition , preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) report marked systemic inflammation associate prognosis cardiac patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft percutaneous coronary intervention . This preoperative immediate postoperative NLR might able predict AKI coronary artery bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
