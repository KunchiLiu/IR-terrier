	<detailed_description>Objectives : To investigate influence sensorimotor treatment balance , agility functionality soccer player assess use force platform , functional test questionnaire . Methods : This study characterize randomized clinical trial . 20 male soccer player assess mean questionnaire , force platform one foot , functional test balance agility ( Side Hop Test , Figure Eight Hop Star Excursion Balance Test Test ) . To platform , parameter center pressure ( COP ) anterior- posterior medial -lateral direction use analysis , functional test time-second performance analyze . Initially athletes respond questionnaire , evaluate force platform functional testing blind evaluator . Following , randomize treatment group ( n=10 ) control ( n=10 ) . The treatment group perform 6 week proprioceptive exercise shift one-leg jump bipedal support . The control group remain soccer training . At end treatment protocol reassess follow cross-over , control group perform treatment sensory motor develop .</detailed_description>
