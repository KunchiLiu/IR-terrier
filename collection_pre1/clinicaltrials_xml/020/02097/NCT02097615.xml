	<brief_summary>At present research generate controversy regard utility antiseptic wind management diabetic foot ulcer syndrome . However , study do tissue animal model . This study involve best presently antiseptic residual effect low toxicity approach eliminate microorganisms promoter formation biofilm , contribute treatment accelerated closure diabetic foot ulcer syndrome . So necessary determine irrigation ulcer diabetic foot syndrome chlorhexidine 0.125 % aqueous solution determines decrease surface great extent standard treatment use irrigation sterile deionized water .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetic Foot Ulcer . Effectiveness Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.125 % Compared With Sterile Deionized Water</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study make perform Hospital General Leon . Population : People Diabetes Mellitus state Guanajuato . Universe : People diabetes mellitus diabetic foot syndrome Guanajuato state . sample : Will evaluate patient diabetes mellitus present loss continuity skin low limb come clinic wound´s León General Hospital . This clinic provide service patient state Guanajuato diabetic foot syndrome , include within multidisciplinary management program . Calculation Sample : 72 patient ; eight lose estimate , 40 patient group require 80 % chance detecting , significance level 5 % , increase primary outcome measure 5 % control group 6 % group experimental . Alpha : 5 % Power : 80 % Inclusion Criteria : Indistinct gender Patients 18 year Diabetes Mellitus submit ulcer diabetic foot syndrome involve tendon , capsule bone . With proper state vascular perfusion . Exclusion Criteria : Ulcers patient interdigital difficult measure affect surface area . Patients locate follow-up wish stop participating study . Methodology : Will invite participate study patient diabetes mellitus consecutive present ulcer plantar IA IB grade classification system ulcer , University Texas , area Clinical wound´s Hospital General Leon Abril November 2014 . After explain study information check understandable , provide sheet sign informed consent . Subsequently select patient give vascular ultrasound measure ankle brachial index determine absence vascular compromise . They carry medical history emphasis analyze clinical data , include characteristic ulcer ( type exudate , measure surface area affect , type tissue involve ulcer depth ) biochemical parameter . Be weigh measure first visit biochemical data request collect information subsequent follow-up visit . They treat principle standard treatment , follow criterion : - Remove ulcer exudate spray one two ingredient make mechanical drive 5 minute , completely negative visual evidence exudate . - Completely remove hyperkeratosis devitalize tissue periphery ulcer cut material dissection sterile dress drag , visually eliminate exudate . - The treated area dry sore - Two photograph distance 20 cm perpendicular ulcer take , cover 1 square centimeter reference measure area affect diabetic foot ulcer syndrome . - The solution blind ulcer cover sterile dress apply 24 hour . - The patient instruct continue treatment every 24 hour follow : - Sterile dress remove continuously irrigate 5 second ingredient assign . - Undiscovered 24 hour , next day irrigation dress area place . Also need avoid contact surface affect area next assessment . - Perform strategy 24 hour , day 7 go wound clinic clinical evaluation . - Every 7 day complete 6 view , clinical evaluation perform , irrigation select ingredient take 2 picture distance 20 cm perpendicular boil , cover reference 1 square centimeter measure area affect diabetic foot ulcer syndrome . - Every 7 day initiation therapy clinic consultation wound measure circulation comment follow : - Ulcer area square millimeter . - Coloring ulcer . - Type exudate ; turbid serous . - Type tissue involve ulcer depth . If patient increase intensity sign symptom diabetic foot syndrome , classify major step scale ulcer Classification System University Texas , perform analysis comprehensive treatment redefine accord suggestion ulcer classification system University Texas . Material clean ulcer : Ingredient 1 : Preparation spray application chlorhexidine gluconate 0.125 % . Ingredient 2 : Preparation spray application sterile deionized water . Method application ingredient describe previously . Method randomization : effect assign random number balance computer , code assign ingredient identical presentation , balance sample size . The code know patient , observer analyst . Only known one advisor . Statistical method : The description data , case non-numerical variable perform report proportion confidence interval 95 % ( 95 % ) case numerical variable , description make base average standard deviation median Q1- Q3 range , depend result Kolmogorov-Smirnov test evaluate Gaussian distribution data . Comparison numerical variable perform Chi square test . Comparison rate reduction size ulcer diabetic foot syndrome treatment base test independent sample Kruskal- Wallis test , depend data distribution . In case consider significance level alpha value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
