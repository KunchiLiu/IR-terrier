Our hypothesis adherence would improve intervention group patient would well understand disease manage . METHODS Study Design Population : A randomized control clinical trial conduct newly diagnose glaucoma patient Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Montreal , Canada . Half participant randomize receive intervention half randomize receive delay intervention conclusion study . Inclusion criterion include diagnosis glaucoma require intraocular pressure lower eye drop therapy prescription drug insurance Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec ( RAMQ ) ( Quebec Health Insurance Program ) throughout course study . There three source data study : questionnaire , medical record , RAMQ prescription drug claim data . Follow-up one year . Recruitment Randomization : From July , 2007 December , 2011 , researcher approach eligible patient determine interest participate study . Interested participant sign informed consent form randomize . Participants intervention group give appointment come back Hospital group intervention . Participants control group give appointment receive group intervention end study . Intervention : Small group 10 people gather two 60-90 minute educational session glaucoma classroom Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital . During break , patient receive one-on-one teach properly instill drop without touch eye use unnecessary drop . Questionnaire Assessment Eye Drop Technique : A single questionnaire give end study participant . The intervention group complete questionnaire intervention control group complete questionnaire intervention . Questions include demographic , systemic comorbidities , ocular medication , eye drop practice difficulty , glaucoma knowledge . The instructor rat ability participant put eye drop eye take account number drop use whether contact lid conjunctiva occur ( good , fair , bad ) . We create composite score perception importance glaucoma eye drop therapy use follow four question : 1 ) think glaucoma serious disease , 2 ) believe treatment effective , 3 ) think drop low pressure eye , 4 ) think drop help preserve vision . Answers know give 0 point answer yes give 1 point . Scores sum composite score range 0 4 . Medical Chart Review : At end follow-up period , information obtain : prescribed eye drop therapy patient per eye , whether patient undergone glaucoma filtering surgery , whether patient die long follow , recent visual field mean deviation well eye use Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer 24-2 SITA Standard Program . Pharmaceutical Claims Calculation Medication Possession Ratio : The Medication Possession Ratio ( MPR ) calculate sum day prescription supply divide number day prescription require . Each person give consent contact RAMQ obtain pharmaceutical claim glaucoma medication . Data collect date purchase , name , dose , class medicine . Data number day medication available per bottle take Rylander Friedman study minimum value use . For numerator MPR , calculate many day medication available use RAMQ data . For denominator MPR , calculate number day medication prescribe medical chart . We take account whether drop need one two eye . If participant multiple medication , calculate single mean MPR medication . We dichotomize MPR medication le 75 % day define non-adherent , previously Djafari et al . SIGNIFICANCE Adherence problem glaucoma patient must often take daily eye drop despite noticing benefit vision despite frequent side effect . Low cost intervention help improve adherence need .</brief_summary>
