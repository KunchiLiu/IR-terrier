	<detailed_description>Purpose design Fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) serious condition affect 8 % pregnancy contribute 50 % stillbirth . Severe early onset FGR affect 1 500 pregnancy occur 28 week gestation . As yet therapy improve fetal growth utero . The EVERREST Consortium currently develop treatment FGR use gene therapy increase level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) mother 's uterine artery . Although case severe early onset FGR cause chromosomal abnormality maternal infection , commonly due inadequate uteroplacental blood flow . VEGF , secrete placenta , vasodilator mediates vasculogenesis angiogenesis . In FGR , however , maternal serum level VEGF significantly low normal pregnancy . Previous study sheep guinea pig model FGR show administer adenovirus VEGF gene therapy ( Ad.VEGF ) maternal uterine artery safely increase fetal growth . The EVERREST Consortium plan carry phase I/II trial ass safety efficacy intra-uterine artery Ad.VEGF woman pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR . This call EVERREST Clinical Trial . As pregnancy high rate fetal mortality morbidity vital up-to-date , reliable outcome data untreated pregnancy compare outcomes clinical trial . The prospective study application clinically biochemically characterise cohort pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR across four European centre later take part clinical trial . A database create contain information antenatal investigation , maternal complication , fetal outcome neonatal progress . This link biobank contain sample maternal blood , umbilical cord , umbilical cord blood , placenta , placental bed myometrium . There three aim study : 1 . To provide data pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR compare outcome group pregnancies undergo treatment use maternal Ad.VEGF gene therapy . 2 . To provide important information likely prognosis baby bear affected pregnancy short long term . These data currently lack . 3 . To provide sample use investigate biological mechanism underlie condition , subsequently may use provide biomarkers outcome . The design project involve consultation lead European fetal medicine specialist , neonatologists , pathologist biomedical scientist form part EVERREST consortium . The multicenter nature project raise issue confidentiality data protection also allow large data set draw meaningful conclusion . Furthermore mean finding applicable United Kingdom also Europe . It also provide large group patient recruit EVERREST trial . The project also give approval National Institute Health Research , fund Fetal Medicine Clinical Study Group Royal College Obstetrician Gynecologists , PI member . Other lead Fetal Medicine centre across United Kingdom involve recruit prospective study wider picture severe FGR sample affect pregnancy available UK . Recruitment Women refer Fetal Medicine Unit suspect severe early onset Fetal Growth Restriction give Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) read . If diagnosis severe early onset FGR make woman ask interested take part study . Interested eligible woman meet member research team read PIS answer question . If woman would like time decide meet member research team subsequent hospital appointment . For woman understand official language participate hospital interpreter would normally present hospital appointment part routine care . If interpreter present telephone interpret service may use interpreter may arrange next hospital appointment . For woman understand spoken language write PIS member research team read PIS answer question . For woman communication difficulty ( e.g . visual hearing impairment ) individual provision make depend woman 's preference . Any woman give informed consent read PIS consent witness . Consent When severe early onset FGR suspect , woman give Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) read . Principal Investigators responsibility write local PIS , conform national requirement also contain essential information UK PIS . An English version UK PIS modify , change track , meet local requirement . This review member Study Management Group ensure key information retain . The PIS translate local language member site research team , back-translated independent translator verify member Study Management Group . During consent process make completely unambiguously clear participant free refuse participate aspect study , time reason , without incur penalty affect treatment child . The participant 's decisional capacity determine team member take consent formal capacity instrument use . If doubt capacity participant enrol . All member research team involve obtain consent receive training assess capacity importance valid consent free coercion . Documented consent obtain store securely research site , file woman 's case note . Risks , burden benefit Women may distress discuss study already worry upsetting time follow diagnosis severe early onset FGR . If case pursue , discussed future appointment woman wish . Within University College London Hospital Fetal Medicine Unit woman frequently give information research time appointments investigator find distress . Women may concern decline involved study affect care receive . The Participant Information Sheet make clear case . There risk breach confidentiality data share . This minimise hold data central secure database , password protect access authorised member team , create unique pseudoanonymised Participant Identification Number use database . Participant identifiable data , include name , address hospital ID number , enter onto central database . Performing ultrasound assessment uterine artery blood flow add 2-5 minute 30 minute ultrasound scan . At appointment woman often need wait ultrasound scan may need blood pressure monitoring , urine check fetal heart beat monitoring ( cardiotocograph ) part routine care . This mean hospital hour , uterine blood flow assessment would small fraction . The maternal blood sample may involve temporary pain and/or bruising . This minimise sample take trained healthcare professional . During low risk pregnancy two routine blood sample recommend book 28 week gestation . In pregnancy complicate severe early onset FGR several additional blood sample need part clinical care . Investigators plan take investigator first sample time blood test need look maternal infection ( toxoplasmosis , cytomegalovirus , rubella ) investigator second time pre-operative blood test take Caesarean section . The time take read Participant Information Sheet , give informed consent give maternal blood sample may inconvenience participant . This minimise consent woman attend hospital part ongoing care . The myometrial biopsy placental bed biopsy add estimate 1 minute Caesarean section . Generally surgical time Caesarean 45 minute anesthetic time patient transfer include overall procedure take approximately 2 hour . They associate significant risk hemorrhage post-operative complication . Biopsies would take clinical contra-indication e.g . excessive uterine bleed maternal medical condition mean duration surgery limit . The umbilical cord , umbilical cord blood placental sample take baby deliver , cord cut placenta deliver involve pain inconvenience mother baby . At moment treatment severe early onset FGR . This leave parent feel helpless face diagnosis . It may help feel participation could contribute good understand condition potential treatment future . Women pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR high risk future affect pregnancy , may also potential direct benefit future reproductive health . Babies born pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR routinely follow four EU country two year age , correct prematurity , since well know many severe morbidity medical input require . Investigators collect data clinical blood result , investigation neurodevelopmental assessment , perform routinely part standard care . Confidentiality The EVERREST consortium collect demographic clinical data participant four European country combine central database . Within center participant give unique study Participant Identification Number ( PIN ) . Data enter identification number onto central database store server base University College London . The database password protect accessible member EVERREST Consortium , UCL Clinical Trials Unit , participate hospital external regulator , include European Commission . The server protect firewall patch maintain accord best practice . The physical location server protect Closed-circuit television security door access . The database cod frame develop Trial Manager conjunction CTU . The information link participant identifiable data pseudoanonymised Participant Identification Number hold locally research sit . This either hold write form lock filing cabinet electronically password protect form hospital computer . After completion study data link participant identifiable data PIN destroy database retain server University College London on-going analysis conjunction bio bank . All member research team receive training regulation surround confidentiality data handle responsibility area . It make clear participant PIS process consent data obtain medical record medical record baby . It explain data store form directly identifiable share within European Union purpose study . Electronic data transfer encrypted password protect form . It anticipate result analyze tissue sample direct clinical significance participant . If , however , result obtain would serious impact participant 's current future health would feed back recruit study center Participant Identification Number . Within recruit center result could link back participant without identify rest research team . Conflict interest Some member research team involve give clinical care woman pregnancy affect severe early onset FGR . Although affect woman 's care whether choose participate study , woman may feel sense pressure participate `` upset '' clinical team . It emphasize PIS person obtain consent free decline decision affect care receive . At end study result publish EVERREST website participant able access . Participants inform website PIS . Use tissue sample future research At conclusion study , store sample transfer site national regulatory approval , retention bio bank . Participant consent obtain advance retention . Separate ethical application make research use sample . Samples store fully use become unusable , anticipated maximum 10 year frozen sample . If participant give consent retention future research UK sample dispose accordance Human Tissue Authority 's Code Practice European sample dispose accord local national guideline .</detailed_description>
