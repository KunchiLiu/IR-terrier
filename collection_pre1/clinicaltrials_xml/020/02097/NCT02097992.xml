	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose study test hypothesis patient stable COPD use ICS regularly , single dose long-term treatment 4 week roflumilast increase albuterol -induced vasodilation ( delta Qaw ) . These vascular effect roflumilast consider anti-inflammatory .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants enrol study three month There 6 study day ( visit ) . The patient ask come research laboratory morning study day . They instruct abstain ingest alcoholic beverage use PDE5 inhibitor night study , consume coffee caffeinated drink morning study day potential acute cardiovascular action . The patient also ask fatty breakfast study day avoid potential effect fat absorption roflumilast . The visit separate least 48 hour . The treatment administer double-blind randomized design , use active roflumilast identically appear roflumilast placebo provide Forest . Visit 1 On visit , medical history obtain patient undergo physical examination complete pulmonary function test . If meet entry criterion , Qaw measure 15 min inhalation 180 µg albuterol use spacer ( ΔQaw ) . We previously show vasodilation peak 5 30 min inhale dose albuterol healthy non-smokers ; patient COPD , exhibit vasodilatory response inhale albuterol , peak effect also occur time healthy subject . Since patient enrol present study regular ICS user , expect vasodilator response albuterol previously show . Visit 2 On day , Qaw measure 15 , 30 , 60,120 240 min oral administration either 500µg roflumilast placebo , blind patient investigator ( acute roflumilast effect ) . Visit 3 The patient give either 500µg roflumilast placebo ( alternate treatment visit 2 ) blind patient investigator . One hour later , Qaw measure 15 min inhalation 180µg albuterol use spacer ( ΔQaw ) . Pharmacokinetic study show geometric mean plasma concentration roflumilast 500µg dose peak one hour oral drug administration . The patient randomize double blind fashion either roflumilast 500 µg placebo every morning breakfast . They ask return follow visit 4 week later ( visit 4 ) . Visit 4 The patient take morning dose ( roflumilast placebo ) day . Qaw measure 15 min inhalation 180 µg albuterol use spacer ( ΔQaw ) . The treatment discontinue patient ask return visit 5 4-week washout period . Visit 5 The protocol visit 4 repeat . The patient start alternate treatment 4 week : Those roflumilast visit 3 4 place placebo , placebo visit 3 4 place roflumilast . The patient ask return final visit ( visit 6 ) 4 week later . Visit 6 The protocol visit 4 repeat . The patient undergo exit exam discharge study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Twentyfour patient physiciandiagnosed COPD ( female male , current smoker exsmokers ) age 45 year recruit study . The patient smoke history least 10 packyears , must use ICS regularly least 4 week time screen . Confirmation diagnosis COPD require presence persistent exertional dyspnea postbronchodilator FEV1 le 80 % predict FEV1/FVC ratio le 0.7 ( GOLD stage ≥2 ) . At entry study , patient clinically stable ; allow remain regular COPD treatment regimen use LABA and/or LAMA 24 hour , SABA and/or shortacting muscarinic antagonist ( SAMA ) 6 hour come laboratory . If use roflumilast , subject discontinue 4 week enter study . Women childbearing potential use accept birth control measure Pregnant breastfeed woman . Use cardiovascular medication hold study day Use oral airway medication antiinflammatory agent Use supplemental oxygen discontinue laboratory visit Subjects know SABA roflumilast intolerance An acute COPD exacerbation within four week prior study</criteria>
