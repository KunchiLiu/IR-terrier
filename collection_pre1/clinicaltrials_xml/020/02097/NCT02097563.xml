	<brief_summary>The present study aim : 1. compare different approach ( high intensity vs. low intensity ) training community provider ( routinely treat young patient bipolar disorder , psychosis , sub-threshold high-risk condition ) implementation family-focused treatment ( FFT ) ; 2. ass cost FFT train implementation support ; 3. determine whether different form clinician training associate different outcome 1 year among patient early-onset mood psychotic disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite impressive result laboratory setting , significant lag community adoption sustainability family intervention early-onset mood psychotic disorder . Our objective determine optimal method train monitoring delivery evidence-based family-focused treatment ( FFT ) community provider treat young patient ( age 13-25 ) bipolar disorder ( BD ) , psychosis , `` high-risk '' condition . FFT administer 12 session psychoeducation , communication training , problem-solving skill train . There six randomize control trial indicate , among adults adolescent BD , bipolar spectrum , psychosis-risk disorder , FFT pharmacotherapy associate rapid stabilization symptom , delayed recurrence , enhance functioning , good medication adherence , improvement family interaction relative comparison treatment 1-2 year . Using community partner participatory approach , engage diverse stakeholder ( clinician , administrator , caregiver ) three community site ( Harbor-UCLA Medical Center , San Fernando Mental Health Center , Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center ) treat early-onset , low socioeconomic status , urban , racially ethnically diverse bipolar psychosis patient . We partner 3 community site randomly assign 30 clinician low intensity ( web-based training plus low intensity supervision ) high intensity training ( live workshop high intensity supervision , i.e. , weekly individual supervision fidelity feedback ) . Clinicians administer FFT 120 patient ( age 13-25 ) recent-onset mania , psychosis high-risk condition . We expect 20 clinician complete treatment 80 patient . Dependent variable empirically-derived fidelity component score time measure supervisor clinician . We hypothesize train , clinician high low intensity group attain minimum level fidelity require certification four component . However , clinician high intensity training sustain high level fidelity across subsequent treatment case , satisfy likely adopt FFT model . This study facilitate translation evidence-based intervention identify effective treatment component inform larger-scale dissemination FFT community setting .</detailed_description>
