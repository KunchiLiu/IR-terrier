	<detailed_description>According Statistik Austria , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common reason death Austria total population . In 2011 , 42,3 % death due CVD ( ICD-10 I00-I99 ) . In People age 45-64 year , CVD , beyond cancer , second common cause death . According `` Ã–sterreichische Gesundheitsbefragung 2006/7 '' two-thirds men three-quarters woman physically inactive whereby physical inactivity define least 3x/week sudatory exercise like cycling , jog aerobic . A famous study do Morris et al . 1953 show bus conductor London ( walk job ) half coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality compare bus driver ( sit job ) therefore initiated hour birth CVD research connection physical ( ) activity . Cardiorespiratory fitness might reduce does-dependently cause cardiovascular mortality 20-30 % ( 5-8 ) probability develop CHD 30-50 % ( 9-11 ) . Recently , CVD-research focus investigation blood-markers indicate presence atherosclerosis represent risk development genesis CV event . E.g . inflammatory marker IL-6 , TNF-alpha , ICAM-1 , P-selectin , hsCRP serum amyloid A promising marker . Studies show hsCRP level baseline predict future CV event . Markers plaque stability e.g . myeloperoxidase , metalloproteinase-9 soluble CD-40 ligand . However , influence exercise factor already investigate . The main dependent variable endocan osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) : OPG member TNF-related family involve bone metabolism . However , high level OPG report association cardiovascular outcome ( CAD , vascular calcification , advanced atherosclerosis , heart failure ... ) . Serum concentration find correlate severity peripheral artery disease , carotic stenosis myocardial infarction . Furthermore , OPG associate left ventricle leave atrial remodelling patient severe aortic stenosis , disease often obverse elderly patient . Age gender show predict OPG level , least hemodialysis patient . Several study perform investigate influence acute exercise resistance training circulate OPG amount less known influence long-term physical exercise . Endocan ( endothelial cell specific molecule 1 ; ESM-1 ) recombinant proteoglycan may represent new marker correlate CV risk surrogate endothelial dysfunction play role endothelium-dependent pathological disorder . Other variable : - Progerin : Progerin originally investigate course research Hutchinson-Gilford-Syndrome , genetic effect affect child lead atherosclerosis . Progerin correlate vascular pathology `` normal '' age present also `` normal '' population . - Myeloid-related protein 8 14 ( MRP-8/14 ) : MRP-8/14 stable heterodimer , form Ca++-binding protein . It show MRP-8/14 regulate vascular inflammation , involve diabetic vascular complication occur CAD . Furthermore , MRP-14 associate histopathologic finding inflammation status atherosclerotic plaque . - Angiopoietin-like protein 2 ( angptl2 ) : Angptl2 depend family angiopoietin-like protein involve angiogenesis . Angptl2 show 6 time high mouse CAD compare control . Furthermore , increase age increase pronounce mice high cholesterol level . Angptl2 therefore contribute genesis pathogenesis atherosclerosis . - Cathepsin S K : Cathepsins synthesize inactive proenzyme get activate proteolytic process . Atherosclerotic lesion contain much high amount cathepsin S K normal artery . Furthermore , seem play role formation aneurysm . - Cystatin C : Cystatin C cysteine protease inhibitor participate protein catabolism suggest predict CVD . High serum level cystatin c show correlate early stage atherosclerosis . Cystatin C independent predictor risk cardiovascular event . - Placental growth factor ( PlGF ) : PlGF , cysteine-knot protein quite homologous VEGF , implicate Pathophysiology angiogenesis . PlGF-expression atherosclerotic lesion show associated inflammation microvascular density suggest PlGF play role plaque destabilization clinical manifestation CAD ( 32 ) . Anti-PlGF monoclonal antibody therapy mouse lead decrease development atherosclerosis . All mention marker distinctive interest atherosclerosis research , however , influence long-term exercise study yet .</detailed_description>
