	<brief_title>Adipose Cells Degenerative Disc Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study ASC implantation perform intra-discally . ASCs derive patient 's adipose-derived tissue . Liposuction use local anesthesia syringe collection perform collect adipose tissue specimen subsequent process isolate stem cell . The adipose tissue specimen collect patient 's abdomen use liposuction cannula . In addition , sample peripheral blood collect isolation platelet rich plasma . The adipose tissue process separation adipose tissue-derived stem cell , resuspend platelet rich plasma transfer intra-discal administration . The number cell injected vary depend amount tissue process number cell obtain process . Following injection follow-up data collect 3 , 6 12 month treatment . Total study time frame anticipate approximately 6 month . This study enroll approximately 100 patient .</detailed_description>
