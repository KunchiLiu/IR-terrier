	<brief_summary>There limited therapeutical option patient secondary dystonia due cerebral palsy . Pharmacotherapy often without effect , side effect severe . Meanwhile deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) proven safe effective therapy patient parkinson´s disease primary / idiopathic dystonia . Experiences DBS patient dyskinetic cerebral palsy limit heterogeneous data . With STIM-CP investigate effect DBS quality life young patient dyskinetic movement disorder ( dyskinetic cerebral palsy ) due perinatal hypoxic brain injury . Additionally , effect DBS motor development , speech , memory , attention , cognition pain perception assess . In total , 20 patient age 7-18 year diagnose dyskinetic cerebral palsy , receive DBS , include . 11 German DBS-centres participate trial . We assume DBS reduces severity dystonia improve quality life patient .</brief_summary>
