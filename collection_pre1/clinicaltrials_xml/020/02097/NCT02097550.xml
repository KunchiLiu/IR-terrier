	<brief_summary>This project seek improve health patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) develop test electronic health intervention ( combine secure e -- mail , smartphone text message , online video material ) promote patient use effective medication . The information collect electronic health intervention guide future research , include large trial study among related patient group ( e.g. , racial minority ) disease ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes mellitus ) . The project potential improve health outcome million patient CKD yet receive effective medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Care eHealth Intervention Improved Outcomes Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) affect 20 million American adult . Effective medication reduce progression remain vastly under-utilized due well-known behavioral barrier patient clinician , include affective barrier denial , inertia , uncertainty . The health consequence poor level medication adoption warrant development new strategy facilitate use . Moderate CKD Critical Juncture Intervention : Rates CKD likely escalate contribute condition ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes , obesity ) increase . With progression , patient experience costly preventable renal cardiovascular disease adverse outcome ( e.g. , dialysis , myocardial infarction ) . CKD also impose disproportionately heavy burden racial/ethnic minority low socioeconomic status . There estimate 8 million U.S. adult stage 3 `` moderate '' CKD ( define estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 ) offering sizeable target population intervention . Patients stage 3 CKD often diagnose stage disease routine laboratory test perform primary care provider time disease progression still minimize . Evidence show use four category medication ( renal protection , hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia ) slow even halt CKD disease progression . Underutilization Effective Medications CKD Exposes Quality Gap : These effective drug remain vastly under-utilized despite promotion drug formulary , practice guideline , clinician patient educational campaign , include landmark 2002 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative related undertaking . National ambulatory data indicate even among patient CKD diagnose cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , 57 % angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-I ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , 35 % achieve target blood pressure control , 52 % take lipid-lowering agent , despite clear benefit high-risk population . Those without CVD diagnosis comparable even bad rate target measure . After system-wide quality improvement initiative , Southern California Kaiser patient identify CKD still notable quality gap care : though improve , 16 % miss ACE-I/ARB , 56 % poorly control blood pressure , 40 % LDL target , 50 % comorbid type 2 diabetes ( diabetes ) hemoglobin A1c level 7 % great . Aim 1 : Formative research—Develop eHealth intervention Challenge : There good evidence target conscious process health behavior change less affective processing . Approach : Using theory-based approach , identify promise content , minimum dose , delivery eHealth intervention promote appropriate medication adoption . We use observational , systematic review , qualitative methodology formative research special emphasis target affective processing ( addition conscious processing ) . Impact : We develop e-Health intervention anticipate effective content , dose , delivery . Aim 2 : Evaluative research—Pilot test eHealth intervention small RCT Challenge : The eHealth intervention must pilot refined prior definitive investigation efficacy . Approach : We test eHealth intervention feasibility 2-arm pilot RCT ( intervention vs. usual care control ) among patient stage 3b CKD manage primary care clinician , also collect data critical designing future efficacy trial . Randomization : patient ( 50/arm ) cluster clinician ( 20/arm ) target inclusion 1-3/clinician . Primary outcome : 4-point `` CKD score '' assess control risk factor CKD progression ( proteinuria , blood pressure , plasma glucose , cholesterol level/calculated CVD risk ) . H1 : intervention group achieve good mean CKD score usual care group . Secondary outcome : new prescription promote medication , CKD progression , feasibility process data . Impact : A new intervention specifically targeted medication adoption ready evaluation large efficacy RCT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stage 3a ( eGFR 4559 ) plus poorly control risk factor CKD progression and/or cardiovascular disease morbidity/mortality ) . Our intervention appropriate patient stage 3a CKD yet optimize kidney protection ( set proteinuria ) ACEinhibitors/ARBS , hypertension , diabetes cardiovascular disease treatment . Our intervention message promote medication class optimization condition thus appropriate patient stage 3a CKD yet control condition Stage 3b chronic kidney disease ( define eGFR 3044 ) : The rationale include patient stage 3b CKD ( define eGFR 3044 ) stage 3a ( eGFR 4559 ) reduce possibility misclassification high eGFRs ( little underlie kidney dysfunction ) respond evidence patient stage 3b CKD much high rate progression kidney failure stage 3a . We choose follow inclusion criterion optimize balance generalizability , participant safety , treatment adherence , retention . Having primary care provider ( PCP ) UCSF , define identify individual provider provider group participant receive ongoing medical care , need ; Not pregnant study assessment . The ability use computer smartphone The ability understand English Severe hypertriglyceridemia ( TG &gt; 500 mg/dL ) Hyperkalemia ( K &gt; 5.0 mEq/L ) Serious illness likely preclude study completion Pregnancy Intolerance/allergy indicate CKD medication Medication management CKD ( i.e. , medications/medication class target promotion eHealth intervention ) already optimize Has never use MyChart : MyChart use indicate minimum level exist familiarity use eHealth material Having access computer smartphone Plans change primary care site . Family/household member another study participant study staff member ; Already enrol plan enroll research study would limit full participation trial confound interpretation result ; Investigator discretion clinical safety protocol adherence reason .</criteria>
