	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , toxicity , safety profile AT13387 ( Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 ) give weekly combination dabrafenib trametinib patient BRAF-mutant metastatic unresectable solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary estimate objective response rate ( ORR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) document 6-month PFS 1-year overall survival ( OS ) patient BRAF-mutant metastatic unresectable melanoma treat AT13387 give weekly combination dabrafenib trametinib . II . To describe pharmacokinetics treatment dabrafenib , trametinib , AT13387 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 . Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) , trametinib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 , Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
