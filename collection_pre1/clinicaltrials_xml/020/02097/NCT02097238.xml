	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 4 month progression free survival rate objective response rate patient recurrent osteosarcoma administer eribulin ( eribulin mesylate ) therapy day 1 day 8 21 day cycle . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) eribulin subject recurrent osteosarcoma . II . To describe tolerability single agent eribulin . OUTLINE : Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 2-5 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
