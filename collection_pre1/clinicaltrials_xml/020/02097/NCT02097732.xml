	<brief_summary>This study test efficacy use standard immune therapy melanoma prior stereotactic radiosurgery ( ipilimumab induction ) , compare stereotactic radiosurgery follow immune therapy . The study 's hypothesis ipilimumab induction good well control brain metastasis compare stereotactic radiosurgery follow immune therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Induction Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases Receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized Phase II selection study investigate use ipilimumab induction prior stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , versus induction , melanoma brain metastasis . Participants randomize Arm A `` Induction '' ( two dos ipilimumab prior SRS , two dos ipilimumab SRS ) versus Arm B `` No induction '' ( SRS first , follow 4 dos ipilimumab ) . Participants undergo multiple dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs brain submit blood sample immune test .</detailed_description>
