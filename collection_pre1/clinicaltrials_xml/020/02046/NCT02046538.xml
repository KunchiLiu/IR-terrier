	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish safety Zaltrap patient undergo pre-operative chemotherapy Zaltrap . The investigator hypothesize Zaltrap impact colorectal cancer growth metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Zaltrap Chemotherapy Advanced Resectable Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient receive 3 month chemotherapy consist either FOLFOX FOLFIRI ( case liver limit CRC ) FOLFOX ( case rectal cancer ) . The FOLFOX regimen consist Oxaliplatin , Leucovorin , 5-FU . The FOLFIRI regimen consist Irinotecan , Leucovorin , 5-FU . Zaltrap administer chemotherapy every 2 week first 5 6 plan treatment cycle . After standard 3-4 week recovery period ( i.e . 5-6 week 's last Zaltrap dose ) , patient undergo standard resection . At time resection , tumor collect biomarker discovery . Following resection , patient randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive chemotherapy without zaltrap 3 additional month . Patients assign Zaltrap may continue zaltrap ( without chemotherapy ) disease recurrence additional 15 month . Patients research blood draw periodically preoperative postoperative period . The investigator plan demonstrate pre-operative chemotherapy Zaltrap associate safety signal would preclude drug development patient population . The investigator also plan perform correlative study identify potential biomarkers Zaltrap activity . The investigator hypothesize antiangiogenic therapy may specifically target micrometastatis niche patient liver limit metastatic colorectal cancer significantly increase chance cure patient .</detailed_description>
