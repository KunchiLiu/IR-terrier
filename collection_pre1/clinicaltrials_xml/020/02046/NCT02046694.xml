	<brief_summary>This research do determine allopurinol change metabolism oral chemotherapeutic medication 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) child acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . 6-MP originally start standard dose child ALL , dose adjust accord absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) . Occasionally , 6-MP dos need increase order get ANC specific target range . Also , increase 6-MP dose lead unwanted side effect , inflammation liver show increase laboratory value ( ALT , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , bilirubin ) , nausea , abdominal discomfort . Previous study child inflammatory bowel disease show combine allopurinol 6-MP decrease side effect associate high dos 6-MP also increase efficacy 6-MP . Allopurinol approve Food Drug Administration treatment tumor lysis syndrome ALL . Through research study , hope show combination allopurinol 6-MP safe , tolerable , effective child ALL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Allopurinol As A Modifier 6-MP Metabolism Pediatric ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients several visit Pediatric Oncology outpatient clinic . Each visit consist physical examination laboratory evaluation . Each laboratory evaluation consist take approximately 10 15 milliliter blood ( approximately three teaspoon ) . These clinic visit may actually coincide clinic visit previously schedule accord patient 's treatment protocol . - At first study visit , patient physical examination laboratory evaluation . At visit , patient ask stop take 6-MP methotrexate . - At second study visit , one week later , patient physical examination laboratory evaluation . We prescribe allopurinol restart 6-MP methotrexate half patient 's previous dos . - Clinic visit physical examination laboratory evaluation schedule every 1-2 week total 5 visit . Doses allopurinol , 6-MP , methotrexate may adjust visit base laboratory value clinical symptom .</detailed_description>
