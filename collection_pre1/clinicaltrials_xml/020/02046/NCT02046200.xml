	<detailed_description>Current pharmacotherapies alcohol use disorder ( AUDs ) limit efficacy . Thus , development effective treatment AUDs represent important public health objective . Repositioning , i.e . use exist approve drug indication , represent fast economically feasible approach drug development . Ivermectin ( IVM ) FDA-approved antiparasitic medication significantly reduce alcohol intake mouse , suggest may useful treatment AUDs human . The goal project provide key clinical evidence IVM reposition novel therapeutic agent treat AUDs . We enroll 10 alcohol dependent individual placebo-controlled randomized pilot safety trial IVM ( 30 mg orally ) 2-day ( 1-night ) inpatient stay UCLA CTRC employ well-characterized battery behavioral paradigm ( i.e. , alcohol administration cue exposure ) . The goal study test : ( ) safety combine IVM , dose currently show safe human ( 30 mg ) , moderate dos alcohol ( 0.08 g/dl ) ; ( b ) whether IVM reduces reinforce effect alcohol alcohol administration whether reduces alcohol crave cue exposure , compare placebo .</detailed_description>
