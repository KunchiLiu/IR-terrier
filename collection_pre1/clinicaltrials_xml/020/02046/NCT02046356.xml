	<brief_title>Early Recurrence Risk Factors Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radio Frequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Radio frequency ablation ( RFA ) , curable technology , recommend treatment early hepatoma guideline different country , however , early ( within 2 year ) recurrence rate operation remain high , investigator know study risk factor independent risk factor recurrence retrospective study , multi-center prospective case-control study need . Therefore , investigator aim adopt method identify factor ( ) 86 patient early hepatoma fulfill diagnostic criterion Milan accept complete RFA hospitalization . - After RFA , inform consent acquire patient follow-up begin . According follow-up data , patient assign recurrence group un-recurrence group . The monitoring data risk factor inputted Epi Date software statistic analyze SPSS 18.0 . The statistical method include : Chi-square test comparison rate , Logistical regression analysis relate risk factor independent risk factor .</detailed_description>
