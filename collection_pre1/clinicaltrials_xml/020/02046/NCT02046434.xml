	<detailed_description>This Phase I clinical trial phenylbutyrate 20 Parkinson patient 20 age- sex-matched normal control subject see phenylbutyrate increase removal alpha-synuclein brain bloodstream . All subject receive 20 grams/day phenylbutyrate liquid form phenylbutyrate-triglyceride take one teaspoonful three time per day meal . Blood drawn two day prior start phenylbutyrate measure alpha-synuclein concentration . Phenylbutyrate-triglyceride start change plasma alpha-synuclein measure day 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 day take phenylbutyrate . After 21 day , drug stop final blood sample measure 28 day see plasma alpha-synuclein fall pre-phenylbutyrate level . No effect Parkinson symptom expect short trial . Please note although take type Parkinson 's drug symptomatic treatment disqualifies , neurologist willing able Parkinson medication six week trial , may eligible participate .</detailed_description>
