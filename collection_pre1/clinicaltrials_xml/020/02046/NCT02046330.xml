	<brief_summary>We propose clinical study medial forebrain bundle DBS treatment 10 patient treatment refractory depression ( TRD ) . Data University Bonn indicate surgical lesion medical forebrain bundle produce therapeutic benefit patient depressive disorder , suggest DBS site may also reduce symptomatology TRD patient ( Schaepfer , 2013 ) . Depression affect 10 % US population least 10-15 % benefit therapy hence must explore new treatment . The Activa® system manufacture Medtronic Neurological use study . Study subject age 22 65 year age suffer TRD , fail multiple treatment regimen , include ECT , remain symptomatic . Those identified TRD patient enrol clinical pilot study investigate DBS , target MFB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : Subjects ten patient MDD identify via Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV , manifest current major depressive episode disable severity , refractory prolong treatment trial conventional medication , electro-convulsive therapy ( ECT ) psychotherapy . A marked impact depression health functional status evidence major impairment function potentially severe medical outcome ( repeat hospitalization , serious suicidal self-injurious behavior ) . They recruit individual currently see facility referred psychiatrist community . Patients initially screen comprehensive review psychiatric history , obtain interview patient , family treat psychiatrist and/or psychologist , well obtain review available record previous psychiatric treatment . The available generally-accepted alternative treatment depression pharmacologic therapy , psychotherapy , ECT . Failed trial multiple proven pharmacologic treatment , adequate course psychotherapy , adequate course bilateral ECT ( inability tolerate adequate ECT trial ) inclusion criterion candidate consider study . However , alternative participation study , candidate may undertake additional trial potentially beneficial novel combination medication psychotherapy , may undertake trial novel intervention lack definitive evidence efficacy severe depression ( e.g. , light therapy , herbal therapy , transcranial magnetic stimulation , vagal nerve stimulation ) . The protocol design include four phase . All patient enter phase sequence . The experimental design illustrate timeline Figure 1 . Surgical implantation follow : 1 ) Baseline Phase ( 1 month period stimulation ) ; 2 ) Variable Staggered Phase ( blind stimulation onset start 1 month 3 month post implant , optimal parameter determination time ; 3 ) Initial Chronic Phase ( blind bilateral stimulation , last least three month ) ( see ) ; 4 ) Continuation Phase ( unblinded active bilateral unilateral stimulation maximize clinical response ) Protocol overview design : We propose clinical study medial forebrain bundle DBS treatment 10 patient treatment refractory depression ( TRD ) . Data University Bonn indicate surgical lesion medical forebrain bundle produce therapeutic benefit patient depressive disorder , suggest DBS site may also reduce symptomatology TRD patient ( Schaepfer , 2013 ) .
