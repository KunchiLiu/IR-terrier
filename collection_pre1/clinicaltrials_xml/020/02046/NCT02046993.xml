	<brief_title>Effect Smart Phone Based Telemonitoring Blood Pressure Among Hypertensive Patients Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , block randomize controlled 6 month study compare blood pressure control hypertensive patient participate enhance usual care plus smart phone base telemonitoring ( TM ) Blood Pressure ( BP ) hypertensive patient receive enhance usual care ( UC ) alone primary care setting.A previous local study do Fung et al show mean diastolic BP reduction 3.84 mmHg use manual record HBPM structured program . On basis expectation least 5 mmHg difference power 90 % significance level 5 % assume standard deviation 10 mmHg account 20 % attrition rate , sample size 206 need . Following inclusion exclusion criterion , subject recruit voluntary basis study . Having obtain informed consent , subject require attend structure home blood pressure monitor education program base Fung et al study require pas self-BP measurement competency test randomisation . [ 1 ] All participate subject allocate use block randomization intervention group ( TM ) control group ( UC ) . Research assistant assessment baseline , 3 month 6 month post intervention partially blind groupings.At baseline follow-up visit , research assistant blind allocation outcome measure clinic blood pressure 15 minute rest validate electronic automate sphygmomanometer conduct self-efficacy manage chronic disease scale ( 6-item scale ) . Four blood pressure read take 1 minute interval do subject mean 2nd 3rd reading would use outcome measure baseline , 3 month 6 month . For intervention group , patient assist download mobile application tool ( apps ) , specifically develop use telerecording reading home self BP measurement . For control group , patient encourage self BP monitor keep BP diary . The research assistant blind collection mean systolic diastolic home blood pressure reading reading base subject ' paper record control group mean systolic diastolic BP reading send data center baseline , 3 month 6 month . Regular home BP monitoring define take least 3 BP reading per week document manually paper record send electronically mobile apps data center . Comparisons two group term compliance home BP measurement reading , proportion patient home BP monitoring , self-efficacy outcome improvement clinic BP reading 3 month 6 month post-intervention assess use statistical analysis.Data analysis conduct use Statistical package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 16.0 . Descriptive statistic , include frequency percentage categorical variable mean standard deviation continuous variable , use describe demographic characteristic summarize baseline characteristic variable . Independent T-test use examine difference outcome variable TM UC group . A p-value 0.05 use level statistical significance . The principal investigator sub-investigator regular monitoring , conduct regular meeting research team ensure quality assurance patient recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event .</detailed_description>
