	<brief_summary>Compromised tissue oxygenation surgery may negatively influence patient outcome . Primary cause insufficient tissue oxygenation reduce cardiac output due hypovolemia and/or reduce cardiac contractility . In cardiac surgery patient especially , postoperative pericardium effusion and/or tamponade may compromise cardiac function . Today , hemodynamically instable patient often monitor mean pulmonal artery catheter transpulmonary thermodilution . However , method allow quantification functional limitation . Underlying cause may investigate relatively recent technology hemodynamically focus transesophageal echocardiography ( ClariTEE ( R ) ImaCor ) also provide possibility continuous monitoring . It report train program consist six hour may enable physician unexperienced field echocardiography apply new method . Up , evidence whether method associate improved postoperative outcome . Therefore hypothesize continuous hemodynamically focussed transesophageal echocardiography positively influence patient outcome ( primary hypothesis ) . Furthermore , application may decrease hospital expense ( secondary hypothesis ) .</brief_summary>
