	<brief_summary>The objective study 1 ) demonstrate effectiveness innovative bicycle train program teaching youth DS ASD ride standard two wheel bike , 2 ) determine effect treatment health related performance measure , physical activity level , pattern sleep behavior , psychosocial outcome , community participation . The hypothesis test study : 1 ) significant treatment group difference ( EXP v CON ) number participant demonstrate ability ride two wheel bicycle favor EXP group follow first year training . 2 ) At end second year training CON group receive bicycle train program , group difference number rider learn ride . 3 ) At end first year , significant treatment group difference ( EXP v CON ) health related performance measure , average time spent moderate moderate vigorous physical activity , pattern sleep behavior ( sleep onset , frequency night wake ) , self parent perception bicycle rid ability , community participation ( number community activity engage , frequency community participation , number people participate outside parent , number community location participate ) , favor EXP group . 4 ) At end second third year , CON group demonstrate significant improvement measure ( significant improvement pre-training measure 12 24 month measure ) . 5 ) At end third year , EXP group demonstrate significant group difference measure compare CON group magnitude difference less observed hypothesis 3 12 month measurement CON group receive training . These hypothesis test separately DS ASD group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two-wheel bicycle rid skill consider societal norm child youth America well life alter activity ( Klein , 2004 ) . Most child learn ride bicycle age 7 year . Children disability often require time learn functional motor behavior skill order successfully accomplish skill , child disability also require specialized instruction . Consequently , many child disability never learn ride two-wheel bicycle . If child disability learn ride two-wheel bicycle , tend learn much later child without disability . In Down syndrome population , estimate less 10 % ever learn ride two wheel bicycle . Learning ride two-wheel bicycle allow child participate leisure activity sibling peer ( Klein , 2004 ) . This true child Down syndrome ( DS ) child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . In previous research , specialize adapted bicycle successfully use teach child Down syndrome master important functional motor skill . In previous research , successfully train 62 % child DS ride 5 day ( 75 minute per day 5 day ) result , display significantly less time sedentary activity significantly time moderate vigorous activity 12 month follow training compare control group . Of 62 % child DS learn ride , 54 % still rid 18-24 month receive training.The child start learn ride two-wheel bicycle stable adapt bicycle ( thick roller wheel attach rear wheel ) quickly progress towards standard two-wheel bike . The result first bicycle study suggest 38 % reach mastery rid two wheel bike need follow training . In recent study , increase standard use classify child independent rider 30 foot 100 foot , provide follow-up training several weekend , link rider community bicycle rid club help insure continue ride follow formal individualized training . In recent study , successfully train 62 % child DS 94 % child ASD ride two wheel bicycle 100 foot five day , 75 minute day . Most learned able ride much long distance 100 foot . Participants new randomized clinical study , 9-18 year age range . After random assignment , experimental group receive bicycle intervention training . The control group receive incentive towards individualize instruction choice increase physical activity . Through learn ride two wheel bike , expect intervention induce positive change functional health related variable include : waist circumference , percent body fat , knee extensor strength , knee flexor strength , level physical activity , stand balance , participation community activity , psychosocial development . In addition child ASD expect see improvement pattern sleep behavior .</detailed_description>
