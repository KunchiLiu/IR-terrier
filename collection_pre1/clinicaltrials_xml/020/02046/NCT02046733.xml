	<brief_summary>Despite fact majority patient limited disease SCLC respond well standard treatment , great proportion relapse within 12 - 24 month . Several study patient lung cancer suggest possible favourable association increase presence immunologically active cell tumour survival . Nivolumab ipilimumab protein , help immune system attack destroy cancer cell immune cell . Early clinical trial nivolumab ipilimumab show activity broad range cancer , include SCLC . The aim current study investigate efficacy ( well treatment work ) tolerability ( severe side effect ) standard treatment ( chemotherapy radiotherapy ) alone , compare standard treatment follow nivolumab ipilimumab patient limited SCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Trial With Nivolumab IpiliMUmab LImited Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At time diagnosis , 30 % patient small cell lung carcinoma ( SCLC ) limit stage disease , call stage I-IIIB ( IASLC ) . The outcome limit disease SCLC still poor , median survival 16 24 month current form treatment 15-25 % long term survivor . Combining chemotherapy thoracic radiotherapy standard treatment approach limited-stage SCLC combination platinum compound ( cis- carboplatin ) etoposide cisplatin ( PE ) backbone regimen . Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy superior sequential treatment early thoracic irradiation start first second cycle chemotherapy appear beneficial . Hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy show efficacious radiotherapy give long overall treatment time . However , availability routine-use hyperfractionated radiotherapy remain matter debate . Therefore , trial , radiotherapy schedule accelerate twice-daily administration once-daily radiotherapy accept . The choice schedule stratification factor randomisation . The adaptive immune response trigger via effector T-cells , antigen-presenting cell ( APCs ) co-stimulatory signal mediate T cell receptor CD28 . The interplay signal result activation clonal proliferation T cell . T-cell proliferation tightly regulate order avoid autoimmunity . The balance co-stimulatory signal mediate CD28 co-inhibitory signal via call immune checkpoint receptor crucial maintenance self-tolerance protect tissue damage normal immune response . After activation , T-cells express immune checkpoint receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 ( CTLA-4 ) program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) . CTLA-4- PD-1 express T-cells play critical role maintain self-tolerance also responsible non-responsiveness tumour antigen . Cancer cell escape im-mune surveillance express immune checkpoint receptor . The goal immune check-point inhibitor therapy activate immune system attack particular target tumour cell , rather remove inhibitory pathway block effective antitumour T cell response . Ipilimumab monoclonal antibody bind CTLA-4 inhibits interaction ligands B7.1 B7.2 , Nivolumab monoclonal antibody target PD-1 . Engagement PD-1 natural ligand , PD-L1 PD-L2 , result inhibition T cell proliferation , survival cyto-kine secretion . Nivolumab abrogate interaction PD-1 ligand . The two antibody , nivolumab ipilimumab , target different immune cell receptor , also regulate distinct inhibitory pathway therefore non-overlapping mechanism action . Anti-CTLA-4 therapy seem drive T-cells tumour , result increased number intratumour T-cells concomitant increase IFN-y . This turn induce expression PD-L1 tumour microenvironment , subsequent inhibition antitumour T-cell response , may also increase chance benefit anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 therapy . A combination treatment anti-CTLA-4 ( e.g . ipili-mumab ) plus anti PD-1 ( e.g . nivolumab ) anti-PD-L1 antibody enable creation immunogenic tumour microenvironment subsequent clinical benefit patient . Nivolumab monotherapy approve treatment advanced melanoma ( FDA , EMA , Japan ) previously treat squamous NSCLC ( FDA , positive CHMP opin-ion ) . Nivolumab ipilimumab improve PFS compare nivolumab ipilimumab alone study melanoma ( CA209067 ) . In randomised open-label phase I/II trial ( CheckMate 032 ) , evaluate nivolumab without ipilimumab pretreated SCLC patient progressive disease sensitive refractory platinum base chemotherapy , base interim analysis response rate 33 % disease stabilisation 22 % observed combination nivolumab ipilimumab compare 18 % response rate 20 % stable disease nivolumab mono-therapy . Both , nivolumab monotherapy nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination treatment tolerable treatment SCLC , new safety profile identify compare profile nivolumab without ipilimumab anti-cancer therapy . Nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered consolidation treatment comple-tion standard treatment include chemo-radiotherapy prophylactic cranial irradia-tion ( PCI ) .</detailed_description>
