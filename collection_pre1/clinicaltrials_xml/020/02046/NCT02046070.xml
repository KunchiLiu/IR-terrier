	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , multicenter , open-label study patient Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma ( NDMM ) receive prior systemic treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) ineligible high-dose therapy ( HDT ) -stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) due age ( ie , ≥ 65 year ) comorbid disease ( ) Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma ( RRMM ) ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Evaluate Oral Combination Ixazomib ( MLN9708 ) With Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone Patients With Newly Diagnosed Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational drug test study call MLN9708 also know Ixazomib . This study look disease response rate safety people take ixazomib addition cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . NDMM participant randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group RRMM participant assign third group : - NDMM - ixazomib ( MLN9708 ) 4.0 mg + 300 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone - NDMM - ixazomib ( MLN9708 ) 4.0 mg + 400 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone - RRMM - ixazomib ( MLN9708 ) 4.0 mg + 300 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone The study enroll approximately 148 participant . This multi-centre trial conduct United States , European Union , Australia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each participant newly diagnose multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) must meet follow inclusion criterion enrol study : 1 . Adult male female participant 18 year age old confirm diagnosis symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) accord standard criterion . 2 . Participants cyclophosphamide dexamethasone treatment appropriate consider eligible highdose therapy ( HDT ) stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) 1 follow reason : The participant 65 year age old . The participant le 65 year age significant comorbid condition ( ) , opinion investigator , likely negative impact tolerability HDTSCT . Each participant relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) must meet follow inclusion criterion enrol study : 1 . Adult male female participant 18 year old confirm diagnosis symptomatic MM either currently time initial diagnosis , accord standard criterion , relapse and/or refractory disease 1 3 line prior therapy . A participant consider refractory disease disease progression occur treatment period within 60 day receive last dose give therapy . A line therapy define 1 cycle singleagent combination therapy sequence plan treatment induction therapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) maintenance therapy . 2 . No evidence graftversushost disease participant undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation . In addition , participant ( NDMM RRMM ) must meet remain criterion : 1 . Participants must measurable disease define least 1 follow 3 measurement : Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L ) . Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hour . Serum free light chain assay : involved free light chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL ( ≥ 100 mg/L ) , provide serum free light chain ratio abnormal . 2 . Participants must meet follow clinical laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm^3 platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^3 . Platelet transfusion help participant meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day prior administration study drug . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 x ULN . Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) ≥ 30 mL/min . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 4 .

( Periodic abstinence [ ie , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) , adhere treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention guideline cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . 5 . Male participant , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status postvasectomy ) , : agree practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 90 day last dose study drug , agree practice true abstinence period previously describe , line prefer usual lifestyle participant . ( Periodic abstinence [ eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method female partner ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) , adhere treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention guideline cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . 6 . Voluntary write consent must give performance studyrelated procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw participant time without prejudice future medical care . 7 . Suitable venous access studyrequired blood sampling . 8 . Is willing able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 1 . Prior treatment multiple myeloma either standard care treatment investigational regimen ( participant NDMM ) . NOTE : Prior treatment corticosteroid ( maximum dose corticosteroid exceed equivalent 160 mg dexamethasone 14 day . Localized radiation permit long therapeutic level administer least 14 day prior first dose study treatment . 2 . Diagnosis smolder MM , Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia , POEMS ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin change ) syndrome , plasma cell leukemia , primary amyloidosis , myelodysplastic syndrome , myeloproliferative syndrome . 3 . Central nervous system involvement . 4 . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 2 year first dose previously diagnose another malignancy evidence residual disease . Participants nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ type exclude undergone complete resection . 5 . Peripheral neuropathy Grade 1 pain Grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy cause clinical examination Screening period . 6 . Known gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance study drug , include difficulty swallowing . 7 .
