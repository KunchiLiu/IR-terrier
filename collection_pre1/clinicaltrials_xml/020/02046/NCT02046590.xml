	<brief_summary>There worldwide trend minimally invasive intervention , result increase number intervention perform outside operating room . Currently , approximately 12 15 % total anaesthetic workload non-operating room anaesthesia ( NORA ) anaesthetic activity increase . Many intervention need supplementary comfort measure relax patient high success rate . Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography ( ERCP ) perform &gt; 50,000 time per year U.S. , typical minimally invasive intervention need patient sedation . There controversy optimal comfort intervention minimally invasive intervention particular ERCP . Two different approach insure patient ' comfort propose : general anaesthesia endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation sedation spontaneous ventilation . Well-performed study sedation versus general anaesthesia use randomize controlled trial design observer blind contribute improve decision-making optimal comfort measure minimally invasive procedure . At knowledge randomize control trial report . The investigator hypothesize deep sedation without tracheal intubation achieve similar success rate ERCP general anaesthesia similar rate harmful postoperative effect . The primary aim trial demonstrate success rate ERCP inferior patient randomize deep sedation without orotracheal intubation v general anesthesia orotracheal intubation . Secondary aim include comparison randomization group patient safety , patient endoscopist satisfaction , duration patient recovery anesthesia procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>What may benefit general anaesthesia ? In one retrospective study 1000 patient , ERCP failure rate general anaesthesia half compare observed moderate sedation ( 7 % versus 14 % ) , failures result inadequate sedation . It also report complication rate associate therapeutic intervention ERCP may significantly lower general anaesthesia use , perhaps absence patient movement make procedure technically less difficult . When general anaesthesia administer ERCP , airway protected endotracheal intubation may decrease risk broncho-aspiration patient , although measure demonstrate effective patient risk digestive endoscopy . However , aspiration time in/ex-tubation well micro-aspiration contaminate upper airway secretion along leak defect tracheal cuff seal exclude standard endotracheal tube use . What may harm general anaesthesia ? Intubation extubation manoeuvre may prolong endoscopic room occupation time , post-anaesthesia care unit stay may longer 30 70 % patient suffer sore throat ( reduced lidocaine use ) . Furthermore , orotracheal intubation may induce short time hemodynamic change relate laryngoscopy . What may benefit deep sedation ? The main advantage sedation probably faster turnover intervention room . In sole practice survey anesthesiologists endoscopy available , 81 % anaesthesiologists state use sedation , general anesthesia , ERCP . Deep sedation propofol digestive endoscopy show superior moderate sedation combination benzodiazepine plus opioid many aspect , include well patient cooperation , short recovery time lower number desaturation event . In Switzerland , sedation ERCP obtain use benzodiazepine propofol similar proportion case , propofol use , administered endoscopist nurse two third case anaesthesiologist one third case . Evidence prospective study suggest complex procedure , include therapeutic ERCP , may perform safely deep sedation without tracheal intubation use propofol , even high-risk patient . What may harm deep sedation ? In large study include nearly 10'000 patient , adverse event observe 1.4 % patient sedate use propofol . In study , adverse event define premature termination procedure due sedation-related event ( often relate hypoxemia ) need assist ventilation , rarely , admission intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
