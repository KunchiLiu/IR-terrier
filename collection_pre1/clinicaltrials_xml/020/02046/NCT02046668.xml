	<brief_summary>This pilot study obtain preliminary evidence base sample size calculation future trial whether spironolactone ( aldosterone blocker ) reduce knee pain old people symptomatic OA knee give addition usual analgesia . Aldosterone known pro-inflammatory , spironolactone suppresses cytokine production chronic arthritis . This application build previous work applicant show spironolactone significantly improve quality life ( particularly pain ) frail old people . The investigator recruit 86 people ( age 70 year ) well-defined OA knee 25mg spironolactone daily match placebo 12 week . The primary outcome group difference change WOMAC pain sub-score 12 week . Secondary outcome WOMAC stiffness physical function subscales health relate quality life ( EQ-5D ) . Morning cortisol level measure assess effect mineralocorticoid receptor blockade glucocorticoid level , may mediate anti-inflammatory effect spironolactone ; urinary CTX-II , serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 ( MMP-3 ) measure biomarkers sensitive effect pharmacological intervention osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>

Symptomatic idiopathic OA knee accord American College Rheumatology clinical radiographic criterion ( ie Knee pain without crepitus presence osteophytes x ray ) 5 . To avoid floor effect , participant require moderate ( severe ) pain screen least 2 5 WOMAC pain score item 6 . To receipt ( prescription or/and counter ) one analgesic agent therapeutic dose least 2 month 7 . Willing knee xray one take precede 12 month 1 . Clinical diagnosis symptomatic heart failure 2 . History inflammatory arthritis 3 . Already take spironolactone 4 . Previous intolerance spironolactone 5 . Known allergy spironolactone lactose 6 . Objection take capsule make animal source gelatine 7 . Taking oral NSAIDs ( increase risk renal impairment combine spironolactone ) 8 . Taking ACE inhibitor ARBs ( angiotensin II receptor antagonist ) . ARBs many property similar ACE inhibitor . Both exclusion increase risk acute kidney injury hyperkalaemia , previous study also exclude ACE inhibitor ( ARBs ) treatment safe well tolerate . 9 .
