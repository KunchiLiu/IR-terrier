	<detailed_description>The investigator prospectively enroll 130 adult receive colonoscopy examination Jan 1 , 2014 June 30 , 2014 . Written Inform consent achieve colonoscopy . All patient randomly assign group A group B . The group A name `` set colon cleanse room group '' . The group B name `` standard colon preparation group '' . The randomization do study nurse well trained teach course bowel cleanse level evaluation , low residual diet education preparation method . Demographic data collect questionnaire colonoscopy . Diet restriction two day low residual diet well educate detail checklist . All patient receive brief counsel session . The investigator outline colon preparation instruction . The investigator also explain rationale colon preparation complete checklist picture colon cleanse assessment . All patient group B initiate standard colon preparation PEG-ELS make two sachet PEG ( Klean-PrepTM , Norgine Ltd. Harefield , Middlesex , United Kingdom ) dissolve 2 L water 8:00 AM day colonoscopy . All patient group A drink two liter PEG-ELS colon cleanse room in-hospital setting colon preparation 8:00 AM day colonoscopy . The time interval group colon preparation colonoscopy 3 5 hour . All colonoscopy perform two endoscopists Jin-Shan Branch Hospital Olympus CF-260AL colonoscope ( Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) . All endoscopists train National Taiwan University Hospital least eight hundred colonoscopy experience . The endoscopist follow standard protocol insert , withdraw observation . Intramuscular injection hyoscine butylbromide do antispasmodic contraindication . Complete colonoscopy define reach take picture cecum . Endoscopists take picture every anatomical portion colon include cecum , ascend colon , transverse colon , descend colon , sigmoid colon rectum fecal material wash . Theendoscopist also record colonoscopy examination video file . All colonoscopists ask take least thirty picture whole colonoscopy examination . Colon cleanse quality score Boston Bowel Preparation Quality Scale . The scale apply colon segment include right colon ( R ) , middle colon ( T ) rectosigmoid colon ( L ) . The score calculate add 0 3 rating colon section . Electronic file endoscopic picture without lesion presentation edit videos review endoscopist . All detect adenoma study group record store electronic file video include location , size , morphology endoscopic diagnosis . The primary endpoint study compare Boston Bowel Preparation Quality Scale two study group . The secondary endpoint compare average number adenoma detection two study group . Sample size estimate average number adenoma detect ( 1.0 lesion per subject standard preparation group , SD 1.0 1.5 lesion per subject hospital preparation group , SD 1.0 ) accord previous study National Taiwan University Hospital pilot study National Taiwan University Hospital , Jin Shan Branch , 80 % power enrol 65 subject group achieve ( test , Î± error 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
