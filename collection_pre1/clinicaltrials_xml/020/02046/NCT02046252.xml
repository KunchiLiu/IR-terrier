Participants randomize treatment condition , receive naloxone challenge , pas prescribe oral naltrexone oral placebo implant/implant placebo ) , give schedule addiction counsel HIV treatment appointment . A 2-week supply oral medication provide bi-weekly counseling session , re-implanted week 12 , 24 , 36 . Only research pharmacist know group assignment , however blind broken case emergency . The primary outcome measure compare implant naltrexone versus oral naltrexone ability achieve viral load &lt; 400 copy week 24 48 . Secondary outcome compare efficacy two addiction treatment ; study adherence antiretroviral therapy ; evaluate time relapse number day relapse ; evaluate decline CD4 count ; evaluate HIV risk behavior ; evaluate opioid positive urine test ; evaluate number day patient keep scheduled appointment .
