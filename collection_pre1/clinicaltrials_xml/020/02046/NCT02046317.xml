	<brief_summary>For bone fracture injury , particularly femur fracture , femoral nerve block ( FNB ) provide fast effective mean control pain . However , method always employ due fact position needle therefore block time consume challenging , precisely place , nerve block result poor pain control . Traditional method nerve blockade include blind technique use peripheral nerve stimulator ( PNS ) . Unfortunately , neither method provide reliable guide needle placement lead intraneural placement and/or fail attempt . Hypothesis : When ultrasound technology implement procedure may improve success rate compare technique provide real-time visual guidance . This may result fast prolong pain relief reduce amount analgesic need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Femoral Nerve Block Isolated Femur Fracture Using Echo Friendly Needles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , publish information regard ultrasound guide femoral block use echo friendly needle limit . More , even less information regard ultrasound guide nerve block use echogenic versus standard care needle . This study hop add general knowledge pain management ED set provide unique perspective ultrasound guide technique use echogenic needle enhance accuracy success rate nerve block ED patient . Results study compare result similar study see finding comparative relevant factor . The study design two comparative arm ; arm use local anesthetic Bupivacaine 0.25 % epinephrine ; case total 15 ml inject around femoral nerve . Once identify ultrasound 5 ml injected lateral , medial posterior aspect nerve . The experimental arm , receive FNB use echogenic needle ; control group receive FNB use standard care needle .</detailed_description>
