	<brief_summary>Cell saver routinely use hospital off-pump coronary artery bypass graft retrieve wash blood lose operation . This wash blood retransfused patient order prevent allogeneic blood transfusion . However , little known rheologic property oxygen transport capacity wash red blood cell effect retransfusion blood microcirculatory blood flow organ damage patient . For cell saver 3 different operate principle exist . The common one use discontinuous blood wash spin bowl intermittently fill blood , process empty . A second one use continuous blood wash principle rotational disk . A third one intermediate use feature discontinuous bowl technology continuous rotational disc technology . The investigator hypothesize operate principle effect rheologic property oxygen transport capacity wash blood . Previous research suggest particular deformability oxygen carrier property red blood cell affect . As consequence , red blood cell may block small blood vessel , affect microcirculatory blood flow tissue oxygenation . This may lead organ damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cell saver routinely use hospital off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( OPCABG ) retrieve wash blood lose operation . This wash blood retransfused patient order prevent allogeneic blood transfusion . For cell saver 3 different operate principle exist . The common type use discontinuous blood processing spin bowl intermittently fill blood , process empty . A second type use continuous blood processing principle rotational disk . A third one intermediate use feature discontinuous bowl technology continuous rotational disc technology . In types autotransfusion system wind blood washed , concentrate stored blood conservation bag . In several study hemoglobin level , leucocyte platelet count wash cell saver blood measure , indicate difference type cell save . In study biochemical marker inflammation wash cell saver blood measure , also indicate difference type cell save . Recently , blood bank blood end shelf life wash use similar device propose study . The investigated device remove substance blood differently . However , rheologic property red blood cell assess . Despite widespread clinical use cell saver , little therefore know rheologic property oxygen transport capacity wash red blood cell . As process wash blood cell occur high centrifugal load , concern elasticity deformability process red blood cell . Ultrastructural change cell saver wash red blood cell demonstrate use scan electron microscopy suggest poor performance cell microcirculation . Using continuous type cell saver , previously could demonstrate reduction deformability 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate ( DPG ) level process blood cell . The implication microcirculatory blood flow may obstruct blockage small blood vessel , 2,3-DPG regulates oxygen transfer , tissue oxygenation may also hamper . However , moment effect retransfusion wash cell saver blood microcirculatory blood flow tissue oxygenation patient unknown . Thus , study investigator want determine vitro rheologic property oxygen transport capacity wash blood process one 3 different type cell saving ( discontinuous , continuous mixed ) measure vivo retransfusion process blood patient effect microcirculatory blood flow , tissue oxygenation organ damage use organ specific biomarkers .</detailed_description>
