	<brief_summary>Highest treatment efficacy patient refractory myeloma may achieve regimen combine novel agent alkylating agent . However , apply approach patient substantial risk critical myelosuppression . Pomalidomide demonstrate significant activity combination Dexamethasone relapse refractory multiple myeloma . This trial attempt improve efficacy Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone well balance efficacy toxicity . Integration Cyclophosphamide treatment case suboptimal response first evidence progressive disease aim significantly increase duration treatment positive impact PFS . It furthermore attempt optimize potential Pomalidomide antimyeloma efficacy . Based recent finding , myeloma disease wide clonal heterogeneity , combination treatment case suboptimal myeloma control might lead effective suppression especially aggressive subclones might reduce early resistance . In addition , goal keep individual patient long possible effective IMiD treatment , potential drug might optimize accord current view maintenance treatment result ideally outgrowth indolent clone bone marrow niche .</brief_summary>
