	<detailed_description>Due several promote factor related physiological immaturity gastro-intestinal tract , gastro-esophageal reflux ( GER ) frequent condition among preterm infant . GER clinical presentation may vary within wide range symptom , vomit , regurgitation cardiorespiratory event , apnoeas bradycardia , common preterm population . Particularly , apneic episode inversely related gestational age ( GA ) might associate pathological event hypoxia , hypercapnia pressure variability , seem negatively affect long-term neurological development preterm baby . Combined pH multiple intraluminal impedance ( pH-MII ) currently consider best choice GER diagnosis preterm infant . While pH monitoring limited detection acid reflux , combine pH-MII effectively identify acid non-acid GER , predominant preterm baby . Moreover , thanks multichannel probe , combine pH-MII allows evaluate height reach refluxate within esophageal lumen distinguish retrograde fluid bolus movement ( reflux ) anterograde one ( swallow ) . In last decade , GER pharmacological treatment increasingly widespread NICUs . The provision anti-histamine2 ( H2 ) blocker proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) preterm population , however , might lead adverse effect increase incidence necrotizing enterocolitis infection . Hence , avoid useless potentially harmful pharmacological overtreatment , step-wise approach , firstly promote conservative strategy , currently consider advisable choice GER management symptomatic preterm infant . Postural dietetic intervention represent common conservative strategy efficacy improve GER symptom feature largely investigated . As assessed previous pH-MII study , prone left-side position effective right-side supine one determine significant improvement acid non-acid GER feature . Feed thicken widely employ reduce vomit regurgitation symptomatic term infant ; regard preterm population , however , little data currently available . We previously investigate efficacy thicken fortified human milk preterm infant suffer GER symptom ( frequent regurgitation , desaturations , bradycardia ) , observe benefit . Furthermore , standard human milk fortification show increase GER frequency preterm infant . With regard anti-regurgitation ( AR ) formula , recently evaluate effectiveness specific AR formula , thicken amylopectin specifically tailored preterm infant ' nutritional need ; test thicken formula effectively reduce number acid GERs , difference observe frequency non-acid GERs mean esophageal acid exposure , know main determinant development gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Thus , accord preliminary data , feed thicken seem almost ineffective improving GER symptoms feature preterm infant . Non-nutritive sucking ( NNS ) part routine neonatal care , widely apply NICU setting . NNS show positively influence gastric secretion , gut motility improve digestive process . NICU hospitalization need respiratory support , however , might delay transition tube feed full oral feeding , thereby increase length hospital stay negatively affect mother-neonate relationship . Over two decade ago , meta-analysis Schwartz et al . show beneficial effect NNS reduce time attain full oral feed well length hospitalization . These result confirm recent review Harding . The role NNS GER , however , yet clarify . It previously show swallow enhances occurrence low oesophageal sphincter relaxation , know represent trigger stimulus reflux episode . On hand , act swallow appear promote esophageal clearance refluxate ; hence , possible influence NNS GER might hypothesize . In pH-metric study , perform Orenstein et al . infant young 6 month , NNS seem worsen effect GER apply prone posture , whereas seat position associate ameliorative outcome ; controversial result , however , extend preterm population . To date , efficacy NNS mean pacifier preterm infant symptomatic GER preliminary evaluate Zhao et al. , report improvement overall GER feature ( number reflux , reflux index , total time pH &lt; 4 ) fast time gastric empty NNS group . However , study perform pH monitoring , effect NNS non-acid GER evaluate yet . Due buffer effect milk feed gastric pH , acidity gastric juice GA-dependent , non-acid GERs represent major percentage ( 70 % ) overall reflux episode preterm population . Moreover , recently observe , non-acid reflux main responsible occurrence GER-related apnea . Hence , beneficial effect GER-related apnea subsequent hypoxic episode , potentially harmful preterm infant , could supply conservative strategy effective decrease non-acid GERs feature . The primary aim observational , prospective , exploratory study evaluate effect NNS GER pH-MII feature preterm infant ( GA ≤32 week ) symptomatic GER ( i.e . suffer frequent regurgitation , feed difficulty , failure thrive and/or post-prandial desaturations ) 24-hour pH-MII monitoring GER diagnostic evaluation schedule . The secondary aim study ass , mean simultaneous non-invasive 6-hour polysomnographic recording , effect NNS total , central , obstructive , mixed apneas cardiorespiratory event within subgroup patient recurrent desaturations . Overall thirty preterm infant ( GA ≤32 week ) enrol suffer moderate/severe GER symptom diagnostic 24-hour pH-MII monitoring schedule evaluate GER feature , accord clinical practice . During 24-h pH-MII monitoring infant receive eight meal , four follow NNS treatment pacifier . The sequence NNS application consecutively alternate study participant . For evaluation , minimum 2 hour NNS post-prandial treatment require . The healthcare assistant ( i.e . medical staff nurse ) inspect correct application NNS , record effective time pacifier usage regularly check pacifier position relation pH-MII probe polysomnographic flow sensor , avoid possible interference . Due immaturity , enrol patient might show ineffective sucking , potentially lose pacifier . In case , healthcare assistant offer pacifier baby maximum four time postprandial period ; measure fix pacifier avoid . The pH-MII device use study ( Comfortec pH-MII Sandhill Scientific ) nasogastric probe seven ring , compose six dipolar impedance channel one antimony electrode responsible pH detection place middle distal impedance dipole . Due characteristic , pH-MII able measure esophageal height reach refluxate identify direction esophageal bolus movement , thereby distinguish retrograde flow ( reflux ) anti-retrograde flow ( swallow ) . Esophageal probe length determine use Strobel 's formula : [ baby length ( cm ) x 0.252 + 5 ) ] - 13 % . Impedance monitoring detects GER episode ( MII-GER ) sequential drop impedance value less 50 % baseline , start distally propagate retrogradely least next two proximal measure segment ( 4.5 cm low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) ) . A GER episode define acid non-acid accord pH : MII episodes pH low 4 defined acid MII-GERs , whereas MII episode pH≥4 define non-acid MII-GERs . GERs migration height maximum distance LES reach esophageal refluxate . An acid GER episode record pH monitoring pH drop le 4 ; detect pH sensor , pH drop last least 5 s. The total percent time esophageal exposure pH &lt; 4 name Reflux Index ( RIpH ) . Data pH-MII record automatically acquire portable Sleuth Sandhill Scientific system store personal computer contain specific software ( BioVIEW Analysis Sandhill Scientific , version 5.0.9 ) . Data analysis perform aforementioned software confirm direct visual evaluation . In subgroup patient recurrent desaturations , simultaneous non-invasive 6-hour polysomnographic monitoring , comprehensive two meal ( one follow NNS ) , perform evaluate possible effect NNS apneic episode ( total , central , obstructive , mixed ) cardiorespiratory event . The polysomnographic device use study ( System Plus , Micromed , Mogliano Veneto , Italy ) measure oral/nasal airflow flow transducer place nostril , whereas abdominal movement detect band place around abdomen connect respiratory inductance plethysmography . Each oral/nasal flow cessation ≥5 second consider apneic episode ; apnea classify central ( CA : absence oral/nasal flow movement abdominal wall ) , obstructive ( OA : abdominal movement inadequate oral/nasal flow ) mixed ( MA : component CA OA ) . Apneas include periodic breathe patter rule analysis . Systemic oxygen saturation record mean pulse oximeter sensor , place infant 's foot . Cardiorespiratory event characterize hypoxic episode , define occurrence SatO2 &lt; 80 % , and/or bradycardia , define pulse rate &lt; 100 bpm . The polysomnographic record automatically acquire computer connect polysomnographic device . The number total apneas , CA , OA , MA cardiorespiratory event trace visually analyze sub-investigators . Statistical analysis perform SPSS 20 ( Statistical Package Social Sciences , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) Windows . Differences NNS control period term GER frequency feature , number apneic bradycardic episode test Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test . The level significance set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
