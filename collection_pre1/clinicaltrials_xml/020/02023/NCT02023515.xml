	<detailed_description>The investigator 's long-term goal contribute development empirically-based , clinically-useful weight loss weight maintenance intervention . The objective application obtain proof feasibility weight loss maintenance intervention address underlying issue stress , effective approach long-term weight loss maintenance . The central hypothesis application weight management intervention utilize stress management skill produce weight loss significant improvement stress metabolic syndrome biomarkers 10 20 week follow-up . This hypothesis formulate base upon data show stress associate increase risk obesity small study show method stress management produce long-term weight loss maintenance decrease depression stress . The rationale propose study proof feasibility intervention enable subsequent definitive study R01 level . If , however , investigator unexpectedly disprove concept , result would also valuable would lead investigator shift focus redistribute resource accordingly . To test central hypothesis , thereby accomplish objective application , follow specific aim pursue : 1 . Compare stress management base program standard behavioral weight loss program weight loss cost-effectiveness . The approach involve two different intervention group . Group 1 ( control ) receive standard behavioral weight loss program . Group 2 receive stress management base intervention build research neuroscience principle attachment theory . 2 . Determine secondary outcome intervention , include stress measure salivary cortisol telomere length ; depression , disorder eating pattern , dietary intake , physical activity . It hypothesize Group 2 show great improvement secondary outcomes 10 20 week follow-up Group 1 . 3 . Establish proof concept decrease stress variable associate improvement weight stress-related psychological variable . At completion study , investigator expect determine type intervention produce great weight loss community sample 10 20 week follow-up . The investigator also determine impact two intervention secondary outcome , include stress measure salivary cortisol telomere length ; depression , disorder eating pattern , dietary intake , physical activity .</detailed_description>
