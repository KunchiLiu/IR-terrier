	<brief_title>Long-term Safety Efficacy Follow-up Study PNEUMOSTEM® Patients Who Completed PNEUMOSTEM® Phase-I Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) common cause death prematurely born baby low birth weight . In addition , many child recover disease suffer various complication prolong hospitalization , pulmonary hypertension , failure thrive . It report bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSC ) differentiate pulmonary epithelial pulmonary endothelial cell . Some animal study show BM-MSCs differentiate bronchial cell type 2 pneumocytes rat pneumonia improve fibrosis occur administration bleomycin . Based finding , consider mesenchymal stem cell therapy help regenerate damage lung well BPD cause lung inflammation , fibrosis , deficiency type 2 pneumocytes , . PNEUMOSTEM® consist human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell intend treat BPD premature infant . The purpose study evaluate 3-5 year long term safety efficacy patient complete earlier part phase I clinical trial PNEUMOSTEM® .</detailed_description>
