	<brief_summary>Objective : The primary objective study comparison protein concentration patient stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) healthy control . Aim : This pilot study aim determine possible altered protein profile woman suffer SUI , compare healthy woman therefore discriminate potential protein biomarker SUI . Main outcome measure : mass spectrometric measure urinary proteomic secretome diseased healthy subject ( sequence coverage number identify protein ) Trial design : Prospective case- control study Setting : Department Gynecology Obstetrics Medical University Vienna co- operation Core Facilities Proteomics Medical University Vienna Population : Twenty female patient SUI twenty healthy patient attend outpatient clinic Department Obstetrics Gynaecology , Medical University Vienna ( sample size calculation FDR 0.05 , power 80 % , assumed proportion true H0 0.95 , assume standardized effect size 1 ) Methods : Examinations carry : patient history , provocative stress test , ICIQ short form questionnaire , residual urine volume ( ultrasound ) urine analysis ( dipstick testing ) . A urine sample obtain patient spontaneous micturition , protease inhibitor add immediately . Two serum blood vial ( 9ml ) take peripheral vein patient routine laboratory research . Proteomics analysis perform use chromatographic separation ( LC ) mass spectrometric detection ( MS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : Sample preparation analysis include : 1 . Sample collection immediate addition protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ) . 2 . Urine centrifugation filtration removal cell debris . 3 . Protein precipitation apply methanol/chloroform separation removal possible non-proteinic substance . 4 . Protein digestion apply in-solution trypsin , pepsin , Glu-C. 5 . Peptide separation use nano HPLC different chromatographic approach . 1 . Reversed phase ( RP ) separation peptide MS detection 2 . Separation peptide use HILIC ( hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography ) discrimination polar peptide . 3 . In addition RP HILIC directly couple MS , digest peptide separate use multidimensional approach . Weak anion exchange column operate HILIC condition use separate peptide carry posttranslational modification phosphorylation acetylation , thus , increase dynamic range detection . During separation , fraction collect re-injected onto RP HILIC MS detection . 4 . All nano HPLC separation perform use biocompatible separation system . Mass spectrometric analysis digest peptide perform use two different detection method : ion-trap time-of-flight ( qToF ) MS. qToF mass spectrometric detection analysis also use label-free quantitation peptide protein detect sample . All measurement perform triplicate provide correction technical variability separation ionization . General database search perform use Human SwissProt Database actual version time analysis . Data search perform use Mascot ( http : //www.matrixscience.com/ ) X ! Tandem ( http : //www.thegpm.org/tandem/ ) search machine , final data allocation filter use Scaffold ( www.proteomsoftware.com ) . Statistical analysis : Data analysis conduct bioconductor package limma . Before data analysis , data filter exclude protein measurement low interquartile range . Groups compare moderate paired t-statistics adjust age . Adjustment multiple test do Benjamini-Hochberg correction control FDR 0.05 .</detailed_description>
