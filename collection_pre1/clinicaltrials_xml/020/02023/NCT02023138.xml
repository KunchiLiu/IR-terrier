	<brief_summary>There lack evidence best method involve patient population ( IPP ) clinical practice guideline ( CPG ) development . The goal pilot study document acceptability , feasibility effectiveness two method implication patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) CPG development . Method : A single blind , randomize crossover trial perform patient TBI . Participants : A convenience sample 20 patient ) moderate-to-severe TBI ( Glascow Coma Scale &lt; 13 ) , b ) live TBI two four year , c ) French-speaking , ) able use computer e ) able participate two-hour group meeting recruit among member Associations TCC Des Deux Rives . Procedures : The patient first receive in-person training guideline IPP . They randomize Group 1 Group 2 researcher blind experimentation . They experiment either group discussion ( control intervention ) Wiki ( experimental intervention ) . Phase 1 : A week training , Group 1 participant invited discussion group animate experimented moderator , ask discuss CPG recommendation choose research team exist CPG . The participant ask : 1 ) opinion recommendation ; 2 ) preference regard recommendation ; 3 ) modification , correction addition bring recommendation . In mean time , Group 2 participant receive email present link Wiki . They invite answer three question Group 1 , use Wiki platform . The patient week interact answer question ; recall could send email require . At end Phase 1 , participant group fill questionnaire document acceptability method experiment . Phase 2 : As per crossover design , Group 1 participant assign Wiki intervention Group 2 participant assigned discussion group intervention . The procedure repeat second recommendation . At end Phase 2 , patient ask answer short survey validate preference two method . Tools : The acceptability method evaluate questionnaire adapt Sidani al . validate three TBI individual . The feasibility intervention evaluate use ) number participant reach group Wiki , b ) number participant complete intervention c ) number support intervention require group Wiki . The effectiveness two method evaluate submit adapted recommendation panel expert clinicians evaluator blind methodology recommendation adaptation . They invite rate clarity , accuracy , appropriateness usefulness recommendation . Analysis : Feasibility indicator report use descriptive statistic . Within-subject analysis use non-parametric statistic perform assess acceptability two method . AC1 coefficient raters ' agreement calculate expert evaluation score , effectiveness method compare use appropriate non parametric statistic . Impact : This pilot trial first one evaluate methodology involve disabled individual CPG development .</brief_summary>
