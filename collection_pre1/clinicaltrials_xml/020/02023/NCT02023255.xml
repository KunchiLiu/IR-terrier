	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics JNJ-39393406 Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo-controlled ( study inactive substance give one group participant , study medication give another group ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , multiple ascend dose ( participant receive multiple dos study medication dose level subsequently escalate group ) study . This study consist screen phase ( 21 2 day prior dose administration ) , double-blind treatment phase ( Part A - 7 day Part B - 13 day ) , follow-up phase ( within 7 14 day last dose administration ) . In Part A multiple ascend dose study approximately 40 young healthy male participant randomly allocate 5 cohort ( group individual similar characteristic ) receive single daily dos either JNJ-39393406 placebo 7 consecutive day . After dose level , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile ( explore body medication ) dose level evaluate next dose level escalate consider safety tolerability data . In Part B study approximately 48 elderly healthy male female participant randomly allocate A , B , C cohorts receive single daily dos either JNJ-39393406 placebo 13 consecutive day . Dose level Part B select base PK data Part A . In Part A Part B study dose level increase acceptable safety tolerability data obtain . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , 24-hour creatinine clearance , Holter monitoring , telemetry , electrocardiogram , vital sign , physical examination , neurological examination . The study duration participant approximately 8 week .</detailed_description>
