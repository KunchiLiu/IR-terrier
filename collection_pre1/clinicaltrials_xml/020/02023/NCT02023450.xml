	<brief_summary>Study Rationale : There recent evidence HIV protease inhibitor ( HIV-PI ) improve pulmonary hemodynamics experimental model pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . There also experimental evidence TLR4 high mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1 ) participate pathogenesis experimental pulmonary hypertension . A recent high throughput screen inhibitor HMGB1 induce macrophage activation yield HIV-protease inhibitor ( PIs ) potent inhibitor HMGB1 induce cytokine production . Based experimental evidence propose trial determine whether HIV-PIs alter pathobiology PAH . Study Objectives : The main objective study determine whether saquinavir ritonavir ( SQV+RIT ) well-characterized safety profile human reduce bio marker inflammation pulmonary artery pressure patient PAH . Study Hypothesis : We hypothesize HIV-PI , SQV+RIT , reduce circulate parameter inflammation include HMGB1 , IL1-beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , TNF-alpha CRP . Our end point change parameter baseline duration study.We hypothesize treatment SQV+RIT reduce pulmonary artery ( PA ) pressure patient PAH measure echocardiography . Study Design : This single center open label phase 0 study evaluate effect SQV +RIT patient IPAH . Subjects IPAH ( N=20 ) enrol study , divide 3 cohort entail administration HIV protease inhibitor three dos . The first cohort ( n=3 ) receive start dose SQV 0.3 mg/kg twice daily combination RIT 0.03 mg/kg twice daily . If first dose well-tolerated , second cohort ( n= 3 ) IPAH give dos SQV 3 mg/kg RIT 0.3 mg/kg twice daily . If second dose well-tolerated , last cohort ( n= 14 ) IPAH give dos SQV 15 mg/kg RIT 1.5 mg/kg twice daily .</brief_summary>
