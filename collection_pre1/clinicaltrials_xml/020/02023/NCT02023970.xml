	<brief_summary>Cardiac valve disorder widely spread general population represent third frequent cardiovascular illness coronary disease arterial hypertension . In context , aortic valve stenosis ( central pathology project ) common form valve disease . Cardiac valve replacement vast majority case first line therapy degenerative heart-valve disease . These represent mechanical bioprosthetic valve ( BHV ) . In vast majority case , BHV derive animal biological standpoint classify xenograft . BHV severely penalise premature structural damage , ultimate valve failure occur around 10 year surgery 5 30 % case , depend type BHV use . Several factor [ include dyslipidaemia , gender , valve position ] may contribute ultimate failure BHV increase evidence recently substantial immune reaction elicit implanted BHV . This immune response still poorly understood . It may lead adverse immune reaction thoroughly investigate TRANSLINK team . In light , TRANSLINK project aim provide necessary data demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt central role anti-BHV immune response premature failure BHV provide efficient strategy enable safe implantation BHV valves currently unsuitable candidate</brief_summary>

Fifty patient per type BHV include . When 50 patient include one eight group , stop inclusion group . Additionally , control group heart operate patient without biological valve include study ( patient operate mechanical valve ( n=50 ) CABG without BHV ( n=50 ) .
