	<brief_title>Open-Label , Dose-Escalating Study Assessing Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy , RP103 Mitochondrial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-escalation study ass safety , tolerability , efficacy , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-release Capsules ( RP103 ) treatment child inherit mitochondrial disease . Patients inherited mitochondrial disease associate nuclear mitochondrial DNA mutation impair respiratory chain . These include , limited follow clinical syndrome : Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy ragged-red fiber ( MERFF ) ; mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , strokelike syndrome ( MELAS ) ; KearnSayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy ( Leigh Syndrome ) ; POLGrelated disorder ( Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome , Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia , Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia , Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders , Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia , POLGRelated Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders ) ; Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome ( MNGIE ) , also call myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome POLIP syndrome; others , e.g. , mitochondrial cardiomyopathy syndrome due multiple mitochondrial DNA deletion . Prior treatment , patient undergo Screening Visit . If eligible , subject return Day 1 study visit begin RP103 dose day . Every 2 week subsequent 8 week , subject alternate return clinic detailed assessment ( Weeks 4 8 ) receive telephone call Investigator team ass safety RP103 dose ( Weeks 2 6 ) potential need immediate unscheduled study visit . Thereafter , subject continue return clinic every 4 week detailed assessment Weeks 12 , 16 , 20 24 ( Study Exit visit ) . The Week 24 visit Study Exit visit ( i.e . single visit rather two separate one ) subject elect continue RP103-MITO-002 ( NCT02473445 ) extension study , study IRB approve site subject continue extension study . If extension study yet IRB approve time subject reach Week 24 , subject elect continue RP103 , Study Exit visit take place later separately Week 24 visit . The extension study continue result present RP103-MITO-001 study know .</detailed_description>

Sterile male partner ( vasectomy perform least 6 month prior study ) . 9 . Subjects 's legally authorize representative must provide write informed consent ; Subject must provide assent , require local/institutional requirement 10 . Have mitochondrial myopathy evidence one follow criterion : 1 . Weakness consistent myopathy ( e.g . accompany muscle waste and/or absence neuropathy ) physical exam 2 . OR document myopathy basis muscle biopsy consistent mitochondrial myopathy disease 3 . OR weakness and/or progressive exercise intolerance ( modest exercise typically provoke heaviness , weakness , ache active muscle , tachycardia ) . Weakness due myopathy neuropathy cause deem investigator 1 . Documented diagnosis concurrent inborn error metabolism 2 . Nonelective hospitalization relative mitochondrial disease direct complication disease within 60 day prior Screening Visit . 3 .
