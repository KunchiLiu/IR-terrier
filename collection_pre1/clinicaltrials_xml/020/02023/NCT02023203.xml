	<brief_summary>Inguinal hernia repair one commonly perform surgery around world . It account approximately 75 % abdominal wall hernia present lifetime risk 27 % male 3 % female . Since modern concept surgical hernia repair describe Bassini 1887 , technique bear name , several technique develop last century order improve surgical outcome inguinal hernia repair . Different open repair , anterior ( Shouldice , McVay ) posterior ( Stoppa ) approach describe developed , Lichtenstein describe tension-free hernioplasty concept support use prosthetic mesh repair hernia defect . Notable Improvements observe technique term recurrence , pain , discomfort comparison previous tension repair . Considerable advantage open repair obtain introduction minimally invasive surgery inguinal hernia repair , term patient comfort recurrence rate . Regarding prosthetic material , mesh evolve since first Dacron mesh use Lichtenstein . First generation mesh manufacture use material reason describe heavyweight mesh . New generation mesh design less material order diminish inflammatory response foreign body reaction , provide less chronic pain similar recurrence rate heavyweight mesh . The density ( weight ) mesh , measure g/m2 , inversely proportional size pore lately report one main aspect relate prosthetic material pore size . Large pore mesh use less material , consequently associate well tissue ingrowth . The large pore lightweight mesh condition less amount material use . All previous study compare light heavyweight polypropylene mesh But order get proper comparison behavior mesh inguinal region important include material pore size . The aim study compare patient-reported outcome use either Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) large pore mesh ( LP-PTFE ) v small pore polypropylene mesh ( SP-PPL ) .</brief_summary>
