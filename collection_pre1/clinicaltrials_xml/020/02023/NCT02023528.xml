	<brief_summary>Based Medicare data , 5-year survival dialysis patient 39 % . This low stage IIIB breast cancer ( 54 % 5-year survival ) . The annual mortality dialysis patient ~ 23 % compare &lt; 0.1 % United States general population . Even kidney transplant recipient substantially high mortality ( ~7 % ) compare general population . Consequently , life-expectancy dialysis transplant population much low general population . Cardiovascular event lead cause death dialysis patient malnutrition also strong risk factor death . The current proposal develop prospective registry incident dialysis patient University Utah dialysis program examine cardiovascular nutritional factor dialysis patient . This registry include clinical administrative data . In addition , blood sample store future analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This prospective , observational study patient University Utah dialysis program . Study Procedures : Patients new dialysis University Utah dialysis program approach determine whether want participate registry . If interested , study purpose procedure explain informed consent obtain . Participants ask complete brief questionnaire demographic ( age , gender , race , education ) , co-morbid condition ( diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , hypertension , chronic lung disease , malignancy , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease peripheral vascular disease ) , physical activity level , cognitive function sleep pattern . Height , weight , waist circumference measure . Annual follow visit conduct patient 5th annual follow-up , death , transplantation loss follow-up . During visit , participant complete questionnaire physical activity level , cognitive function sleep pattern . Height , weight , waist circumference measure . Thirty milliliter ( ml ) blood also draw . Relevant Dialysis data ( cause duration kidney disease , duration dialytic therapy , duration frequency dialysis session , type dialyzer use , type vascular access ) , medication ( erythropoietin dose route administration , iron supplement ) , laboratory marker ( hemoglobin , serum calcium , serum intact parathyroid hormone , serum phosphorous , white blood cell count differential neutrophil lymphocyte count urea reduction rate ) obtain electronic medical record . 30 ml blood drawn dialysis day dialysis . Serum/ plasma separate . DNA extract rest cell baseline visit store . The sample store freezer future analysis . Participants longitudinally follow use dialysis unit electronic medical record annual follow visit . In addition , participant consent , Medicare follow-up data United States Renal Data System ( USRDS ) obtain . The USRDS national registry dialysis patient . U.S. Medicare regulation stipulate irrespective insurance status , patient start chronic dialysis therapy must report USRDS . The outcomes patient track USRDS use Medicare database national Vital Statistics ( maintain National Center Health Statistics ) .</detailed_description>
