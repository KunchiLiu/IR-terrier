	<brief_summary>A pilot study design determine ( primary objective ) three brief intervention three oral BSE regimens alter mRNA biomarkers Nrf2 pathway signal , include NQO1 , GSTs AKRs , oral mucosa healthy subject . Quantitative distribution data preliminary effect size specific Nrf2 target , measure serial buccal cell scraping , determine course 3-day exposure three BSE regimen . These data inform design randomize , phase II chemoprevention trial patient HPV-negative HNSCC . Ten healthy volunteer recruit pilot study , Age ≥ 18 year , male female : 1 ) The non-cancer population present University Pittsburgh Eye Ear Institute Hillman Cancer Center . This may include patient benign disease friends/family member , friends/family member patient cancer ; 2 ) Professionals , staff , student University Pittsburgh .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intervention 1 , GRR-BSE If eligible , participant may undergo baseline visit procedure immediately follow screen visit ( day ) . If necessary logistical purpose , participant may return baseline visit initiation first BSE intervention time 14 day follow eligibility assessment . At baseline visit ( day 1 ) , participant undergo baseline blood buccal cell collection . Blood collection perform trained phlebotomist . Buccal cell collection conduct trained research coordinator , principal investigator , co-investigator . Participants receive write verbal instruction intervention diary documentation BSE drink , detail intervention timeline , include overnight void , blood buccal cell collection , day GRR-BSE consumption . Participants receive list brassica vegetables condiment avoid study intervention . Participants also receive list CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor must avoid study intervention . For overnight void , participant instruct begin collect urine 5 pm , collect urine first morning void follow day . The intervention diary space participant record date time GRR-BSE consumption , space subjective comment regard taste tolerability . Participants provide : 1 ) collection bottle overnight urine collection ; 2 ) three frozen GRR-BSE beverage insulate cooler bag frozen blue-ice block ; 3 ) intervention diary instruction , state . Participants store frozen GRR-BSE beverage home freezer . On even day 1 , participant collect baseline overnight void return study team day 2 . Each even 3 evening ( day 2-4 ; 5pm 8pm ) , participant thaw consume one GRR-BSE beverage . Beverages may thaw room temperature 1-2 hour , lukewarm ( 70-80°F ) water bath 20-30 minute . Participants record time consumption intervention diary . AE assessment buccal cell collection conduct day 3 , 4 , 5 ( 8 1 pm ) study investigator train research coordinator . On even day 4 , participant collect overnight void return study team day 5 along intervention diary . Blood collection occur day 5 ( 8 1 pm ) . Participants undergo minimum 3 day washout . Day 5 intervention , include GRR-BSE dose , count first day washout period . Intervention 2 , SFR-BSE At baseline visit intervention 2 ( day 1 ) , participant undergo baseline blood buccal cell collection . Blood collection perform trained phlebotomist . Buccal cell collection conduct trained research coordinator , principal investigator , co-investigator . Participants receive write verbal instruction intervention diary documentation SFR-BSE drink , detail intervention timeline , include overnight void , blood buccal cell collection , day SFR-BSE consumption . Participants receive list brassica vegetables condiment avoid study intervention . Participants also receive list CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor must avoid study intervention . For overnight void , participant instruct begin collect urine 5 pm , collect urine first morning void follow day . The intervention diary space participant record date time SFR-BSE consumption , space subjective comment regard taste tolerability . Participants provide : 1 ) collection bottle overnight urine collection , include instruction collection ; 2 ) three frozen SFR-BSE beverage insulate cooler bag frozen blue-ice block ; 3 ) intervention diary instruction , state . Participants store frozen SFR-BSE beverage home freezer . On even day 1 , participant collect baseline overnight void return study team day 2 . Each even 3 evening ( day 2-4 ; 5pm 8pm ) , participant thaw consume one SFR-BSE beverage . Beverages may thaw room temperature 1-2 hour , lukewarm ( 70-80°F ) water bath 20-30 minute . Participants record time consumption intervention diary . AE assessment buccal cell collection conduct day 3 , 4 , 5 ( 8 1 pm ) study investigator train research coordinator . On even day 4 , participant collect overnight void return study team day 5 along intervention diary . Blood collection occur day 5 ( 8 1 pm ) . Participants undergo minimum 3 day washout . Day 5 intervention , include SFR-BSE dose , count first day washout period . Intervention 3 , SFR-BSE ( T ) At baseline visit intervention 3 ( day 1 ) , participant undergo baseline blood buccal cell collection . Blood collection perform trained phlebotomist . Buccal cell collection conduct trained research coordinator , principal investigator , co-investigator . Participants receive write verbal instruction intervention diary documentation SFR-BSE ( T ) application , detail intervention timeline , include overnight void , blood buccal cell collection , day SFR-BSE ( T ) application . Participants receive list brassica vegetables condiment avoid study intervention . Participants also receive list CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor must avoid study intervention . For overnight void , participant instruct begin collect urine 5 pm , collect urine first morning void follow day . Participants explicitly instruct intervention 3 topical application . Participants instruct take one mouthful ( approximately 30 mL 1/3 dose ) SFR-BSE ( T ) beverage , swish , gargle , hold mouth 2-3 minute spit . This repeated twice ( total 3 swish , gargle , hold spit application ) beverage go , aim total exposure time 6-8 minute . The intervention diary space participant record date , time duration SFR-BSE ( T ) topical application , space subjective comment regard taste tolerability . Participants provide : 1 ) collection bottle overnight urine collection , include instruction collection ; 2 ) three frozen SFR-BSE ( T ) beverages insulate cooler bag frozen blue-ice block ; 3 ) intervention diary instruction , state . Participants store frozen SFR-BSE ( T ) beverages home freezer . On even day 1 , participant collect baseline overnight void return study team day 2 . Each even 3 evening ( day 2-4 ; 5pm 8pm ) , participant thaw consume one SFR-BSE beverage . Beverages may thaw room temperature 1-2 hour , lukewarm ( 70-80°F ) water bath 20-30 minute . Participants record time duration topical application intervention diary . AE assessment buccal cell collection conduct day 3 , 4 , 5 ( 8 1 pm ) study investigator . On even day 4 , participant collect overnight void return study team day 5 along intervention diary . Blood collection occur day 5 ( 8 1 pm ) .</detailed_description>
