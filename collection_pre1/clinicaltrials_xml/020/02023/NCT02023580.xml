	<brief_summary>Although HIV test highly effective antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) improve survival HIV , relatively low level ART adherence present significant public health challenge term potential transmit HIV . Preventing transmission virally unsuppressed HIV+ MSM unprotected anal intercourse ( UAI ) serodiscordant partner great public health impact . As new HIV infection MSM attribute part increase access sex partner online , critical deliver behavioral intervention HIV+ MSM online reach many high-risk men relatively low cost . The investigator ' theoretically-grounded HIV prevention video UAI , HIV disclosure , test MSM rigorously evaluate among MSM recruit online . Findings indicate significant reduction UAI significant increase HIV status disclosure 3-month follow-up , compare baseline . In subsequent online , randomize control trial ( RCT ) MSM , investigator find significant reduction UAI among MSM video arm 60-day follow-up , compare baseline ; HIV+ MSM video arm reduce UAI , include serodiscordant UAI ( SDUAI ) 60-day follow-up , compare baseline . Based finding , investigator work POZ.com ( POZ ) , large website HIV+ individual , test whether could recruit ethnically diverse HIV+ MSM successful . The investigator identify potentially highly effective feasible risk reduction intervention approach HIV+ MSM . With commitment POZ strong team expert , investigator propose refine intervention edit 3 HIV prevention video short dos 10 online session ( include booster ) ; target HIV+ MSM virally unsuppressed ; monitor self-reported clinical indicator ( i.e. , viral load ) ; target online recruitment race/ethnicity enroll equal number HIV+ White , Black Hispanic MSM balance representation ; improve retention incentive proven online platform ; include educational information ART adherence ; cost cost-effectiveness analysis potentially avert HIV infection determine health-related cost saving . Online , investigator recruit follow national sample 1,500 high-risk , virally unsuppressed HIV+ MSM 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design . For primary outcome ( reduction SDUAI increase HIV disclosure sex partner ) , propose online study utilizes 2-arm RCT design , 10 intervention video vignette ground SLT/SCT , evaluate innovative , multisession , video-based online intervention tailor 1,500 English- Spanish-speaking virally unsuppressed HIV+ White , Black Hispanic MSM . Men randomize receive 10 session theory-driven video treatment `` attention '' video control . Men classify White , Black , Hispanic base self-identification , computerized randomization occur within race/ethnicity assure balance representation across experimental arm . All participant receive online survey baseline , 3- , 6- , 9- 12-month follow-up . All participant receive incentive completion online survey . Preparation Online RCT ( AIM 1 ) ( Months 1 - 12 ) . In AIM 1 investigator finalize intervention material RCT , plan online recruitment , program test online platform work CAG ensure appropriate literacy level material proper Spanish translation survey . The investigator use exist video footage 3 video edit ten 2-3 minute segment dub Spanish . The HIV Is Still A Big Deal Project establish 2004 , PHS launch HIV prevention website ( hivbigdeal.org ) 2008 . Our 3 HIV prevention dramatic video , 10 minute length , form inter-related series character cover HIV disclosure sex partner SDUAI : The Morning After , The Test , Ask Me , Tell Me , include 3 HIV+ character focus importance HIV disclosure sex partner order reduce HIV transmission .

The video vignettes available study participant via secure URL men able forward videos friend participant ( prevent cross contamination arm ) . Attention Control Videos : The video control arm design equal video intervention arm number session , duration , interest level . For video control , investigator edit exist digital footage ( dub vignette Spanish ) gay-themed television series DTLA ( Downtown Los Angeles ) . The series group gay friend ( different race ethnicity ) struggle romantic family relationship . Although show set LA , storylines relatable general gay audience . Implementation Online 2-Arm RCT ( 750/Arm ) ( AIM 2 ) ( Months 13 - 33 ) . In AIM 2 investigator conduct online 2-arm , video-based RCT , recruit randomize 1,500 U.S. virally unsuppressed HIV+ White , Black Hispanic MSM POZ , Barebackrt , Facebook , Grindr Craigslist . This 12-month online intervention design reduce high risk behavior use multi-session video vignettes booster . Dissemination treatment control videos occur : 1 ) baseline 3-month follow-up , men view 6 video vignette , space 1 week apart ; 2 ) 6- 9-month follow-up , men view 4 video booster , space 1 week apart . *Investigators able track whether men click video link . All participant complete baseline , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month follow-up survey . To reduce chance instrument reactivity ( i.e. , assessment effect ) , investigator provide detailed online survey assessment baseline 12-month follow-up brief online assessment 3- , 6- 9-month follow-up . All participant receive text email link 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month follow-up survey . Arm 1 : Video Treatment arm complete baseline , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month online survey assessment . Between baseline 3-month follow-up , men view 6 video vignette ( participant receive link view video vignette week 6 week ) . Based team 's experience attenuate intervention effect 6 month , men receive 4 video booster , space 1 week apart , 6-month assessment survey . Spacing dose time improve critical thinking . The additional video continuation dramatic series plus additional video scene disclosure serodiscordant partnership . Arm 2 : Video Control arm complete baseline , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month online survey assessment . For comparability study arm , control group provide number videos time period use footage DTLA .
