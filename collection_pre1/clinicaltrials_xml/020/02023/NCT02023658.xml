	<brief_summary>Despite significant increase global health investment availability low-cost , efficacious intervention design reduce mother child HIV transmission low middle income country high HIV burden , translation scientific advance effective delivery strategy slow , uneven incomplete . As result , pediatric HIV infection remain largely uncontrolled . Enhancing implementation pMTCT intervention contextually appropriate system analysis improvement approach potentially reduce drop-off along pMTCT cascade , lead dramatic improvement infant maternal outcome . The goal proposal develop model systematic assessment improvement pMTCT service sub-Saharan Africa . In specific aim 1 , identify health system factor service delivery approaches associate high low perform pMTCT service Côte d'Ivoire , Kenya Mozambique . In specific aim 2 adapt evaluate feasibility impact system analysis tool associate performance enhancement approach pMTCT service Côte d'Ivoire , Kenya Mozambique . This system analysis tool associate performance enhancement approach currently develop pilot pMTCT service Mozambique . The result implementation research expect generate knowledge global health significance , disseminate study result intervention tool broad PEPFAR network , rapidly impact pMTCT service delivery enhancements across high need country .</brief_summary>
