	<brief_title>Evaluate Effect Planet Water Foundation 's Clean Water , Sanitation Hygiene Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multidimensional approach need meet Millennium development Goals ( MDG ) address Water Sanitation Hygiene Knowledge , Attitudes Practices . The MDG reduce child mortality 2015 require increase focus country region child death rate high , renew commitment reach vulnerable child ( UN , 2013 ) . India Nigeria account one third death child less five year age ( UN , 2013 ) . Using combination research base literature review , expert opinion policy report multifactor model develop determine necessary variable need address integrated approach WASH relate problem could design . Variables identify impact WASH outcome . These variable classify several category include : 1 . Socio-demographics 2 . Environmental Access 3 . Knowledge , Attitudes , Practices 4 . Family Health Profile 5 . School Characteristics The propose study conduct randomize control clinical trial meet overall study objective evaluate Planet Water Foundation 's Program develop multidimensional framework . The proposed clinical trial include 12 school ( 6 residential 6 non-residential ) . Six school ( n=3 residential ; n=3 non-residential ) include Group 1 ( No Planet Water intervention ) Group 2 ( With Planet Water intervention ) two location include district Pune Thane State Maharashtra . Locations match base similar water source school , toilet facility , water quality testing , water purification technique , geographic setting , geographic population size . Planet Water Foundation 's Program ( PWP ) provide school-based program aim improve health outcome child use three component : ( ) access safe water , ( b ) access hand wash facility , ( c ) access water-health hygiene education . As part PWP , access safe water provide use AquaTower , incorporate Ultra Filtration ( UF ) system . PWP 's Water-Health &amp; Hygiene education program four week program include four module : ( 1 ) importance clean water , ( 2 ) wash hand , ( 3 ) wash hand , ( 4 ) protect germ hands-on , activity-based program incorporates game , drama , song , dance . A mixed method approach use open-ended multiple-choice question form questionnaire . Questionnaires translate English local language ( Marathi ) , back-translated English analysis BAIF Development Research Foundation India . Students , household caregivers/parents , teacher give separate questionnaire . Three different interview conduct : ( 1 ) household questionnaire conduct home student include study , ( 2 ) teacher questionnaire administer school , ( 3 ) student questionnaire administer student individually interviewer separate room away student . Group 1 Group 2 give questionnaire . All questionnaire administer cooperation BAIF Development Research Foundation , local foundation India . The foundation receive data collection data entry training prior study . Data gather paper form data enter Microsoft Excel® . The online data repository store encrypted manner password protect . The information store behind secure firewall provide local research foundation India . All data gather paper form store locked cabinet , information access individual directly involve research . Consent obtain ensure ( 1 ) approve personnel present consent process , ( 2 ) few number individual possible aware subject 's participation research , ( 3 ) research activity perform private place possible . The study sample include six Group 1 ( PWP intervention ) school six Group 2 ( With PWP intervention ) school , 60 student per school total 360 student Group 1 school 360 student Group 2 school . The sample size among 12 school calculate assume intra-cluster correlation coefficient p=0.01 , design provide 80 % power ( Donner Klar , 1996 ) detect medium effect size ( Cohen 1992 ) 0.50 . The sample size increase 15 % , 414 intervention control , account attrition . Descriptive statistic compute variable ensure data quality evaluate assumption statistical test . Variable distribution describe histogram , box plot , central tendency , measure variation frequency distribution . We test assumption normality outcome measure , within PWP control group . Additionally , test assumption PWP control group equal variance . Generalized linear mixed model ( GLMMs ) unequal variance ( McCulloch et al. , 2008 ) apply ideal condition normality equal variance meet . Testing equality variance available COVTEST statement , base ratio residual likelihood pseudo-likelihoods . Residuals level model examine assess model fit . Generalized linear mixed model use SAS PROC GLIMMIX also provide flexibility model different type outcome variable ( binary , count continuous data ) . All analysis conduct use SAS/STAT® software Windows version 9.2 high . Prior test study hypothesis , examine data possible covariates . Potential confounding variable control enter variable covariates regression model . These explanatory variable improve detection treatment effect enter variable covariates GLMMs . These variable enter covariate univariate two-sided chi-square test compare PWP control group significant alpha level 0.20 . In preliminary analysis , examine potential covariates use single-level however also examine potential covariates use hierarchical linear model . We use liberal alpha 0.20 decision whether adjust covariate important confounding effect overlook . Hierarchical , correlate data structure : A hierarchical linear model ( HLM ) approach ( Raudenbush Bryk , 2002 ) use account correlation induce repeat measurement time student nest within school . School model random effect . These HLMs implement SAS use generalize linear mixed model , apply analyze binary , count continuous repeat measurement data , collect unequal time interval follow hierarchical structure ( McCulloch Searle , 2001 ; Liang Zeger 1986 ) . These model address correlate nature multiple measurement come subject time . We anticipate generalize linear model appropriate data , also explore use method generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) ( McCulloch Searle , 2008 ) . The GEE method require assumption normality equal variance , use less information linear mixed model since first two moment distribution employ GEE .</detailed_description>
