	<brief_summary>The edentulism use inadequate denture , unstable teeth wear long period usage lead disharmony stomatognathic system due gradual loss occlusion vertical dimension result inadequate mandibular movement condyle-fossa relation . The reline denture base use interocclusal appliance prior definitive rehabilitation could influence functional aspect . However , Randomized Controlled clinical Trials ( RCTs ) test combine use two treatment reestablish functional aspect . The , aim study evaluate whether denture base reline use interocclusal appliance prior final rehabilitation influence mandibular movement condyle-fossa relation , incomplete denture wearer . For controlled , crossover , randomize blind clinical trial , 30 volunteer , totally edentulous , complete denture wearer period five year , select . The volunteer randomly allocate three subgroup ( n= 10 ) receive follow treatment : Control ( C ) Volunteers receive new complete denture without previous intervention old complete denture ; Relining Denture ( RD ) Volunteers submit reline base old complete denture 30 day usage replacement new complete denture , evaluation perform ; Interocclusal Appliance ( IA ) Volunteers submit treatment interocclusal appliance 30 day usage replacement new complete denture , evaluation perform . Volunteers evaluate regard extent mandibular movement intraoral record Gothic Gysi arch ; condyle-fossa relation cone-bean computed tomographic scan ; occlusion vertical dimension Willis compass photographic record . These evaluation perform three period , T0 baseline ; T1 application randomize treatment , reline denture interocclusal appliance ) ; T3 final rehabilitation . The control group evaluate period T0 T3 .</brief_summary>
