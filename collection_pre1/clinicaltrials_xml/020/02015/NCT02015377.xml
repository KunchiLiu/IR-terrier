	<detailed_description>Our major unifying hypothesis diet comprise high sugar , energy dense , low fiber meal , associate post-prandial metabolic , hormonal psychosocial profile promote overeat sedentary behavior . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) Compare effect HIGH SUGAR , LOW FIBER ( HSLF ) meal versus LOW SUGAR , HIGH FIBER ( LSHF ) meal insulin dynamic , select gut peptide , mood level physical activity minority adolescent , ( 2 ) Explore effect HSLF versus LSHF meal post-prandial ad libitum food intake , ( 3 ) Explore difference reaction HSLF versus LSHF meal lean overweight adolescent ( 4 ) Examine ethnic difference meal response Hispanic African American child . Research Design Methods : We employ cross-over design 3-4 week washout period normal weight overweight African American Hispanic youth come Observation Lab fast state consume high sugar low sugar meal separate visit random order . Meal consumption follow five hour intensive observation quantify real-time physical activity laboratory setting design offer equally attractive choice active sedentary behavior . After 5 hour , participant offer food platter array food type invite eat ad libitum . Subsequent energy nutrient intake quantify . Rationale : This study prompt three observation : ( 1 ) The disproportionate level obesity risk type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease Hispanic African American child ; ( 2 ) The rapid decline physical activity puberty especially Hispanic African American adolescent , ( 3 ) Children , particularly minority child , tend diet high add sugar low fiber . Thus , imperative improve understand interrelationship dietary intake , physical activity risk factor type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease minority youth , particularly puberty , physical activity level significantly decline . Relevance public health : This study provide new information acute effect meal composition mood subsequent choice physical activity normal weight , healthy overweight insulin resistant overweight Hispanic African American youth . Furthermore , suggest finding may potentially lead good understand acute affect poor nutritional choice physical activity minority adolescent population high risk obesity , diabetes type 2 , obesity-related disease .</detailed_description>
