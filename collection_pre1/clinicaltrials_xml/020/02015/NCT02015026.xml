	<brief_summary>Background : - Adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) rare tumor incidence 1.5 2 per million people per year . It poor prognosis overall 5-year mortality rate 75 - 90 % average survival time diagnosis 14.5 month . - The treatment choice localize primary recurrent tumor surgical resection . Patients recurrent metastatic disease infrequently curable surgery alone . - As solid tumor , chemotherapy option limited benefit , although platinumbased therapy response rate 25 30 % . To date target therapy show value disease . - The natural history ACC vary greatly patient survive month others live disease year . The basis differ clinical presentation know . While one exclude immune host component responsible diverse clinical course , also possible may genetic basis phenomenon . A bio-specimen repository major step towards comprehensive study rare unusual tumor , allow u begin characterize subgroup within disease . - Patients rare tumor seek expert advice management care . Dr. Fojo expertise frequently ask consult care ACC patient throughout world . A natural history study would establish formal mechanism referral , allow systematic collection epidemiologic data well much need tumor sample . Objective : -To characterize natural history adrenocortical cancer , process , collect blood , tissue sample study genetic/biochemical pathway involve development progression adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) . Eligibility : - Patients great equal 12 year age biopsy-proven ACC - Patients great equal 12 year age suspect ACC Design/Schema : - Patients offer clinical consultation treatment recommendation , include standard care clinical trial option . Computed tomography scan thorax , abdomen pelvis perform staging purpose indicate ; occasionally , magnetic resonance imaging perform visualization lesion liver , spine , anatomic site . - Medical history document patient follow throughout course illness , particular attention pattern disease recurrence progression , response therapy , duration response hormone production patient hormone production manifestation disease . Tumor growth rate also calculate throughout course disease . - Blood tumor sample obtain baseline follow-up interval surgery indicate . Tumor sample may include sample harvest facility prior enrollment trial . - Genetic epigenetic analysis tumor select case expression array analysis perform .</brief_summary>
