	<detailed_description>Study objective To investigate early control mobilization ankle week 3 8 affect functional outcome patient report outcome treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture . Study Design Type study The study perform single-blinded , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . The randomisation computer base ; opaque envelope use . In total 130 patient include . Time schedule Recruitment patient study begin 1st November 2013 . The expected study period 4-5 year ; recruitment expect span 2 year , provide average 6 patient include per month . Method Setup At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre majority patient acute ATR treat non-operatively . A cast applied emergency room . After 2 week bandage change removable orthosis full weight bearing allow . Patients choose participate trial - randomisation - place one two group : 1 . The intervention group : Must perform control mobilization-exercises begin week 3 . 2 . The control group : In line current treatment regimen patient must keep boot time allow move ankle . Treatment protocol two group similar concern orthose , removal wedge weight-bearing . The difference patient intervention group instruct ankle exercise . Compliance The following measure take ensure compliance within group : 1 . The intervention group : The patient equip train diary record training five daily training session . 2 . The control group : The orthosis seal . If boot remove register . Blinding The doctor physical therapist conduct follow-up blind intervention . This ensure Project Nurse charge randomisation . The patient give direct phone number Project Nurse , he/she charge treatment related question enquiry intervention period . Potential medical query discuss one affiliated doctor . Post-examinations relation study Follow-up do 8 16 week plus 6 12 month . The study 's primary endpoint 12 month mark . Population Patients treat acute Achilles tendon rupture Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion wish participate treat accord standard regimen ( non-operatively without early control movement ankle joint ) . Number patient 65 patient include group ( 130 patient total ) . The sample size calculation base clinical relevant difference 10 point ATRS , standard deviation ( SD ) 16 power 0.90 ( two side ) . In previous material , fully comparable population , find SD 16 point 1 year post-examination . 54 patient require group ; due risk drop 65 patient include group . Inclusion criterion - Age 18-70 year . - The patient must expect able attend rehabilitation post-examinations . - The patient must able speak understand Danish . - The patient must able give informed consent . Exclusion criterion - Former rupture one Achilles tendon ( ) . - Previous surgery Achilles tendon . - Fluoroquinolone treatment within last 6 month . - Tendinosis treat corticosteroid ( tablet injection ) within last 6 month . - The patient diagnose arterial insufficiency leg . - Terminal illness severe medical illness : ASA score high equal 3 . - The space rupture calcaneus less 1cm . Data Registration All relevant data record specially design database . The data registration report Danish Data Protection Agency . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint evaluate 12 month . ATRS : Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score 25 A patient report validation score develop ass symptom physical activity treatment Achilles tendon rupture . Secondary endpoint Heel-rise work test : Endurance test patient stand one leg lift heel exhaustion . The number height heel-rises count measure . The result compare weight patient total work estimate . The MuscleLab ® ( Ergo Test Technology , Oslo , Norway ) measurement system use 25 . Single heel-rise test : The patient stand foot neutral position . It record whether patient able make single heel-rise injured leg . The heel-rise acknowledge heel lift least 2 cm stretch knee . The MuscleLab ® ( Ergo Test Technology , Oslo , Norway ) measurement system use 26 . Ultrasound : The length calcaneus distal tip medial head gastrocnemius muscle . Amlangs ultrasound classification 27 . Cost effectiveness analysis : A cost effectiveness analysis perform compare two treatment protocol . DVT screening : Ultra sound deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) perform 2 8 week . Perimeter calf : The perimeter calf measure wide point injured side 16 week . The distance point lower edge patella measure centimeter . The distance use measure perimeter healthy leg subsequent measurement trial . Re-ruptur ( RR ) : It register tendon re-ruptures trial period . Work : Hard physical labour involve heavy lifting , climb stair climb ladder . E.g . bricklayer , paviour , carpenter , dustman , mailman . Moderate physical work involve lot walk . E.g . salesperson , shop assistant , nurse . Light physical work involve light walk . E.g . office work Return work : It record many day pass work resume part-time full-time . Sport : Does patient sport ? If yes , kind , many hour per week average level ( professional , amateur , exerciser ) . Return sport : It record many day pass sport activity resume many day pass sport activity reach premorbid level . Health information : Former disease around Achilles tendon , rheumatic disease , dominant leg . Other data : Age , Cpr.nr. , master data necessary identify call back patient post-examinations . The study carry accordance principle Helsinki Declaration . Patients cover patient insurance Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . The protocol well patient information declaration consent must approve National Committee Health Research Ethics inclusion patient begin . The project manager responsible inform National Committee Health Research Ethics critical adverse event and/or major change protocol . All correspondence file project manager . Declaration consent All patient receive verbal write information concern study . The inclusion take place declaration consent obtain . It responsibility investigator provide patient comprehensive verbal write information concern course study , purpose , potential risk benefit . Statistics The two group describe descriptively regard demographic parameter well primary secondary endpoint describe paragraph `` Data registration '' . Comparison primary secondary outcome group do use relevant statistic accord characteristic variable necessary normal distribution . The change outcomes period time describe within group . The research group The study carry collaboration research unit , Clinical Orthopaedic Research Hvidovre ( www.corh.dk ) Department Physical- Occupational Therapy , Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . Data analysis writing article The data analysis draw article do project manager last-author . The project group regularly involved process . Economic condition The study fund Department Orthopaedic Surgery Department Physiotherapy , Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . The project group independently initiate study . Patients receive fee participation . Publication It expect study publish international , high-impact journal . We furthermore seek result present national international medical convention . The result also publish online relevant medium .</detailed_description>
