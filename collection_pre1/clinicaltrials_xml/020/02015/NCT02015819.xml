	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect determines best dose genetically modify neural stem cell flucytosine give together leucovorin treat patient recurrent high-grade glioma . Neural stem cell travel site tumor brain . The neural stem cell use study genetically modify express enzyme cytosine deaminase ( CD ) , convert prodrug flucytosine ( 5-FC ) chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Leucovorin may help 5-FU kill tumor cell . The CD-expressing neural stem cell administer directly brain . After give neural stem cell day spread migrate tumor cell , research participant take 7 day course oral 5-FC . ( Depending research participant enters study , s/he may also give leucovorin take 5-FC . ) When 5-FC cross brain , neural stem cell convert 5-FU , diffuse neural stem cell preferentially kill rapidly divide tumor cell minimize toxicity healthy tissue . A Rickham catheter , place time surgery , use administer additional dos NSCs every two week , follow time 7 day course oral 5-FC ( possibly leucovorin ) . This neural stem cell-based anti-cancer strategy may effective treatment high-grade glioma . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define phase II recommend dose intracerebrally administer cytosine deaminase ( CD ) -expressing neural stem cell ( NSCs ) combination oral 5-fluorocytosine ( FC ) ( flucytosine ) leucovorin . II . To determine feasibility treat study patient 1 dose NSCs follow 7-day course 5-FC leucovorin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess possible development NSC immunogenicity ( anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody response ) repeat dose NSCs . II . To characterize relationship intracerebral systemic concentration 5-FC 5-FU maximum tolerate dose level . III . To describe clinical benefit ( define stable disease , partial response , complete response ) treatment regimen . IV . To determine , time autopsy , fate NSCs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study CD-expressing genetically modify neural stem cell flucytosine . Patients receive CD-expressing neural stem cell intracranially ( IC ) day 1 15 flucytosine orally ( PO ) every 6 hour day 4-10 18-24 . Depending subject enters study , s/he may also give leucovorin orally every 6 hour day 4-10 18-24 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
