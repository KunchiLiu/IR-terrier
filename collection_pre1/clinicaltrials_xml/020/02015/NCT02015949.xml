	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common cause death disability young adult . Patients experience significant problem concentration , attention , memory ( call 'cognitive impairment ' ) follow TBI . These cognitive impairment drastically impact patient 's well-being , lead significant economic social consequence . Roughly quarter TBI patient improve equal number deteriorate time . The investigator know little patient vary much recover . Crucially , investigator treatment improve brain functioning recovery TBI . Trials investigate way protect brain injury disappointing . An alternative strategy , however , improve function brain region remain intact , function inefficiently TBI . The investigator know dopamine ( chemical brain ) know influence many brain function investigator know pathway brain use dopamine affect TBI . In human , drug increase dopamine brain , methylphenidate , sometimes used enhance cognitive function TBI , response treatment highly variable patient . Therefore , need clinic way target use drug patient likely respond . In single centre study , investigator use SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Tomography ) image measure dopamine level brain . MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan assess brain structure function . The investigator test whether treatment methylphenidate improve cognitive function TBI patient ongoing cognitive problem , whether mechanism involve normalisation brain function whether brain dopamine level predict magnitude improvement symptom .</brief_summary>
