	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study determine feasibility safety use small bead ( 70-150 micron place 100-300 micron ) deliver chemotherapy liver treat patient liver lesion colorectal cancer . The bead ( LC-Bead M1 ) load irinotecan ( DEBIRI-M1 ) , use administer transarterichemoembolization ( TACE ) . Eligibility : Patients liver cancer colorectal cancer . Study Overview/ Treatment : DEBIRI , load irinotecan , device utilizes tiny bead ( 70-150 micron ) deliver chemotherapy agent liver tumor ( ) via hepatic artery . This device allow continuous release irinotecan liver tumor tissue ( ) cause necrosis target tumor ( ) . The potential advantage small bead deep penetration tumor bed , avoid premature proximal occlusion vessel feed tumor , consistent dose . Response therapy evaluate monthly clinic visit blood test ( include assessment liver function tumor marker ) image ( usually MRIs ) every 1-2 month . Patients study 6 month exit study follow survival . Once exit study continue eligible receive DEBIRI , recommend .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis fail intolerant least one systemic chemotherapy liver direct therapy . 1 . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 study entry . 2 . The patient age 18 year old . 3 . The patient life expectancy &gt; 12 week . 4 . Patients liver dominant disease define &gt; /=75 % tumor body burden confine liver 5 . Less 60 % liver tumor replacement 6 . At least one month elapse since recent prior cancer therapy follow exception : Chemotherapy ( exclude irinotecan base regimen ) may continue evidence hepatic progression treatment provide change therapy 1 month prior DEBIRITACE treatment immediate chemotherapeutic toxicity complicate DEBIRITACE resolve . In case , chemotherapy may continue continue control extrahepatic disease . 7 . The patient measurable disease directly treat intrahepatic therapy ( define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) . 8 . Patients least one measurable liver metastasis &gt; 2 cm . 9 . Patients patent main portal vein 10 . The patient adequate hematologic function define follow criterion : An absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1500/mL , Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9.5 g/dL , Platelet count &gt; /=75,000/mL , INR &lt; /=1.3 prior receive DEBIRITACE . 11 . The patient adequate hepatic function , define follow criterion : Total bilirubin &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL , Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; /= 5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Albumin &gt; 2 . 12 . The patient adequate renal function , define follow criterion : Serum creatinine &lt; /=2.0 . 13 . The patient baseline international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.5 . 14 . The patient , woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test . 15 . The patient able give write informed consent . 16 . The patient willing able comply study procedure , schedule visit , treatment plan . 1 . The patient history another primary cancer ( ie , primary cancer associate patient 's current liver tumor ) , exception ( ) curatively resect nonmelanomatous skin cancer ; ( b ) curatively treated cervical carcinoma situ ; ( c ) primary solid tumor treat curative intent , know active disease present , treatment administer last 3 year prior enrollment ( date inform consent ) . 2 . Any contraindication hepatic embolization procedure : Large shunt determine investigator ( pretesting TcMMA require ) Severe atheromatosis Hepatofugal blood flow Main portal vein occlusion ( e.g . thrombus tumor ) Any patient eligible curative treatment ( i.e . resection radiofrequency ablation ) Patients ' whose measurable disease within area liver previously subject radiotherapy 3 . Contradindications irinotecan : Chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or bowel obstruction History severe hypersensitivity reaction irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate , lactic acid excipients Camptosar Severe bone marrow failure History Gilbert Syndrome ( specific test require ) Concomitant use St John 's Wort ( Hypericum ) Marcoshunting note hepatic angiogram . 4 . The patient untreatable bleeding diathesis . 5 . The patient complete main portal vein thrombosis reversal flow . 6 . The patient evidence clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . 7 . The patient brain metastases 8 . The patient clinically significant symptomatic extrahepatic disease , example , uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection require parenteral antibiotic Symptomatic congestive heart failure ( class II IV New York Heart Association classification heart disease ) Unstable angina pectoris , angioplasty , stenting , myocardial infarction within 6 month Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg , find 2 consecutive measurement separate 1week period despite adequate medical support ) Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ( multifocal premature ventricular contraction , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia symptomatic require treatment [ NCICTCAE Grade 3 ] asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia ) 9 . The patient pregnant breastfeeding . 10 . Psychiatric illness/social situation would compromise patient safety limit compliance study requirement 11 . There evidence substance abuse medical , psychological social condition may interfere patient 's participation study evaluation study result 12 . The patient allergic contrast medium readily prevent premedication manage . 13 . Other significant medical surgical condition , medication treatment , would place patient undue risk would preclude safe use chemoembolization would interfere study participation 14 . The patient peritoneal disease ascites ( great trace image ) .</criteria>
