	<brief_summary>Background : - Many cancer produce two particular protein . The immune system target attack cancer . The PANVAC vaccine put gene protein inside virus vaccine body see protein foreign invader attack . Researchers test PANVAC people high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . They give people respond usual treatment , bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) several week . They want see PANVAC plus BCG good BCG alone . Objective : - To compare effect PANVAC plus BCG therapy , BCG therapy alone . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer fail least 1 course BCG . Design : - Participants screen blood urine test abdominal scan . - Participants randomly assign get BCG BCG plus PANVAC . - They 10 visit 15 week . Most part usual cancer care . - They blood urine test . - All participant get BCG 6 weekly injection . - One group also get PANVAC 5 injection 15 week . - Between week 17 20 , participant undergo test tumor area part usual care . They cystoscopy , exam anesthesia , bladder biopsy . Results used evaluate different treatment . - Participants quarterly follow-up visit 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) Combined With PANVAC Versus BCG Alone Adults With High Grade Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Who Failed At Least 1 Course BCG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - High grade ( G3 ) non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder ( stage Ta , T1 , CIS ) high rate recurrence progression - The standard care therapeutic agent single induction course bacillus Calmette- Guerin ( BCG ) - Although second induction course use patient fail single induction course BCG , 35 % patient fail initial induction course experience 12 month disease-free survival receive second induction course - For patient fail second induction course , radical cystectomy pelvic lymphadenectomy recommend treatment , although high morbidity rate small real mortality rate - Therefore , unmet need localize treatment patient fail initial induction course BCG potentially improve upon poor result second induction course BCG - Recently , unique pox viral vector-based vaccine , PANVAC , show induce CD4 CD8 antigen-specific immune response tumor-associated antigen ( TAAs ) , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) mucin-1 ( MUC-1 ) . This vaccine also contain transgene three human T cell co-stimulatory molecule potentially augment immune response - We hypothesize combined administration BCG PANVAC may augment BCG-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response bladder cancer cell express MUC-1 and/or CEA potentially reverse BCG failure patient fail one induction course BCG Objectives : -To determine improvement disease-free survival ( DFS ) BCG + PANVAC compare BCG alone phase II study non-muscle invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma bladder fail respond intravesical BCG within 1 year post treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals fail least one previous induction course intravesical BCG , define histologically confirm persistent relapse tumor present post-BCG endoscopic evaluation . All BCG failure consider inclusion study , include BCG-refractory , -resistant , -relapsing , define Rationale Background . For purpose study , BCG-refractory BCG-resistant subject consider BCG-persistent disease . - Patients currently candidate radical cystectomy ( e.g . patient refuse surgery , comorbidities preclude major surgery , etc. ) . - Normal organ function , ECOG 0-2 . Design : - This randomize , open label prospective , Phase II study subject non-muscle invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma bladder fail least one induction course intravesical BCG , randomize one follow arm : TICE BCG +PANVAC TICE BCG alone . Randomization stratify BCG treatment subgroup . - All subject receive intravesical TICE BCG ( 50mg ) per usual standard care weekly start week 3 total 6 week . - The combination arm receive pox viral vaccine contain transgene CEA MUC-1 ( modify HLA-A2 agonist epitope ) well 3 human T-cell costimulatory molecule , B7-1 , ICAM-1 , LFA-3 [ rV-PANVAC ( vaccinia ) rFPANVAC ( fowlpox ) ] follow : - rV-PANVAC 2 x 10 ( 8 ) pfu SQ week 0 . - rF-PANVAC1 x 10 ( 9 ) pfu SQ week 3 , 7 , 11 , 15 . - For Phase II study , test hypothesis subject TICE BCG +PANVAC arm well disease-free survival subject TICE BCG alone arm . - Patient accrual target one patient per month first 6 month 1-2 patient per 1-2 month afterwards , follow-up period complete accrual 12 month post treatment . - Based power 84 % type 1 error ( 1-sided ) 0.15 , total 49 subject need accrue . - Allowing proportion subject evaluable , maximum 54 subject accrue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 3.1.1.1 Patients must histologically confirm localized high grade ( G3 ) transitional cell carcinoma ( urothelial carcinoma ) bladder stage Ta , T1 , and/or CIS confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI 45 day prior study entry . This obtain outside hospital prior entry study NCI . However , outside pathology specimen require formalinfixed paraffin embed tissue reread Laboratory Pathology , NCI . For patient enrol collaborate trial site , diagnosis must confirm Department Pathology institution patient enrol trial . Pathology also review Laboratory Pathology NCI participate trial site prefers another pathologic evaluation . 3.1.1.2 Patients fail least one previous induction course intravesical BCG , define histologically confirm persistent relapse tumor present postBCG endoscopic evaluation . All BCG failure consider inclusion study , include BCGrefractory , resistant , relapse , define Rationale Background . For purpose study , BCGrefractory BCGresistant subject consider BCGpersistent disease . 3.1.1.3 Patients currently candidate radical cystectomy ( e.g . patient refuse surgery , comorbidities preclude major surgery , etc. ) . 3.1.1.4 Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use BCG combination PANVAC patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 3.1.1.5 ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . 3.1.1.6 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 50,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal estimate GFR ( calculate use CKDEPI equation ) &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 sq.m . 3.1.1.7 Computerized Tomography ( CT ) urogram Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) urogram . If urogram protocol available contrast allergy/poor renal function preclude imaging , noncontrast CT MRI abdomen/pelvis within 28 day study entry suffice . 3.1.1.8 Chest xray negative metastatic disease . 3.1.1.9 Ability patient understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 3.1.2.1 Previous pelvic radiation bladder prostate cancer perform &lt; 12 month prior enrollment study . 3.1.2.2 Patients receive concurrent investigational agent ( patient eligible enroll 4 week completion prior agent ) . 3.1.2.3 Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . There least 3 week delay time previous bladder biopsy/TURBT allow adequate bladder heal prior enrollment . 3.1.2.4 Patients history encephalitis , multiple sclerosis , seizures within last year ( seizure disorder brain metastasis ) exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 3.1.2.5 History allergy untoward reaction prior vaccination vaccinia virus 3.1.2.6 Patients evidence immunocompromised list : Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due potential decrease tolerance risk severe side effect Active autoimmune diseases require treatment history autoimmune disease might stimulate vaccine treatment .
