	<brief_summary>The overall goal Lumbar Image Reporting Epidemiology ( LIRE ) perform large , pragmatic , cluster randomize control trial determine effectiveness simple , inexpensive easy deploy intervention - insertion epidemiological benchmark lumbar spine imaging report - reduce subsequent test treatment . The investigator 's main hypothesis patient refer primary care provider , insert epidemiological evidence lumbar spine image report reduce subsequent diagnostic therapeutic intervention , include cross-sectional imaging ( MR/CT ) , opioid prescription , spinal injection surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term public health significance simple , inexpensive intervention potential substantially reduce unnecessary expensive care back pain patient . Importantly , approach could apply wide range condition diagnostic test ( e.g . imaging test , laboratory test , genetic testing ) . If study positive , add epidemiologic benchmark diagnostic test reporting could become dominant paradigm communicate diagnostic information . To test hypothesis , investigator propose conduct pragmatic cluster , randomize control trial , randomly assign primary care clinic four large health system receive either standard lumbar spine image report report contain epidemiological benchmark common imaging finding . The investigator use novel step wedge randomization scheme temporally randomize site , allow within-site before/after comparison addition between-site comparison , assure site eventually receive intervention . The primary outcome metric back-related intervention intensity . The primary analysis occur clinic level patient level . This pragmatic trial demonstrate feasibility randomly assign clinic within large health system well feasibility passively collect outcome data two year enrollment use robust electronic medical record system available health system .</detailed_description>
