	<brief_summary>Background : -Some people wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( WT-GIST ) deficiency one proteins call SDH . Vandetanib cancer drug approve treat thyroid cancer use success tumor similar loss SDH . Researchers want see drug also decrease tumor growth people WT-GIST . Objectives : -To test whether study drug benefit people WT-GIST . Eligibility : -Adults child 3 year old old WT-GIST . Design : - Researchers test participant tumor tissue confirm wild type GIST . - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . They also electrical record heart ( ECOG ) scan tumor . - Participants take study drug 28-day cycle . Their doctor decide many cycle complete . - They take study drug every day record diary . - On Day 14 , also visit doctor look side effect . - Before cycle 2 , 3 4 , participant physical exam , urine test , blood pressure check , blood test . These test do periodically long study . - Before cycle 4 , scan do check size cancer . Most repeated every 3-6 cycle . - When stop take study drug , participant return clinic physicial exam blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Vandetanib Children Adults With Wild-Type Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) common mesenchymal tumor gastrointestinal tract , resistant cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy . KIT PDGFRA mutation identify tumor initiate event 85 % adult patient GIST , 85 % GISTs pediatric patient lack KIT PDGFRA mutation ( wild-type ) imatinib effective elicit objective response . - Recent work Pediatric Wild-Type ( wt ) GIST Clinic NCI lead identification succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) germline mutation 12 % patient wt-GIST ( 6/34 ) . SDH protein expression evaluate use immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) markedly decrease absent 18/18 patient pediatric wt-GIST . Thus majority wt-GIST SDH-deficient . Vandetanib ( ZACTIMA ; ZD6474 ; AstraZeneca ) oral small molecule antineoplastic drug inhibits VEGFR2 , EGFR , RET-dependent signaling . Preliminary preclinical data demonstrate mark growth inhibition SDH-mutant/deficient renal cell carcinoma cell line treat vandetanib . Objective ( ) : - Primary : To assess clinical activity ( radiographic response RECIST v1.1 ) vandetanib child adult wt-GIST use RECIST ( v1.1 ) . - Secondary : To evaluate toxicity , progression-free overall survival , pharmacodynamics , quality life treatment vandetanib . Eligibility : -Adults child measurable localize metastatic wt-GIST confirm CLIA laboratory eligible trial participation . Patients must measurable disease RECISTv1.1 adequate organ function . Design : - This phase II trial determine whether daily oral vandetanib active patient wt-GIST . Vandetanib activity assess primarily radiographic response measurable disease use RECISTv1.1 . - Vandetanib administer orally daily continuously absence toxicity disease progression , use 28-day cycle . - Patients carefully monitor toxicity response . A small , optimal two-stage phase II design target response rate 25 % use . Nine evaluable patient enrol initially . If 1 first 9 response , accrual would continue total 24 patient enrol . If 3 response 24 ( 12.5 % ) patient , would sufficiently interesting activity warrant study .</detailed_description>
