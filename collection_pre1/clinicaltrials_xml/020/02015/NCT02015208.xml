	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common leukemia adult , recently , limited treatment option . However , combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) produce impressive clinical response prolongs survival many CLL patient symptomatic disease . Unfortunately , FCR toxic regimen generally tolerate patient age 65 year constitute 70 % CLL patient population . In addition , FCR contraindicate patient whose leukemia cell harbor deletion chromosome 17 , tumor suppressor p53 locate , cell intrinsically resistant genotoxic drug . This group constitute 10-15 % patient age require first-line therapy . Better therapy two large group patient need . The initiating event CLL think genetic damage class B lymphocytes prevents proper function apoptotic pathway . However , disease progression drive signal proliferation center tumor microenvironments circulate CLL cell originate . Signals cause CLL cell proliferate include antigens activate B-cell receptor ( BCRs ) , Toll-like receptor ligand , chemokines , cytokine . CLL cell respond strongly microenvironmental signal exhibit aggressive clinical behavior resistance cytotoxic drug . These observation motivate use signal transduction inhibitor treat CLL initial result target kinase BCR-signaling cascade , Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK ) , suggest strategy effective likely change treatment paradigm CLL . BCR signal driver CLL proliferation vivo . Cytokines chemokines tumor microenvironment activate Janus Kinases ( JAKs ) mediate many pathological feature CLL cell . Cytokine signal pathway show rewired aggressive tumor cell support rapid growth eventually overcome effect inhibit BCR-signaling . Preclinical finding suggest JAK inhibitor also place treatment CLL . Based strong theoretical rationale pre-clinical evidence , along know toxicity profile , Ruxolitinib expect significant activity limited toxicity single agent CLL . This trial design investigate efficacy toxicity Ruxolitinib patient otherwise unfit first-line therapy FCR .</detailed_description>
