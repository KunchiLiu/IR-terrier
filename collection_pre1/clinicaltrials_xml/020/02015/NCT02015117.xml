	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose trametinib without whole brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs , trametinib , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving trametinib whole brain radiation therapy may better treatment brain metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib With Without Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximally tolerate dose trametinib use combination whole brain radiation therapy patient brain metastasis . ( Cohort A ) II . To quantify trametinib resect brain metastatic lesion utilizing high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) compare quantification adjacent tissue : brain margin , arachnoid , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . ( Cohort B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tolerability feasibility combination trametinib radiation therapy brain brain metastasis . II . To evaluate objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion combination trametinib radiation therapy . III . To evaluate local control rate , measure time study enrollment time death . IV . To evaluate neurologic progression-free survival , measure time study enrollment time progression within brain death . V. To evaluate overall survival , measure time study enrollment time death . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify cyclin D1 , p27 , phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( pERK ) -1/2 , phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( pAKT ) , phosphatase tensin homolog gene ( PTEN ) , phosphorylated mammalian target rapamycin ( pMTOR ) , phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( pS6K ) , ribosomal protein S6 ( pS6 ) resect metastatic brain lesion via quantitative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) compare IHC profile primary tumor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study trametinib . Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort . COHORT A : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4 week . Beginning week 2 , patient undergo whole brain radiation therapy five day week 3 week . Treatment continue 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT B : Patients receive trametinib PO QD day 1-14 follow surgical resection tumor . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
