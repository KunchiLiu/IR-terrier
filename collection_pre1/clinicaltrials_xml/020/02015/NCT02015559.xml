	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well mucoadhesive oral wound rinse work prevent treat stomatitis patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) - progesterone receptor ( PR ) -positive metastatic locally recurrent breast cancer remove surgery receiving everolimus . Mucoadhesive oral wound rinse may help prevent symptom stomatitis , mouth sore , patient receive everolimus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse Preventing Treating Stomatitis Patients With ER- PR-Positive Metastatic Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer That Can Removed Surgery Receiving Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate whether use prophylactic MuGard ( mucoadhesive oral wound rinse ) participant treat everolimus reduce rate stomatitis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare symptoms mouth sore patient receive MuGard compare receive best supportive care . II . Evaluate rate everolimus dose adjustment therapy discontinuation result stomatitis participant treat MuGard prophylaxis versus best supportive care . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive mucoadhesive oral wound rinse orally ( PO ) gentle swish 30-60 second 3-6 time daily begin day 1 everolimus therapy continue 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive intervention . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 7 day .</detailed_description>
