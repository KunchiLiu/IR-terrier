	<brief_summary>This research study Feasibility clinical trial . In trial , researcher try figure whether medication chosen base rapid test do tumor tissue . Information feasibility pilot trial hopefully help researcher plan large trial future determine effect therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selecting Patient-Specific Biologically Targeted Therapy Pediatric Patients With Refractory Or Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study assign specific drug treatment base lab test perform participant 's tumor tumor tissue take biopsy do he/she first diagnose take he/she relapse progress . All participant get Temozolomide Etoposide start . Then depend review participant 's tumor tissue he/she also receive one following : Sorafenib , Everolimus , Erlotinib , Dasatinib . The purpose research study learn feasibility obtain use information study do tumor tissue order help make treatment decision patient relapse refractory pediatric brain tumor . The investigator also want find effect therapy participant participant 's brain tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological confirmation brain tumor diagnosis relapse tumor . There must document progression recurrence disease MRI image CSF study since completion last tumordirected medical therapy . Patients may surgical resection radiation tumor , need measurable evaluable disease study entry . Patient 's current disease state must one know curative therapy . Age great 1 month less 30 year time enrollment . BSA great 0.3 m2 time enrollment . Karnofsky &gt; /= 50 % patient &gt; 16 year age , Lansky &gt; /= 50 % patient &lt; /= 16 year age . Neurologic deficits patient CNS tumor must relatively stable minimum 7 day . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Adequate bone marrow function include : ANC &gt; 750 Platelet count &gt; 100,000/uL without platelet transfusion within past 7 day Adequate renal function define creatinine within normal range age calculate GFR &gt; 100 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Adequate liver function define Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal . Adequate CNS function : Patients know seizure disorder must seizures adequately control nonenzyme inducing antiepileptic medication No increase steroid dose within past 7 day . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy : Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within 3 week entry onto study ( 6 week prior nitrosourea ) . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 7 day since completion therapy growth factor , 14 day longacting ( e.g . PEGfilgrastim ) Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day 3 halflives ( whichever longer ) since completion therapy biologic agent . Radiation therapy : ≥ 12 week must elapse craniospinal radiation ; ≥ 2 week must elapse focal radiation . Surgery : &gt; 3 week major surgery . If recent craniotomy , adequate wound heal must determine neurosurgical team prior start study therapy . Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Rescue : No evidence active graft vs. host disease ≥ 4 week must elapse . All patient and/or legal guardian must sign institutionally approve write informed consent document . Patients breastfeed , pregnant refuse use effective form birth control exclude . Abstinence consider effective form birth control . Patients uncontrolled infection exclude . Patients know bleed disorder punctate intratumoral hemorrhage exclude . Patients receive antineoplastic agent exclude . Patients enzymeinducing anticonvulsive agent exclude . Patients require strong CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor exclude . Patients require anticoagulation uncontrolled bleeding exclude . Patients steroids symptom management must stable dose 7 day prior study enrollment . Patients within 1 year allogeneic stem cell transplant , patient active GVHD require immunosuppression exclude .</criteria>
