	<brief_summary>Pathogenesis hip dysplasia Hip dysplasia multifactorial origin influence genetic intrauterine factor , mechanical ( rump presentation oligohydramnios ) hormonal factors1 . To ease passage birth canal , hip joint quite mobile perinatally . Postnatally , laxity ligament subside femoral head normally position deeply acetabulum2 . The theory femoral head migrate sufficiently acetabulum , dysplasia may develop matrice stimulate acetabular growth correctly position . Normally , birth femoral head sits deep acetabulum hold surface tension synovial liquid . The growth hemispherical morphology acetabulum dependent presence normally grow correctly place spherical femoral head work convex matrice . If reason normal development disturb pre- postnatally , pathologic relation may develop femoral head acetabulum3 , lead hip dysplasia . Purpose research project investigate correction acetabulum accurately perform surgeon use navigation equipment PAO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Capacity After Computer Assisted Periacetabular Osteotomy Patients With Hip Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morphological change hip dysplasia The dysplastic hip joint complex morphology characterise wide shallow acetabular cavity excessively oblique articulate roof . The acetabular cover femoral head globally deficient4 ; 5 acetabular rim hypertrophy possibly due excessive pull often hypertrophic labrum . Anteversion normal5-7 , occasionally acetabulum retroverted8 ; 9 . The weight-bearing area acetabular roof head reduce articular cartilage significantly thicker normal10 . Hip dysplasia often associate increased anteversion femoral neck5 ; 11 valgus neck-shaft angle result reduce abductor lever arm12 . However deformity vary individual individual retroversion femoral neck also report hip dysplasia12 . Patients hip dysplasia prone develop osteoarthritis hip young age 13 ; 14 . The reason fully understood , explanation could reduce contact area acetabulum femoral head well reduced abductor lever arm increase load per contact-area hip joint4 . The increased load strain articular cartilage believe result degeneration cartilage subchondral bone eventually osteoarthritis14-17 . The purpose periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) increase acetabular cover femoral head thereby distribute pressure well available cartilage surface . PAO follow rehabilitation At PAO , pubic bone osteotomized fluoroscopic control , ischial osteotomy posterior iliac osteotomy perform . The acetabular fragment reposition optimise coverage femoral head . The reposition challenge clearly demand aspect procedure18 . Four week discharge , rehabilitation initiate carry two physiotherapist specialise orthopaedics . The patient come hospital physiotherapy twice week exercise session 1 hour 30-minute aerobic strength program follow 30-minute program mobility gait training . Physiotherapy end 2-3 month PAO physiotherapists assess patient achieve predetermined functional goal e.g . walk speed without crutch ability run . As result patient ' young age , high physical function aim , regain level function PAO . It yet examine whether PAO patient surgery attain functional capacity comparable age- gender-matched population .</detailed_description>
