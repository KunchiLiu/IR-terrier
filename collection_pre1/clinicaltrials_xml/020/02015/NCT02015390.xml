	<brief_summary>The United States Department Defense ( DoD ) fund excite new research University Texas Medical Branch ( UTMB ) Department Orthopaedic Surgery Rehabilitation major improvement treatment extremity trauma involve segmental bone loss . These devastate injury occur frequently civilian military . They typically result motor vehicle accident , high-energy fracture , gunshot injury , blast injury , also surgical removal bone segment infection tumor . Despite many modern medical advance area , bone heal adequately replace bone loss restore pre-injury limb function extremely difficult achieve . Existing standard treatment procedure exceedingly complicate , require highly specialized equipment clinical skill , usually require many surgical procedure many month year . Despite effort cost , major complication usually occur standard treatment option , patient 's ability return acceptable functional status typically low , , therefore , many patient limbs amputate . The UTMB Department Orthopaedic Surgery Rehabilitation conduct DoD-funded clinical trial determine compare advantage two new innovative surgical bone defect treatment technique significantly effective wound warrior civilian patient condition . One treatment method , call `` Masquelet Technique '' , involve two-stage surgery : first one create biomembrane around defect apply cement spacer , second one cement spacer removal defect bone grafting . The method , develop UTMB physician , `` Cage Technique '' comprise one-stage surgery special hollow , fenestrated , titanium cage fill bone graft implant defect . Initial clinical experience technique promising , date , prospective clinical study compare two new method defect treatment . Identifying optimal surgical bone defect reconstructive technique would significantly improve clinical outcome patient challenge condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Masquelet Versus Titanium Mesh Cage Techniques Treatment Large Long Bone Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Segmental long bone defect remain formidable treatment challenge . All exist standard treatment option major limitation often culminate limb amputation permanent functional deficit . We develop novel , one-stage alternative treatment segmental bone loss utilizes cylindrical titanium mesh cage ( CTMC ) combination bone graft , establish clinical merit initial clinical series . Shortly thereafter , Masquelet report another new defect reconstruction technique involve two-stage approach : first induce biomembrane formation cement spacer , subsequent spacer removal bone grafting . Both Masquelet CTMC technique base principle graft containment render optimal potential graft heal defect ; however , differ primary biological versus biomechanical function provide containment . The Masquelet biomembrane containment , rich source vascular supply growth factor , create excellent biological milieu graft , require additional surgery associate prolong protected weight bearing graft consolidation occur . Conversely , benefit CTMC technique primarily biomechanical support provide graft reconstruct extremity , thereby permit immediate functional restoration without mobility weight bearing restriction bone heal process . Although Masquelet CTMC technique effective treatment large segmental bone defect , prospective , well-controlled study compare therapeutic efficacy specific clinical indication . Objective : Determining clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness Masquelet ( Arm I ) versus CTMC technique ( Arm II ) combination reamer-irrigator-aspirator ( RIA ) harvest autograft ( Option A ) allograft-demineralized bone matrix ( DBM ) composite ( Option II ) treatment segmental long bone deficiency . Specific Aims : 1 ) Establish effect specific patient bone defect characteristic treatment outcome ; 2 ) Determine compare clinical efficacy reconstruction technique ( Arm I vs Arm II ) ; 3 ) Establish merit use specific graft type ( Option A v Option B ) within across study arm ; 3 ) Develop quantitative predictive model improve clinical decision making , 4 ) Assess compare cost-effectiveness resource expenditure incur specific treatment selection . Study Design : Single-center , multi-site , two-arm , randomized clinical trial . Thirty patient segmental bone deficiency result trauma , gunshot , iatrogenic resection due infection , nonunion , neoplasm enrol randomize receive either Masquelet ( Arm I ) CTMC definitive defect treatment ( Arm II ) . Bone graft selection include either RIA-harvested autograft ( Option A ) allograft croutons-DBM composite ( Option B ) . Patients follow to18 month . The data collect include routine patient baseline information , systemic extremity injury characteristic , bone defect characteristic , pre- post-operative clinical examination image , validate functional outcome measure , associate cost expenditure . Descriptive statistic use analyze compare result specifically related rate defect heal functional recovery . Paired t-test used test effect defect reconstruction option outcome measure . Analysis covariance use pair-wise comparison arm within/across bone graft option . Multiple model use produce accurate predictive model account possible morbidity interaction . Derived joint distribution cost effect , cost-effectiveness acceptability curve establish compare study arm . Military Relevance : Many combat injury involve extremity trauma segmental bone loss , extent successfully treat impact function quality life wound warrior . The Masquelet CTMC develop innovative , biologically-sound defect reconstructive technique address complexity therapeutic concern associate condition ( ie , immediate restoration limb alignment/stability , early motion , weight bearing ) . The propose trial aim compare efficacy technique identify one instantly adopt applied military surgeon .</detailed_description>
