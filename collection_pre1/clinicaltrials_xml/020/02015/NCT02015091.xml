	<brief_summary>Background : - People bite mosquito carry weaken malaria parasite could fight disease later expose normal malaria parasite . Scientists discover make weaken parasite , inject PfSPZ vaccine . Researchers want see people receive vaccine get malaria bite control setting ( control human malaria infection , CHMI ) . Objective : - To see PfSPZ malaria vaccine safe prevents malaria control set . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 45 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood lab test , EKG . - Participants split 8 group , study 3 12 month . - Participants receive 3 5 vaccination , inject needle arm vein muscle . - Participants keep health diary contact phone . - For CHMI , cup mosquito carry malaria apply participant arm 5 minute . Five mosquito time use , 5 bitten . Some group expose malaria . - After CHMI , participant visit clinic frequently ( include daily visit 12 day ) 28 day . - Blood drawn visit , 1 20 tube . Physical exam medical history may also repeat - Participants develop malaria treat immediately clinic . Standard treatment take 72 hour . Malaria symptom may last 3 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Controlled Human Malaria Infections Evaluate Protection After Intravenous Intramuscular Administration PfSPZ Vaccine Malaria-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VRC 314 design open-label evaluation safety , tolerability , immunogenicity protective efficacy PfSPZ Vaccine . This vaccine administer 1.35 time 10 ( 5 ) PfSPZ per injection IV route schedule 5 vaccination previously show confer protection vaccinate subject CHMI perform shortly last vaccination ; however limit durability protection small number protect subject rechallenged several month later . This study design substantiate initial result IV vaccination route protection CHMI . Based potential importance dose schedule optimize sustain immunity vaccine , increase PfSPZ IV dosage schedule 3 5 vaccination evaluate protection CHMI conduct early ( 3 week ) late ( 24 week ) completion vaccination . To assess high dose give another route confers protection , one group receive PfSPZ IM , half amount administer arm schedule 4 vaccination . The primary objective study relate safety tolerability vaccination IV IM rout administration protection Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) challenge perform via well-established CHMI procedure early ( 2-4 week ) complete schedule 3 5 vaccination . The secondary objective relate durability protection 20-26 week last vaccination exploratory objective related immunogenicity PfSPZ Vaccine identify potential immune correlate protection .</detailed_description>
