	<brief_summary>The prevalence Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) rise rapidly worldwide . In Denmark approximately 8 % adult T2D 25.000 diagnose year . This vast consequence society patient . Standardized treatment aim normalize blood glucose hypertension comparable healthy individual , test large study . The effect cardiovascular disease complication modest best one study show increase mortality intensive treatment . The standardized treatment often result polypharmacy , increase risk patient discontinue treatment . We propose new approach treatment T2D , patient ' individual characteristic consider . The aetiology diabetes different , warrant different treatment . Many patient concomitant illness affect way patient treat . A tight regulation blood glucose patient constitute risk adverse effect , especially hypoglycemia . In sense individual target treatment important . Effective lifestyle treatment importance successful outcome therefore offer application help patient physician organize activity individually . The objective individual treatment choose effective medication . If prescribe drug desire effect replace different drug . The overall goal reduce number substance side-effects , simultaneous improve treatment reduce incidence cardiovascular diabetes-related complication . This turn result improve quality life improve adherence treatment . The potential effect individual tailor treatment T2D improve guideline treatment , improve patient ' health , also reduce socioeconomic consequence grow T2D prevalence</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design prospective randomise control open-label multicenter trial . General practitioner region southern Denmark responsible treatment , central visit additional data sample locate Odense University hospital hospital south west Denmark , Esbjerg . The inclusion phase run 2 year . The follow-up phase 10 year inclusion . Registries employ characterization patient sample end-points . Concomitant medication sample National Prescription Database . Concomitant illness identification endpoint sample Registry Patients , Registry Cause Death , Danish Registry Regular Dialysis transplantation , Danish general practice database , The National Indicator project , Statistics Denmark , The National Indicator Project , The Danish Cancer Registry , DD2-database local database . Treatment The control group treat accord national guideline . The intervention group treat accord individual assessment . Several approach employ achieve individualization . - Identification pathophysiological trait order choose correct medication target hyperglycaemia . Identification pathophysiological trait , genetic testing , GAD antibodies C-peptid level , individualize treatment hyperglycaemia accord follow group : MODY ( maturity onset diabetes young ) , LADA ( latent autoimmune diabetes adult ) , steroid-induced diabetes , insulinopenic diabetes , secondary diabetes patient insulin resistance . Specific treatment algorithm apply group . - Individualized target patient regard hyperglycaemia . The target choose basis age , motivation , skill , risk hypoglycaemic event , therapy resistance , initial hba1c concomitant illness . As factor change target adjust accordingly . - Hemodynamic characterization impedance cardiography use order individualize anti-hypertensive medication . - Individualized target patient regard hypertension . The target choose basis concomitant risk factor . Further individualization achieve discontinue drug proven effective within three-month period proven side-effects . Treatment algorithms intervention group . Hyperglycemia - MODY ( characterize genetic test ) : Glimepiride repaglinide type 1 3 . 1 ) diet , 2 ) basal insulin type 2 . Basal insulin type 5 - LADA ( GAD positive &gt; 30UI/ml ) : basal bolus insulin-regime . Metformin BMI &gt; 25 - Secondary diabetes ( HOMA-beta &lt; 78.45 % AND history pancreatitis similar ) : basal bolus insulin regime - Steroid induced diabetes : 1 ) meal time insulin 2 ) metformin 3 ) basal insulin fast blood glucose 7 - Insulinopenic type 2 diabetes ( HOMA2-beta &lt; 78.45 % AND HOMA2-S &gt; 105.5 % ) : 1 ) metformin 2 ) insulin , basal 3 ) meal time insulin - Classical type 2 diabetes ( HOMA2-beta &lt; 78.45 % AND HOMA2-S &lt; 105.5 % ) : 1 ) metformin 2 ) GLP-1 analogues* 3 ) basal insulin 4 ) meal time insulin . - Hyperinsulinemic type 2 diabetes ( HOMA2-beta &gt; 78.45 % AND HOMA2-S &lt; 105.5 % ) In patient BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 gastric bypass pharmacological treatment consider equally . In patient BMI &lt; 35 kg/m2 pharmacological treatment option : 1 . In patient BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 gastric bypass consider accord current national criterion preference patient . 2 . 1 ) metformin 2 ) GLP-1 analogues* 3 ) Glitazones ( pioglitazone currently register ) 4 ) insulin , basal 5 ) meal time insulin If mark oedema develop relation institution glitazones treatment terminate . If patient osteoporosis , glitazones generally use . If patient heart failure glitazones use . *In case patient reluctant inject economical objection , DD4-inhibitors choose . Premixed insulin use instead basal insulin instead basal insulin+mealtime insulin whenever deem relevant treat physician Hypertension Hemodynamic characterization impedance cardiography use order individualize anti-hypertensive medication . By impedance measure vascular resistance , intravascular volemia inotropy obtain . All patient treat ACE inhibitor . Secondary medication general achieve follow algorithm : High vascular resistance : 1 . Use ACE-inhibitor add calcium-channel blocker ( CCB ) exist ACE-inhibitor . 2 . In case resistance increase 100 % neither ACE-inhibitor CCB give , consecutive add accord blood pressure . If hypervolemia present address CCB introduce . 3 . If intravascular volume normal blood pressure high ACE-inhibitor ; use CCB - also resistance normal High intravascular volume : 1 ) Use hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg combine ACE inhibitor one pill possible . Else use bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg . If patient already receive diuretic , spironolactone use . Start 25mg , maximum dose 50mg . If kalium 4.3 impaired kidney function present start 12.5mg . Control kalium paramount . High inotropy 1 ) High inotropy might change institution drug . Introduce CCB first secondly thiazide patient normovolemic . In reverse order patient hypervolemic normal vascular resistance . Therefore high inotropy treat carvedilol 1 ) patient receive ACE inhibitor , thiazide CCB impedance measure high inotropy make ACE-inhibitor , thiazide CCB start . Lifestyle A dietician employed make write material regard diet . A Cookbook make available online , together accompany grocery list . The diet do accord composition 20 % protein , 40 % fat 40 % carbohydrate improve glycemic control . The extra percentage fat , compare current recommendation come polyunsaturated fat . To facilitate exercise accelerometer hand individual goal exercise set . A novel interface accelerometer use monitor exercise do thereby enable patient physician evaluate effort . Interval walk general focus exercise guidance , patient individual exercise preference . Individual goal exercise effort set software modify goal accord current fitness . Goal set intervention group Treatment hyperglycaemia make accord follow goal - Optimal control HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % ( 48 mmol/mol ) - Acceptable control hba1c &lt; 7.5 % ( 58 mmol/mol ) - Free symptom , best possible Hb1ac within restraint The general practitioner free choose goal applicable , accord mention criterion . In patient neuropathy former cardiovascular disease extra vigilance take optimal control choose . If patient develops severe hypoglycaemic event , repeat measure blood glucose 4.0 mmol/l therapy resistant , goal reassess . Treatment hypertension make accord follow goal 1 . BT &lt; 135/85 patient microalbuminuria , increased creatinine establish cardiovascular disease 2 . BT &lt; 140/90 patient without complication First visit primary physician In control group schedule deem necessary physician In intervention group schedule locate baseline visit central hospital , order achieve collection relevant data individualization . Periodic visit primary physician These take place every 3 month . At visit treatment institute accord specify algorithm . If goal meet , interval 1 month recommend intervention group .
