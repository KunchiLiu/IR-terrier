	<brief_title>Januvia ( Sitagliptin ) Healing Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes diabetes related complication major cost burden healthcare system encompass 1/5 overall healthcare dollar United States [ 1 ] . Much cost related treatment low extremity wound diabetic patient account 60 % nontraumatic amputation perform [ 2 ] . Amputation often precede chronic ulceration . The incidence diabetic ulcer approximately 6 % 3 year period [ 1 ] . Diabetic foot ulceration particularly challenge heal due host factor include vascular compromise , peripheral neuropathy , begin prone infection . Therefore , strategy heal wound quickly possible paramount importance . Current strategy chronic wound heal limited topical ointments/therapies , allografts/xenografts without cell impregnation , dressing , wound heal device . None current modality show clearly effective another [ 3,4 ] . Currently , oral medication examine heal chronic ulceration . Particularly , antihyperglycemic medication study specifically purpose wound heal . Glucose control wound heal show related [ 5-7 ] . However , think wound heal result tight glucose control merely global effect rather direct result medication utilized evidence indicate specific antihyperglycemic medication work well another . Further , mechanism relationship exist well understood . Specifically , microenvironment wound evidence change biomarkers delineate . Januvia ( sitagliptin ) FDA approve antihyperglycemic drug inhibits enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , enzyme responsible breakdown glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) . By block effect , GLP-1 GIP stimulate secretion insulin suppress release glucagon thereby normalize blood glucose . The unique property drug decrease likelihood hypoglycemia . Therefore , drug often use combination antihyperglycemic medication produce synergistic effect . DPP4 express membrane variety cell type well soluble form , cleave two N-terminal amino acid , X-ala X-pro , limited number peptide substrate , usually result inactivation . A family DPP4 inhibitor , gliptins , show preserve full-length active form GLP1 GIP patient type II diabetes , enhance antihyperglycemic activity . In addition GLP1 GIP , important substrate DPP4 essential wound healing , alter diabetes , include SDF-1α/β ( stromal cell derive factor 1 ) , PYY ( peptide YY ) , NPY ( neuropeptide Y ) , GM-CSF ( granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ) , G-CSF ( granulocyte colony stimulate factor ) , IL3 ( interleukin 3 ) [ 8-12 ] . SDF , PYY , NPY important angiogenesis , GM-CSF , G-CSF , IL3 necessary leukocyte proliferation infiltration wound bed . The observation DPP4 cleave inactive signaling molecule vivo suggest modulation DPP4 activity direct effect wound heal . The prospect daily oral medication improve overall glucose control diabetic patient well expedite wound heal process profound . This study explore possibility . This prospective , randomize study examine ability sitagliptin expedite wound heal process diabetic patient chronic foot wound . This single center study 250 total subject randomize 2 arm . It project study take 3 year complete . The two arm 1 ) Januvia ( sitagliptin ) 100mg q day* 2 ) placebo-control q day . Patients Type II diabetes chronic foot ulcer enrol study . Each subject randomize one two arm participate study maximum 16 week . At end 16 week subject exit study . If time course study wound heals , subject exit study 2-week confirmatory visit . *For moderate renal failure subject , sitagliptin dose adjust 50mg q day .</detailed_description>
