	<brief_summary>The treatment pterygium still quite controversial . Previous study use large incision pterygium excision large graft report low recurrence rate P.E.R.F.E.C.T . technique . However , P.E.R.F.E.C.T . technique relatively lengthy procedure may suitable patient limited conjunctival reserve . Thus , try evaluate final outcome sutureless amniotic membrane transplant technique combine extended pterygium excision hope avoid complication P.E.R.F.E.C.T . PTERYGIUM technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment pterygium still quite controversial . There lack consensus ophthalmological community optimal surgical management pterygium . The main challenge successful surgical treatment pterygium recurrence , evidence fibrovascular growth across limbus onto cornea . Previous study use large incision pterygium excision large graft report low recurrence rate P.E.R.F.E.C.T . technique . However , P.E.R.F.E.C.T . PTERYGIUM technique perfect since lengthy procedure , require meticulous handle tissue , associate significant postoperative pain , frequently , transient diplopia . Therefore , try evaluate final outcome sutureless amniotic membrane transplant technique combine extended pterygium excision hope avoid complication P.E.R.F.E.C.T . PTERYGIUM technique . This sutureless technique tissue glue may promote increase clinical use amniotic membrane patch alleviate patient ' pain shorten surgical time .</detailed_description>
