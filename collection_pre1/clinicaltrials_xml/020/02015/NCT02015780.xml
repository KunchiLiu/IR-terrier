	<brief_title>Fasiglifam Type 2 Diabetic Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 4 5 Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call fasiglifam . Fasiglifam test treat people diabetes chronic kidney disease . This study look glycemic control people take fasiglifam addition standard antihyperglycemic therapy . The study enroll approximately 164 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Fasiglifam 50 mg ; - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient . All participant ask take one tablet time day throughout study addition current antihyperglycemic therapy . All participant ask record time hypoglycemia sign symptom diary . This multi-center trial conduct United States European region . The overall time participate study approximately 57 week . Participants make 17 visit clinic . Due potential concern liver safety , balance , benefit treat patient fasiglifam ( TAK-875 ) outweigh potential risk . For reason , Takeda decide voluntarily terminate development activity fasiglifam .</detailed_description>
