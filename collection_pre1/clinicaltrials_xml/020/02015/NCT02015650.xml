	<brief_summary>Concomitant radio-chemotherapy become standard therapy advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Local side effect cause chemotherapy , like mucositis , increase combination radiotherapy . Mucositis , painful inflammation ulceration oral mucosa , limit patient´s treatment plan . Studies show one third patient discontinue Chemotherapy side effect . Accordingly side effect , patient eat habit get limit . This require increase pain medication , mostly opioid derivate , cause side effect , require symptomatic medication . This require change nutrition hard pappy food impairing , liquid food need . A central vein catheter do parental nutrition gastrostomy enteral nutrition , mean risk haemorrhage increase risk bacteraemias sepsis patient . This would mean decrease general condition dose reduction treatment stop need . Accordingly , result treatment delay prolongation hospital stay . Risk study know side effect product : Mitomycin-C , 5-Fluorouracile , Cetuximab radiation therapy . These list particular product description description radiation thera-py . Another risk would primary objective fulfil . So patient would lower quality life expect . Following benefit expect . Benefit patient : - Decrease mucositis side effect cause mucositis , also xerostomia , taste disturbance , dietary restriction , dysphagia - Decrease pain medication side effect cause pain medication - Decrease surgical intervention ( gastric tube , central venous catheter ) risk cause intervention ( sepsis , bacteraemia , bleeding , injury heart stomach , etc . ) - Improving patient social functioning , social eating , social contact - No interruption therapy - Increase life quality - Weight stabilization Benefit clinical practice : - Increase compliance - Fulfilling complete therapy - Hospital stay plan</brief_summary>
