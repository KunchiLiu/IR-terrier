	<brief_title>A New Algorithm Predict Ovarian Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The normal process reproductive age varies considerably among woman . This imply woman remain highly fertile fifth decade life , whereas others face loss natural fertility already mid-thirties . Female reproductive age seem largely base age relate change ovarian function . Decreasing number follicle , coincide diminish oocyte quality , dictate gradual change menstrual cycle regularity monthly fecundity inevitable evolution menopause . The mechanism behind observed gradual decline follicle pool reduce oocyte quality far fully understood , although recent knowledge regard endocrine , paracrine , genetic , metabolic factor involve lead well understand immensely complex puzzle . Within context normal female reproductive aging , already outline , large individual variation exist age various reproductive event occur . This variation major implication preventive management age-related decrease fertility general health risk associate extremely early menopause condition POF . Moreover , distance menopause important parameter lead clinician 's choice appropriate timing surgical treatment benign gynecological pathology . Although chronological age important predictor physiological ovarian response endogenous exogenous Follicle-stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) , environmental genetic factor contribute biological ovarian ageing , chronological biological age always equivalent . Among genetic factor able determine age menopause occur , important size initial oocyte stock , proportion undergoes atresia rate initiation follicles growth . It suggest , moreover , certain single nucleotide polymorphism ( regard FSH receptor genotype ) also affect sensitivity gonadotrophin ovarian age [ Alviggi 45 ] . Environmental factor diet , cigarette smoking , regimens chemotherapy radiotherapy , endometriosis ovarian surgery may shorten functional lifespan woman 's ovary . Even continuous follicle loss recognize late stage cycle irregularity , endocrine ultrasound marker emerge last decade may express accurately follicle number decline long time period . Among endocrine parameter , study used clinical practice FSH , Estradiol ( E2 ) Anti-Mullerian Hormone ( AMH ) . Basal FSH , extensively study past decade , provide indirect marker ovarian reserve . FSH level increase advance age , reduce negative feedback FSH release pituitary [ broekm vecchio 10 ] . High FSH level therefore represent small cohort size . To exclude possibility confound factor , E2 level great 50 pg/ml , suppress FSH secretion , parameter always evaluate together menstrual cycle day 1-4 . In woman vary degree hypergonadotropism ( range imminent ovarian failure full-blown POF ) , however , good parameter ass extent ovarian follicle depletion seem represent AMH ( Broekm 109 ) . It dimeric glycoprotein autocrine paracrine action follicle development , exclusively produce granulose cell preantral ( primary secondary ) small antral follicle ( 2-7 mm diameter ) . The number small antral follicle directly relate total size primordial follicle pool ( Broekm 68 ) . With decrease number antral follicle age , AMH serum level also become diminished ( Br 66 , 95 , 104 ) invariably become undetectable near menopause ( Br 65 ) . Recent study indeed suggest AMH serum level represent ovarian quantitative reserve ( Br 105-107 ) may provide index age menopause . Regarding ultrasound marker , several study , recently , demonstrate Antral Follicle Count ( AFC ) , define total number antral follicle , size 2-10 mm , present ovary , represent good marker either chronological age basal FSH assess ovarian biological age [ alviggi 89 ] also correlate occurrence menopausal transition ( broekm 66 ) , indicate parameter relate strongly quantitative aspect ovarian reserve . As AFC , ovarian volume , measure vaginal ultrasound , associate ovarian functional asset also transvaginal ultrasound use power Doppler often use evaluate blood flow ovary natural cycle . Several study , moreover , show ovarian flow index baseline ultrasound scan correlate subsequent follicular response may new indicator predict ovarian responsiveness IVF treatment ( Sattar 2005 ) The added value ovarian volume stromal blood flow , however , either individually together , AFC endocrine marker , predictability ovarian age assess multivariate module . The challenge ovarian reserve test , anyhow , lie possibility identify woman reduce reproductive life span early stage life adequate action take . Basal endocrine level sonographic parameter , however , usually consider low specificity sensitivity use predict low ovarian reserve infertile woman ( Younis 2010 ) prognosticate distance menopause . Although simple test extensively investigate past seldom look combination . On contrary , improvement test identification woman reduce ovarian life span probably come combine endocrine image evaluation .</detailed_description>
