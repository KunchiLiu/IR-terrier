	<brief_summary>This study address racial/ethnic disparity HIV/AIDS treatment . Many person live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) U.S. ( 10-19 % PLHA ) , predominantly African-Americans Latinos , delay take Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) late course HIV disease never initiate HAART medically indicate . However , behavioral intervention increase HAART initiation among PLHA delay decline HAART ( `` PLHA-DD '' ) . The overarch aim propose study develop flexible , target , sustainable behavioral intervention increase HAART initiation among PLHA-DD , , efficacious , lead reduction morbidity , early mortality , health care cost , well increased viral load suppression ( reduce transmission others ) . Further , study complement prim participant exist adherence intervention , PLHA-DD benefit initiate HAART .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timely Initiation HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Among Those Who Delay/Decline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application seek reduce racial/ethnic disparity HIV/AIDS treatment . National study consistently show many person live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) U.S. ( estimate 10-19 % PLHA ) , predominantly people color , delay take Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) late HIV disease never initiate HAART medically necessary , even engage care . This population critical importance experience disproportionately high morbidity earlier mortality compare peer HAART , high health care cost . Further , less likely achieve virologic suppression , increase probability HIV transmission others . However , yet behavioral intervention increase timely initiation continue use HAART PLHA-DD . This proposal seek address serious gap exist program create culturally target , sustainable , multi-level , individualized video-based behavioral intervention population PLHA medically eligible HAART delayed decline HAART ( refer `` PLHA-DD '' ) . This adherence intervention per se , serve complement , primer , exist adherence intervention , PLHA-DD benefit initiate HAART . The propose study innovative seek broaden HAART adherence research paradigm include HAART initiation . Barriers HAART initiation PLHA-DD multi-faceted . At individual level , example , PLHA-DD suffer negative attitude toward HAART ( particularly medical mistrust fear ) , lack accurate knowledge HAART health , `` compete priority , '' include mental health problem substance use . PLHA-DD also experience powerful social barrier HAART include negative peer norm regard medication stigma . Further , structural barrier poor access necessary resource support ( e.g. , transportation , paperwork ) ancillary service ( e.g. , mental health care ) impede HAART initiation . We create culturally target video-based intervention increase motivation psychosocial practical preparedness HAART among PLHA-DD . The study guide two complementary theoretical model : Theory Triadic Influence , social-cognitive theory integrates individual , social , structural influence health behavior Anti-racist Stance , acknowledge salience barrier link racial/ethnic minority status live PLHA-DD ( associate exclusion , stress , discrimination , poor access institutional structure ) , without assume homogeneity among PLHA-DD . The intervention flexible individualize : 12-week intervention period participant receive three structured session ( include one `` support partner '' reduce social barrier , plus patient navigation , efficacious low-threshold adaptable approach reduce individual structural barrier initiate sustain HAART . The intensity navigation depend need , increase intervention 's efficiency . The session consist individualized interactive component target high-quality video component , enhance ease-of-use , fidelity , future sustainability . The aims three-year project : 1 . Explore health care social service provider ' PLHA-DD 's perspective barrier to/facilitators initiation continuation HAART PLHA-DD level individual , network , organization , structure ; 2 . Develop component intervention examine acceptability , safety , feasibility , gather preliminary evidence efficacy respect HAART initiation continuation among PLHA-DD medically eligible HAART . To accomplish aim , conduct three phase study : ( 1 ) Elicitation Phase explore barrier HAART among PLHA-DD ( n=16 ) health care social service provider ( N=18 ) ; ( 2 ) Development Phase create intervention component use Intervention Mapping , mechanism integrate theoretical model , data , literature ; ( 3 ) Evaluation Phase test revise intervention component ( N=30-50 PLHA-DD recruit two large urban HIV clinic assign intervention control arm use permuted block random assignment interview 3 time point ) . We also explore peer recruitment approach reach PLHA-DD . PLHA recruit peer see local field site engage procedure clinic-recruited cohort . We enroll total 90-100 PLHA-DD , ideally half clinic half peer recruitment . The urgent need address disparity HAART initiation continuation support access HAART vulnerable population identify numerous scientific community leader , health care provider , public health official . Although PLHA-DD modest proportion population PLHA ( 10-19 % ) , efficacious intervention reduce morbidity , increase longevity , increase viral load suppression , reduce health care cost associate delayed HAART initiation sorely lack group , high potential public health significance .</detailed_description>
