	<brief_summary>Acute aortic dissection ( AD ) deadly , difficult diagnose disease present array common unspecific symptom . Aortic dissection detection ( ADD ) risk score bedside clinical tool estimate risk AD . D-dimer evaluate several study biomarker AD , show pool diagnostic sensitivity 97 % . However , consider severe morbidity mortality AD , negative D-dimer per se consider insufficient rule-out AD unselected patient . The aim present study evaluate whether diagnostic performance D-dimer differs patient different clinical risk AD , particular whether negative D-dimer test may allow safe rule-out AD patient subgroup without necessity perform urgent aortic imaging . Consecutive adult patient suspect AD present ED enrol establishment final diagnosis ; standardize clinical form comprehensive presence/absence 12 risk marker allow ADD risk score fulfil d-dimer level measure presentation . The aortic imaging exam use confirm refuse AD compute tomography angiography transesophageal echocardiography final diagnosis establish review available data . The accuracy , failure rate efficiency diagnostic strategy combine standardized clinical stratification via ADD risk score D-dimer test therefore assess .</brief_summary>
