	<brief_summary>The Translocator Protein ( TSPO ) protein reach high level inflammation brain . Recently , radioligands developed attach TSPO ( radioligand drug tag radioactivity ) . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging , radioligand detect follow injection patient . However , difficult accurately measure amount TSPO use PET moment . This brain `` reference region '' TSPO ( ie area brain TSPO ) . `` Reference region '' useful help work much PET signal represent `` specific binding '' ( radioligand target interest ) , much represent `` non specific binding '' ( radioligand many structure interest ) . In absence reference region , non specific bind estimated give drug bind TSPO . The drug prevents radioligand bind TSPO ( manner speak ) `` creates '' temporary reference region non specific binding measure . To , use XBD173 ( Emapunil anxiolytic drug act selective agonist peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ) bind TSPO block bind PET ligand ( [ 11C ] PBR28 ) , TSPO ligand phenoxyarlyacetamide class . Most TSPO PET study ( one previous study approve West London REC ) quantify signal use ratio specific bind brain radioactivity blood . This require arterial line insertion burdensome subject , increase variability . In study aim determine ratio specific bind brain nonspecific binding brain use temporary reference region . For accuracy participant repeat scan procedure determine test-retest variability amount TSPO .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Translocator Protein ( TSPO ) protein reach high level inflammation brain . Recently , radioligands developed attach TSPO ( radioligand drug tag radioactivity ) . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging , radioligand detect follow injection patient . However , difficult accurately measure amount TSPO use PET moment . This brain `` reference region '' TSPO ( ie area brain TSPO ) . `` Reference region '' useful help work much PET signal represent `` specific binding '' ( radioligand target interest ) , much represent `` non specific binding '' ( radioligand many structure interest ) . In absence reference region , non specific bind estimated give drug bind TSPO . The drug prevents radioligand bind TSPO ( manner speak ) `` creates '' temporary reference region non specific binding measure . The aim study , therefore , develop method allow accurate quantification TSPO expression brain healthy subject . The study also include patient multiple sclerosis determine reproducibility 11C-PBR28 PET signal population characterise raise TSPO signal . This vital since 11C-PBR28 PET signal evaluate marker disease activity treatment response , condition characterise neuroinflammation include MS . If high test re-test variability people raise TSPO signal , argue usefulness 11C-PBR28 PET purposes.To , use XBD173 ( Emapunil anxiolytic drug act selective agonist peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ) bind TSPO block bind PET ligand ( [ 11C ] PBR28 ) , TSPO ligand phenoxyarlyacetamide class . Because different people possess different type TSPO ( due genetic difference subject , 3 type TSPO expression pattern ) important study subject 3 group . We study healthy volunteer patient multiple sclerosis . Each subject undergo : 1 . Screening visit , take blood determine TSPO subtype subject . 2 . Study day 1 : subject undergo two PET/CT scan MRI scan brain . This involve insertion arterial line . In two PET scan , subject give oral dose XBD173 ( 90mg ) . 3 . Study day 2 : Repeat procedure Study day 1 . Only one MRI scan do one two study visit . Recruitment Healthy volunteer recruit poster ( include e-posters electronic notice board email ) , announcements lecture , word mouth around Imperial College campus . MS patient recruit Neurology clinic across Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust Hospitals , Charing Cross Hospital St Mary 's Hospital . Patients may refer University College London Hospital National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery suitable study . Male female participant 18 70 include . Women child bear potential undergo urinary pregnancy test prior scan ensure pregnant .</detailed_description>
