	<brief_summary>As survival rate critical illness improve , strategy return patient baseline cognitive functional status important research priority . Up 100 % ICU survivor suffer degree cognitive impairment hospital discharge approximately 50 % decrement persist year . While mechanisms newly acquire brain injury poorly understood , several risk factor identify . Unfortunately , unclear accurately predict long-term cognitive impairment . Immediate opportunity improve cognitive outcome risk reduction exist . The investigator propose comprehensively study prevalence sleep abnormality association cognitive impairment , may yield potential target effective therapy . Moreover , investigator examine gene x environment association [ APOE ε4 ] may allow genetic risk stratification individual great risk cognitive impairment . The investigator hypothesize EEG [ sensitive longitudinal marker brain dysfunction ] novel independent predictor long-term cognitive impairment , possibly candidate intermediate end point future clinical trial . This study potential identify novel biomarkers risk factor post-critical illness cognitive impairment , may lay foundation rational intervention mitigate risk high-risk individual .</brief_summary>
