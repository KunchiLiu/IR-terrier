	<brief_title>Sleep Disordered Breathing , Obesity Pregnancy Study ( SOAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emerging data support link sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) adverse pregnancy outcome , particularly preeclampsia . Furthermore , SDB , characterize intermittent nocturnal hypoxia-reoxygenation well sleep disruption , result endothelial dysfunction metabolic dysregulation , biological pathway associate adverse pregnancy outcome . Obesity well-known risk factor adverse pregnancy outcome SDB , associate aforementioned biological aberration . Therefore , obesity complicates definition causal relationship SDB pregnancy outcome . While classic cardiovascular risk factor ( prehypertension ) certainly relevant pregnancy , also well-established risk factor unique pregnancy ( uterine vascular stiffness , placental angiogenic factor ) . The interplay SDB , obesity unique cardiovascular risk factor remain undefined , proposal aim address knowledge gap . Without data , ability understand mitigate risk use therapeutic intervention SDB , CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) , compromise . To address knowledge gap , make use placenta 's ability accumulate evidence damage time provide record maternal vascular health throughout gestation . Numerous placental lesion derive maternal vascular disease identify readily detect placental pathology . These lesion provide measure severity hypoxic stress experience fetus gestation . The investigator ' central hypothesis SDB effect modifier increase maternal cardiovascular risk placental hypoxic injury obese pregnant woman , CPAP treatment pregnancy result improve cardiovascular risk placental profile . To test hypothesis investigaotrs identify cohort obese woman without SDB . The investigator examine SDB 's impact maternal vascular stiffness ( uterine artery Doppler ) , angiogenesis ( pregnancy specific angiogenic factor e.g. , sFLT-1 ) metabolism ( insulin resistance ) across pregnancy ( Aim 1 ) . The investigator perform randomize controlled trial autotitrating- CPAP verse sham-CPAP pregnancy examine impact CPAP treatment pregnancy cardiovascular risk ( Aim 2 ) explore interplay SDB , CPAP evidence maternal vascular disease chronic fetal hypoxia evaluate placental profile obese woman without SDB ( Aim 3 ) .</detailed_description>
