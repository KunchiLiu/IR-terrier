	<brief_title>Ovarian Reserve Modification After Lps Hysterectomy With Bilateral Salpingectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer account 3 % female cancer represent fifth lead cause cancer death Western world ( 1 ) . In 90 % case , epithelial ovarian cancer ( 2 ) . Because biological aggressiveness tumor nonspecific symptom , cause diagnosis advance stage 75 % case , ovarian cancer gynecological cancer high mortality rate ( 3 ) . To date , effective screening strategy early diagnosis ovarian cancer n't exist , prophylactic adnexectomy available tool reduce incidence mortality rate , even role surgical strategy controversial , especially premenopausal woman ( 4 ) . In fact , American College Obstetricians Gynaecologists ( ACOG ) guideline recommend ovarian preservation premenopausal woman family history risk factor ovarian cancer ( 5 ) . Some clinical study show prophylactic adnexectomy consequent surgical menopause increase significantly long term risk cardiovascular psychosexual disease . ( 6-8 ) . In particular , case-control study do population 29,380 woman subject hysterectomy without adnexectomy , show increase risk total mortality ( HRs 1.12 95 % CI 1:03 1:21 ) , lethal non- lethal cardiovascular disease ( HRs 1.17 95 % CI 1:02 1:35 ) stroke ( HRs 1.14 95 % CI 0.98-1.33 ) ( 9 ) . In population woman subject salpingectomy , surgery n't able lead improvement general survival ( 10 ) . Considering new histopathological classification epithelial ovarian cancer , propose Kurman ( 11 ) base new acquisition pathogenesis origin tumor , possible conceive new preventive strategy associate less morbidity . In fact , carcinogenesis model propose Kurman , provide classification important histological type epithelial tumor two type , diversify accord clinico-pathological genetic feature . The type I compose low-grade serous , low-grade endometrioid , clear cell mucinous carcinoma , whose ovarian borderline tumor endometriosis represent pre-neoplastic lesion . Conversely , II type include high-grade endometrioid carcinoma , carcinosarcoma undifferentiated carcinoma , frequently , high-grade serous carcinoma , whose preneoplastic lesion , , seem represent serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma ( STIC ) . Plenty evidence , support correlation epithelial ovarian cancer STIC , obtain immunohistochemical molecular genetics investigation ( 11 ) . However , clinical point view , association demonstrate study 55 patient affect high-grade serous carcinoma , whose result show involvement endosalpinx 70 % case presence STIC 50 % case ( 12 ) . Some study , perform BRCA1 / 2 population , show presence strongly sit reactive p53 , define `` p53 signature '' , distal tube ( 13 ) . These site seem frequent characteristically multifocal tube concomitant STIC ( 14 ) . The finding `` p53 signature '' may , therefore , identify early clonal expansion neoplastic proliferation . This new theory give opportunity prevent devastate type cancer addition prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy ( PBS , removal tube preservation ovary ) surgical procedure perform woman benign disease accomplish reproductive desire . The PBS , place current standard procedure ( bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ) could reduce risk cancer , improve time quality life reduce risk premature death due cardiovascular disease , see woman subject salpingo-oophorectomy onset natural menopause . Our preliminary data ( 17 ) show , bilateral salpingectomy perform great care , patient negative effect term ovarian function . In addition , experience , perioperative complication attributable salpingectomy alone . Despite retrospective design first study , accord post hoc analysis , data show significant statistical reliability . However , prospective data effetc PBS patient submit TLH still need</detailed_description>
