	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) effective increase level ( ) physical activity ( PA ) ( b ) self-efficacy patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . PR evidence-based multidisciplinary approach consist primarily supervise exercise program educational component . It demonstrate high efficacy improve dyspnoea , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) functional exercise capacity patient COPD . Despite improvement , conclusive evidence benefit translate increase PA patient 's day-to-day life . This concern low PA predictor cause mortality , correlate low HRQoL , increase level dyspnoea high number hospital admission group patient . Self-efficacy find instigate force form intention exercise maintain practice extend time . Self-efficacy may key determine whether patient translates improvement exercise tolerance actually physically active . Based current knowledge , insufficient evidence self-efficacy increase pulmonary rehabilitation correlation make level self-efficacy level PA group patient . Hence study aim find whether exist PR program increase level PA self-efficacy . Correlation level PA self-efficacy make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention group consist patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) refer Guy 's St Thomas ' Hospital ( GSTT ) pulmonary rehabilitation . A sample 30 anticipated maximum number patient could enrol 3 month recruitment period Guy 's St. Thomas ' Hospital . 1 . The patient information sheet , together referral PR , post patient . Patients inform study detail patient information sheet . This include fact wear accelerometer 5 7 day prior start program . These accelerometer collect thereafter . Instructions use accelerometer give . They also inform personal information strictly keep confidential result use analysis study . 2 . Written consent take initial assessment patient agree participate study . 3 . The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index Self-Efficacy ( PRAISE ) questionnaire administer . It consist 15 question take less 10 minute complete . 4 . The patient undertake 14 session PR supervision successfully complete program . The program hold Guy 's St Thomas ' Hospital . 5 . The PRAISE questionnaire administer completion program . Patients ask wear accelerometer track physical activity . After 5 7 day use , accelerometer collect either address via stamped postage . No change make current pulmonary rehabilitation program . No control group present study pulmonary rehabilitation standard care ethical withhold pulmonary rehabilitation patient COPD . The null hypothesis would difference physical activity self-efficacy pulmonary rehabilitation . The statistical test use paired sample t-test determine change ) physical activity b ) self-efficacy pulmonary rehabilitation . Correlation analysis make self-efficacy physical activity ) Anxiety depression ( Hospital anxiety depression scale ) , b ) Functional exercise capacity ( 6 minute walk test ) c ) COPD Assessment test . A Pearson Spearman correlations do depend whether data normally distribute .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients fulfill current inclusion criterion referral pulmonary rehabilitation Guy 's St Thomas ' Hospital . Have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respiratory condition . Are aware referral detail program . Have consent able attend program . 2 . A diagnosis COPD confirm spirometry ( Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second/Forced Vital Capacity &lt; 0.70 bronchodilator ) ( GOLD , 2014 ) 1 . No evidence COPD spirometry 2 . Acute exacerbation within last 46 week require hospital admission 3 . Evidence ischemic heart disease/ acute change ECG 4 . Uncontrolled hypertension 5 . Inability exercise independently musculoskeletal/neurological condition would prevent completion course limit participation course 6 . Lung cancer</criteria>
