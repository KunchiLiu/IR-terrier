	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery ( LCS ) gain wide acceptance treatment various pathology diverticular disease colon cancer . In comparison conventional open surgery LCS benefit shorter hospital stay , reduce postoperative pain , low wound-related complication rate , well cosmetic result earlier return normal activity . Despite fact laparoscopic colorectal surgery do small incision , still considerable amount abdominal wall trauma procedure . This still cause significant amount postoperative discomfort , add patient ' stress , decrease satisfaction , prolong length hospital stay . Postoperative pain difficult control mainly manage pharmacologically use narcotic non-narcotic medication deliver different route . The effectiveness pain control depend medication , dosage , frequency route administration . The latter mainly achieve intravenous route immediate postoperative period laparoscopic colorectal surgery patient , patient restrict anything mouth return bowel function . Another route delivery use local anesthetic well opioids via epidural catheter . Epidural analgesia ( EA ) potential offer excellent pain control decrease rate postoperative ileus . Despite extensive use epidural anesthesia obstetrics , date study look effectiveness epidural analgesia laparoscopic colorectal surgery . The primary purpose study evaluate impact epidural analgesia compare conventional analgesia length hospital stay patient undergo laparoscopic colorectal procedure . The secondary objective study evaluate patient satisfaction , quality life , pain control return bowel function patient treat either epidural analgesia intravenous narcotic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery become standard care treatment many colorectal pathology . In comparison open conventional surgery benefit decrease length hospital stay ( 1 ) , reduce postoperative pain , early return bowel function ( 2,3 ) , early return normal activity improve cosmetic result . Several criterion must meet patient discharged hospital . These discharge criterion objective criterion use discharge surgical patient : 1 . Return bowel function ( manifested passage flatus bowel movement ) 2 . Ability tolerate regular diet 3 . Stable vital sign 24 hr 4 . Good pain control oral medication 5 . Ability void freely 6 . Return similar level preoperative function All attend surgeon strictly adhere 6 criterion discharge patient . Poor pain control know increase length hospital stay surgery . Good pain control thus becomes essential order decrease length hospital stay make patient comfortable . Pain control traditionally achieve intravenous route use narcotic non-narcotic medication . Postoperative pain mainly incisional nature due enhance response mechanical thermal stimulus area incision ( 6 ) . Despite fact laparoscopic surgery do small incision , several incision require place different trocars need safely perform procedure . These incision still cause significant amount pain discomfort . Opioid narcotic deliver systemically intravenous route well know side effect , range mild nausea opioid-induced bowel dysfunction ( 6 ) . They also know prolong postoperative ileus block coordinate bowel motility surgery . The pathophysiology ileus multifactorial incompletely understood . Major mechanism contribute ileus include surgical stress physical manipulation bowel , secretion inflammatory mediator , change fluid balance , hormone electrolyte concentration ( 7 ) . Postoperative ileus take several day resolve every effort make help bowel regain function . This include judicious use IV fluid , correct electrolyte abnormality find right balance adequate pain control deliver right amount intravenous pain medication . Controlling postoperative pain adequate manner without substantial systemic side effect becomes primary importance . One way would use epidural analgesia local anesthetic inject catheter place epidural space . The injection cause loss sensation loss pain , block transmission signal nerve near spinal cord preserve motor function . The epidural space space inside bony spinal canal outside membrane call Dura mater . Thus contact cerebrospinal fluid spinal cord . Several trial epidural analgesia colorectal surgery patient demonstrate potential benefit technique decrease postoperative pain ( 8-10,12,14-18 ) , fast return bowel function faster resolution ileus ( 8,9,12 , 14 , 16,17 ) well decrease incidence nausea ( 17 ) . These trial also show patient use epidural analgesia require less pain medication ( 10,11 ) . A retrospective review Sweden demonstrate reduction mortality epidural anesthesia patient undergoing rectal resection ( 19 ) . However , result report concern length hospital stay , cost quality life inconclusive . Most trial conduct small 39 patient arm large trial ( 9-17 ) . The study show decreased length hospital stay consist cohort 22 patient compare `` historic '' standard group ( 12 ) . This study small non-randomized ( 12 ) . The remain study , despite randomize , small thus fail show decreased length hospital stay patient receive epidural analgesia compare intravenous analgesia ( 9-11 , 13-15 , 16 ) . The hypothesis advocate epidural decrease postoperative pain allows faster recovery bowel function decrease length hospital stay . On hand , epidural usually leave place 2-3 day follow surgery patient transition different form pain medication . This transition might fact take time actually increase length hospital stay thus potentially adversely affecting hospital cost . In addition , study conduct fail adequately assess quality life patient receive EA laparoscopic colectomy . Other measure show reduce length hospital stay opioid induced side effect use alvimopan peripherally act μ-opioid receptor antagonist , recently approve reduction postoperative ileus colectomy . Alvimopan associate reduced ileus-related morbidity compare placebo , without compromise opioid-based analgesia patient undergo surgery ( 20-21 ) . Thus use alvimopan may obviate advocate use EA solely reduce opioid-induced ileus . This large prospective randomize trial recruit 160 patient arm : epidural arm conventional analgesia one . The trial perform adult patient undergo elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery benign malignant condition University California , Irvine ( UCI ) . The primary end point study would show difference length hospital stay one day 2 group , secondary end point would show decreased incidence pain , early return bowel function , early ambulation , good quality life , less incidence complication side effect epidural group . This large randomized trial look use epidural analgesia laparoscopic colorectal surgery ever conduct . It hopefully provide definitive answer regard difference length hospital stay . It also address issue relate cost-effectiveness well quality life use validated questionnaire , point address previously publish data .</detailed_description>
