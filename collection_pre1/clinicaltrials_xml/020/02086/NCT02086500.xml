	<brief_title>Study Tranexamic Acid During Air Medical Prehospital Transport Trial ( STAAMP Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Traumatically injured patient continue plague uncontrolled hemorrhage result significant morbidity early mortality . A primary driving force unbridled hemorrhage know early coagulopathy complicates severe injury . Trauma induce coagulopathy postulated equilibrium imbalance pro anticoagulant factor , platelet , endothelium fibrinolysis soon injury . Recent evidence demonstrate early use antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid ( TXA ) trauma center arrival result improve survival patient risk bleeding . Bringing proven treatment prehospital arena intervene early patient would otherwise candidate treatment real potential reduce prevent vicious hemorrhagic cascade , improve clinical outcome provide insight underlie mechanism responsible maximize benefit . Objective/Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis prehospital infusion tranexamic acid patient risk bleed reduce incidence 30 day mortality . The secondary hypothesis include prehospital tranexamic acid reduce incidence hyperfibrinolysis , acute lung injury , multiple organ failure , nosocomial infection , mortality , early seizure , pulmonary embolism early resuscitation need , reduce prevent early coagulopathy demonstrate improve present INR rapid thromboelastography parameter , reduce early inflammatory response , plasmin level , leukocyte , platelet complement activation , determine optimal dose tranexamic acid post-injury .</detailed_description>
