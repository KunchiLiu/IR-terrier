	<brief_title>Red Cell Transfusion Goals Patients With Acute Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transfusion red blood cell ( RBCs ) vitally important care patient undergo myelosuppressive therapy acute leukemia . The therapeutic approach disease involve use high dos chemotherapy treat blood cancer bone marrow disorder ; damage marrow blood system . Malignant healthy stem cell affect chemotherapy , even malignant cell kill , take week healthy cell reconstitute marrow . At diagnosis bone marrow recovery post treatment , RBCs need support patient . Current practice major comprehensive cancer center utilize liberal hemoglobin transfusion trigger 8-9 g/dL high . Higher hemoglobin level high risk patient may benefit better energy organ function . However , research variety clinical setting , suggest high hemoglobin transfusion threshold associate even high mortality rate compare low hemoglobin threshold ( 7-8 g/dL ) . These setting include prospective randomized trial high-risk orthopedic surgery patient , critically ill adult pediatric ICU patient , acute GI bleed patient , patient undergo cardiac surgery . One clinical scenario ideal transfusion threshold unknown patient receive chemotherapy hematologic malignancy . Transfusion requirement trigger systematically study acute leukemia cancer . Acute leukemia carry high mortality ; unnecessary increase morbidity mortality acceptable . Without clear benefit high transfusion threshold , add risk cost transfusion may substantial unnecessary . The investigator plan study issue pilot feasibility study randomly assign patient treat acute leukemia transfuse RBCs either high low hemoglobin concentration trigger point . In way , investigator able accurately determine benefit harm low high red cell count induction treatment recovery period patient acute leukemias . This study also collect information evaluate advantage disadvantage two transfusion threshold feasibility expand study large randomize trial.This safety data serve platform large mortality study leukemia possibly additional study solid tumor .</detailed_description>
