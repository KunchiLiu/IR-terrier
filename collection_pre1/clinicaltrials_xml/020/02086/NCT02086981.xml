	<detailed_description>The age population well increased life expectancy put progressively urgent demand adequacy level care provide hospital environment ensure clinical pathway tailor need individual patient . On hand , gradual evolution Health Care system care acute , increase level specialization often technologically drive , must neglect aspect personalization care protect elderly `` frail '' patient , intrinsic characteristic . In context , evaluation frailty undertakes mean prevention promotion quality life take account important issue patient 's safety economic weight entail . Delirium ( acute confusional state ) complex syndrome frequently occur elderly hospitalize population . Development Delirium associate negative outcomes longer hospital stay , high rate complication , cognitive functional decline , loss independence , institutionalization , , ultimately , death . For skilled healthcare professional , hand , represent challenge condition prompt accurate diagnosis introduction prevention non-pharmacological measure may reduce incidence , severity and/or duration Delirium improve functional recovery . Therefore mean conduct observational study also provide evidence patient ' need address on-ground educational aspect healthcare professional daily practice . The purpose study determine incidence prevalence ( surgery ) Delirium elderly population admit Department Orthopedics Traumatology High Dependency Unit postoperative phase well determine risk factor develop condition . Secondary objective mean hospital stay , rate complication well in-hospital mortality 1 , 3 12 month discharge , functional recovery cognitive outcome 1 , 3 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
