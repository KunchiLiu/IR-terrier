	<brief_summary>The formation metastasis responsible much 90 % cancer-associated mortality . In spite recent advance oncologic therapy , approximately 50 % lung cancer patient already overt disseminated cancer diagnosis . Additionally , numerous patient locoregional disease initially treat curative intent develop ( oligo ) metastases course disease . In instance , stage IV patient generally consider incurable mostly treat palliatively . Oligometastases , define 1-5 site active disease whole body imaging , coin refer isolate site metastasis resemble limited tumor metastatic capacity . The implication concept local cancer treatment curative proportion patient metastases incorporate local therapy conceptually attractive approach . In several , , academic center standard treatment patient oligometastases good general health standard chemotherapy follow surgery Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy ( SABR ) radical dose macroscopic visible tumor . The widespread introduction SABR minimally invasive surgery fuel research treat patient oligometastases . Indeed , local control metastasis obtain virtually part body low proportion patient experience severe side effect . In prospective study publish date , approximately 20 % patient remain free recurrence several year treatment sit disease target radiation . Along standard anti-cancer therapeutic modality like chemotherapy radiotherapy ( RT ) , immunotherapy recently gain lot attention . Angiogenesis one hallmark cancer , therefore , considerable effort make exploit unique target selective drug delivery . One appeal target approach splice variant fibronectin contain extra domain B ( EDB ) , abundantly express vascular endothelial cell variety primary tumor well metastasis , virtually absent normal tissue . Recently , human recombinant scFv fragment direct EDB , designate L19 , develop subsequently combine pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) , result immunocytokine L19-IL2 . L19-IL2 delivers high dos IL2 ( metastatic ) tumor site ( ) exploit selective expression EDB newly form blood vessel . Interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) play essential role activation phase specific natural immune response . Even though direct cytotoxic effect cancer cell , induce tumor regression stimulate potent cell-mediated response . In summary , L19-IL2 immunocytokine stimulate immune response specifically tumor angiogenesis tissue remodeling . Radiotherapy particularly interesting partner immunotherapy , since harness specifically modify immunogenicity primary tumor microenvironment , attempt generate situ immunization host patient 's cancer . Our hypothesis three independent therapeutic approach synergize improve dramatically survival patient oligometastases solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Study Combining L19-IL2 With SABR Patients With Oligometastatic Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Tumor vasculature Profound difference exist vascular endothelium surround stroma normal tissue tumor . Tumor vasculature extremely disorganize tortuous . Vascular shunt frequent , distinguish arteriole venule challenge . Apart architecture , blood flow strikingly alter : sluggish , sometimes stationary even reverse . The endothelium tumor proliferate rapidly contributes active angiogenesis . The direct contact tumor endothelium host 's blood pool make site unique target selective drug delivery . 2 . L19 Fibronectin ( FN ) broadly present soluble constituent plasma body fluid . FN usually exist dimer form two nearly identical ( approximately 250 kDa ) subunits covalently link near C-terminus pair disulfide bond . Even though FN molecule product single gene , result protein exist multiple form arise alternative spice pre-mRNA generate 20 variant human . Splicing occurs 3 region FN gene , lead inclusion exclusion either one two type III repeat , name EDB EDA . The 91 amino acid sequence EDB identical mouse , rat , rabbit , dog human . EDB-containing FN dispensable embryogenesis , think play modulate role growth connective tissue . In adult , EDB-FN highly express normal tissue angiogenesis , mature vessel . Furthermore , EDB-containing FN abundantly find solid tumor . It mainly produce tumor cell deposit subendothelial extracellular matrix solid tumor hematological malignancy . L19 single chain ( scFv ) human antibody specifically target EDB-FN . Antibody fragment small scFv format useful versatile tool various advantage include rapid blood clearance easy manipulation antibody engineering . The L19 antibody show recognize target EDB-FN vivo animal model patient . In past year , L19 antibody conjugate numerous agent , include therapeutic radionuclides , cytokine . 3 . Interleukin-2 Cytokines heterogeneous group soluble small polypeptide glycoprotein exert pleiotropic redundant effect promote growth , differentiation , activation normal cell . Cytokines produce immune cell may pro- anti-inflammatory immune-modulatory activity . In malignant disease , cytokine production release affect tumor and/or therapeutic intervention . Cytokines may also display potent anticancer activity , frequently hamper treatment-related toxicity prohibit dose-escalation therapeutically effective concentration . Interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) play essential role activation phase specific natural immune response . Even though direct cytotoxic effect cancer cell , induce tumor regression stimulate potent cell-mediated response . As , IL2 one treatment option metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient . 4 . L19-IL2 In order overcome toxicity simultaneously deliver therapeutic dos IL2 tumor issue , elegant option combine anti-EDB scFv L19 antibody IL2 pursue . It show L19-IL2 conjugate mediates selective delivery accumulation IL2 tumor endothelial cell , EDB antigen express angiogenesis , lead dramatic increase therapeutic efficacy IL2 . In first preclinical study , 80 % xenograft tumor ( include teratocarcinoma small cell lung cancer ) tackle L19-IL2 subsequently compose connective necrotic tissue . At time increase level interferon-gamma cytotoxic lymphocyte , macrophage natural killer cell find . These histological therapeutic effect underlined orthotopic pancreatic cancer model treat antibody-cytokine conjugate . One year later , response percentage repeat Ramos lymphoma xenograft treat L19-IL2 anti-CD20 antibody rituximab whereby complete remission last one year find 4 5 mouse treat . In recent phase I/II clinical trial , use L19-IL2 proven safe variety stage IV malignancy recommend dose 22.5 Mio IU . Furthermore , safely combine dacarbazine stage IV melanoma patient maintain recommend dose level . In first study , overall objective response rate report 51 % two cycle , second rate 28 % one complete response still ongoing 21 month treatment initiation . At present , three phase I/II clinical trial L19-IL2 alone combination chemotherapy patient metastatic melanoma ( ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT01055522 NCT01253096 ) pancreatic cancer ( ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT01198522 ) ongoing . Summary Study Design Details SABR : Prescribed dose risk adapt metastatic localization closeness organ risk ( accordance local protocol MAASTRO clinic ) . Patients receive dose schedule 1 x 30 Gy , 3 x 15-20 Gy ; 5 x 12 Gy ; 8 x 7.5 Gy ; 80 % 100 % isodose encompass periphery PTV closely possible . Maximum dose restrict volume dose high 105 % must locate within gross tumor . The minimum dose allow EQD2α/ẞ10 =60 Gy , ablative dose EQD2iso=≥ 87.5Gy10 always objective . Treatment delivered intensity modulate arcs treatment . Step -1 : Assessment toxicity 10 Mio IU L19-IL2 ( n=3-6 ) ; step choose dose-limiting toxicity occur Step 1 .
