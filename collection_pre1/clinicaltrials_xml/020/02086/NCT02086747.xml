	<brief_title>Acetaminophen Chronic Pain Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appropriate expression pain `` unpleasant sensory emotional experience associate actual potential tissue damage , describe term damage '' ( IASP,2008 ) ( 1 ) . When pain last longer 3 month beyond time acute injury would expect healed , patient 's presentation become complex , often , surprisingly , psychological feature . These include complaint poor non-refreshing sleep , tiredness , depression poor concentration . Pain stage often say `` chronic '' ( 2 ) . Chronic pain common problem also significant increase public health burden virtually developed country ( 3 ) . Hysterectomy one common surgical procedure woman . Recent study recognize 20-40 % incidence chronic post-surgical pain hysterectomy surgery ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) . Effective pain management important component postsurgical care . Many patient , however , continue experience inadequate pain relief ( 7 ) Despite analgesic strategy , postoperative period 80 % patient still suffer moderate severe pain ( 8 ) . The ideal analgesic property like rapid effective pain relief , minimal adverse effect , minimal impact major organ system interaction pharmacologic agent . Opioids still good choice postoperative pain dose dependent adverse effect negative postoperative outcome ( 9 ) ( 10 ) . Nonopioid analgesic commonly use alone adjunct opioid-based analgesia treat moderate severe pain . Perioperative administration acetaminophen nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) advocate provide `` multimodal '' `` balance '' analgesia decrease opioid dose requirement may reduce associated adverse event reduce postsurgical pain intensity ( 9 ) ( 11 ) . Acetaminophen superior analgesic safety analgesic profile . At time le contraindication drug interaction others . Acetaminophen act selectively inhibit release prostaglandin within central nervous system well peripheral analgesic effect ( 12 ) . Rarely overdose use induce hepatoxicity ( 13 ) . While provide fast significant pain relief well significant morphine-sparing effect , ( 14 ) ( 15 ) . associate increase incidence nausea , vomit , respiratory depression observe opioids deleterious gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal effect associate NSAIDs cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 inhibitor ( 16 ) . Several international guideline ( EULAR , ACR ) influential review recommend use paracetamol first-line analgesic choice management chronic pain , provide cost-effective analgesia without risk associate NSAID use , particularly elderly . Based currently available data , use alternative analgesic , tramadol opioids , either alone combination paracetamol , warrant patient whose pain respond nonnarcotic analgesic . While recommendation base vast amount clinical data , account individual patient response ( 17 ) . Paracetamol rapidly absorb immediaterelease formulation , maximum concentration plasma typically occur 0.25 2.0 hour , onset action within 30 minute ( 18 ) . Because terminal elimination phase half-life paracetamol plasma short , region 1.9-2.5 hour therapeutic dose , ( 19 ) recommend time dose 4-6 hour , result 4-times daily dose schedule . The investigator hypothesise postoperative treatment paracetamol repeat dos 1 g comparison placebo hysterectomy patient moderate severe pain would decrease analgesic consumption perioperatively incidence chronic pain associate abdominal hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
