	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug combination call Imprime PGG Rituximab possible treatment relapsed/refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Clinical Trial Rituxan B-Glucan PGG Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm eligibility : Study Drugs : The participant receive Imprime PGG rituximab weekly , four week . Clinical Exams : At participant 's weekly visit physical exam general health specific question problem might medication participant may take . Scans ( Imaging test ) : The Investigator measure participant 's tumor 10 week Week 4 treatment CT scan . Additional scan perform 6 month 12 month follow end treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Patients must histologically determine indolent NHL relapse primary refractory initial therapy . Indolent NHL include morphologic clinical variant : Follicular lymphoma , grade 13a Marginal zone lymphoma ( extranodal , nodal , splenic ) All nodal marginal zone lymphoma eligible Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma stomach ( gastric MALT lymphoma ) may candidate cure antibiotic local radiotherapy . Patients fail antibiotic local therapy eligible protocol long measurable disease naïve chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy . Splenic marginal zone lymphoma patient may receive prior splenectomy long measurable disease naïve chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy . Rebiopsy mandate relapse unless clinical suspicion alternate diagnosis . Between 13 prior line chemoimmunotherapy and/or monotherapy rituximab . Patients may prior autologous allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Measurable disease previously irradiate CT scan least 2 cm , OR patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence progression since radiation . Imaging must complete great 4 week prior study enrollment . ECOG performance status 02 ( Appendix B , Section 17.2 ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 prior treatment Oxygen saturation ≥ 90 % , 2 LPM oxygen Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN AST ≤ 3 X ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN ( unless lymphoma liver ) Age ≥18 year Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 30 day start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc. ) . Steroids symptom palliation allow , must either discontinue stable dos time initiation protocol therapy . Patients may receive investigational agent , receive investigational agent within 4 week begin treatment . Patients previously receive PGGBetafectin ( Betafectin® ) Imprime PGG . Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study . Patients know leptomeningeal brain metastasis . Imaging spinal fluid analysis exclude CNS involvement require , unless clinical suspicion treat investigator . History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction monoclonal antibody therapy know hypersensitivity baker 's yeast . Patients know HIV infection hepatitis B C infection.HIV test mandate perform discretion treat investigator . Patients systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control ( define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment ) . Prior history another malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical breast cancer ) unless disease free least three year . Patients prostate cancer allow PSA le 1 . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) male study participant reproductive potential must agree use double barrier birth control method contraception course study treatment period 3 month complete study treatment . WOCBP define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy postmenopausal ( menses ) least 12 consecutive month . WOCBP must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration treatment . History noncompliance medical regimen . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : New York Heart Association Class III IV cardiac disease , include preexist clinically significant arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease Other uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit adherence study requirement .</criteria>
