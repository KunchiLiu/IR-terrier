	<brief_summary>The aim current study determine whether rifaximin lactulose effective preventing development severe hepatic encephalopathy hospitalize patient cirrhosis new onset kidney failure . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment group : Group A : Lactulose 20g dose titrate 2-3 soft-formed bowel movement per day Group B : Rifaximin 550mg tablet twice daily . Subjects follow daily two week hospital discharge . Treatment success define prevention grade 3 4 HE hospitalization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparison Rifaximin Versus Lactulose Hospitalized Cirrhotic Patients With Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic Encephalopathy ( HE ) reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome develop patient cirrhosis due accumulation variety toxic substance produce bacteria gastrointestinal tract . It characterize slow function brain function range severity mild cognitive impairment ( grade 1 ) , presence shake tremor call asterixis ( grade 2 ) , lethargy arousable state ( grade 3 ) , coma ( grade 4 ) . Decreased kidney function exacerbate condition , hospitalize patient cirrhosis new onset kidney failure risk development severe HE . Possible treatment HE include lactulose antibiotic . Lactulose reduces production many toxin bacteria , antibiotic work reduce number bacteria gastrointestinal tract . Rifaximin antibiotic antibiotic absorbed , posse wide antibacterial spectrum , approve Food Drug Administration 3/2010 prevention relapse patient recurrent severe hepatic encephalopathy . The aim current study determine whether rifaximin lactulose effective preventing development severe hepatic encephalopathy hospitalize patient cirrhosis new onset kidney failure . To determine whether rifaximin lactulose effective preventing severe HE , seventy consecutive hospitalized patient cirrhosis new onset kidney failure recruit . New onset kidney failure define progressive sustained increase serum creatinine &gt; 0.5mg/dl baseline value 2.0mg/dl great within 3 day . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment group : Group A : Lactulose 20g dose titrate 2-3 soft-formed bowel movement per day Group B : Rifaximin 550mg tablet twice daily . Subjects follow daily two week hospital discharge . Severity hepatic encephalopathy grade physical examination , review hospital chart , performance standard paper pencil test evaluate ability concentrate . In addition , approximately one tablespoon drawn twice week every 3 4 day ammonia level toxin . A sample breath also collect subject breathe collection bag measure substances determine whether bacteria present small intestine . Treatment success define prevention grade 3 4 HE hospitalization .</detailed_description>
