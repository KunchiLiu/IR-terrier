	<brief_summary>Acquiring diarrhoea hospital serious problem frequently occur susceptible patient receive antibiotic part ( often life-saving ) care . The common cause Clostridium difficile - bacterium normally live third u cause problem . Rates infection fall increased awareness improve hygiene start creep . Clostridium difficile cause range disease short-lived mild diarrhoea severe disease bowel major effect whole body even death . This study aim identify substance stool blood enable doctor predict severe individual 's disease . These test easily perform . If prove accurate identifying subsequent severity patient 's illness due Clostridium difficile , patient predict develop bad disease receive intensive treatment become unwell benefit . On hand , patient whose disease predict marker run course without cause serious consequence spar side effect risk intensive treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) , often consequence antibiotic therapy , common one serious hospital-acquired illness . It cause range intestinal upset mild diarrhoea life-threatening severe colitis . The incidence , recurrence mortality rate CDI increase dramatically recent year . Metronidazole recommend first-line antibiotic , vancomycin colectomy reserve severe case . Although risk factor develop CDI well known , factor predict outcome and/or recurrence CDI uncertain lack specificity intestinal inflammation . We wish investigate careful prospective monitoring standard clinical biochemical measure able identify patient go fail primary treatment . If one factor prove able predict outcome , could ultimately use early escalation therapy aim reduce morbidity , mortality length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
