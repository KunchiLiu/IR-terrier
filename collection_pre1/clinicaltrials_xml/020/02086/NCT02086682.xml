	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Airless Tubing Inpatient Acute Hemodialysis Unit Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) , prevent clot extracorporeal circuit , one key advance lead rapid development expansion hemodialysis use , remain mainstay hemodialysis practice today . However , anticoagulation hemodialysis patient high risk bleeding remain frequently encounter problem nephrology practice . The need anticoagulation prevent clot extracorporeal blood circuit need prevent anticoagulation relate bleeding complication patient lead development numerous strategy ; safe bleed standpoint anticoagulant-free hemodialysis . Streamline® bloodline ( Medisystems® Corporation , Lawrence , MA ) design eliminate blood-air contact . A pressure pod measure arterial venous pressure without blood-air contact . The venous chamber run without air gap . It also design blood flow circular vortex manner . This airless system think provide several benefit : improve dialysis efficiency blood flow rate , reduce heparin use clot rate . The goal study prospectively examine Streamline® airless tube system inpatient set association clot rate , dialysis efficiency .</detailed_description>
