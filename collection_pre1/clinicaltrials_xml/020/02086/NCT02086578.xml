	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine radiation treatment call `` Multi-beam Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy '' ( IMRT ) reduce side effect relate implant candidate radiation therapy . Currently , standard method give radiation `` 3D radiation '' , use 2-5 beam radiation . `` Multi-beam '' IMRT work use 8-12 small radiation beam give `` tailor '' `` customize '' radiation dose implant , breast , chest wall lymph node . At time , multi-beam IMRT may lower radiation dose heart , lung nearby tissue . The goal study reduce complication irradiation implant . The study doctor recently complete trial use technique specifically look impact woman implant reconstruction undergo post-mastectomy radiation therapy . By deliver `` customize '' dose radiation implant , intent reduce side effect radiation implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo mastectomy axillary dissection immediate tissue expander placement . As current practice MSKCC , patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy undergo expansion chemotherapy , exchange permanent implant perform approximately one month chemotherapy radiation begin approximately one month exchange . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo `` rapid expansion '' expander begin radiation least 4 week follow surgery , although may perform sooner patient recover surgery treat physician deems safe proceed treatment . In patient , exchange permanent implant occur discretion treat plastic surgeon ( approximately 5-8 month end radiation ) .</detailed_description>
