	<brief_title>Sonidegib Lenalidomide After Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess complete response ( CR ) rate lenalidomide sonidegib ( LDE225 ) maintenance follow upfront single autologous stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity lenalidomide LDE225 use maintenance therapy patient post autologous SCT . II . To determine progression-free survival rate 1 2 year post autologous SCT . III . To evaluate progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient achieve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative status . OUTLINE : Patients receive sonidegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stringent complete response ( sCR ) , CR , good partial response ( VGPR ) , partial response ( PR ) , minor response ( MR ) , stable disease ( SD ) ( unconfirmed [ u ] sCR , uCR , uVGPR , uPR , uMR ) continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 90 day 3 year .</detailed_description>
