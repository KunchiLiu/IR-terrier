	<brief_title>AMH Levels Change During Treatment With GnRh Agonist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anti Mullerian hormone ( AMH ) glycoprotein produce granulosa cell antral preantral ovarian follicle . Several study show AMH level provide reliable indication size grow follicle pool ( 1 ) . AMH commonly use biomarker improve ovarian reserve woman reproductive age relate outcomes assist reproduction cycle , chance pregnancy distance menopause ( 2-4 ) . For several year GnRH agonist use purpose preserving fertility course chemotherapy young woman cancer ( 5 ) . Their effectiveness , however , n't 100 % need monitor ovarian reserve course treatment young woman . With administration GnRHa , FSH level ( use hormone improve ovarian reserve , although less reliable less manageable intra-cyclic variation ) use measure residual ovarian function due physiological reduction gonadotropin induce treatment . AMH level , conversely , relatively stable menstrual cycle ( 6 ) administration contraceptive pill ( 7,8 ) , suggest gonadotrophin independence molecule . AMH could therefore useful biomarker ovarian reserve course GnRHa treatment . The use GnRHa fertility preservation chemotherapy controversial inconclusive outcome data fertility ( 9 ) mechanism GnRHa may act preserve fertility unknown . The major function GnRHa suppress production pituitary gonadotrophin , act indirectly ovarian follicle , expose grow follicle toxicity chemotherapy thus protect future ovarian function . Determine effect GnRHa AMH serum level essential step determine effectiveness treatment term preservation fertility reliability marker ovarian reserve cancer patient treat GnRHa . Up , publish study show extremely contrast data . Considered GnRHa largely use non-oncological patient preoperative pharmacological preparation various benign gynecological condition , possible exploit high number patient characteristic non-invasive assessment analogue effect AMH level .</detailed_description>
