	<brief_title>Phase I Trial LDE225 Steroid-refractory Chronic GVHD After Allogeneic HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I clinical trial enroll participant steroid-refractory chronic GVHD , likely take approximately 24 month complete accrual . Treatment consist LDE225 give daily continuous dose 28-day cycle . Participants undergone allogeneic SCT develop chronic GVHD respond sufficiently systemic corticosteroid ( dose least 0.25 mg/kg/day ideal body weight ) , relapse disease taper steroid , adequate response steroid plus therapy . Participants respond eligible receive additional course therapy . Participants follow trial 12 month start therapy trial complete participant reach 12 month follow-up withdrawn trial . The initial dose escalation phase 4 cohort participant ( cohort 3-6 participant ) primary endpoint safety toxicity administer LDE225 setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible inclusion study meet follow criterion : Patients must provide write informed consent prior screen procedure . Age 18 year old . Recipients allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) either myeloablative reduced intensity conditioning regimen . Any donor source stem cell eligible . Participants must least 100 day HCT . Patients must steroid refractory classic cutaneous , myofascial , sclerodermatous cGVHD ( +/ organ involvement , clinically diagnose ) , define persistent sign symptom chronic GVHD despite use prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day ( 0.5 mg/kg every day ) least 4 week precede 12 month ( equivalent dose alternate corticosteroid ) without complete resolution sign symptom improve line therapy beyond steroid treat physician feel increase add steroids patient 's best interest . Note dose systemic steroid certainly low 0.25 mg/kg/day enrollment . Stable dose corticosteroid 4 week prior enrollment No addition subtraction immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , calcineurin inhibitor , sirolimus , mycophenolate mofetil ) 4 week prior enrollment . The dose immunosuppressive medicine may adjust base therapeutic range drug ECOG performance status ≤ 3 Serum Cr ≤ 2 gm / dL Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , AST &lt; 5x ULN ) , unless hepatic dysfunction manifestation cGVHD . For patient diagnosis hemolysis Gilbert 's make , total bilirubin allow elevate . For patient abnormal LFTs threshold , document cGVHD liver biopsy require prior enrollment . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define ANC ≥ 1000 / µl platelets ≥ 20,000 / µl without growth factor transfusional support Plasma creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN Patient able swallow retain oral medication Patients major surgery within 4 week initiation study medication . Patients concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study potentially affect interpretation study data . Patients unable take oral drug lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract know malabsorption syndrome . Patients previously treat systemic LDE225 Hh pathway inhibitor . Patients neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis , HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil , discontinue least 2 week prior start LDE225 treatment . If essential patient stay statin control hyperlipidemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . NB : Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid whilst LDE225 treatment . Patients take part experimental drug study within 4 week 5 halflives , whichever longer , initiate treatment LDE225 . Patients receive antineoplastic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy ) concurrently within 2 week start treatment LDE225 . Patients receive treatment medication know strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment LDE225 . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment LDE225 . Note patient require antifungal prophylaxis preferred fluconazole , , patient take voriconazole posaconazole must continue exclude dose escalation phase study . Once MTD establish , patient take voriconazole posaconazole allow enroll dose adjustment determine expansion phase open . Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent ) Exposure new immunosuppressive medication 4 week prior enrollment . ECP therapy within 4 week prior enrollment Active disease relapse Active , uncontrolled infection Impaired cardiac function clinically significant heart disease , include one following : Angina pectoris within 3 month Acute myocardial infarction within 3 month QTc &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female screen ECG A past medical history clinically significant ECG abnormality family history prolong QTinterval syndrome Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor adherence antihypertensive regimen ) Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Patients willing apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study 6 month final dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception define either : Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Sterilization : Patient surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . [ For female study patient , vasectomized male partner sole partner patient ] Use combination follow ( a+b ) : Placement nonhormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) nonhormonal intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . Note : Hormonal contraception method ( e.g . oral , injected , implant ) allow count contraception rule study drug decrease effectiveness hormonal contraception . Patients able continue take oral contraceptive desire . Note : Woman consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential Male patient must use highly effective ( double barrier ) method contraception ( e.g. , spermicidal gel plus condom ) entire duration study , continue use contraception refrain father child 6 month follow study drug . A condom require use also vasectomize men well intercourse male partner order prevent delivery study treatment via seminal fluid Sexually active male unwilling use condom intercourse take study drug 6 month stop investigational medication agree father child period . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
