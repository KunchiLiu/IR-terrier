For targeted patient , test effect use pharmacist pharmacy technician obtain initial medication history . This study use randomize controlled trial usual care ( involve nurse physician ) vs usual care + pharmacist vs usual care + pharmacy technician obtain admission medication history .

	<detailed_description>At large university-affiliated hospital , conduct IRB-approved , pragmatic randomize trial inform consent waive . Inclusion criterion , access via EHR , : &gt; =10 chronic prescription medication , history acute myocardial infarction congestive heart failure , admission skilled nursing facility , history transplant , active anticoagulant , insulin , narrow therapeutic index medication ; exclude admit pediatric trauma service transplant service pharmacist . All arm receive usual care patient admit emergency department . This include RNs obtain AMHs , natural variation checking , correct order AMHs admit provider . In two intervention arm , PSPTs pharmacist obtain initial AMHs . They contact family , pharmacy , and/or provider resolve question . As per prior study , obtain reference standard AMHs patient ( usually one day admission ) , initial AMH error independently rat &gt; =2 pharmacist significant , serious , life-threatening . These three error severity assign 1 , 4 , 9 point , respectively . We calculate weighted error score patient , mean scores/pt arm . We 80 % power identify arm higher/lower score &gt; =11.2/patient .</detailed_description>
