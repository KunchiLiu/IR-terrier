	<brief_summary>1 . Study Objectives 1 ) Primary Objective : Progression-free survival 2 ) Secondary Objectives : 1. overall survival 2. response rate 3. incidence , nature severity adverse event 4. lipid lower effect simvastatin 5. exploratory biomarker analysis : angiopoietin 2 , BiP ( Binding protein ) , Hsp ( Heat shck protein ) 90α 2 . Study hypothesis In recent vitro study , addition simvastatin bevacizumab reduce proliferation , migration , invasion tumor formation endothelial cell . Moreover , colorectal cancer cell medium treat simvastatin combine bevacizumab inhibit endothelial cell invasion associate decreased mediator angiogenesis , angiopoietin 2 , BiP HSP 90α.. Treatment bevacizumab simvastatin reduce growth xenograft tumor compare bevacizumab alone . 3 . Assessments 1 ) Safety : physical examination , vital sign , body weight , ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status , clinical laboratory evaluation ( chemistry , blood cell count ) AE ( adverse effect ) grade use CTCAE ( Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ) v 4.0 2 ) Efficacy : progression-free survival overall survival collect . Response rate accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) 1,1 guideline also evaluate 3 ) PFS ( Progression free survival ) : time randomization tumor progression death 4 ) OS ( Overall survival ) : time randomization death last follow-up 5 ) Biomarker analysis ; The correlation blood level , protein expression angiopoietin 2 , BiP , Hsp90α clinical response explore .</brief_summary>
