	<brief_summary>The study purpose compare usual hospice care PAINRelieveIt group effect : ( 1 ) patient outcome ( analgesic adherence ; bad pain intensity , satisfaction , misconception ) lay caregiver outcome ( pain misconception ) diverse sample 250 cancer patient-caregiver dyad receive hospice care ; ( 2 ) nurse outcome ( obtain appropriate analgesic patient ) sample hospice nurse . The investigator hypothesize posttest , control pretest data compare usual care group , PAINRelieveIt group : ) report decrease score bad pain intensity pain misconception ; b ) increase analgesic adherence ( primary outcome ) ; c ) large proportion report satisfaction pain intensity whose nurse obtain appropriate analgesic patient ' pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unrelieved cancer pain end life major health problem inconsistent patient-centered goal last day . Building successful approach research outpatient oncology setting , investigator propose study test PAINRelieveIt , system-level intervention computerized tool patient-reported pain outcome ( English , Spanish , Chinese languages ) , decision support clinician ( English ) multimedia education tailor cancer patient lay caregiver . Using 1-week pre-test/post-test randomized design patient receive home level hospice care provide two Chicago-area hospice , compare effect usual hospice care PAINReportIt Summary usual hospice care PAINRelieveIt pain outcome . The tablet-based PAINRelieveIt include valid reliable pain tool ( PAINReportIt ) , summary patient 's pain data decision support hospice nurse obtain recommendation algorithm-based analgesic therapy ( PAINConsultN ) , multimedia education tailor patient 's lay caregiver 's pain management misconception ( PainUCope ) . Patient's/caregiver 's answer automatically store electronic database , system generates PAINReportIt Summary ( usual hospice care control group ) ; PAINConsultN PainUCope ( experimental group ) . All patient receive usual hospice care . All patients/caregivers complete PAINReportIt pretest 1-week later ( posttest ) ; patient also complete part PAINReportIt daily . Via daily e-mail update , control-group hospice nurse receive PAINReportIt Summary experimental-group hospice nurse receive PAINConsultN . Additionally , experimental group patients/caregivers view multimedia educational material via PAINUCope help patient report pain adhere prescribe analgesic . Specific aim compare usual hospice care PAINRelieveIt group effect : 1 . Patient outcome ( analgesic adherence ; bad pain intensity , satisfaction , misconception ) lay caregiver outcome ( pain misconception ) diverse sample 250 cancer patient-caregiver dyad receive hospice care . 2 . Nurse outcome ( obtain appropriate analgesic patient ) sample hospice nurse . The investigator hypothesize posttest , control pretest data compare usual care group , PAINRelieveIt group : ) report decrease score bad pain intensity pain misconception ; b ) increase analgesic adherence ( primary outcome ) ; c ) large proportion report satisfaction pain intensity whose nurse obtain appropriate analgesic patient ' pain . Findings guide future system-level research implement PAINRelieveIt multi-site , longitudinal trial test effect disseminate technology clinical decision manage pain patient/caregiver pain outcome national sample hospice . This approach offer improved pain control die patient population .</detailed_description>
