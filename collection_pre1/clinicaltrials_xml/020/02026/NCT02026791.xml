	<brief_summary>Since laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) design introduced clinical setting , supraglottic airway device widely use advantage manipulation device insert easy endotracheal tube cause less postoperative sore throat . Insertion LMA perform relatively easily safety appropriate depth anesthesia compare insertion endotracheal tube LMA insert without use laryngoscope without cause stimulus vocal cord trachea . Hence , LMA may useful case coronary artery disease carotid endarectomy stabilization cardiopulmonary function important . In addition , LMA hemodynamically stable induction anesthesia also arousal anesthesia thus less dangerous cardiovascular disease patient . LMA may useful also patient chronic obstructive lung disease patient excessively sensitive airway ventilation difficult perform . Therefore , elderly patient prevalence cardiovascular disease chronic obstructive lung disease , use LMA , stimulate airway less , may provide hemodynamical stability reduce relevant complication side effect . LMA Supreme newly design way proven superior conventional LMA Classic term easy insertion oropharyngeal seal . A study compare LMA Classic LMA Supreme adult subject show LMA Supreme superior insertion success rate well oropharyngeal leak pressure ( OLP ) LMA Classic . Another newly develop supraglottic airway device I-gel . In I-gel , disposable , latex-free LMA , soft , gel-type cuff make thermoplastic elastomer replaces inflatable cuff LMAs . Thus , I-gel advantage , instal , require additional clinical manipulation cuff inflation cuff pressure monitoring . A comparison I-gel LMA Classic disposable supraglottic airway device produce various manufacture adult subject show clinical property similar respect easy insertion , time require installation , laryngopharynx leak pressure , degree glottis exposure observe fiberoptic bronchoscope . Thus , I-gel expect supraglottic airway device may replace conventional LMA Classic . The elderly know upper airway anatomically different young adult depend age . A study conduct CT show normal elderly people wider upper airway young male middle-aged male elderly accompany sleep apnea wider upper airway young male region include nasopharynx , oropharynx , hypopharynx . Therefore , upper airway elderly wider longer , different supraglottic airway device guide may necessary . Our previous study show single time success rate significantly low , insertion difficult , insertion take long time LMA classic use elderly patient young adult patient . However , available guide use supraglottic airway device supraglottic airway device appropriate elderly patient . Moreover , study ever conduct regard guide . Therefore , study , clinical usefulness I-gel LMA Supreme , new supraglottic airway device , verify elderly patient . It also verify two device well use supraglottic airway device .</brief_summary>
