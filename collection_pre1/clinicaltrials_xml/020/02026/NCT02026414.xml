	<brief_summary>PrimaVie ( Natreon Inc ) , purify standardized shilajit extract nutraceutical use . Research indicate PrimaVie® target action increase energy , revitalization anti-aging . Findings recent murine study reveal PrimaVie ( PV ) significantly change expression gene relate muscle function ( unpublished data ) . Based fact , think interest study effect PrimaVie exercise training human skeletal muscle adaptation . The objective study determine effect PrimaVie supplementation combine PrimaVie supplementation exercise change muscle gene expression relate muscle function . Two hypothesizes make , oral supplementation PrimaVie twice day 12 week influence gene expression skeletal muscle pre-obese obese human , oral supplementation PV act treadmill exercise training favorably impact skeletal muscle gene expression . The participant total 3 visit 12 week . During visit include measurement height , weight vital sign , 2 tablespoon blood draw leave right arm , muscle biopsy ( use biopsy needle ) collect use local anesthetic . The blood muscle biopsy use lab related procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subject see advertisement placed location around Wexner Medical Center RN ( research nurse ) list main contact . After potential subject contact research nurse , he/she use inclusion/exclusion criterion determine potential eligibility . If potential subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , he/she schedule primary visit Morehouse Medical Plaza Davis Heart Lung Research Institute . At initial visit , research nurse meet potential subject private room study fully explain lay language , inform consent obtain . Then , appropriate demographic , biometric health/clinical information record data collection sheet , 22.5 mL blood obtain via venipuncture right/ leave forearm . A muscle biopsy also collect trained physician . The blood muscle biopsy use lab relate study procedure . The subject give 8-week supply PrimaVie supplement instruction , well copy research protocol inform consent form . If supplement mail , also instruction , well copy research protocol inform consent form mail . The subject instruct call Research Nurse/ approve study personnel let know received supplement mail go question concern subject may well schedule follow visit . All follow visit ( T1 , T2 , T3a T3b ) consist 22.5 mL blood draw , collection muscle biopsy/biopsies measurement previously specify demographic , biometric health/clinical variable . For 4 week exercise treadmill training ( 70-75 % HRmax 20 min ; 5 min warm 5 min cool - total 30 min day ; 3 day week ) , subject supervise ( study personnel ) exercise routine ( Treadmill ) study designate facility ( locate The Ohio State University campus ) . Study Hypotheses : - Hypothesis 1 : That oral supplementation PrimaVie twice day 12 week influence gene expression skeletal muscle sedentary pre-obese obese human - Hypothesis 2 : That oral supplementation PrimaVie synergistically act treadmill exercise training favorably impact skeletal muscle gene expression . Aim : A non-randomized , longitudinal study determine effect PrimaVie exercise training human skeletal muscle adaptation 30 pre-obese obese volunteer . Participants : 40 volunteer recruit via study advertisement , contact research staff base study inclusion exclusion criterion . At visit follow recorded/collected : - 22.5 mL blood ( approximately 2 tablespoon ) ( venipuncture ) - Muscle biopsy/biopsies ( 1 muscle biopsy per visit collect T1 T2 , 2 muscle biopsy collect T3 ) - Age ( year ) - Sex ( M/F ) - Height ( cm ) - Weight ( lb ) - BMI ( Kg/m2 ) - Blood pressure ( mm/Hg ) - Pulse - Body fat Percentage - During first visit ( enrollment visit , T1 ) , follow information recorded/collected well : - Tobacco use history - Current alcohol use - Current drug use - Current exercise regimen - Date first day last menstrual period ( female ) - Current Medications - Allergies - Nonmedical information , include : address ( used send PrimaVie supplement via mail , applicable ) ; telephone number , email address Participants come three visit : - Visit 1 ( T1 ) - Baseline ( prior start supplementation ) - Visit 2 ( T2 ) - First 8 week supplementation alone - Visit 3 ( T3 ) - Next 4 week supplementation together exercise ( T3 consist 2 sample collection : T3a ( pre-exercise ) 12 week supplementation together 4 week exercise - sample take immediately final exercise routine ( Visit 3 ) , T3b ( post exercise ) 12 week supplementation together 4 week exercise immediately final exercise routine ( Visit 3 ) Samples collect participant : - Peripheral blood : At visit , 22.5 mL peripheral venous blood collect . - Muscle biopsy : biopsy collect Vastus lateralis Gastrocnemius muscle . A biopsy collect board certify Physician application local anesthetic site biopsy . Study Supplement : PrimaVie ( Natreon Inc ) , purify standardized shilajit extract nutraceutical use . Research indicate PrimaVie® target action increase energy , revitalization anti-aging . PrimaVie® also work cellular level , play direct role synthesis ATP , compound supply body energy , healthy mitochondrial function . Findings recent murine study reveal PrimaVie ( PV ) significantly change expression gene relate muscle function ( unpublished data ) . Based fact , think interest study effect PrimaVie exercise training human skeletal muscle adaptation . Participants take : - 500 mg/day PrimaVie ( Natreon Inc. ) supplement , 250 twice day first 8 week study ( 250 mg capsule morning food 250 mg capsule even food ) - 500 mg/day PrimaVie ( Natreon Inc ) supplement , 250 mg twice day next 4 week ( 250 mg capsule morning food 250 mg capsule even food ) study include supervise exercise treadmill training , include : - exercise supervise treadmill training ( supervise treadmill train include 5 minute warm ; 70-75 % HRmax 20 minute ; 5 minute cool - total 30 minute per day 3 day per week )</detailed_description>
