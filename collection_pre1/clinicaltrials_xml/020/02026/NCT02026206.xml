	<detailed_description>Study design : This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centered trial carry two university hospital . This clinical trial approve Korea Food Drug Administration Institutional Review Boards two hospital . Study process : All patient give inform write consent inform detail study . Participants permit take analgesic severe difficult control pain occur . Participants randomize either LLLT placebo control group third visit . All participant underwent demographic history taking , physical examination , obstetrics gynecology examination , ultrasound , laboratory test . All participant educate use device demonstration picture-guided user manual . During second visit , participant conduct self-evaluation pain intensity quality life next menstruation start ( pre-treatment score ) use VAS EQ-5D questionnaire . The third visit occur least 5-7 day date next menstruation , clinical primary nurse describe use medical equipment device home . All subject perform LLLT 20 min/day 5 day start menstruation . Within 3 day menstruation start subject self-assessed pain use VAS treatment ( first post-treatment score ) . Subjects carry self-treatment way home 5-7 day start next period visit hospital fifth time record pain VAS ( second post-treatment score ) . As , self-therapy perform 5-7 day next menstruation start . The sixth visit occur within 1-3 day menstruation begin , , subject perform self-evaluation ( third post-treatment score ) use EQ-5D questionnaire VAS menstrual pain intensity . Statistical analysis : All data summarize mean Â± standard deviation number proportion . A p &lt; 0.05 consider indicate significance . We decide therapeutic effect would &gt; 30 % reduction VAS value treatment . The statistical analysis conduct use VAS assessment score third treatment primary endpoint . We use independent t-test evaluate difference group VAS pain score measure third treatment baseline value . The influence variance group pre-treatment , primary treatment , secondary treatment , tertiary treatment verify repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . We analyze difference EQ-5D group use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . Age consider covariate . Any difference group use painkiller analyze Fisher 's exact test . If difference use pain killer group , influence pain killer use closely checked ANCOVA . A per-protocol ( PP ) analysis use clinical trial ass efficacy safety .</detailed_description>
