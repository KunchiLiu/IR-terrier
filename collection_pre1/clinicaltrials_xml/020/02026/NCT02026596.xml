	<brief_summary>Subarachnoidal hemorrhage ( SAH ) cause long-term disability death . Annually 1000 people Finland suffer SAH , average age 50 year . SAH mortality rate 12 % acutely 40 % patient die within month admission hospital . In addition , 30 % survive patient remain neurological deficit . Most survivor primary insult suffer secondary injury first 2-3 week insult . Despite advance neurosurgical -radiological technique intensive care , mortality morbidity rate SAH change recent year . There still limit understanding mechanism secondary insult cause brain injury SAH . In study investigator aim clarify timescale mechanism contribute secondary insult .
