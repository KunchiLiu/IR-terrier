	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes patient prove decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) level . Incretin base therapy associate improved glycemic control boost GLP-1 level . Nevertheless , clinical effect great diversity poorly control Type 2 diabetes patient . This study design understand pharmacological effect genetic variation incretin base therapy type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incretin Based Therapy Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Since GLP-1 receptor encode GLP1R ( glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ) gene , individual may veritably respond incretion base treatment , depend presence absence minor allele characterize single nucleotide polymorphism . The genotyping patient perform compare genetic factor pharmacological effect . Expected Results : How select anti-diabetic drug tailor individual becomes important enormously increase class treatment modality . This study could great help recommend best possible agent individual , improve possibility treatment success , justify need expensive drug give patient .</detailed_description>
