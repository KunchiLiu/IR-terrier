	<brief_summary>Vascular access complication occur cardiac peripheral arterial catheterization . These complication increase patient morbidity mortality , well healthcare cost . Several strategy device employ decrease risk vascular access complication , fluoroscopy-guided access , ultrasound-guided access vascular closure device . Randomized trial data fail demonstrate fluoroscopic guidance reduces common femoral artery access complication . While meta-analysis data demonstrate vascular closure device decrease time arterial hemostasis , increase patient mobilization facilitate earlier patient discharge , reduce incidence vascular complication compare hemostasis achieve manual pressure . Ultrasound guidance show facilitate femoral artery access reduce femoral artery vascular complication . A new device , Micropuncture Kit ( Cook Medical , Bloomington , IN ) allow vascular access small 21gauge needle oppose standard method , require 18 gauge needle . The use Micropuncture Kit purpose decrease vascular access complication examine randomize study date . The present study 552 patient randomize control clinical trial help determine whether femoral arterial access obtain use Micropuncture Kit reduce incidence vascular access complication compare standard 18 gauge needle . The specific aim proposal compare rate femoral artery access complication use Micropuncture Kit vs. standard femoral artery access . It hypothesis incidence femoral artery access complication low among patient Micropuncture Kit use .</brief_summary>
