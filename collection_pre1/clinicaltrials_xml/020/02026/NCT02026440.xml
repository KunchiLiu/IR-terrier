	<brief_title>Evaluation An Oral Fluid Collection Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study evaluate VioOne Oral Fluid Sample Collection Device ( herein refer VioOne Device ) consist several sub-studies describe : A . Recovery Study This study determine percent recovery cotinine spike oral fluid non-smokers collect VioOne Sample Collection Device . 1 . Sample collection Oral fluid collect per VioOne package insert five individual self-reported non-smokers . The sample collect individually spike cotinine concentration 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 25ng/mL . Two set concentration prepare . One set store 2-8Â°C prior test one set ship per routine shipping condition test upon return . 2 . Testing Each sample test duplicate Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay percent recovery calculate level comparing detected concentration spike concentration . 3 . Data Analysis Percent recovery calculate level comparing detected concentration spike concentration . B. Sensitivity/Accuracy Study The study goal show Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA capable distinguish smoker nonsmoker oral fluid sample collect VioOne Sample Collection Device use . 1 . Sample Collection A minimum two study site participate study . Approximately 218 individual enrol study . At least 58 collected sample must self-declared smoker . Oral fluid sample collect individual , give informed consent self-report anonymous fashion whether individual smoker number cigarette smoke per day average . Two sample collect individual study . One sample collect use VioOne Collection Device one collect use commercially available saliva collection cup . There age , gender race criterion enrol patient . 2 . Testing All sample collect VioOne Sample Collection Device test Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA neat saliva sample collect saliva collection cup test GC/MS , latter gold standard method . 3 . Data Analysis The GC/MS result use gold standard assess clinical sensitivity specificity assay use oral fluid sample collect VioOne Oral Fluid Collection Device . C. Assay Specificity Study Beverages Household material test interference detection cotinine oral fluid . 1 . Sample Collection Oral Fluid sample collect individual self-reported non-smokers result sample/buffer matrix pool . The pool divide 15 aliquot individually spike follow 14 compound . One aliquot form pool remain un-spiked . Each spike aliquot divide three aliquot . One aliquot remain spike compound , one aliquot spike 5ng/mL Cotinine one aliquot spike 15ng/mL Cotinine . 2 . Testing Each sample test duplicate . The following compound spike final concentration 10 % unless otherwise note : Sugar Water Alcohol ( Ethanol ) Toothpaste Whole Blood ( 10mg/mL ) Cranberry Juice Hydrogen Peroxide Baking Soda Sodium Chloride Orange Juice Cola Cough Syrup Antiseptic Water Hemoglobin ( 10mg/mL ) 3 . Data Analysis Results compare expected performance measure precision study . ( precision study require use collect human oral fluid ) D. Assay Specificity Study The effect potential food oral cavity contaminant evaluate timed study . 1 . Sample Collection Ten individual self-reported non-smokers recruit study . One sample collect use VioOne Sample Collection Device individual immediately prior start study . Each individual give piece hard candy consume . Additional sample collect VioOne immediately post consumption , ten minute post consumption every thirty minute three hour . After sample collect sample divide two aliquot . One aliquot spike 5ng/mL cotinine one aliquot spike 15ng/mL cotinine . 2 . Testing Each sample/spike/time point test triplicate 3 . Data Analysis Results compare expected performance measure precision study . ( precision study require use collect human oral fluid ) E. Stability sample sample collection buffer A study perform establish stability sample store sample collection buffer various temperature time . 1 . Sample Collection Oral Fluid sample collect individual self-reported non-smokers result sample/buffer matrix pool . The pool split three aliquot . One aliquot spike 7.5ng/mL cotinine , one aliquot spike 10ng/mL cotinine one aliquot remain non-spiked . Each one spike non-spike aliquoted four tube store -20 oC , 2-8oC , room temperature 37oC . 2 . Testing Each sample test eight replicates Day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 35 . 3 . Data analysis The sample consider stable test time point 95 % confidence interval cotinine concentration give day sample overlap Day 0 . F. ELISA Device Stability A long term stability study perform establish stability expiration date Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay along VioOne Sample collection Device . 1 . Sample Collection At test time point , sample three individual collect . Each individual provide three samples- one three lot VioOne Sample Collection Devices . The result sample/buffer matrix obtain lot VioOne Sample Collection Device pool ( total 3 individual sample per pool total 3 pool ) . The result pool divide two aliquot . One aliquot spike 5ng/mL cotinine 25ng/mL cotinine . 2 . Testing Each spike sample test eight replicates period 21 month . Over course testing , three ELISA assay lot use . 3 . Data Analysis The Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay VioOne Sample Collection Device consider stable sample test time point produce result within 95 % confidence interval cotinine concentration overlap Day 0 .</detailed_description>
