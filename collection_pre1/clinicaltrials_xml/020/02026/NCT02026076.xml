	<brief_summary>This study seek determine 1 ) manual unloading test reliable , 2 ) immediate response traction determine use simple unloading test standing . The study wil complete two part : 1 ) small pilot sample ( n=10 ) asses intra inter tester reliability , 2 ) consecutive sample 30 patient low back pain travel knee . All subject rate pain 100 mm line rest painful direction movement . A therapist unload patient spine determine feel relief . All subject undergo 15 minute bout intermittent lumbar traction , 30 sec , 10 sec 50 % body weight . Following traction , subject rate pain 100 mm line . Subjects group response initial manual unloading test assess within group difference . The study hypothesis manual unloading test reliable , responder mechanical traction accurately identify use manual unloading test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manual Unloading Lumbar Spine : Can Predict Responders Mechanical Traction ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist two distinct component . Part one reliability study manual unloading . Two therapist , familiar technique manual unloading describe Kaltenborn17 , perform manual unloading test , blind previous result . Ten consecutive patient recruit sample convenience University Of Connecticut Health Center Department Of Rehabilitation . This test repeat subject within 7 day initial test . Tests agreement apply determine intra inter-rater reliability . Part two consist trial lumbar traction group subject low back pain without radiculopathy , anticipate n=30 . At time enrollment , subject complete standardize informed consent form , detail potential risk trail . Consent include permission demographic data obtain standard intake form , keep de-identified form secure location . All subject complete screen form , ensure potential subject exclude factor present . Prior enrollment , subject complete standardized medical history form ( kept part medical record patient ) , part standard departmental practice . Additionally , participant complete modify Oswestry questionnaire well two 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) , one indicating pain rest , indicate pain provocative test motion ( flexion , extension , side flexion lumbar spine ) . Subjects test unload stand describe Kaltenborn . This test involve therapist apply low grade lift force patient stand position , test symptomatic alleviation via elimination compression pain sensitive structure . Results test cod ( + ) relief ( - ) relief . Prior traction application , subject undergo standardize , comprehensive examination ( standard care ) , include screen exclusion criterion ( myotomal weakness , sensation change , positive neural tension sign ) . All subject weigh prior traction application determine treatment force generate . To aid determine BMI , subject also height measure . The reference test consist single application mechanical traction , 15 minute , 30 second on/ 10 second , 50 % body weight treatment table open position , position supine , hook lie neutral posture . Post traction , subject repeat AROM measure , complete second pair VAS determine immediate effect intervention .</detailed_description>
