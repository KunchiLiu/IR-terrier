	<brief_summary>This research study involve two investigational drug , veledimex , activator ligand ( INXN-1001 ) combination Adenovirus Vector Engineered Express hIL-12 ( INXN-2001 ) . IL-12 protein may improve body 's natural response disease enhance ability immune system kill tumor cell may interfere blood flow tumor . The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability single tumor injection INXN-2001 give combination oral veledimex .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Ad-RTS-hIL-12 With Veledimex Subjects With Glioblastoma Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient stratify one two group , accord clinical indication tumor resection . Patients scheduled standard care craniotomy tumor resection receive one dose veledimex resection procedure . Ad-RTS-hIL-12 administered free-hand injection . Patients continue oral veledimex 14 day . Patients scheduled tumor resection receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 stereotactic injection continue oral veledimex 14 day . The study divide three period : screening period , treatment period follow-up period .</detailed_description>
