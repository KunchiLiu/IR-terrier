	<brief_summary>Objectives : The purpose study investigate attentional ( internal vs. external ) focus effect person amputation perform define compensatory movement reduce likelihood fall . An internal focus attention direct person 's conscious attention body 's movement , whereas external focus attention direct person 's conscious attention effect movement specific feature environment . Numerous experiment investigated effect internal external focus attention motor performance finding favor external focus attention . In work , propose motor learn research experiment evaluate attentional focus strategy rehabilitation outcomes learn adaptation new proprioceptive information person recent transtibial amputation . Research Design Methodology : For pilot study , six participant recent unilateral transtibial amputation recruit . Four participant receive internal external focus attention train method two ( control group ) receive standard prosthetic training instruction . The experiment conduct three phase : Phase 1 -- Baseline Performance Test , Phase 2 -- Training session , Phase 3 - Learning Test . The training utilize vibrotactile device design generate tactile sensation skin-socket interface simulate contact prosthesis environment . The sensation simulate perturbation signal potential fall event . During experiment augment sensory information introduce randomly participant walk preferred pace level surface . Movement kinematics kinetics body record analysis use motion capture system force plate . Finding : It hypothesize external focus attention condition outperform internal focus attention condition respond perturbation . The external focus attention condition yield faster response time show improve compensatory response compare internal focus attention group produce great lateral displacement artificial limb relative line progression . In addition , external condition demonstrate great step length step height internal focus attention condition provide perturbation . Clinical Significance : Current practice within field Physical Therapy reveal little therapeutic intervention fall prevention . Instructions traditionally provide reduce risk fall preparation room obstacle avoidance proper way fall decrease injury . However , protocol provide prosthetic user compensatory strategy avoid fall perturbation occur . The research find result improve training protocol , improve rehabilitative outcome . Impact/Significance : The grow number prosthetic user present need improve patient care effective prosthetic training rehabilitation method . Complimentary mission VA , result research could enhance quality patient care assist patient toward become prosthetically rehabilitate .</brief_summary>
