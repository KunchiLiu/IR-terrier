	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety effect special type cancer vaccine call 'dendritic cell vaccine ' patient either newly diagnose recurrent glioblastoma . The goal dendritic cell vaccine activate patient 's immune system tumor . This study utilize patient 's immune-stimulating dendritic cell isolated procedure call leukapheresis . In laboratory , dendritic cell treat way design promote immune response cancer stem cell . Then dendritic cell inject skin series vaccination , goal activate immune response cancer stem cell tumor . To qualify study , patient must little residual tumor visible recent MRI . In addition vaccine , patient newly diagnose glioblastoma receive standard temozolomide chemotherapy radiation therapy . Patients recurrent glioblastoma receive treatment vaccine long participate study , unless previously treat bevacizumab , case allow continue receive bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Dendritic Cell Vaccine Patients With Either Newly Diagnosed Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study patient either newly diagnose recurrent glioblastoma minimal residual tumor utilizes dendritic cell vaccine consist autologous dendritic cell pulse lysate derive allogeneic glioblastoma stem-like cell line culture neurosphere-forming condition . Patients receive series four vaccine give weekly Induction phase , follow vaccination every 8 week Maintenance phase long patient remain study vaccine supply deplete . In addition investigative treatment , patient newly diagnose glioblastoma receive standard temozolomide chemotherapy radiation treatment , Induction phase begin conclusion radiation . Patients recurrent glioblastoma receive treatment investigative treatment , unless previously treat bevacizumab , case allow continue receive bevacizumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Cohort A : Newly diagnose glioblastoma Patients initial biopsy partial resection qualify Cohort A second surgery ( achieve gross total resection ) occur within 30 day initial surgery , without interval treatment use radiation chemotherapy two surgery . Cohort B : Glioblastoma include third recurrence To qualify Cohort B , patient must previously treat involvedfield radiation therapy concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy , pathology resection qualifies patient trial must consistent recurrent disease ( ie , patient predominantly pseudoprogression radiation necrosis eligible ) . Patients initially diagnose lowgrade glioma ( ie , WHO grade 2 glioma ) subsequent progression highgrade glioma eligible Cohort B provide meet eligibility criterion . Patients recurrent highgrade glioma eligible include third recurrence , therefore permit treated three distinct chemotherapy regimens prior trial enrollment . Prior and/or continue bevacizumab therapy allow . 2 . Complete resection tumor : gross total resection consist gadolinium enhancement linear gadolinium enhancement along resection cavity ; subtotal resection consist linear enhancement nodular gadolinium enhancement le 1cm x 1cm x 1cm total volume . The qualify surgical resection must perform CedarsSinai order allow tumor stem cell antigen test . 3 . ≥ 18 year age 4 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % 5 . Baseline hematologic study chemistry profile must meet following criterion : hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9.9 g/dL , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) &lt; 30 mg/dL , creatinine &lt; 1.4 mg/dL , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 4x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.6 x control unless therapeutically warrant 6 . Female patient child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test 7 . If surgically sterile , male female patient childbearing age must use double barrier contraception ( hormonal ; intrauterine device ; barrier ) 8 . Written informed consent , Release Medical Records Form HIPAA review sign patient legally authorize representative 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 10 . Any Grade 3 4 toxicity ( accord NCI CTCAE ) resolve least 2 week Grade 1 less 1 . Presence active malignancy prior history malignancy , opinion Investigator , would interfere evaluation vaccine interpretation patient safety study result . 2 . Clinically significant pulmonary , cardiac systemic disease , opinion Investigator , would interfere evaluation vaccine interpretation patient safety study result example : 1 . New York Heart Association &gt; Grade 2 congestive heart failure within 6 month prior study entry ; 2 . Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include : Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) ; Clinically significant abnormality electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 3 . Pulmonary disease include great grade 2 dyspnea , laryngeal edema , grade 3 pulmonary edema , pulmonary hypertension accord CTCAE 4.03 4 . Severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition could increase risk associate trial participation trial drug administration could interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry trial . This include limited following : ( ) Immunosuppressive disease , ( b ) Chronic renal disease / failure , ( c ) Concurrent neurodegenerative disease , ( ) Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol . 5 . Presence acute infection require active treatment antibiotics/antivirals ; prophylactic administration allow 6 . Active autoimmune disorder know history autoimmune neurologic condition ( e.g . GuillainBarre syndrome ) . Patients vitiligo , type 1 diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement therapy , psoriasis require systemic therapy , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . 7 . Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity acquire immunodeficiency syndrome related illness serious medical condition 8 . Breastfeeding 9 . Received therapeutic investigational agent within 30 day enrollment 10 . Contraindication MRI 11 . Foreseeable condition would preclude reduction steroid ( dexamethasone ) maximum 2 mg BID within week prior apheresis . 12 . Any foreseeable scheduling constraint would prevent patient Cohort A start chemoradiation within 7 week surgery , foreseeable scheduling constraint would prevent patient Cohort B start Vaccine Induction Phase within 7 week surgery . 13 . Any concomitant chemotherapy standarddose temozolomide patient Cohort A ; concomitant chemotherapy patient Cohort B , exception antiangiogenic humanize monoclonal antibody bevacizumab , allow patient treat bevacizumab prior enrollment trial .</criteria>
