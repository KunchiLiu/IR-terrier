	<brief_summary>We wish prospectively assess burden , management therapeutic approach , outcome acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure require ventilatory support , winter month northern southern hemisphere . We wish specifically examine contribution ARDS define Berlin Definition burden hypoxaemic respiratory failure . Why ? The purpose study provide new current data disease burden acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ARDS . It answer follow question : - What frequency disease burden acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure winter ? - What aetiologies acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure require ventilatory support ? - What incidence ARDS base Berlin definition within patient cohort ? - What mortality ARDS within cohort , vary base ARDS severity ? - What natural history ARDS ? - What key pattern therapeutic resource utilization , particularly approach sustain gas exchange , patient ? When ? The study perform 4 week period February 1st March 31st 2014 Northern Hemisphere June 1st August 31st Southern Hemisphere . What data require ? A basic dataset collect patient admit acute acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure require ventilatory support , detailed dataset collect patient diagnosed ARDS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In summary , study focus follow item : - The frequency disease burden acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure winter - The aetiology acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure require ventilatory support . - The incidence ARDS base Berlin definition within patient cohort - The mortality ARDS within cohort , vary base ARDS severity - Natural history ARDS ( duration evolution severity ) - Therapeutic resource utilization - Use treatment , recruitment maneuver , prone positioning , nitric oxide , high frequency oscillation , ECMO , transfer tertiary hospital small regional one ) accord severity disease - Use non-invasive ventilation management ARDS patient ( use different stage : early ARDS versus immediately extubation ) . This prospective observational study , aim collect adequate dataset large cohort patient admit large number ICUs . ICUs invite participate voluntary basis . ICUs enrol exist database ( e.g. , ERIC study , ICON audit ) invite participate . It important participate ICUs commit ( write agreement ) fully comply study protocol . ICU recruitment country spearhead national coordinator Each ICU request recruit 4 consecutive 'winter ' week 1 . Northern Hemisphere - 4 week period February 1st March 31st 2014 . 2 . Southern Hemisphere : 4 week period June 1st - August 31st 2014 There 2 data collector per participate ICU 's . Each data collector undergo online training program design standardize data interpretation [ esp . CXR 's ] receive login authorization follow completion training . INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient admit participate ICUs receive invasive noninvasive ventilation screen included database . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age &lt; 16 . DATA COLLECTION : Data collection web base , permit conditional Data Collection screen , i.e . data collector automatically guide section complete base data enter indicate whether Inclusion Criteria meet . Data collection do 10am morning . Our aim obtain sample least 1000 ARDS patient within cohort patient receive assisted ventilation . The reported incidence ARDS ICU patient varies , 2.2 % ICU admission develop ARDS ALIEN , 7.1 % ALIVE Study , 17.5 % Ventilated patient KCLIP . A reasonable projection incidence ARDS among patient admit ICUs estimate approximate 5 % ICU admission . As conservative estimate , medium-sized ICU admit 50 patients/month collect data four , 500 ICUs necessary achieve number .</detailed_description>
