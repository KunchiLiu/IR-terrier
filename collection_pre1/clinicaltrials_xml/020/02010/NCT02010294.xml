	<brief_title>Invasive Group A Streptococcus ( GAS ) Infection Children : Bacterial Virulence Factors Detection Host Immunological and/or Genetic Factors Predisposition Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The group A streptococcus ( GAS ) Streptococcus pyogenes strictly human pathogen , cause wide variety infection . These range simple asymptomatic carriage 20 % child , minor illness sore throat impetigo , severe condition necrotizing fasciitis toxic shock syndrome . The pathophysiological mechanism invasive GAS infection poorly understood . These mechanism could involve virulence factor bacterium ( M protein determine emm genotype , also super- antigenic exotoxin SpeA , Spe C , Ssa , Sme z virulence gene , SilC , ... Sic ) , also case , factor associate host immunity particular absence risk factor invasive skin infection cutaneous effraction ( wound , burn , chicken pox ) , corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy recent surgery . The investigator assume invasive GAS infection , especially child without risk factor , Mendelian susceptibility infection may involve . This hypothesis could test study molecular characteristic strain isolate SGA innate adaptive immunity child hospitalise invasive GAS infection without identify risk factor infection . This study could lead good understand pathophysiological mechanism invasive GAS infection also detect child underwent invasive GAS genetic susceptibility infection require specific care . Finally , could also identify specific strain SGA molecular profile , whose detection practice , lead suspicion hereditary immune deficiency .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 1 month &lt; 15 year time inclusion Group 1 : Children hospitalize invasive GAS infection Subgroup 1A ( N = 75 ) : Children invasive infection without know risk factor . Subgroup 1B ( N = 75 ) : Children invasive infection know risk factor . GAS Invasive infection define : ) Proved infection : Bacteriological isolation S. pyogenes liquid normally sterile site , except blister simple erysipelas , without necrosis . This sometimes associate shock multiorgan failure ( streptococcal toxic shock syndrome ( STSS ) ) b ) Probable infection : 1. . Bacteriological isolation S. pyogenes normally nonsterile site ( eg skin , upper respiratory tract ) associate extensive soft tissue necrosis 2. . Bacteriological isolation S. pyogenes site biological sample usually nonsterile ( eg skin , upper respiratory tract ) associate evocative shock syndrome STSS cause find . Contributing factor invasive infection define : cutaneous effraction ( wound , burn , chicken pox ) , use corticosteroid treatment , immunosuppressive recent surgery • Group 2 : noninvasive infection pharyngitis , tonsillitis , proctitis skin infection diagnose positive test rapid diagnosis GAS perform site infection positive GAS culture . Group 1 : Children know immune deficiency unrelated risk factor describe . Group 2 : Children know immune deficiency .</criteria>
