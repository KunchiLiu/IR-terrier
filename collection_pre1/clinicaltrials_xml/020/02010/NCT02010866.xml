	<detailed_description>According theory motivational interviewing stage change , individual change health behavior benefit ( e.g. , less stress ) outweigh risk ( e.g. , concern confidentiality treatment ) . Prior research suggest educational programming promote benefit counter perceive risk counsel increase adult ' motivation get professional help .

Moutier colleague similar size academic medical center OHSU , University California San Diego ( UCSD ) , administer survey medical student , resident , fellow , faculty ( 13 % complete ) majority eventually see clinician indicate never would seek help receive feedback ISP encourage come evaluation/treatment . Being able anonymously dialogue clinician specific situation question appear persuade participant come evaluation accept referral . This academic medical center in-house counseling program resident faculty like OHSU RFWP—UCSD trainees receive initial evaluation clinician provide community referral . Their participation rate 13 % similar rate participation ISP undergraduate population . In present study , hypothesize highly visible utilized RFWP may lead high ISP participation rate among resident , fellow , faculty . Although ultimate goal save life ( i.e. , reduce rate suicide among medical trainee faculty ) , low base rate suicide population make difficult evaluate whether implementation ISP OHSU lead drop suicide rate institution . Even use patient suicidal ideation attempt outcomes problematic information difficult gather unless patient actively involved treatment time . Rather present study effectiveness suicide prevention program measure examine related variable suicide risk—increases protective factor decrease risk factor . Specifically , researcher seek decrease know risk factor ( e.g. , identify intervene untreated depression , substance abuse , high level stress ) increase protective factor ( e.g. , promote self-awareness , receipt support resource delivery mental health service need ) . Present study aim : - reduce know risk factor untreated psychological distress ( e.g. , depression , high stress level , substance abuse ) encouraging resident , fellow , School Medicine ( SOM ) faculty complete self-assessment level stress risk use ISP offer professional help personalize message/dialogue directly address concerns/barriers seek help RFWP offer resource well cop ; - increase self-awareness mildly/moderately distressed trainee faculty fill ISP offer preventive/early intervention educational resource via ISP topic relevant ( base response ) ; - evaluate whether RFWP patient ( one come program via ISP referral source ) report decrease psychological distress , burnout , risk suicide across treatment ; - ass level satisfaction RFWP educational outreach workshop , consultation department leader ( referral trainee and/or faculty ) , clinical service provide distressed trainee faculty .</detailed_description>
