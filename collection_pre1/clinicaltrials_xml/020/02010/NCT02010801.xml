	<brief_summary>Liver cancer include primary hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) metastatic liver cancer one common malignancy world . Over 10000 new case per year diagnose Taiwan . Despite many treatment option , prognosis HCC remain dismal . More 8000 people die cancer every year Taiwan . A majority ( 70 % 85 % ) patient present advance unresectable disease . In contrast , small liver cancer cure appreciable frequency . Five-year disease-free survival exceed 50 % report surgical resection , inoperable patient vascular invasion extrahepatic spread . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) recommend alternative curative therapy . However , main drawback RFA limitation tumor size location . The tumor large 5 cm diameter locate adjacent vessel , could ablate completely . Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) , develop manufacture AngioDynamics US Ltd , ablate tumor fenestrating cancer cell membrane electric pulse . The anti-tumor effect result thermotherapy , also diminish adjacent vessel . Several pre-clinical study already demonstrate IRE safe effective treatment live cancer . The system receive CE mark approval 2008 FDA approval 2010 . However , experience use IRE fro tumor ablation Taiwan . In study , investigator perform intraoperative IRE patient liver cancer schedule receive hepatectomy hospital , investigator evaluate ablate effect tumor specimens , effect adjacent vessel . The investigator appraisal clinical feasibility advantage system study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The diagnosis HCC cancer hepatic metastatic pathologic proven . The diagnosis HCC make pathology / cytology accord AASLD ( 2010 ) diagnostic criterion . In brief , Nodules large 1 cm find ultrasound screen cirrhotic liver investigate either 4phase multidetector CT scan dynamic contrast enhance MRI . If appearance typical HCC ( i.e. , hypervascular arterial phase washout portal venous delay phase ) , lesion treat HCC . If finding characteristic vascular profile typical , second contrast enhance study image modality perform , lesion biopsied . Biopsies small lesion evaluate expert pathologist . Tissue clearly HCC stain available marker include CD34 , CK7 , glypican 3 , HSP70 , glutamine synthetase improve diagnostic accuracy . Suitable surgical resection , distance tumor preserve vessel less 5 mm . Adequate safe margin obtain . There least one tumor , less equal 3 tumor , Each tumor must ≤ 5 cm diameter , ChildPugh class AB , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score 01 , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) score ≤ 3 , Platelet count ≥ 100 K/Μl Total bilirubin ≦ 2 mg/dL ALT AST &lt; 5 x upper limit normal PTINR ≦ 2.0 , PT &lt; 6 second control Serum creatinine ≦ 1.5 x upper limit normal Prior Informed Consent Form Life expectancy least 3 month . Congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 2 Active coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( myocardial infarction 6 month prior study entry allow ) Cardiac arrhythmia ( &gt; Grade 2 NCICTCAE Version 3.0 ) poorly control antiarrhythmic therapy require pace maker Uncontrolled hypertension Any active metal implant device ( eg Pacemaker ) , Women pregnant woman childbearing potential use acceptable method contraception , Received treatment investigational agent/ procedure within 30 day prior treatment NanoKnife™ IRE System , Known history HIV infection Concurrent primary extrahepatic cancer</criteria>
