	<brief_summary>Leaking valve vein legs cause vein become large bloated . These swollen vein call `` varicose vein '' common problem , affect third adult UK . Varicose vein reduce people 's quality life cause problem pain , itch restless leg . Varicose vein may also damage skin time cause problem bleed , skin colour change , eczema even break-down skin call ulcer . Newer , `` key-hole '' method treat leaky vein develop alternative surgery perform local anaesthetic patient awake . Rather cut skin , minimally invasive technique perform tiny stab wound ; little large needle hole . The varicose vein destroy within , usually use heat burn inside vein . These procedure popular ; rapid recovery high success rate . However method also require vein surround large volume dilute local anaesthetic slightly painful administer . A technique call `` Foam sclerotherapy '' involve injection drug mixed foam . This go vein cause stick shut . This procedure near painless perform , small local anaesthetic injection require ; however chance successful treatment first time low patient may need return repeat treatment successfully treat vein . The aim study see whether success rate technique improve . One method `` catheter direct foam sclerotherapy '' involve delivery foam catheter ( long thin tube ) , large length vein treat single hole . The final method `` ClariVein '' use catheter ; time catheter small wire end spin around inside vein ; similar edge strimmer garden ; except irritates vein : rather cut . This irritation make vein susceptible drug apply directly vein wall whilst still active . Early result show final method successful ; however equipment expensive two . This study randomly allocate willing participant varicose vein receive one three treatment see whether two new treatment improve success rate quality life improvement see foam sclerotherapy , whilst also allow near painless treatment , without significant complication , appropriate cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Comparing Standard Cannula Delivered FS , UGFS ClariVein® Management SVI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>. Investigational Plan Study Design This single centre three arm parallel group study equal randomisation . The trial conduct Academic Vascular Surgical Unit Hull York Medical School base Hull Royal Infirmary , university teach hospital . Target population The target population study individual symptom SVI ultrasound evidence axial vein reflux agree receive treatment axial vein reflux . Recruitment Each patient refer vascular service symptomatic SVI assess . Patients potentially meet inclusion criterion make aware research study provide appropriate information , include patient information sheet ( see appendix 1 ) . Patients give opportunity think invitation participate discus family/friends healthcare professional desire . Patients express interest participation offer appointment screen visit study investigator . Randomisation Blinding Randomisation Participants randomise one three treatment . Randomisation conduct seal envelope system . Once enrolled study , effort make assess manage participant outline allocated treatment protocol pre-determined end-point study participant withdrawal . Following randomisation participant 's GP inform intend treatment modality Blinding Due nature procedure involve possible blind participant clinical team group participant allocate . Bias limit use objective measurement , standardise protocol , use patient report outcome standardise assessor outcome . Power Calculation In order detect clinically significant difference technical success 15 % power 80 % significance 5 % ; 73 participant per group require . Assuming 10 % drop rate therefore aim recruit 80 participant per group . The study therefore randomise 240 participant total 3 study group . Treatment Protocol All case perform day-case , out-patient basis per standard practice unit experience endovenous surgeon . For participant , investigate team re-assess inclusion exclusion criterion , confirm consent undertake procedure per protocol . Participants judge high risk venous thromboembolic disease ( VTE ) due use exogenous oestrogen , past medical history family history VTE thrombophilia immobility give single pre-operative dose prophylactic molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , absence contraindication . All participant duplex assessment mark use protocol endovenous procedure differ . The sclerotherapy drug use Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate , also know STD market Fibrovein® ( STD Pharmaceutical Products , Hereford , UK ) . STD come different variation concentration , trial use 3 % , 1.5 % 1 % STD depend procedure protocol . STD use foam liquid preparation make ideal study . The STD use routine stock . It store room temperature suitably secure location ward , clinic theatre . Careful record keep regard participant receive STD batch number Preoperative procedure The treatment aim eradicate significant SVI present limb . Preoperatively vein marked surgeon use duplex-ultrasound patient standing . This identify extent position refluxing axial vein alongside incompetent perforating vein varicose tributary . The significant superficial varicose vein ( GSV , ASV , SSV , GV ) treat length measure note . In addition , average diameter varicose vein calculate via three transverse image vein ( proximal , middle distal ) note . Potential area puncture cannulae may local analgesia apply prior treatment . The participant position supine operating table Clarivein Ultrasound Catheter group sterile precaution include disinfectant skin preparation sterile drape employ , Foam Sclerotherapy tributary treatment group skin disinfectant . The ultrasound transducer prepare sterile cover secure sterile drape allow sterile intra-operative ultrasound duplex scan . Operative Procedure : Foam Sclerotherapy Group The axial vein cannulate local anaesthesia 18G ( green ) , 20G ( Pink ) 22G ( Blue ) Intravenous cannulae ultrasound guidance patient recline supine position GSV ASV treatment , prone position SSV GV treatment . This perform low point demonstrable reflux throughout length incompetent vein 20cm interval . Each insufficient tributary system also cannulate separately . Venous blood aspirate cannulae flush normal saline confirm inside target vein . Local anaesthesia use puncture site prior needle insertion desire patient . Once cannulae secure leg elevate empty vein . The foam prepare Tessari technique surgeon . Two 2-ml syrinx connect via three way stop-cock tap 5 micron filter series ( Braun Medical , Sheffield , UK ) . The syrinx contain 1 part Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate 3 % 3 part air . In practice 0.5ml 3 % STS draw 2 ml air . The foam produce least 20 passage syringe syringe filter . Up 2ml foam inject cannula ultrasound control observe venous spasm , follow gentle massaging skin propagate foam segment vein treat . The surgeon also endeavour prevent propagation fresh foam beyond perforators junction deep venous system . The patient ask dorsi-flex plantar-flex ankle several time clear foam might enter deep venous system . At least 30 second leave injection foam . As per European consensus guideline maximum 12mls foam use one sitting32 33 . Typical volume foam report Bradbury 4-12ml GSV 2-8 ml SSV34 . After ensure axial vein treat surgeon progress treat tributary application dressing , detail . Operative Procedure : Catheter Directed Foam Sclerotherapy ( CDS ) Group The straight segment axial vein cannulate local anaesthesia low point demonstrable reflux guide-wire inserted facilitate placement catheter system . The access cannulae remove replace 5F introducer sheath guide . A Unifuse® ( AngioDynamics , Cambridge , UK ) catheter system deploy via sheath . Unifuse® catheter available 5F either 45 cm 90 cm length combination 5cm , 10cm 15cm long infusion pattern . The appropriate Unifuse® catheter select deployed introducer sheath advance within 2cm junction perforator upper limit incompetence top incompetent segment case segmental reflux . The catheter aspirate ensure correct position flush normal saline . Each tributary system cannulate case FS group . A 1:3 foam 3 % STD produce described FS . At point patient reposition Trendelenburg position ( head ) . The Unifuse® Self-Occluding ball wire insert tip correctly position 2cm junction ultrasound guidance . As internal diameter Unifuse® catheter 1mm ( 3F ) approximately 0.35ml foam 45cm catheter 0.7ml form 90cm catheter inject fill dead-space . The appropriate volume foam infuse Unifuse® catheter withdrawal ultra-sound guidance . The catheter withdrawn length infusion pattern follow injection . The surgeon endeavour prevent propagation fresh foam beyond perforators junction deep venous system . The maximum volume foam use one sit limit 12 ml , although dead space catheter add . Once varicose vein treat total volume foam use note . After ensure axial varicose vein treat surgeon progress treat tributary application dressing , detail .
