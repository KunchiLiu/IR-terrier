	<brief_summary>This study determine health benefit combine exercise training increase amount physical activity daily life fat around abdomen , weight , fitness sensitivity insulin . Volunteers participate one three group 6 month : 1 ) control group , 2 ) exercise training , 3 ) exercise training increase physical activity outside training . The exercise training follow public health recommendation exercise ( 150 minutes/week moderate exercise ) . The group increase physical activity along exercise training ask increase physical activity daily life ( 3,000 step/day current level use step counter ) , meeting focus behavior modification . The investigator hypothesize combine aerobic train additional physical activity training profound reduction waist circumference body composition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Intervention Composed Aerobic Training Non-Exercise Physical Activity ( I-CAN ) study investigate effect aerobic exercise training increase amount physical activity outside training ( Non-EX PA ) waist circumference , weight , cardiovascular disease risk factor prospective pilot trial . The investigator randomize sedentary ( &lt; 6,500 step per day ) obese adult least one additional cardiovascular risk factor ( N= 45 ) : ( 1 ) structure aerobic exercise program intervention Non-Ex PA ( AERO group , N=15 ) ; ( 2 ) structure aerobic exercise program additional goal increase Non-EX PA ( AERO-PA group , N=15 ) , ( 3 ) non-exercise control group ( CON , N=15 ) 6 month . Exercise group participate aerobic training program ( 50 75 % VO2 max ) , design consistent public health recommendation 150 minute per week moderate physical activity . Non-Ex PA AERO group track throughout entire 6 month intervention pedometer capable count step , display participant ( blind mode capable ) . The AERO-PA group progressively increase Non-Ex PA throughout intervention use pedometer ( progressive increase 1,000 3,000 step per day baseline level ) . The AERO-PA group also participate lifestyle counseling ground principle behavioral change theory determine/reinforce strategy increase Non-Ex PA . The primary outcome measure change waist circumference follow intervention . The result pilot study use determine efficacy/feasibility intervention , power large trial R01 application .</detailed_description>
