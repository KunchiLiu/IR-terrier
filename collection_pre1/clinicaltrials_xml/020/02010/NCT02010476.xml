	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus associate approximately 2-fold increase risk Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Patients AD report reduced insulin sensitivity , insulin concentration elevate plasma decrease cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . Cognitively normal individual insulin resistance thus interest effort gain understanding antecedent problem . It may hypothesize , compare insulin sensitive subject otherwise similar general health body habitus , insulin resistant subject likely CSF indicator incipient Alzheimer pathology , abnormality CSF peptide related insulin signal glucose homeostasis , possibly metabolites associate risk AD . The objective 1 ) ass concentration biomarkers Alzheimer pathology CSF cognitively normal men without insulin resistance , 2 ) ass concentration CSF biomarkers potential relevance insulin resistance AD CSF cognitively normal men without insulin resistance . All subject eligibility oral glucose tolerance test perform within past 3 month reveal normal fast blood level normal glucose tolerance . In addition , history significant cognitive disorder , prior diagnosis diabetes mellitus , receive insulin oral hypoglycemic . Eligibility inclusion insulin-resistant group define score Matsuda Index ; non-insulin resistant control normal value Matsuda Index . An effort make ensure group ( i.e. , insulin resistance without insulin resistance ) similar age , weight , BMI , Apo E4 genotype ( APOE ) . All procedure perform single visit . The subject undergo Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) perform qualified examiner . In addition , blood sample obtain measurement basic blood chemistry ( electrolyte , creatinine , glucose , total protein , albumin ) , hematology , thyroid function , metabolic function ( e.g . fast plasma glucose insulin level ) proteomic analysis . The APOE genotype determine blood sample , assess earlier . A lumbar puncture perform obtain CSF sample use determine concentration biomarkers AD pathology find new biomarkers may reflect AD pathology . All material use accord national ethical guideline Good Clinical Practice . Analyses CSF level beta-Amyloid biomarkers , total tau phosphorylated tau do use sandwich ELISA . Descriptive statistic provide analyte , compare 2 group subject . All participant provide write informed consent . Blood CSF sample analyse also collaborator European country . Before analysis send data blood/CSF sample partner project , clinical information sample information make anonymous ( cod data ) . Personal information , i.e. , name personal identity number , remove data/samples , separate code give deliver partner purpose project . Methods database maintenance data delivery use prove functional previous research project . A formal description different data format , access routine tool basic processing create start project .</detailed_description>
