	<brief_summary>The transient global amnesia , memory disorder massive , transient pure , offer unique model explore episodic memory . Topographic MRI reveal focal selective lesion locate CA1 region hippocampus well visible 48h 72h onset episode . There therefore real dissociation structural lesion witch minimal non-existent massive memory disorder . This suggest functional impairment go far beyond structural damage condition . To knowledge , study perform identify functional impairment use rest state fMRI . Thus , investigator wish study neural network involve memory impairment acute phase transient global amnesia use rest state imaging . This technique appear modern adapt patient population . Investigators hypothesize despite limited structural lesion , large functional network impair compare observed group healthy subject . investigator believe alteration functional network explain depth memory impairment observe . The main aim study identify functional impairment patient group vs. control group acute phase transient global amnesia ( TGA ) use rest state imaging . Patients potentially eligible informed arrival emergency unit . If patient eligible would like participate , information give . For patient willing participate , inclusion exclusion criterion verify . Two image exam ( topographic MRI rest state fMRI ) neuropsychological assessment perform three visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transient Global Amnesia ( TGA ) . Exploratory Study Default Mode Network During Acute Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The transient global amnesia transient , massive pure memory disorder . Its pathophysiology poorly know , disease process involve Papez circuitry , specifically medial part temporal lobe ( hippocampus ) . It involve 3-8 per 100,000 people per year . The age patient affect 50 70 year . Structural MRI confirm diagnosis reveal focal selective lesion locate CA1 region hippocampus well observe 48h 72h onset episode . Main purpose : The main aim study identify neuronal functional impairment group patient vs. group healthy subject acute phase transient global amnesia ( TGA ) use rest state fMRI imaging . Secondary purpose : - Show correlation functional activity observe rest state fMRI acute phase cognitive performance patient group . - Describe evolution functional impairment rest state fMRI acute phase ( visit 1 ) post-acute phase ( visit 2 3 ) patient group compare control group subject . Study design : Monocentric , pilot , prospective , control study include consecutive patient admit emergency department CHU Toulouse transient global amnesia . investigator compare two independent group : patient control We expect three month sign consent end study . The total duration study exceed 27 month . Arm number label arm type : This study exploratory . investigator compare two independent group : patient control Interventions : After sign informed consent patient TGA receive neuropsychological assessment , topographic MRI evaluation rest state fMRI three successive visit : - During acute phase within 24 hour - In 72 hour - In 3 month Number subject : It 's difficult estimate number subject require show difference rest state two group acute phase TGA . No study type literature available estimate sample size recruit . In pilot study recruit 22 subject group . Expected benefit : The transient global amnesia model explore memory disorder massive , pure temporary . Better understand Neural Network substrates underlying alteration could help good understand memory disorder disease ( Korsakoff syndrome , thalamic stroke , dissociative amnesia , Alzheimer 's disease ) . Such discovery could lead clinical trial functional brain stimulation recently develop neurological disorder functional impairment show . ( TMS , TDCS ) Statistical analysis : The SPM8 software use generate activation map use fMRI image . The obtained map compare group use test imbed software . Correlation map cognitive performance activation also calculate . Intra group comparison across time assess .</detailed_description>
