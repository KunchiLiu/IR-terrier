	<brief_summary>Adrenal mass highly prevalent detect high frequency conventional imaging . Conventional image often fail rule malignant lesion . Accordingly , hormonally inactive adrenal mass remove surgery benign adenomas surgical removal unnecessary pose avoidable risk patient . We hypothesize combination FDG-PET 123I-Iodometomidate image potential noninvasively identify benign adrenocortical adenoma high accuracy , thereby avoid unnecessary surgery . Uptake 123I-Iodometomidate adrenal mass demonstrate presence CYP 11B enzyme specifically bind metomidate high avidity establish adrenocortical origin lesion , low uptake FDG-PET adrenocortical lesion establishes benign nature excludes presence adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) . The propose trial ass sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value combine image diagnosis adrenocortical adenoma . A secondary focus performance combine test differentiate ACC non-ACC lesion . We expect result trial help greatly reduce need surgery hormonally inactive adrenal mass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Histopathology surgically remove adrenal mass expert surgeon consider gold standard differential diagnosis adrenal neoplasia . Thus recruit patient schedule surgery adrenal mass uncertain origin . Patients eligible trial adrenal mass discover standard imaging ( CT and/or MRI ) lead clear characterization malignant potential lesion ( Hounsfield unit unenhanced CT ≥10 ) . In addition , patient adrenal neoplasia recruit hormonally active lesion exclude surgery plan perceive risk malignancy . Patients evaluate [ 123I ] Iodometomidate SPECT/CT [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT . Computed tomography perform low dose CT adrenal region . Imaging start either [ 123I ] Iodometomidate SPECT/CT [ 18F ] fluoro- deoxyglucose PET/CT perform two consecutive day . The time interval [ 123I ] Iodometomidate SPECT/CT [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT exceed 6 week . Patients follow visit 2-4 week [ 123I ] Iodometomidate SPECT/CT [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT ( immediately surgery , earlier 2 week post image ) . Thirty day surgery patient contact phone assessment adverse event relate surgery .</detailed_description>
