	<detailed_description>Muscle weakness major disability responsible deeply reduce overall quality life ( QoL ) patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . Research show strength training ( ST ) significant positive effect performance daily living activity people MS , result increase QoL . Several ST method currently employ reduce strength impairment MS one regimen portray superior others . When strength impairment prominently lateralize one limb , train commonly address weak side order balance deficit . However , ST may always applicable severely weaken limb compromise sustain . For select patient hypothesize train less affected limb Cross Training ( CT ) approach may overcome problem , also avoid patient ' frustration potential withdrawal rehabilitation program . Aim project investigate compare two group select MS patient , mark asymmetry strength , effect induce dynamometric , neurophysiological , functional clinical outcome CT less-impaired leg ( CT group ) compare ST more-impaired leg ( ST group ) . In order make comparison population expose condition MS , third group compose healthy subject also include study . The research plan articulate 5 phase ( recruitment , baseline assessment , 6 week-intervention phase , post-intervention assessment follow 12 week ) .</detailed_description>
