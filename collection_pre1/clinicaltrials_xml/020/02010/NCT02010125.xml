	<brief_summary>This study evaluate bio-mechanical biochemical abnormality acute ACL-injured knee time . Data collect advanced quantitative MR imaging , functional testing , bio-specimen collection . Researchers collect data time baseline visit , within 28 day injury , temporal sequence post-operative post-injury recovery return activity . The hypothesis study ( 1 ) T1ρ T2 significantly elevate lateral side ACL-injured knee immediately injury ( indicating damage cause initial injury ) , fully recover 6-month , 1-year follow ups ; ( 2 ) T1ρ T2 significantly elevate medial side ACL-injured knees 1-year follow-up ; ( 3 ) difference bio-marker expression pattern correlate initial MRI finding , would provide information regard full spectrum intra-articular pathology subsequent clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective longitudinal study evaluate biomechanical biochemical abnormality acute ACL-injured reconstruct knee advance quantitative MR imaging , bio-specimen collection , functional testing . Researchers recruit retain patient acute ACL tear within 28 day injury , follow longitudinally 6 week , 6 month , 12 month . Standard Care MR image captured baseline , quantitative morphological MRI quantitative T1ρ T2 image injured contra-lateral knee take within 7 day baseline , 6 month , 1 year post-injury post-surgery . Scans take place immediately surgery attempt study immediate effect ACL reconstruction . The physical performance test acquire 6 month follow-up patient unstable knee . For 6 healthy volunteer , MRI right knee require 4 time point - baseline , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month . The control volunteer use measure reproducibility . The control volunteer perform physical performance test study questionnaire . The purpose six control subject track reproducibility physiologic variation T1p T2 value normal knee . These subject complete image four time point , space six month apart . The result help evaluate expect range difference knee without traumatic injury . This information assist interpretation value patient ACL injury observe variation outside expect magnitude healthy individual . The control subject also help monitor change scanner reliability site compare two clinical site . Phantoms scan month aid process , control subject add help ensure data collection constant time .</detailed_description>
