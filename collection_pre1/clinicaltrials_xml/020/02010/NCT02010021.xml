	<brief_summary>Some tumor use estrogen body assist growth . Letrozole drug prevents cell produce estrogen . This assist slow growth tumor cell . Letrozole also promote cell destruction inhibit cellular destruction pathway . The objective study look difference cellular destruction pathway letrozole use , difference cellular destruction pathway participant receive letrozole versus . The study also look gene participant call Ki67 . This gene associate rate tumor cell growth . The study measure level Ki67 compare amount activation cellular destruction pathway . Participants study undergone diagnostic biopsy breast tissue . In order meet objective , one group participant ( Arm A ) receive letrozole . Tissue leftover diagnostic biopsy treat RAD001 ( Everolimus ) laboratory effect drug cellular destruction pathway study . The group participant ( Arm B ) take letrozole minimum 10 maximum 21 day . They second tumor sample take part surgical procedure complete remove tumor tissue . Any difference cellular destruction pathway exposure letrozole measure .</brief_summary>
