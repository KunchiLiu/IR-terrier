	<brief_summary>This observational study collect data adult survivor childhood cancer compare data collect age- gender-matched control purpose assess vascular risk among cancer survivor . Advances cancer therapy lead increase number adult previously treat pediatric malignancy , many experience late adverse health-related sequela risk develop chronic condition relate prior therapy . The epidemiology many end-organ toxicity describe , yet pathophysiologic mechanisms injury incompletely understood . One mechanism may damage circulatory system , particular endothelial layer , initiate inflammatory state lead dysfunction premature atherosclerotic disease . This process may begin significantly progress sub-clinical nature many year prior manifest cardio- cerebrovascular event . Using establish novel biomarkers predictive atherosclerotic disease combine unique measurement vascular function , study assess pre-clinical vascular disease population childhood adolescent cancer survivor . The goal project investigate effect cancer therapy vascular system acquire new knowledge risk-stratify survivor plan interventional study prevent reduce premature vascular morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate biomarkers vascular injury ( inflammation , hemostasis , endothelial activation ) among childhood cancer survivor compare age/gender-matched control . - Assess vascular function among childhood cancer survivor compare age/gender-matched control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - Investigate additional biomarkers vascular health function among childhood cancer survivor compare age/gender-matched control . Eligible person consent participate trial ask follow : - Vital sign measurement include rest heart rate , blood pressure , height , weight . - Biomarker analysis complete Cytokine Reference Laboratory , Department Pediatrics , University Minnesota Medical School Vascular Biology Center ( VBC ) , Department Medicine , University Minnesota Medical School . - An echocardiogram ass cardiac function . - Pulse wave analysis measure CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System . - Pulse contour analysis study use Endo-PAT2000 system . - Pulse wave velocity assess use SphygomoCor CVP Clinical System .</detailed_description>
