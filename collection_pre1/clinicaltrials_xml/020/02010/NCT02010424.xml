	<brief_summary>In cattle le 10 % embryo develop blastocyst stage embryo culture individually , however bovine embryo culture group typical 25-35 % blastocyst observe . This tendency , i.e . improve embryo development group culture , also demonstrate mammalian specie , mouse , cat human . The main reason beneficial outcome group culture ascribe presence autocrine factor , factor secrete preimplantation embryo act upon embryo neighbor embryo . Although group culture system common vitro production system animal embryo , rarely do human setting , individual follow-up embryo whole culture period utmost importance . Recently CE-labelled culture device design human embryo , allow combine benefit group culture approach individual culture . The WOW dish commercially available Primo Vision consist 9 small microwells bottom plate , embryos cultivate individually microwell , cover drop culture medium . In clinical randomized trial , 158 patient include half fertilized oocyte culture individually ( standard culture system ) half fertilize oocyte culture group WOW dish , five day culture . The aim study increase number blastocyst suitable transfer cryopreservation culture embryos WOW dish .</brief_summary>
