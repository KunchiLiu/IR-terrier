	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) use biventricular pacing ( BiVP ) establish effective treatment heart failure . Unfortunately 45 % patient respond , improvement symptom cardiac size . Reducing proportion non-responders become key research focus CRT . Targeting position leave ventricular ( LV ) pace lead within coronary vein network previously show increase proportion responder CRT . Several technique try target lead position , best investigate use speckle-tracking echocardiography target lead position site late mechanical activation leave ventricle , use invasive monitoring select pace site great acute haemodynamic response ( AHR ) BiVP occur . Both technique limit group patient technique possible provide limited useful information . The relationship two measure unknown - previous study investigate correlation site late mechanical activation determine echo site maximal AHR . It likely hybrid technique use investigation might allow optimal lead positioning patient , information show equivalent , streamline technique design . This study also able contribute towards several important secondary question . In particular investigator study possibility use non-invasive cardiac output monitoring ( NICOM ) assess haemodynamic response rather intravascular pressure monitor wire . The investigator also wish ass whether site late mechanical activation change right ventricular pacing .</brief_summary>
