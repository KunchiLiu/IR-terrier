	<brief_title>Virtual Therapy Rehabilitation Spastic Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considered second frequent cause death worldwide , stroke also responsible large number functional disability individual . The socio - economic hardship many patient face perform program intensive rehabilitation sensorimotor , lead functional limitation many case , promote irreversible consequence . Spasticity upper low limb stroke result loss function mobility key therapeutic approach order restore function . Currently , Virtual therapy use physical therapy , demonstrate safety , feasibility potential facilitate effective rehabilitation treatment , promote motor recovery . The objective study analyze compare effectiveness virtual therapy conventional physiotherapy paretic upper low limb patient sensory motor deficit stroke . Virtual therapy base custom application use virtual reality projection , conventional treatment base cinesiotherapy member upper low paretic . The evaluation perform biomedical instrumentation use dynamometry , electromyography analysis functional movement . Statistical difference base test significance level p 0 , 05 . As result expect - scientifically proven effectiveness new form treatment aim improve quality life functional independence patient neurological sequel .</detailed_description>
