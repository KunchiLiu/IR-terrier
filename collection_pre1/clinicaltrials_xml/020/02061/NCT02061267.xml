	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome may define constellation cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor comprise obesity , type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension . Lack habitual physical activity certain dietary pattern , include high-saturated fatty acid ( SFA ) intake , contribute increase risk CVD , whereas great risk reduction relate monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) , mainly olive oil , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) . Vitamin B3 , major substrate nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ( NAMPT ) , also emerge nutritional intervention strategy prevention CVD . NAMPT show exert activity central importance cellular energetics innate immunity . Within cell , NAMPT rate-limiting step salvage pathway nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) biosynthesis . By virtue role , regulate cellular level NAD+ thereby NAD+-consuming enzyme . NAMPT also release variety cell , elevate level find systemic circulation subject range inflammatory disorder . Recent evidence suggest , primarily due high MUFA content , olive oil useful optimal fat modulation CVD risk factor postprandial state . In addition , NAMPT show correlate triglyceride fast plasma , potential regulatory role fatty acid NAMPT expression propose . The global aim project ass whether olive oil ( MUFA ) , compare dietary fatty acid ( SFA omega-3 PUFA ) association vitamin B3 could benefit NAMPT-related inflammation atherosclerosis . We hope provide important novel insight relationship among dietary fatty acid , NAD+ metabolism , metabolic syndrome . This aim expect achieve one principal objective : To elucidate influence olive oil ( MUFA ) , butter ( SFA ) fish oil ( omega-3 PUFA ) meal supplement vitamin B3 postprandial NAMPT modulation involvement leukocyte inflammatory response subject metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
