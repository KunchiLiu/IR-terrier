	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging use help doctor determine much oxygen tumor get . Hypoxyprobe use determine level oxygen post-surgery current study . If study successful , image use determine tumor 's oxygen status even patient get surgery . Investigators want find much oxygen participant tumor base much pimo present , correlate result MRI 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) PET scan . This study also test investigational radioactive substance know FMISO . FMISO use PET scan help doctor see much oxygen tumor get . Participants might ask participate optional PET scan use FMISO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Correlates Hypoxia Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot phase II imaging study determine hypoxia melanoma . About 16 - 24 hour surgery , participant ask come study center take investigational agent oral pimonidazole ( pimo ) mouth . Pimo substance able enter tissue low level oxygen present ( hypoxia ) . When tissue remove visualized microscope , amount pimo present related amount oxygen part tissue . The dose pimo give participant depend weight ( 13 mg pimo/kg body weight ) . After surgery , sample participant 's tumor tissue view doctor microscope determine amount pimo present .</detailed_description>
