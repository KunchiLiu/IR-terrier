	<brief_title>Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Human Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) inflammatory condition affect intestinal tract ( large small bowel ) . Some patient CD may get swell intestinal tract ( inflammation ) scar intestinal tract ( fibrosis ) . Fibrosis develop chronic injury . Both inflammation ( swell ) fibrosis ( scar ) cause bowel narrow , lead bowel become block . The long-term goal project develop new noninvasive radiology image test show difference bowel wall inflammation fibrosis . Currently image test reliably . Current image method ( CT MRI ) order help diagnose follow-up CD excellent show inflammation , accurate finding fibrosis . CT also expose patient small amount radiation , CT MRI costly . We therefore study ultrasound imaging , cost-effective expose patient radiation . CEUS use microbubbles solution inject vein one arm . This allow doctor see blood flow part body . This microbubble contrast agent ( dye ) call Optison . Another image method , call shear wave elastography , use sound wave noninvasively measure stiffness structure body . It important able tell difference inflammation fibrosis Crohn 's disease , narrow bowel due inflammation generally respond well medication , whereas narrow caused fibrosis respond well medication may require surgery .</detailed_description>
