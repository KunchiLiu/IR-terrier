	<brief_summary>Previously , study show child woman thyroid autoantibody experience birth complication poorer health first day . Studies also show later sign cognitive developmental challenge ( risk attention deficit/hyperactivity problem ) among child mother autoimmune thyroid disease . In Denmark formalize screen treatment subclinical thyroid disease - without Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies ( TPO-antibodies ) - among pregnant woman . The hypothesis study offspring woman subclinical thyroid disease mitochondria-dysfunction lead complication birth , poor health well-being early childhood . The investigator test recruit mother blood sample third trimester pregnancy , screen cord blood birth later test child Bayley test two time early childhood .</brief_summary>
