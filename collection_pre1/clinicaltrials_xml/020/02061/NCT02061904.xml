	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density Changes Acetabulum After Revision Hip Arthroplasty Using Bone Impaction Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis , open question specific aim project : We believe important gain insight process bone graft remodel preservation bone stock bone impaction graft . Radiographs far conclusive CT scan repeat regular interval obvious reason . Prospective follow-up BMD bone impaction area contribute understanding . There literature available BMD change acetabulum bone impaction graft . From recent experience earlier research BMD specific ROI femoral neck motivate explore potential DEXA technology software field revision hip arthroplasty . We hypothesize BMD change bone impaction graft acetabulum adequately monitored modern DEXA technique . Research Questions : 1 . Will bone impaction graft acetabulum result well preserved/remodelled bone stock within 2 year revision hip arthroplasty ? 2 . Can change BMD interpret representative process bone remodelling bone impact area ? Study design This trial describe protocol prospective explorative follow-up study record clinical , radiographic data , bone mineral density data specific time interval ( preoperative , within 2 week postoperative , 3months , 6months , 1 year 2 year postoperative ) . The data collect use SPSS ( version 20 . ) Main objective : To prospectively assess BMD short medium time interval specific ROI indicator process bone remodelling ossification bone impaction graft revision hip arthroplasty.. Secondary Objectives : Clinical score ( SF-12 , Oxford Hip score , VAS pain VAS satisfaction ) obtain . Vigilant identification Adverse Events ( AEs ) maintain throughout study . Mean change clinical score , time , also test repeated measurement statistic . Because clinical success always indicative radiographic success vice versa , correlation make . Sample size : Our study concern explorative study twenty patient . Study duration : The expected duration study approximately 3 year commencement subject enrollment . Subject enrollment expect take 1 year . All subject follow least two year surgery last subject achieves two-years follow-up . Evaluation criteria The study design evaluate possible clinical , radiographic bone densitometry difference change revision hip arthroplasty . Evaluation criterion different follow-up interval . A Clinical : - patient 's evaluation accord Oxford Score , Dutch translation validate - patient 's evaluation general health SF-12 score , license validate Dutch translation11 - patient 's degree pain satisfaction prosthesis procedure . B Radiological : - X-ray evaluation implant stability , migration , change cup head angle , radiolucent line , loosen osteolysis . X-Rays preferably digital , preoperative , 6 month , 1 year 2 year . C. DEXA bone density measurement - Bone density measurement perform preoperative acetabulum several region interest ( ROI 's ) include bone impaction graft area . Once ROI 's acetabulum determine digitalize save software , subsequently ROI transport 4 day postoperative 4 day postoperative , 6 month , 1 year 2 year . - This method test earlier resurface study prove reliable reproducable . - An independent radiologist measurement DEXA-scan D Survival revision hip arthroplasty bone impaction graft - According Kaplan Meiers survival rate . E Complications adverse event - Early late complication possibly associate revision hip arthroplasty possible relationship bone impaction graft surgical technique .</detailed_description>
