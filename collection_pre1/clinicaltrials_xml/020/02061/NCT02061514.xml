	<brief_title>The Effect Two Different General Anesthesia Regimes Postoperative Sleep Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Major surgery lead postoperative disturbance sleep pattern subjective deterioration sleep quality accord patient ' report well objective alteration sleep architecture , record polysomnography - These disturbance include severe sleep fragmentation , rapid eye movement ( REM ) slow wave sleep significant reduction duration well increase non-REM sleep stage . Spontaneous awakening also frequently report - After third fourth postoperative day , substantial rebound total REM activity , frequent report vivid nightmare - Factors implicate postoperative sleep disturbance include limited severity surgical procedure , neuroendocrine response surgery , inadequate treatment postoperative pain external factor interfere sleep , light , noise therapeutic procedure - There difference molecular mechanism inhalational anesthetic intravenous agent affect different brain region induce anesthesia . Our hypothesis difference may also evident postoperative period , affect brain function involve sleep architecture , since sleep alter state consciousness like anesthesia . So , aim study assess effect two different anesthetic technique maintain general anesthesia patient subject similar major operation - Patients take part study evaluate regard preoperative sleep quality Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire ( PSQI ) . The PSQI examines seven component sleep quality retrospectively period four week : subjective sleep quality , sleep latency , sleep duration , habitual sleep efficiency , sleep disturbance , use sleep medication , daytime dysfunction last month . The patient self-rates seven area sleep . Scoring answer base 0-3 scale , whereby ' 3 ' reflect negative extreme Likert scale . The global score generate sum seven component score range 0 21 , high value correspond reduced sleep quality . - Consequently , patient randomize one two group : one group general anesthesia maintenance base intravenous agent ( propofol ) second group general anesthesia maintenance base inhalational agent ( desflurane ) - Patients assess postoperatively sleep diary regard potential sleep disturbance subject long-term assessment sleep quality use PSQI one three month postoperatively - Since anesthetic-related difference hormone profile expect , marker relate neuroendocrine response stress ( cortisol , prolactin ) also assess investigate difference two different anesthetic regime - Impaired melatonin secretion propose one mechanism involve postoperative sleep disturbance . It therefore expect different method anesthetic maintenance may affect endogenous circadian melatonin rhythm different way . Consequently , melatonin secretion also measure investigate potential desynchronization melatonin rhythm well differences melatonin secretion two different anesthetic technique - The clinical implication study lie fact postoperative sleep disturbance lead postoperative hemodynamic instability , episodic hypoxemia mental status deterioration , untowardly affect short long-term postoperative outcome . It would interest determine whether one two anesthetic regime superior far postoperative disturbance sleep architecture concern</detailed_description>
