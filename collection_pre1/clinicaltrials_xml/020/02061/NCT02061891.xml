	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate acute invasive coronary evaluation treatment conduct within 12 hour diagnosis improve clinical outcome compare deferred , subacute strategy patient unstable angina pectoris ( UAP ) / non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) Furthermore , observational design potential clinical benefit coronary compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) select patient invasive investigation treatment two treatment arm ( acute v defer ) evaluate . The follow main hypothesis test : - Very early invasive coronary investigation improve clinical outcome patient UAP/NSTEMI-ACS - CCTA perform invasive coronary investigation improve clinical management patient UAP/NSTEMI-ACS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Very Early veRsus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIAL Consecutive patient suspect UAP/NSTEMI screen participation study . Only patient deem clinically suit invasive coronary evaluation treatment include . A total 2500 patient include trial Departments Cardiology Danish Hospitals . METHODS If patient accept participation trial computerize 1:1 randomization acute invasive coronary evaluation ( Intervention group - within 12 hour time diagnosis ) defer invasive evaluation ( Control group - later 72 hour time diagnosis ) . All include patient undergo CCTA prior invasive coronary evaluation , except patient moderately reduce renal function ( se ) . The treat invasive cardiologist remain blind observational CCTA data . Patients endstage renal disease dialysis may undergo CCTA . CCTA data record part research protocol make available treating physician . SECONDARY EXCLUSION Based post-hoc expert clinical evaluation patient UAP/NSTEMI-ACS ( arrythmias , pulmonary oedema , miss STEMI , pneumonia , Pulmonary embolus ) exclude analysis difference outcome measure treatment strategy group . STATISTICAL METHODS Patients UAP/NSTEMI-ACS base previous study expect event rate 15 % within 1 year 50 % 4 year primary combine endpoint : cause mortality , non-fatal recurrent myocardial infarction , hospitalisation refractory ischemia heart failure . In order demonstrate reduction 25 % within 3 year 711 patient group need . The study power detect clinical relevant reduction mortality heart failure hospitalization total 2500 patient .</detailed_description>
