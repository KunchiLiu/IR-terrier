	<brief_title>Evaluation Aesthetic Outcomes Single Crowns Supported Tissue Level Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both successful implant-supported restoration peri-implant soft hard tissue vital determinant may affect short- long-term aesthetic outcome . For reason , pink aesthetic score ( PES ) introduce evaluation peri-implant soft tissue FÃ¼rhauser 2005 modify Belser PES/WES 2009 . So far , series clinical study confirm suitability PES/WES PES index objective outcome assessment aesthetic dimension anterior single-tooth implant . However , knowledge , study long term data aesthetic outcome evaluation non-augmented heal site anterior maxilla still rare , paper publish recently mainly focus immediate implant placement tooth extraction 1-5 year follow . In previous study , evaluate alteration soft tissue around implant-supported single crown anterior maxilla original standard PES time crown placement 6 month post-loading .We find aesthetic outcome soft tissue around single-tooth implant improve significantly follow-up compare baseline accord PES assessment . However , follow time previous study short ( 6-8 month ) , long time follow necessary confirm previous hypothesis observation .</detailed_description>
