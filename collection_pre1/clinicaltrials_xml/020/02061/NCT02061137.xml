	<brief_summary>The Trial Objective ass safety efficacy oral fingolimod ( FTY720 ) child older 6 year Rett Syndrome . So far establish treatment child Rett Syndrome . Therefore positive result term safety first indication efficacy would path way phase II clinical study patient test hypothesis fingolimod treatment may slow regression motor language skill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rett syndrome neurodevelopmental disorder characterize normal early psychomotor development follow loss psychomotor acquire purposeful hand skill onset stereotyped movement hand gait disturbance . The gene discover 1999 disease find caused mutation methyl-CpGbinding protein 2 ( MeCP2 ) . However , many way clinically peculiar condition remain mystery , clear correlation gene mutation abnormal biological marker , neuropathology and/or unique clinical symptom sign . Rett syndrome X-linked ( Xq28 ) dominant postnatal severe neurodevelopmental disorder second common cause genetic mental retardation girl first pervasive disorder know genetic basis . Its incidence 1/10,000-15000 live birth . The classical variant characterize apparently normal development first 6-18 month accompany usually early deceleration head growth , follow period regression motor language skill , hand stereotype , seizure , autonomic dysfunction neurological relate symptom . Repeated observation experiment mouse model several laboratory lead appreciation role BDNF disease pathophysiology . BDNF neurotrophic factor play major role neurogenesis , neuronal survival , differentiation , maturation early development well synaptic function plasticity throughout life . Abnormalities BDNF homeostasis believe contribute neurological phenotype pathophysiology part symptoms methyl-CpG bind protein 2 ( Mecp2 ) null mouse show progressive deficit expression symptomatic stage . FTY720 ( Gilenya ) orally active modulator four five sphingosine-1 phosphate ( S1P ) receptor . FTY720 act 'super agonist ' S1P receptor thymocytes lymphocyte , induce uncoupling/internalization receptor . A local study group ( Yves-Alain Barde ) find FTY720 increase level brain derive neurotrophic factor improve symptom mice lack MeCP2 . In addition volume striatum seem high ( 4 week old mouse treat 4 day interval 0.1mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally ) . Based result intend perform phase I clinical , study assess safety efficacy oral fingolimod ( FTY720 ) child Rett Syndrome . Children include old 6 year age , fulfil diagnostic criterion Rett Syndrome clinical Stages II -IV parent agree .</detailed_description>
