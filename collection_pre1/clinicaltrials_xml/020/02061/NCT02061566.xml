	<detailed_description>Over past decade , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) acquire much attention potentially devastate problem clinical medicine . When kidney lose filtering function , lot dangerous metabolite accumulate body , include urea , nitrogenous waste product uremic toxin . Indoxyl sulfate ( IS ) anionic uremic toxin accumulate serum patient uremia . In previous study , investigator successfully induce AKI animal model . IS enhanced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) expression IL-1β-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVECs ) may play critical role progression AKI .
