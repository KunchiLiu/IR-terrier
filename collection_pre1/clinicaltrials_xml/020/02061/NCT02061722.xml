	<brief_summary>The aim study measure availability PDE10A enzyme Huntington disease gene expansion carrier ( HDGECs ) use recently develop radioligand [ 18F ] MNI-659 . The study cross-sectional , examine HDGECs different stage disease ( pre-manifest , stage 1 stage 2 ) , comparison Healthy Controls ( HCs ) . The HDGECs include study recruit large database REGISTRY ( NCT01590589 ) ENROLL-HD ( NCT01574053 ) study .</brief_summary>
