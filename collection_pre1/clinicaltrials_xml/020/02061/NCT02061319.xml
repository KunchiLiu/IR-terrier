	<brief_summary>The main purpose project see 12-week program Nordic walk well standard exercise therapy increase exercise capacity ( measure far people walk 6 minute ) increase quality life ( measured people fill two questionnaire ) . We also see Nordic walking : improves heart performance ( measure heart ultrasound ) ; improve active people ( measure activity monitor ) ; increase aerobic fitness ( measure treadmill test ) ; improve body composition ( measure waist size ) ; reduce hormone level blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Nordic Walking vs. Standard Cardiac Rehabilitation Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-site , parallel-group , randomize control trial conduct ( Appendix C ) University Ottawa Heart Institute ( UOHI ) . Patients stable HF refer cardiac rehabilitation undergo baseline assessment randomly assign ( 1:1 ) either standard exercise therapy ( consist regular walk resistance exercise program ) Nordic walk . Follow-up measure take end intervention ( 12 week ) 14-week no-intervention observation period ( 26 week ) . After initial randomization treatment group , participant stratify treatment group randomly assign one three follow-up measurement condition 12 week : echocardiograph cardiopulmonary test ( N=80 ) ; cardiopulmonary test ( N=60 ) ; follow-up echocardiograph cardiopulmonary test ( N=76 ) . The primary outcome : ) change exercise capacity measure 6MWT ; b ) change disease-specific HRQL measure MLHFQ . Additional measure examine effect exercise intervention : cardiac performance ; leisure time activity ; cardio-respiratory fitness ; body composition ; neurohormonal activation ; generic HRQL</detailed_description>
