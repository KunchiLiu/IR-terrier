	<brief_summary>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) age think part relate reduced serum sex hormone well-recognized , especially female , poorly understood . International study assess hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) prevent/reduce MCI ongoing . MCI lead morbidity , reduce quality life substantial healthcare cost . The common therapeutically induced reduction sex hormone level men treatment prostate cancer ( PCa ) . PCa androgen dependent androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) suppress testosterone castrate level key therapy advance disease . About one million men worldwide receive ADT PCa , mostly use luteinising hormone release hormone agonist ( LHRHa ) although oral oestrogen use pastÍ¾ eventually perhaps 4 % Caucasians may castrate . MCI side effect castration men remain poorly research . This study aim demonstrate pathological change occur brain significant proportion prostate cancer patient subject ADT correlate MCI symptom . Highlighting pathological change MCI improve understanding intervention slowing/preventing MCI PCa survivor . Brain scan employ positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging technique use detect presence pathological change brain relate ADT induce MCI . MCI assess neuropsychological assessment ( standard paper-based questionnaire online ) neural basis investigate use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In male , MCI age thought part relate reduction serum androgen level international study on-going prevent age-related cognitive decline use androgen replacement therapy . Reduction cognitive function often lead morbidity reduction quality life . The common therapeutically induced reduction sex hormone level men treatment prostate cancer . As prostate cancer androgen dependent growth , androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) suppress serum testosterone level castration level ( &lt; 1.7mM ) key therapeutic intervention advance disease . Up 1 million men worldwide estimate prescribed ADT prostate cancer , mostly use luteinising hormone release hormone agonist ( LHRHa ) . ADT also use treat early prostate cancer early asymptomatic prostate cancer increasingly diagnose treat follow screen serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurement , estimate suggest eventually 4 % Caucasians castrate , remain ADT long 10 year . ADT associate considerable adverse effect , include MCI . Up 69 % men show MCI six nine month ADT , decline least one cognitive area , commonly visuospatial ability executive function . Little work do quantify MCI due ADT , understand mechanism , predict patient affect determine way reduce side effect . Establishing presence pathophysiology ADT induce MCI first important due lack understand underlying mechanism . A plausible scientific approach regard appear use brain 's immunological response pathology use PET image ligand activate microglia . Brain microglia demonstrate highly responsive brain injury rapidly activate attempt envelope/ contain focal pathology . When activate , brain microglia show express translocator protein ( TSPO ) . The 18 kilo-Dalton ( KDa ) translocator protein ( TSPO ) formerly know peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) widely express body particularly enrich 20 50 fold steroid synthesise tissue . High TSPO expression also report immune cell macrophages monocyte TSPO well-characterised marker neuroinflammation . PET image ligand develop TSPO use successfully research range brain disorder . While image provide mechanistic information underlie pathology , except exasperation frank neuro-inflammation , offer generic sensitive bio-marker demonstrate presence on-going active pathology</detailed_description>
