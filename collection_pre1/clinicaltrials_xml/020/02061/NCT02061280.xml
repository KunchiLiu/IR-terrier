	<brief_summary>Asthma inflammatory disease impose significant burden affect estimate 300 million person 20 % child worldwide . It one common chronic disease childhood lead cause school absenteeism . There continue great need clinical trial asthma traditional clinical trial expensive reason cite patient non-participation extra inconvenience logistical barrier . Study design patient center reduce trial cost need . The long-range goal application transform paradigm clinical research efficient cost-effective enterprise capitalize upon current widely use mobile electronic mean communication information transfer . This innovative project streamline clinical trial run concurrently nearly identical traditional clinical trial , `` Long-acting Beta Agonist Step Down Study '' ( LASST ) allow direct comparison process outcome streamline traditional approach . Children 12 17 year old asthma randomized participate project ( streamlined trial ) LASST ( traditional trial ) . In proposal : measure comprehension study information use original questionnaire , Research Participant Assessment ( developed Nemours ) , follow parental permission/assent process deliver internet dynamic interactive multi-media format ( Specific Aim 1 ) ; measure efficiency participant drive data entry home Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) online database use iPad , quality spirometry EasyOne Plus handheld meter remote coach use iPad ( Specific Aim 2 ) ; test whether streamline approach `` trial effect '' compare difference Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) score follow 12 week study drug treatment child randomize project compare LASST . We collect effort reporting data compare personnel cost trial . If streamline project lack `` trial effect '' reduces cost compare LASST , methodology would generalizable study include adult disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Phase III / IV clinical trial expensive time consume often suffer poor enrollment retention rate . Pediatric trial particularly difficult schedule around parent , participant potentially sibling schedule burdensome . We evaluate use internet mobile device conduct consent process study visit streamline pediatric asthma trial . Our hypothesis study process noninferior less expensive compare traditional pediatric asthma trial . Materials/Methods Parents participant , age 12 17 year , complete inform consent process view multi-media website contain consent video study material streamline trial . Participants provide iPad WiFi ( wireless internet ) EasyOne spirometer use FaceTime visit online twice daily symptom report 8-week run-in follow 12-week study period . Outcomes compare participant complete similarly design traditional trial comparing treatment within pediatric health-system . After 8 week open-label Advair 250/50 twice daily , participant trial type randomize Advair 250/50 , Flovent 250 , Advair 100/50 give 1 inhalation twice daily . Study staff track time spend determine study cost . Results Participants enrol streamlined traditional trial recruitment ongoing . Conclusions This project provide important information clinical economic outcome novel method conduct clinical trial . The result broadly applicable trial disease .</detailed_description>
