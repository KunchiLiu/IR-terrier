	<brief_summary>Celiac disease ( CD ) complex disease cause eat gluten , protein contain wheat , rye , barley . It well know many factor contribute development CD , include gene food eat . In CDGEMM study , consider many factor possible study contribute disease development . If investigator find one factor , combination factor , increase risk develop CD , able apply information help prevent detect disease high-risk child future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celiac Disease Genomic Environmental Microbiome Metabolomic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CDGEMM study address genomic , environmental , microbiome , metabolomic factor could affect development CD . Genomic : The investigator study child first degree relative celiac disease understand gene may contribute whether develop CD . Scientists doctor already aware one group gene , call HLA DQ2 DQ8 gene , involve development CD . These gene necessary development CD , alone predict develop disease . The investigator hope CDGEMM study help learn specific gene , also identify gene could make easy predict develop CD . Environmental : When infant enroll , investigator record information environment include whether bear vaginally Cesarean section whether give antibiotic . Over time , investigator also consider part infant 's medical history include feed modality ( breastfeed versus formula feeding ) , illnesses , infection , growth understand information relate CD development . Since investigator follow infant reach 5 year age , investigator update information every six month understand change might affect child develops CD . Microbiome : Our gut , compromise small large intestine , contain many type bacteria . These bacteria live gut normally help break digest food , provide body energy , make vitamin body need . This diverse community bacteria call gut microbiome . A main goal CDGEMM study understand microbiome affected factor , like food antibiotic drug , may affect development CD . It possible learn type bacteria live gut disease development may help u predict develop CD happens . Metabolomic : The process occur gut , digestion food production vitamin , create product call metabolite . The specific metabolite produce differ person person depend many factor , include gene , member gut microbiome , food eat . We study infant 's unique metabolomic profile ( metabolites infant produce ) understand specific profile associate CD .</detailed_description>
