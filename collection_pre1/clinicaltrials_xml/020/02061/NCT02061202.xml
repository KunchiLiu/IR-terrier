	<brief_summary>The propose research design test global hypothesis inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , therapy develop treat asthma , prevent vasoocclusive painful episode adult SCD wheeze , meet criterion diagnosis asthma . The specific aim proposal 1 ) Conduct feasibility study - randomize controlled trial ICS adult SCD meet criterion diagnosis asthma report recurrent cough wheezing , 2 ) Measure effect ICS biological correlate pulmonary inflammation ( determine exhale nitric oxide ) vascular injury ( determined sVCAM ) SCD , 3 ) Compare property traditional Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design therapeutic trial SCD preparation design definitive trial ICS . These aim potential 1 ) change standard care individual SCD recurrent cough wheeze , 2 ) provide insight pathogenesis non-asthmatic wheeze SCD response treatment , 3 ) explore suitability innovative clinical trial design overcome challenge hinder therapeutic innovation SCD .</brief_summary>
