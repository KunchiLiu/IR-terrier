	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Bexarotene Beta-Amyloid Apolipoprotein E Metabolism Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , investigational drug study design measure effect bexarotene clearance AÎ² total production apoE human brain young , healthy individual APOE3/3 genotype . From date initial subject recruitment issuance final study report closeout activity , expect total study duration 6 10 month . Each participant screen eligibility randomize receive either oral bexarotene placebo control ( `` Test Article '' ) .The study potential demonstrate pharmacodynamic property novel treatment approach Alzheimer 's disease . The primary biomarker measurement obtain study believe highly dynamic able provide rapid read-out biologic activity candidate therapeutic study . In addition , exploratory analysis involve proteomics-based screen identify protein within blood CSF induce Test Article , thereby potentially identify new biomarkers use future clinical trial demonstrate bexarotene action target engagement .</detailed_description>
