Eligibility criterion : There patient take part development phase , thus eligibility criterion apply pre-existing datasets . Primary investigator company original pharmacokinetic data factor VIII factor IX concentrate provide data creation model . No restriction country , language factor concentrate apply . Interventions : There therapeutic intervention plan part study . The study result system intend use produce patient level estimate potentially useful modify treatment regimens patient . The phase 1 `` activity '' portion WAPPS-Hemo project include follow : 1. systematic review identify exist publication report pharmacokinetic data factor VIII IX . Only article report individual classic pharmacokinetic data include . The data extract extracted compiled use create population pharmacokinetic model . Investigators company , fulfil eligibility criterion , invite provide data sign bilateral Data Transfer Agreement Data subsequently transfer HIRU , store secure database cod need step b ) . 2. establishment population pharmacokinetic model split data two set : modeling set , pharmacokinetic model build , validation set , use test model implementation . Initially , population pharmacokinetic model build use model data validate use validation set goodness-of-fit plot , bootstrapping , visual prediction check ( VPC ) . After model validation , entire data set use derive final model prospective use . 3. integration population pharmacokinetic model WAPPS-HEMO web service . The Information Technology Support Group HIRU perform extensive in-house beta-testing use fabricate data . 4. field test website ask center participate research network test website fabricate patient data . After successful registration , center provide data , ask generate record patient . We run Population PK estimate , pilot reporting process , gather feedback test process troubleshoot issue come . As well , gather focus group feed-back modify service accordingly . Outcomes : The WAPPS-Hemo project result : 1. repository publish unpublished dataset concentration-time point select population hemophilia patient study administration factor concentrate . Published data summarize systematic review submit publication . 2. population pharmacokinetic model factor concentrate concentration-time point population hemophilia patient . The model development describe scientific report . The extended version available part study documentation , synthetic version submit publication . 3. availability web application use phase ) study . 4. availability prototypal web application use subsequent phase 2 WAPPS-Hemo protocol . Participant timeline : We require 12 month gather data , build model , create prototypal web service . Sample size : We expect able derive model concentrate 50 pre-existing individual PK data . We expect data available 4 different factor concentrate . Recruitment : No patient recruit phase overall WAPPS program . Only already publish data data file use derive model set system . All investigator study identify via literature search contact invited provide data . All drug manufacture active hemophilia field invite provide on-file pharmacokinetic data . Methods : Data collection , management , analysis Data collection method : Data collect primary investigator company agree provide original pharmacokinetic data factor VIII factor IX concentrate . Website development A cluster fully resilient HP server ( Windows web server Network load balance configuration host site , Microsoft SQL database , Windows server NONMEM software ) , locate two different building , support system platform . The system also incorporate fully mirror hard disk , redundant Https connection . The administrative website backup database accessible VPN . The system available 24/7with downtime &lt; 0.01 total time . All WAPPS relate url ( .com , .org , .ca , etc block immediately project fund notification - August 2013 ) . All needed license acquire , include single site license Icon NONMEM population PK software . The website , database access interface , back-end NONMEM interface program dot.net . The system build ready transfer information format compatible hypertext language use embed knowledge Electronic Medical Records ( e.g. , Arden syntax SEBASTIAN framework , http : //www.openclinical.org/gmmsummaries.html ) , facilitate potential interface electronic medical record , database , clinical trial case report form later stage . Data management : Data primary investigator company store secure McMaster University server research team able access . As data provide research team already anonymized , need anonymization . Notwithstanding phase study , already exist data previous publication on-file company-owned database use . We provide description data management subsequent phase study ( WAPPS phase 2 , protocol : The Implementation , User Testing Validation Web-based Application Population Pharmacokinetic Service - Hemophilia ( WAPPS-HEMO ) ) . Users allow access use system moderate registration process . The head partner research center need go registration process , validation McMaster team , she/he receive credential access website . She/he subsequently able authorize user her/his center access system . Each individual user unique access credential , authorize manage patient center she/he belong . Only authorized user able create access patient record , and/or input information require PK assessment . The identification patient happen via combination three different key , minimum two provide case subsequent access record . The three identifier : 1. WAPPS unique identifier , generate system patient 's record creation , report page printout relative patient , 2. patient birthdate , format `` YYYY-MM-DD '' , 3. local patient identifier . As c , wherever allow local center privacy regulation , recommend use string compose `` LASTNAME , FIRSTNAME , LOCAL_CENTER_ID '' . For center whose relevant regulation allow use information , combination alphanumeric code accept . It responsibility local center track local identifier patient file . The data provide user create record patient system . For subsequent re-access user center specific patient record center , system display list register patient , use identifier provide ( i.e . ) b ) mandatorily , c ) information provide center . The user able access specific patient record allow operation ( describe study protocol step 2 ) . Statistical method : The NONMEM 7 version 1.0 ( ICON Development Solutions , Ellicott City , MD ) use Intel Fortran compiler ( version 12 ) population pharmacokinetic modeling . The statistical program R ( version 2.15.0 , R Foundation Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) use compile NONMEM set generate graphical representation model . Perl Speaks NONMEM ( PsN , version 3.5.3 ) PsN Xpose 4 use , respectively , bootstrapping VPC validation test . In order estimate population pharmacokinetic parameter , use first-order conditional estimation interaction method ( FOCEI ) . Exponential function use model inter-individual variability ( IIV ) , inclusion IIV term pharmacokinetic parameter test sequential order . IIV addition significant objective function value ( OFV ) reduction enter model first . Inter-assessment variability ( IAV ) also evaluate baseline pharmacokinetics first available assessment assessment 1 repeat pharmacokinetic profiling subsequent available time assessment 2 . Any residual error find data model combined additive proportional error . Potential demographic clinical factor potentially affect pharmacokinetics ( include type concentrate basic overarch model use product product-specific data available characteristic laboratory technique use measure plasma factor level concentration ) screen use plot IIV versus covariates . When covariates continuous , scatter plot ETA ( IIV code use NONMEM ) versus covariates use determine functional relationship . These scatter plot overlay non-parametric locally weight smooth LOESS line . When covariates categorical , potential difference group identify use box whisker plot . Any possible influence continuous covariates suggest clear trend positive negative slope outstanding correlation coefficient . Influence categorical covariates suggest pronounced change mean value group . In covariate modeling , full stepwise forward addition ( P &lt; 0.005 ) backward elimination ( P &lt; 0.001 ) procedure use . The model selection also validate goodness-of-fit plot , include observation ( OV ) versus population prediction ( PRED ) , OV versus individual prediction ( IPRED ) , conditional weight residual ( CWRES ) versus TIME PRED plot . Other diagnostics , parameter precision , ETA , CWRES distribution shrinkage , also use choose proper population pharmacokinetic model . Methods : Monitoring Data monitoring : For step I WAPPS protocol , need plan data monitoring process . Indeed , data validate part model derivation , use rest study . Congruency check perform user 's input data PK estimation subsequent phase 2 study subsequently routine use interface . Harms : During development phase ( c ) , offer web application beyond boundary develop research unit . The website make available center research network test phase ) ( use fabricate data ) subsequent phase 2 protocol . We clearly identify prototypal experimental use system Research Agreements website page `` Research tool yet ready clinical practice '' . A clear disclaimer indicate `` Any use result population pharmacokinetic estimate care individual patient consider part project phase '' . Auditing : No audit plan phase . We assess percentage error center inputting fabricate data .</detailed_description>
