	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety tolerability addition immunostimulatory therapy consist focal radiation without Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonist Poly ICLC patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) receive concurrent therapy histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACI ) Romidepsin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Histone deacetylase inhibitor epigenetic therapy one active anti-tumor agent patient relapse refractory CTCL despite suppressive effect T cell function , yet overall response rate response duration agent remain suboptimal . Immune stimulatory agent may ideal therapy combine HDACI . To date , one evaluate whether abscopal effect radiation without additional immune stimulation TLR-3 agonist augment efficacy anti-tumor direct epigenetic therapy mycosis fungoides ( MF ) patient . The investigator hypothesize combine modality immuno-chemotherapy may highly effective patient advance MF . This phase I study . It involve two arm patient ( A B ) treat follow standard 3+ 3 design . Patients Arm A one initiate HDACI therapy , patient Arm B one stable disease partial response HDACI treatment . Both group receive HDACI , plus level 1 , focal lesional radiation ; level 2 , radiation combination Poly ICLC . Each arm evaluate escalate independently .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must prior biopsy time point diagnostic confirm MF stage IIAIVA , must fail least one standard therapy ( topical systemic ) . Must skin lesion minimum 2 cm , location amenable radiation minimum 2 additional measurable skin lesion distant radiation site . Must either initiate therapy romidepsin ( Arm A ) currently receive romidepsin document stable disease ( SD ) partial response ( PR ) ( Arm B ) . Patient may prior topical systemic therapy except total electron beam irradiation . Patients must minimum 2 week topical therapy 4 week systemic therapy , phototherapy , local radiation therapy enrollment except HDACI Arm B . Patients allow take weak potency topical corticosteroid patient stable dose month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) Life expectancy great 6 month Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; =2,500/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1,000/mcL platelet &gt; =50,000/mcL total bilirubin : within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT , aspartate aminotransferase ) /ALT ( SGPT , alanine aminotransferase ) = &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine : within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Age &gt; =18 year The effect focal radiation HDACI develop human fetus unknown . For reason agent well therapeutic agent use trial know tetragenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week , topical therapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients allow take weak potency topical corticosteroid patient stable dose month . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition HDACI , TLRagonist , patient know history preexist autoimmune disease . Concurrent therapy systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study HDACI class agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother HDACI , breastfeed discontinue mother treated HDACI radiation . Woman childbearing age men sexually active woman childbearing age must agree acceptable method birth control ( double barrier ) study . Patients know HIV infection ineligible immunomodulatory therapy require normal functional T cell repertoire . If study find safe , effective , immunogenic , HIV positive patient may include future study .</criteria>
