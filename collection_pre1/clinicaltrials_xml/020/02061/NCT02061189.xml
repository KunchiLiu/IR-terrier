	<brief_summary>This clinical trial aim test new physio-therapeutic approach tailor type 2 3 Spinal Muscular Atrophy patient , base physical training swimming-pool . This specific exercise promote motor skill train patient , observed different mouse model . Patient 's motor skill assess use different scale include MFM Hammersmith . This clinical trial attempt develop new non-invasive motor scale sophisticated instrument . This scale useful future clinical trial SMA , give lack sensitivity currently available scale . In addition , study attempt validate questionnaire post-exercise physical well-being .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter study base longitudinal assessment natural disease progression effect exercise protocol swimming pool . This study compare patient determine motor skill disease natural course 12 month . The study compare different scale ( MFM , Hammersmith ) new innovative scale base non-invasive analysis motor skill . 30 patient enrol tested MFM , Hammersmith non-invasive scale every 6 month total 18 month due slow natural progression disease . Among 30 patient , 10 patient select perform 6 month train swim pool , 12 18 month enrollment , define reproducible condition . These trained patient finally reassess 18 24 month test therapeutic effect training compare slope natural disease progression , parameter . Only patient undergone train swim pool reevaluate 24 month ( 6 month post-training ) ass long term exercise effect .</detailed_description>
