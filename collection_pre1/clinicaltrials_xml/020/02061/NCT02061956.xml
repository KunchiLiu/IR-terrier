	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 6th common cancer worldwide third frequent cause death cancer . The 2005 guideline American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) HCC state hepatic resection ( HR ) offer patient solitary lesion non-cirrhotic , cirrhosis still well-preserved liver function . With improvement surgical technique perioperative care , surgical mortality HCC resection reduce less 1 % , 5-year overall survival exceed 50 % . Although development medical science , patient diagnose HCC early stage , lot patient HCC still continue present multiple tumor port vein thrombosis . According AASLD guideline , patient could receive transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) new agent initial treatment .
