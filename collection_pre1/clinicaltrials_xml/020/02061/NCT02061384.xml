	<brief_summary>Men infertility normal hormone level option fertility treatment . Previous research work suggest men infertility may low level active form Vitamin A , call retinoic acid , testis . We think give men low sperm count retinoic acid may increase sperm count improve chance father pregnancy . We want see retinoic acid administration twenty week increase sperm production help infertile men become father without need In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . We also want see add calcitriol retinoic acid improve sperm motility sub-set subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RA-2 13-cis Retinoic Acid ( Isotretinoin )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 20 week , unblinded , two-arm pilot study determine impact therapy 13-cis retinoic acid calcitriol sperm index infertile men . Twenty infertile men , age 21-60 abnormal sperm analysis enrol 20-week give 20 mg 13-cis retinoic acid , twice daily . Subjects # 11- # 20 also administer calcitriol see add calcitriol Accutane improve sperm motility . All subject closely follow side effect relate treatment . The impact treatment index spermatogenesis determine monthly seminal fluid analysis .</detailed_description>
