The risk PML approximately 5 patient 1000 24 month drug . Researchers know exactly cell body virus life isolate blood , urine , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , brain patient immunosuppression . In study , investigator wish determine precisely virus life , body prevents cause brain disease . Because association PML natalizumab , investigator would like see difference amount virus blood , urine , CSF find MS patient treat natalizumab treat different medication MS , treat . The investigator hope knowledge allow u find good way prevent development PML well treatments patient PML .</brief_summary>
