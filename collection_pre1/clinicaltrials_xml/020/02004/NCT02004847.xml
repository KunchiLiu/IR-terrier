	<brief_title>Blue Light Treating Psoriasis Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blue light show release bioactive nitric oxide ( NO ) nitrite nitrosated protein find high concentration skin . This bioactive NO many physiological function regulate immune response , proliferation / differentiation well local blood Perfusion skin . The study test PSO-CT02 device , new investigational medical device emit blue light peak wavelength 453nm treating localise mild Psoriasis vulgaris . It worn Skin effect skin area . In study Treatment ( target ) control area well intensity blue light randomize . The control area serve reference . 50 Patients treat target area daily ( least 5 times/week ) home initial treatment period 4 week . During 4 week , patient return study site safety effectiveness assessment twice . After initiation period patient treat plaque 8 week ( 3 times/week ) . This follow 4 week follow phase without treatment .</detailed_description>
