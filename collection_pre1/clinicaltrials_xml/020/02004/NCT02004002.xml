	<brief_title>Protein Intake &amp; Insulin Action</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance , impaired pancreatic β-cell function , diabetes important complication associate obesity . Although excess energy intake body fat accumulation consider major culprit responsible obesity-associated metabolic abnormality , possible insulin resistance impair β-cell function also due increase dietary protein intake . Protein intake ~15 25 % great obese lean adult exceed current Institute Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) 0.8 g protein/kg body weight ~75 % . An increase habitual protein intake 10 40 % , assess use dietary recall method , show increase risk develop diabetes 2.2 fold . Additionally , ability stimulate glucose disposal insulin infusion report impaired individual consume double recommend protein intake part isoenergetic diet . However , know whether decrease protein intake improve insulin sensitivity β-cell function weight-stable , obese individual . Accordingly , obese men woman randomize 8 week treatment weight maintain diet contain either ) 0.8 g protein/kg body weight ( recommend Institute Medicine ; protein restriction group ) ii ) 1.4 g protein/kg body weight ( control group ) . All subject receive standardize `` base-diet '' without protein supplementation avoid potential food selection bias could confound result use high- low-protein diet .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Body mass index ( BMI ) 30 50 kg/m2 Subjects sedentary ( &lt; 1.5 h exercise/week ) Subjects high habitual protein intake ( &gt; 1.2 g/kg body mass/day ) Subjects evidence significant organ system dysfunction ( e.g . diabetes , severe cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , cirrhosis , hypogonadism , uncontrolled hypo hyperthyroidism ; uncontrolled hypertension ) Subjects metal implant Individuals cancer cancer remission &lt; 5 year , Individuals dementia , Individuals use tobacco product , Subjects take medication know affect glucose metabolism ( e.g. , steroid ) , Subjects take medication control certain medical condition ( e.g. , hypertension ) include drug regimen stable least 6 month enter study expect change study . Women pregnant due change body composition decrease insulin sensitivity cause pregnancy</criteria>
