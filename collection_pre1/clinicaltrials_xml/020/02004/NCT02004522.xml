	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Duvelisib Versus Ofatumumab Patients With Relapsed Refractory CLL/SLL ( DUO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , two- arm , randomize phase 3 , superiority trial design evaluate efficacy safety IPI-145 compare ofatumumab administer patient diagnose CLL/SLL whose disease relapse refractory . Approximately 150 subject receive start dose 25 mg IPI-145 BID initially course 21-day treatment cycle follow 28-day treatment cycle 18 cycle disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( whichever come first ) . After 18 complete cycle treatment , subject may receive additional cycle duvelisib disease progression unacceptable toxicity , judgment Investigator , may derive benefit continued treatment , subject meet criteria additional treatment Cycle 19 Day 1 . Approximately 150 subject receive start dose 300 mg ofatumumab Day 1 follow seven weekly dos 2000 mg . Thereafter , subject receive 2000 mg ofatumumab every month four month . Administration ofatumumab exceed 12 dos ( within 7 cycle ) .</detailed_description>
