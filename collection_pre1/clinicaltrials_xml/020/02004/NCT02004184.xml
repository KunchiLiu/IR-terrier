	<brief_summary>Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account majority ( approximately 85 % ) lung cancer case . Patients localized disease cure surgery , 20 % operable.For majority patient advanced disease , palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy remain recommended therapy . Chemotherapy prolongs survival improve quality life . The recommended first-line therapy 4-6 course platinum combination third generation compound ( e.g . gemcitabine , vinorelbine , docetaxel , pemetrexed , paclitaxel ) . After first-line therapy , recommend observe patient offer second-line chemotherapy disease progression . Regimens second-line therapy include docetaxel pemetrexed monotherapy . Pemetrexed less toxic superior gemcitabine non-squamous NSCLC , whereas docetaxel recommend second-line therapy squamous cell carcinoma . The result study maintenance pemetrexed therapy encouraging ; observe survival benefit clinically relevant relatively large consider poor survival patient advance NSCLC . Furthermore , pemetrexed appear well tolerate . There , however , several limitation study conduct : Relatively elderly patient PS 2 patient enrol - patient control-arms receive pemetrexed progression . The overall aim study investigate whether immediate maintenance pemetrexed therapy prolongs survival compare observation pemetrexed therapy progression patient advance NSCLC . Furthermore , explore whether patient 'performance status ' 2 elderly ≥ 70 year tolerate benefit maintenance therapy ; characteristic blood biomarkers associate sensitivity tolerability therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In previous study without maintenance therapy , median overall survival ( OS ) performance status ( PS ) 0-1 patient approximately 9 month , correspond 6 month randomization study . We consider improvement overall survival two month minimum difference lead routine use maintenance pemetrexed Norway . To demonstrate improvement median overall survival 6 8 month α =0.05 β =0.20 , 198 evaluable patient require arm . We expect drop-out rate maximum 10 % , therefore intend randomize total 436 patient ( PS 0-1 ) - expect 150 70 year old . Sample size calculate PS 0-1 patient . In addition , PS 2 patient randomize required number PS 0-1 patient accrue . We estimate total 100 PS 2 patient enrol - sufficient hypothesis-generating analysis benefit maintenance therapy elderly PS 2 patient . Based experience previous study estimate approximately 30 % patient complete progress induction chemotherapy ; ineligible due deterioration PS . Consequently , need include approximately 765 patient .</detailed_description>
