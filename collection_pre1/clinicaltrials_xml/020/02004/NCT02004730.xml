	<detailed_description>REGISTRY OBJECTIVE To investigate procedural well long-term clinical performance ABSORB technology patient indication percutaneous coronary intervention : 1. multivessel disease ( least two significant stenosis 2 different coronary artery ) , 2. long ( &gt; 24 mm ) single vessel disease . REGISTRY FLOW AND CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE The Italian National Registry prospective multi-center nation-wide registry evaluate safety clinical outcome Absorb BVS daily use patient de novo lesion previously untreated vessel indication PCI multivessel long single coronary artery disease . Indications , however , per recent Absorb IFU . Number Patients Registered Patient Follow-up The Italian National Registry enroll 1000 patient approximately 50 site throughout Italian territory Absorb BVS regulatory approval commercially available . Patients clinical follow-up telephone contact office visit . Measures Taken Avoid Minimize Bias In order minimize bias assess MACE outcomes , event adjudicate independent committee . Clinical follow-up plan : 30 day , 6 month , 1 year , yearly 5 year index procedure . OUTCOMES/ENDPOINTS Outcomes specify : Primary outcome set 1 year : cumulative hierarchical incidence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) define : cardiac death , non-fatal target vessel myocardial infarction ( MI ) , clinically drive target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) ; Secondary endpoint set 1 year : All cause mortality , clinically drive TLR , clinically driven target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) , revascularisation ( non TLR , non TVR ) ARC-defined stent thrombosis , time point . Any type angina post procedure measure mean Cardio Test , propose ANMCO ( Associazione Nazionale Medici Cardiologic Ospedalieri ) [ 21 ] Efficacy parameter : TLR TVR 1 year yearly 5-year follow-up . Safety `` patient orient '' parameter : 1 year yearly 5 year cause mortality , myocardial infarction , Stent thrombosis base ARC classification , 5-year follow-up . Data dual antiplatelet therapy use also collect analyzed . PATIENTS Patient Population Patients enrol registry male female patient derive general interventional cardiology population satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . The Italian National Registry enroll 1000 patient approximately 50 site throughout national terrritory . Informed Consent The Investigator designee , train protocol , explain nature scope registry inform patient potential risk benefit participation , document consent treatment Absorb BVS device accord standard hospital practice . For registry patient must consent data collection follow-up visit . All patient ( legally authorize patient ' representative applicable ) must sign , date time Medical Ethics Committee ( MEC ) approve informed consent prior data collection registry . Obtaining consent , provision copy patient , along date time must document patient 's medical record . The informed consent form must sign investigator . In addition , sign informed consent must keep patient 's medical record . Eligibility Criteria General Eligibility Criteria Assessment general eligibility criterion base medical record site interview candidate patient . Patients must meet least one angiographic inclusion criterion consider registry . If ANY exclusion criterion meet , patient exclude clinical evaluation register . Patient Discontinuation Once register , patient shall remain registry completion require follow-up period ; however , patient 's participation voluntary patient right withdraw time without penalty loss benefit . Conceivable reason discontinuation may include limited following : - Patient voluntary withdrawal - Patient withdrawal physician clinically-indicated - Patient lost-to-follow-up : If patient miss two consecutive schedule follow time point , attempt contact patient unsuccessful , patient consider lose follow-up . No additional data need recorded patient withdrawn registry . Patients replace . Registry Completion An eCRF registry completion form must complete : - patient consider lost-to-follow-up per definition - patient withdraws registry - investigator withdraws patient registry - patient 's follow-up terminate upon registry follow-up complete TREATMENT AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS The treatment strategy determine investigator . It require enrol investigator review recent Absorb BVS IFU ass contraindication , warning precaution section respect risk benefit treat potential patient . Procedure During procedure , patient receive appropriate anticoagulation therapy accord standard hospital practice . The Absorb BVS inspect , prepare , implant accord IFU . QCA analysis recommend pre implantation ABSORB , correct sizing . IVUS , VH-IVUS OCT technique encourage : imaging tool subject subgroup analysis . Post-procedure ( In-hospital ) Post procedure data collect per eCRF Follow-up Antiplatelet Medications A minimum 6 month duration DAPT recommend . Specific type DAPT record per eCRF . Clinical Follow-up Clinical follow-up visit telephone contact office visit per follow schedule . - 30 day : office visit encourage - 6 month : office visit encourage - 1 year , yearly 5 year index procedure : office visit encourage . Angiographic follow The angiographic follow clinically drive . However , patient undergo angio follow IVUS OCT follow include subgroup analysis . ADJUDICATION OF EVENTS In order minimize bias assess MACE outcomes , event adjudicate independent Clinical Event Committee , also act Data Safety Monitoring Board study . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical Overview The data review Data Safety Monitoring Board . The Data Safety Monitoring Board also responsible : - Determining whether information collect sufficient address objective - Recommending modification statistical analysis plan address additional research question base review data Analysis Population All patient successfully register included analysis . A limit one third entire population set group Multivessel Disease patient treat ABSORB conventional stent ( `` hybrid group '' ) . Sample Size Calculations Assumptions Being observational registry aim quantify effect estimate without direct comparison literature benchmark , rely confidence interval profile sample size justification , without proceed formal power analysis . As main analysis pool analysis patient multivessel disease and/or long lesion , overall comprehensive analysis plan primary analytical approach . Accordingly , compute target sample 1000 patient enable computation reasonably precise 95 % confidence interval . Specifically , assume 4.2 % MACE rate 1 year ( keep ABSORBD EXTEND data ) , confidence interval compute adjusted Wald method would 3.1 % 5.6 % 1000-patient sample ( point estimate 42/1000 [ 4.2 % ] ) . Given registry aim reflect real-world patient practice , provision limit restrict patient enrolment depend presence multivessel disease v long lesion envision . Statistical Analyses Continuous endpoint summarize present total number patient , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum . Tabulation categorical parameter include count percentage . The outcome summarize discrete continuous variable use method describe . Survival analysis perform Kaplan-Meier method . Statistical inference base computation 95 % confidence interval use adjust Wald method . Additional analysis involve key subgroup define accord baseline , lesion , procedural feature , statistical significance set 5 % 2-tailed level . Specifically , Student , Fisher exact , log-rank test use bivariate analysis , whereas multivariable linear regression , logistic regression , Cox proportional hazard analysis use adjust confounders . In addition , separate analysis patient multivessel disease , patient long lesion , patient hybrid revascularization perform . DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS The investigator/institution permit direct access source data/documents order registry-related monitoring , audit , MEC review , regulatory inspection perform . As part inform consent , investigator designee obtain permission registry monitor regulatory authority review , confidence , record identify patient registry . QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Protocol Informed Consent Approval The Principal Investigator site must confirm agree content protocol prior participation registry . Also , Principal Investigator obtain write approval protocol , informed consent form , registry related document MEC . In addition , investigator take action necessary ongoing registry approval site per establish procedure MEC . The investigator advise MEC progress registry regular basis registry completion require MEC . The investigator submit amendment protocol well associate informed consent form change obtain write MEC approval prior implementation require MEC . Monitoring A monitoring plan establish . Remote monitor CRO source document analysis event throughout study period independent Event Committee , conduct ensure compliance protocol applicable regulatory requirement . DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING For registry duration , investigator maintain complete accurate documentation include limited following : medical record , registry progress record , laboratory report , electronic case report form , sign informed consent form , device serial number monitor malfunction , correspondence MEC registry monitor/Sponsor , SAE report , information regard patient discontinuation registry completion . Source Documentation - Medical history/physical condition patient involvement registry sufficient verify protocol entry criterion - Dated signed note day entry registry reference sponsor , protocol number , patient ID number statement inform consent obtain - Dated signed note patient visit - Adverse event report resolution include support document discharge summary , catheterization laboratory report , ECGs , lab result include documentation site awareness SAEs investigator device relationship assessment AEs . - Notes regard Dual Anti Platelet Therapy medication take registry - ( include start stop date ) - Patient 's condition upon completion withdrawal registry - Any data require substantiate data enter CRF Electronic Case Report Form Completion Primary data collection base source-documented hospital /or clinic chart review perform clearly accurately site personnel train protocol eCRF completion . eCRF data collect patient register . ETHICAL CONSIDERATION Medical Ethics Committee Review Medical Ethics Committee ( MEC ) approval protocol informed consent form /other write information provide patient obtain Principal Investigator investigational site prior participation registry . No change make protocol informed consent form write information provide patient without appropriate approval MEC . Until registry complete , Investigator advise his/her MEC progress registry , per MEC requirement . Further , amendments protocol well associate informed consent form change submit MEC write approval obtain prior implementation , accord institution 's MEC requirement .
