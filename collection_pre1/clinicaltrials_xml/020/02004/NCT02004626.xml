	<brief_title>Evaluate Noninferiority Medicines Treating Uninfected Pressure Ulcers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective efficacy reduction area devitalize tissue base photographic record . The secondary objective evaluate : - formation granulation tissue ; - lesion reduction treatment ; - healing process Pressure Ulcer ( PU ) range PUSH ; - safety investigational product . Study Plan : - Estimated 92 research participant ; - Aged ≥ 18 year ≤ 80 year - sex ; - Visits 1 10 ; - The maximum lasting period study research participant approximately four week . Evaluations During Study : Evaluation Digital Photography : The digital photographic record provide relative size wound , tissue color condition surround skin . The evaluation digital photograph research participant perform classification assign decrease devitalize area tissue e repair related time heal observed formation granulation tissue epithelialization standardize photograph . Evaluation PUSH Scales : In order provide evaluation instrument PUs Brazil , satisfy simplicity use different clinical scenario keep measurement property , previously attest original version , PUSH scale adapt Portuguese . The PUSH Scale considers three parameter sub - scale wound heal process treatment outcome : wound area , amount exudate present wound , appearance wound . Retention Records : The investigator shall retain documentation study period least five year end study . The Sponsor designee provide list documentation keep Investigator . Monitoring : All aspect study carefully monitor Cristália Pharmaceutical Chemicals Ltda . designate representative ( Clinical Research Organization - CRO ) evaluation relate good clinical practice applicable local regulation . Case Report Forms : The Monitor available investigator , person team , need information guidance . The Monitor study permanent access documentation obligation ensure Case Report Forms complete complete correctly , well check data describe accord source document , order eliminate interference may compromise accuracy data generate clinical trial . Audit Inspections : Authorized representative Sponsor designees , regulatory authority Ethics Committee institution may conduct audit inspection study conclusion . Collecting Data : The information correspond data interest study collect recorded Case Report form provide Sponsor , fill information contain source document . Documents consider source study : medical record use professional time visit , diagnostic test image . Informed Consent Trial : The Principal Investigator ensure research participant receive verbally write relevant information nature , purpose , test drug , possible risk benefit study . Research participant notify free discontinue study time . That opportunity ask question sufficient time consider information receive . Formation database : The database study assemble data Case Report Forms . Doubts discrepancy generate question ( query ) write Principal Investigator .</detailed_description>
