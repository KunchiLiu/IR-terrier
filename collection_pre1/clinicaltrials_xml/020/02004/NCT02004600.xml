	<detailed_description>The hereditary dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa genodermatosis responsible poor adhesion epidermis dermis pull large mucocutaneous fragility recurrent spontaneous posttraumatic bullous detachment . They cause mutation COL7A1 gene encode collagen VII . No curative treatment avaible . The main cause patient death development squamous cell carcinoma , sometimes multiple paticularly aggressive repeat heal part . The early treatment pre-epithelioma cutaneous lesion moderate severe dysplasia type would undoubtedly allow improve prognosis patient . Because cutaneous fragility patient , topical treatment imiquimod 5-FU possible . The photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) one technical reference multiple actinic keratoses lesion adult , also pre-epithelioma lesion . The PDT well tolerate even elderly require single session . The main objective study determine efficiency photodynamic therapy treatment epidermic dysplasies patient affect dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( DEB ) . The secondary objective evaluate tolerance treatment term pain healing , evaluate contribution confocal microscopy diagnosis epidermal dysplasia patient affect hereditary dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa . The main evaluation criterion cutaneous biopsy ( M2 ) PDT session epidermal dysplasia area . The secondary criterion evaluation pain PDT session heal cutaneous lesion M0 , M2 M4 ( lesion area heal time ) correlation histology / MC . This bicentric , open pilot study 5 patient 18 year affect hereditary dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa epidermal displasia . Carcinomas situ exclude study . Each patient suspicious lesion biopsied . In case agreement protocol , 1 PDT session follow consultation control 2 4 month end treatment . Total study duration : 18 month ( 12 month inclusion , 4 month study , 2 month data analysis ) .</detailed_description>
