	<brief_title>Evaluation MNCH Mentoring Intervention Karnataka</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By provide on-site mentoring improve clinical care service delivery , hypothesize quality service care improve patient well clinical outcome . Specifically believe routine on-site clinical service delivery mentor strengthen clinical knowledge , skill practice among staff nurse ANMs ( year 2 ) , strengthen appropriate referral follow care , improve aspect service quality , provider client satisfaction . The evaluation ass change first year intervention focus clinical mentor staff nurse quality improvement PHCs whole . The evaluation focus success indicator show Appendix 1 . Due short time frame evaluation , success indicator principally level input , output , outcome focus adherence Sukshema Critical Care package , although also hope assess key health outcome , term reduction `` near-miss '' case . A. Pre post MM intervention evaluation strategy The `` pre-intervention '' evaluation two phase . The first phase take place 122 site intervention activity begin ( Figure 1 ) . This evaluation focus site readiness provide quality service , provider knowledge , attitude report observed ( simulate ) practice , supervision mentoring , record keep , provider client satisfaction . The NRHM SBA guideline , PHC 24/7 guideline , MHFW NSSK guideline , Sukshema critical care package use determine expectation clinical quality care level . The focus first year MM intervention enhance clinical skill intra-partum postpartum period thus assessment actual clinical practice important . However , data actual practice intrapartum postpartum period difficult collect observation baseline ( especially complication ) . Most PHCs conduct delivery week , therefore almost impossible obtain representative sample observation . Therefore assess intrapartum postpartum clinical practice largely though audit case sheet register . However , case sheet currently either available use . Thus strategy necessitates delay part second phase baseline update training staff give instruct use new improved case sheet . All site give opportunity practice use patient case sheet one month collect project staff use basis assess compliance new case sheet , adequacy reporting , actual case management . Actual case observation do routine MM visit possible . The post intervention phase assessment take place site year first ( plan 6 ) MM visit repeat baseline survey . Pre post MM intervention evaluation survey tool The survey use four type survey tool pre post MM intervention one additional tool one year intervention site : A1 . Questionnaires staff nurse duty ( include night duty ) PHCs evaluation ass knowledge intrapartum , postpartum , newborn care infection prevention , solicit provider perspective mentor supervision . In case , question form case study ask simulated demonstration practice . A2 . Facility audit observation PHCs ass site readiness provide quality service provide check drug use : equipment drug , staff training level , availability correct use case sheet , register referral slip . This tool also section observe practice postnatal ward . A3 . Postpartum client questionnaire woman deliver one month survey trace home assess client recall information service give client satisfaction . Delivery register check woman deliver PHC n previous month trace home interview . A4 . Case sheet register audit case one month survey date assess completeness report appropriate client management A5 . Focus Group Discussions SNs sample intervention PHCs : During post MM intervention survey conduct focus group discussion ( FGDs ) staff selection intervention site understand experience MM intervention gather suggestion improvement . Data collection : The field staff consist three supervisor per district , plus 13 team 2 interviewer , one manage facility audit staff survey , one postpartum client questionnaires 122 PHCs . It necessary team spend 2 day PHC , thus team able complete survey work 3-4 week . Simultaneous data collection carry district . A week 's training provide field team include lecture technical topic , demonstration interview , mock interview field practice . The training provide 10 % person actually require survey , require number select base performance training . KHPT SJMC staff conduct training monitor field work activity quality data . Data processing : Double data entry do KHPT , prepare report pre-intervention survey end-line survey comparison . B . Routine continuous monitoring : First , project staff routinely document staffing , training , financial project input , data crucial assess feasibility scale district . During bi-monthly MM visit , staff proscribed list data collect . As well keep detail staff sit train background clinical mentoring give , mentor proscribe list clinical skill observe ; wherever possible 3 day visit , observe woman labour , delivery postpartum ward , possible , use model case study assess staff skill . There continuous monitoring MM intervention report MM visit include : documentation visit trip report detail facility meeting , talk give , happening PHC area note morbidity mortality discussion ; complete clinical competency checklist mentor individual . They also photocopy case sheet , use basis discussion visit facility action plan , review KHPT clinical staff . The case sheet also collect quarterly control sit KHPT district staff . These staff encourage use case sheet quarterly visit without additional training mentoring . Informed consent Verbal , witness informed consent seek head PHC ask give permission survey PHC ; staff nurse interview PHCs postnatal woman trace community . Districts site Using match ( client volume ) case control strategy , MM intervention pilot evaluated PHCs two district , Gulbarga Bellary total 122 24x7 PHCs ( Gulbarga 70 ; Bellary 52 ) . Sixty one PHCs ( Gulbarga 35 ; Bellary 26 ) randomly assign MM intervention experimental group ( stratify taluka 6-monthly patient delivery load ) , rest serve control sit . SBA + train The first part intervention involve 122 PHC 24/7 facility two district two reason : first feel train generally need help put intervention control site staff level play field term basic MNCH knowledge ; second , know Sukshema baseline survey conduct 2011 staff use adequate reporting mechanism case sheet . As need programmatically job aid , programme evaluative purpose , use train opportunity introduce new case sheet . After first phase baseline survey ( describe ) mentor programme begin intervention site , Sukshema project staff conduct 3 day training update ( call SBA+ ) staff nurse one day SBA+ M.O . 's 122 PHCs two district , irrespective whether previously attend NRHM Skilled Birth Attendant ( SBA ) training . The 3 day training focus essential component intra-partum postpartum ( mother baby ) care identify Sukshema critical care package evidence show significantly reduce maternal newborn morbidity mortality . The one day training doctor focus identification danger sign , pre-referral management complication , quality care , case audit improvement management documentation . At training , staff give , instruct use enhance case sheet woman baby labour discharge , include use partograph . After training , intervention control sit , except Sukshema staff visit every 3 month collect copy case sheet . Sampling strategy The PHC intervention control sit select systematically taluka , stratification match client volume per month . MNCH mentor In district MNCH mentor ( MMs ) , new staff cadre , recruit trained ( Gulbarga 5 ; Bellary 4 ) , responsible intervention 6-7 experimental/intervention PHCs . We also train 3 additional MMs act back-up ( 2 Gulbarga one Bellary ) , total 12 mentor . The MMs attend PHC staff training also train 4 week project staff St John 's Medical College essential clinical competency mentor staff clinical skill , team building problem solving , service delivery improvement , well effective mentor . The MNCH mentor senior nurse , select base specific criterion clinical experience , train mentor ability , experience/familiarity government health system . They guide Mentoring Coordinator district support mentor ' activity liaise , PHCs , district government staff KHPT district staff . During first year , mentor train Project ( ) provide clinical mentoring safe delivery staff nurse hands-on coaching ; ( b ) provide mentor improve quality service building teamwork introduce problem solve initiative address aspect service delivery ( include especially referral process ) ; year 2 mentor ANMs come PHC MNCH mentor visit , provide antenatal , postpartum newborn care , referral follow .</detailed_description>
