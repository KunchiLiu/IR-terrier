	<brief_title>Micra Transcatheter Pacing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 56 site locate around world , include 30 site United States ( U.S. ) . Up 780 subject plan enrol ( i.e . consent ) allow 720 subject implant enable least 600 subject follow least 12-months post-implant . There two primary objective study ( one safety one efficacy ) . The primary safety objective study evaluate major complication relate Micra system procedure . The primary safety endpoint pre-specified evaluate 6-months ( 183 day ) post-implant . The primary efficacy objective , Micra pace capture threshold , also pre-specified evaluate six month post-implant . This study also separate long term safety objective provide additional long-term safety data follow potential regulatory submission . All subject follow official study closure ( official study closure define Medtronic and/or FDA requirement satisfy per Clinical Investigational Plan and/or decision Medtronic regulatory authority ) . Additionally , Micra Accelerometer Sensor Sub-Study ( MASS ) conduct 4 center already active Micra study Austria , Spain , Hungary France . Forty ( 40 ) subject enrol Sub-Study , enrollment Sub-Study complete March 31 , 2016 . The purpose Sub-Study test feasibility future enhancement Micra device functionality .</detailed_description>
