	<detailed_description>The optimal management head neck squamous cell carcinoma typically involve primary surgical resection , indication adjuvant radiotherapy base pathologic marker intermittent - high-risk disease , include positive margin , extracapsular nodal extension , lymphovascular invasion , perineural invasion ( 1-3 ) . Trismus one long term sequela radiotherapy head neck cancer patient . The prevalence trismus head neck oncology treatment could high 42 % ( 4 ) . It significantly reduce nutrition due impaired mastication ( 5 ) . The loss function appear related damage fibrosis muscle mastication . Radiation therapy involve temporomandibular joint , pterygoid muscle , temporalis masseter muscle likely result trismus ( 5 , 6 ) . Moreover , may scar tissue radiation surgery , nerve damage , combination factor ( 6 , 7 ) . In addition , dose RT level excess 60 Gy ( 8 ) configuration radiation field increase ( 9 ) likely cause trismus . These data document clinical result conventional radiotherapy ( RT ) . Recently , extensive data suggest intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) safe efficacious adjuvant set oral cavity cancer ( OCC ) ( 10-12 ) . Hsiung et al . ( 13 ) Chen et al . ( 14 ) confirm radiation induce trismus progressed time improve IMRT . Hsiung et al . ( 13 ) find average normalize maximal interincisal distance ( MID ) 94 % 98.1 % 5 m 12 m post-IMRT , respectively . In addition , 0.2 mm deterioration radiation-induced trismus period 12-18 month post-IMRT note . Moreover , Chen et al . ( 14 ) also confirm radiation induce trismus progressed time improve IMRT . However , Kent et al . ( 15 ) examine incidence trismus IMRT group compare conventional radiotherapy group . There significant difference maximum vertical dimension IMRT conventional RT group , ( 38.8 ± 9.0 v 33.7 ± 10.1 mm , respectively , p = 0.11 ) . Helical tomotherapy ( HT ) conceptually regard image-guided IMRT . HT design developed advantage sharper dose gradient well normal tissue spar . Our clinical experience use HT locally advance head neck cancer achieve encouraging result along less toxicity , low percentage dermatitis xerostomia compare previous report ( 16-18 ) . HT provide good normal tissue spar sharp dose gradient IMRT ( 19 , 20 ) .Chen et al . ( 19 ) compare HT IMRT nasopharyngeal carcinoma note HT significantly reduce dose contralateral parotid gland improve dose homogeneity PTVs . Additionally , HT reduce mean dos brainstem ( p = 0.02 ) , larynx ( p = 0.03 ) , oral cavity ( p = 0.03 ) . Similarly , head-and-neck cancer , HT plan also provide favorably result compare step-and-shoot IMRT plan . They expect able reduce parotid normal tissue ( average 6.5 Gy ) complication probability , keep similar target dose homogeneity ( 21 ) . Furthermore , HT provide well mandible spar IMRT mean dose decrease 34.9 Gy ( IMRT ) 30.7 Gy ( HT ) ( 20 ) . However , HT provide good normal tissue spar reduce incidence trismus ? It 's still interesting issue discus . In 4-year initial clinical experience 39 postoperative OCC patient treat HT , note incidence grade 1 grade 2 , 3 trismus [ accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) ] appear inversely trend time sequence post-HT treatment ( Fig . 1 ) . These observation hint possible decreasing late complication HT good normal tissue spar sharp dose gradient ( 16-18 ) responses radiation induce trismus improve IMRT ( 13 , 14 ) . According previous study ( 6 ) , Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could provide advantage finding masticator structure patient trismus develop radiotherapy nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . The abnormality comprise radiotherapy-induced masticator muscle fibrosis inflammation , denervation atrophy masticator muscle secondary mandibular nerve damage , osteoradionecrosis change mandibular ramus , perimasticator fibrosis extend masticator space post RT damage parotid gland . The presence several MRI abnormality masticator structure patient trismus radiotherapy suggest trismus multifactorial . However , good correlation data severity trismus image finding thus change may possible due non-specific inflammatory fibrosis reaction radiation . Also , correlation data radiation dosages abnormality , finding may also result cause surgery chemotherapy . Therefore , try evaluate MRI examination perform patient trismus establish follow radiotherapy OCC patient , order identify range frequency underlie disease may cause complication . We retrospect OCC patient use MRI signal abnormality score ( SA score ) , separate patient accord clinical trismus grade three group , mean SA score grade 0 patient 8.5 , grade 1 6.76 grade 2 4.87 . Compared group 2 patient , statistically significant difference group 1 ( p= .04 ) well group 0 ( p= .02 ) , respectively . It mean SA score could correspond trismus grade ( Fig . 2 ) . Rehabilitation train improve swallow function slow progress trismus NPC patient follow radiotherapy . The efficacy rate ( percentage patient excellent effective result ) rehabilitation group high control group ( 77 % vs. 43 % ) , difference statistically significant ( p = 0.02 ) . The efficacy rate trismus rehabilitation group significantly high control group ( 64 % vs. 28 % , p = 0.02 ) ( 22 ) . Using Therabite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System ( Therabite Corporation , Bryn Mawr , PA ) maintain and/or improve mandibular range motion post-irradiated patient report ( 23 ) . They note net increase maximal interincisal distance ( MID ) Therabite group ( 13.6 mm [ +/- 1.6 mm ] ) significantly great unassisted exercise group ( 6.0 mm [ +/- 1.8 mm ] ) mechanically assist mandibular mobilization stack tongue depressor combine unassisted exercise group ( 4.4 mm [ +/- 2.1 mm ] ) ( P &lt; .05 ) week 6 thereafter . These data support benefit rehabilitation trismus follow RT . However , rehabilitation follow new RT techniques synchronic effect improve patient 's quality life another interesting point need discus . Acupuncture ancient Chinese method treat disease relieve pain . Electro-acupuncture ( EA ) one many physical measure use relieve musculoskeletal pain improve associate restricted range motion . Furthermore , electrical stimulation via skin patch electrode effective EA . Low frequency ( 2 Hz ) high frequency ( 100 Hz ) EA selectively induce release enkephalins dynorphins experimental animal human . Clinical study suggest effectiveness treatment various type pain spinally induced muscle spasm ( 24 ) . In addition , acupuncture-like stimulation exerts physiologic effect central nervous system , mediate presumably muscle afferent fiber . The effect may relevant relief muscle spasm musculoskeletal pain , restoration mobility ( 25 ) . Moreover , combine method acupuncture pressure otopoints ( combination group ) use treat facial spasm . The total effective rate combination group , acupuncture group pressure otopoints group 95.4 % , 92.1 % 62.5 % respectively ; cure rate 38.4 % , 15.8 % 5 % respectively . The difference result three group indicate therapeutic effectiveness combine method acupuncture pressure otopoints well two therapeutic method ( 26 ) .These data hit potential benefit combination EA physical therapy . Moreover , electrical stimulation via skin patch electrode effective EA ( 24 ) . Therefore , effect physical therapy combine skin patch electrode different frequency maybe well physical therapy alone follow CCRT RT another interesting issue discus . Therefore , design current prospective measurement study 3 year follow-up evaluate incidence severity radiation-induced trismus IMRT HT follow physical therapy without electrical stimulation via skin patch electrode use MRI ass relevant pretreatment factor , treatment-related factor , dosimetric parameter . Specific Aims : For Year 1 : 1 . To clarify optimal dos muscle mild non-trismus treat IMRT HT retrospective clinical data 2 . To testify whether MRI finding good correlation radiation dose also clinical severity trismus . 3 . To testify whether IMRT HT plan achieve optimal dos re-plan patient new constrains . . For Year 2 : 1 . To clarify whether newly plan technique IMRT HT decrease incidence progression trismus head neck patient . 2 . To testify whether MRI finding serve predictor trismus follow . 3 . To clarify whether add rehabilitation provide synchronous benefit trismus follow newly RT plan technique . For Year 3 : 1 . To clarify whether HT provide good clinical result decrease trismus head neck patient IMRT . 2 . To clarify whether MR image abnormality head neck patient IMRT change early introduction rehabilitation . 3 . To clarify whether electrical stimulation via skin specific point combine rehabilitation provide synchronous benefit rehabilitation alone trismus follow newly RT plan technique .</detailed_description>
