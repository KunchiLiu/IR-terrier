	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) among lead cause death disability main cause death among under-45s . Most patient moderate severe TBI admit intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . The 'PROmoting patient SAFEty quality improvement critical care ' ICU network recently establish 6 European country European Union funding ( PHEA 2007331 ) , continue collect high-quality data beyond grant duration . In 2012 , 242 ICUs join 'PROmoting patient SAFEty quality improvement critical care ' , recruit total 85,965 patient . Of ICUs , 180 admit least one TBI patient , total 3,300 case . Hence , network expect enroll 7-9,000 moderate-to-severe TBI patient 4 year , 125 participate ICUs . The 'PROmoting patient SAFEty quality improvement critical care ' consortium already focused attention TBI start collect additional information condition order develop prognostic model identify center excellence TBI management . Aims CREACTIVE project consolidate exist network order well describe epidemiology moderate-to-severe TBI 7 country ( Cyprus , Greece , Hungary , Israel , Italy , Poland , Slovenia ) ; establish centralized repository biological sample ( blood derive fluid , CSF ) clinical imaging data , exploit prognostic purpose ; build prognostic model base clinical biological data predict short- long-term outcome ; identify effective clinical intervention optimally treat TBI patient ; recognize determinant optimal vs. suboptimal performance . All patient admit participate ICUs diagnosis traumatic brain injury , regardless severity , recruit . Centralized repositories image data biological sample analysis phenotypic genotypic biomarkers establish approx . 2,000 adult TBI patient . Follow-up perform six month trauma event , two-tiered . The first level administer phone constitute extended version Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOSe ) health-related quality care questionnaire . The second level encompass patient 's full examination , child , include dedicate sleep disturbance study . The second level follow-up perform select subgroup ICUs .</detailed_description>
