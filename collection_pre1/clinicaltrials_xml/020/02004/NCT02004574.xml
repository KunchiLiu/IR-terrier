	<detailed_description>Psoriasis disease difficult cure usually recurrent therefore , continue management crucial . An evidence-based approach important appropriate treatment patient psoriasis . However , lack response data topical treatment Asian patient psoriasis , treatment guideline available . Therefore , routine topical treatment , instead patient-specific treatment , usually apply , may result treatment failure . In regard , imperative conduct study assess topical treatment Korean patient psoriasis vulgaris term efficacy side effect . Furthermore , psoriasis patient Korea , mostly small plaque type , may exhibit different disease activity response outcomes accordingly require different treatment option compare Western population whose dominant psoriasis type large plaque type . Thus , study Korean patient psoriasis may reveal interest find . In order investigate optimal maintenance regimens topical treatment Korean patient psoriasis vulgaris , plan study evaluate efficacy three 8-week maintenance regimen contain Xamiol® gel ( PRN treatment group , Continuous treatment group Twice weekly treatment group ) patient become `` Responder '' 8-week induction therapy Xamiol® gel ( `` Responder '' ) . The primary objective study evaluate percentages `` Responder '' * week 16 , assess Investigator 's Global Assessment Disease Severity ( IGA ) , three different 8-week maintenance regimen Xamiol® gel 8-week induction treatment Xamiol® gel patient psoriasis vulgaris . * Responder define subject `` clear '' `` almost clear '' accord IGA . Secondary study objective evaluate efficacy , % Relapse time Relapse , PGA , Patient Compliance , Safety Quality Life ( DLQI TSQM ) three arm calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate combination gel treatment Korean patient chronic plaque psoriasis body .</detailed_description>
