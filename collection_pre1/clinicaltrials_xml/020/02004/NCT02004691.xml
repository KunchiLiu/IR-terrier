	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective phase 2/3 study evaluate efficacy olipudase alfa ( recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase ) administer intravenously every 2 week 52 week adult patient acid sphingomyelinase deficiency ( ASMD ) assess change 1 ) spleen volume measure abdominal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( , United States [ US ] , association patient perception relate spleen volume measure splenomegaly relate score ( SRS ) ) ; 2 ) infiltrative lung disease measure pulmonary function test , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) . Secondary Objectives : - To confirm safety olipudase alfa administer intravenously every 2 week 52 week . - To characterize effect olipudase alfa patient perception relate spleen volume measure SRS 52 week study drug administration . ( For US , effect olipudase alfa splenomegaly relate score part primary objective ) . - To characterize effect olipudase alfa 52 week study drug administration follow endpoint assess sequentially : - The effect olipudase alfa liver volume ; - The effect olipudase alfa platelet count ; - The effect olipudase alfa fatigue ; - The effect olipudase.alfa pain ; - The effect olipudase alfa dyspnea .</brief_summary>
