	<brief_title>Safety Study Use Topical Cyclosporine Treatment Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease ( DED ) multifactorial disease tear ocular surface result symptoms discomfort , visual disturbance , tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany increase osmolarity tear film inflammation ocular surface . DED prevalence estimate around 15 -35 % population 50 year old . There wide variety topic medication treatment DED , though aim re-establishment tear osmolarity equilibrium reduction damage ocular surface . The treatment DED include medical treatment , tear substitution , tear preservation , production stimulation , anti-inflammatory ; also include surgical treatment , tarsorrhaphy salivary gland transplant . Considering tear substitute anti-inflammatory topical treatment , purpose study determine efficacy immunomodulating topical medication contain 0.05 % cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , compare topical lubricant ( vitamin A , Refresh Endura® ) , treatment dry eye disease ( DED ) due primary secondary Sjögren 's syndrome ( aqueous deficient DED ) evaporative DED .</detailed_description>
