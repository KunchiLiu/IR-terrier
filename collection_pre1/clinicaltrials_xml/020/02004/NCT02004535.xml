	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate benefit binaural hear non-traditional cochlear implant candidate ( Asymmetric Hearing Loss ) . Asymmetric candidate patient severe profound hearing loss one ear well hearing ear . ( One ear deaf ear well hearing case use hear aid . ) The investigator hypothesize cochlear implantation poorer ear provide functional increase word sentence understand quiet noise , perceive benefit , localization ability , measure auditory performance relative use well hearing ear alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multichannel cochlear implant highly successful restore speech understand adult child congenital acquire bilateral profound severe-to-profound sensorineural ( permanent ) hearing loss . As implant technology continue develop post-implant performance patient improve , patient selection criterion broaden include patient less severe hearing loss . Further , result study patient receive bilateral cochlear implant demonstrate improved performance feasibility integrate signal ear . In contrast person bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss , person one ear profound severe-to-profound hearing loss ear substantially less hearing loss , date , consider cochlear implant candidate . This assumed well enough conventional hearing aid well ear . A problem assumption even appropriately fit well ear hear aid , many hearing-impaired individual still experience significant difficulty speech understanding everyday listening environment , along significant communication handicap interfere employment quality life . Previous study examine performance patient symmetrical hearing loss wear cochlear implant one ear power hearing aid ear , illustrate two input combine provide binaural hear benefit . It hypothesize study patient asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss may also receive significant binaural benefit cochlear implant poorer ear along appropriately fit hearing aid well ear . That , study examines whether patient asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss utilize type input ( acoustic one ear electric ) effectively , combine receive binaural hearing assistance improve speech understanding , localization ability , patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
