	<brief_summary>Patients localized prostate cancer routinely treat radiation therapy entire prostate gland . The investigator identify cancer concentrate prostate gland use new specialized imaging technique call 11C Choline PET ( stand choline positron emission tomography ) . This different old type PET scan use past ( call FDG PET ) accurate new PET scan identifying cancer prostate gland . It also show deliver high dos radiation prostate cancer cell prostate result well cure rate patient prostate cancer . Therefore goal number one investigator want give high radiation dose prostate cancer cell . But challenge deliver high dos radiation prostate gland may also increase chance complication higher dos radiation rectum , bladder surround area . Therefore goal number two investigator want minimize radiation dose rectum , bladder surround area . 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( 3T MRI ) new kink scan use study identify urethra prostate investigator minimize radiation dose urethra . The investigator believe 3T MRI scan able point area cancer may able predict well treatment may work , well area tumor appear respond fail . In study , investigator keep dose radiation rectum bladder low possible increase radiation dose part prostate cancer cell . The investigator compare cure rate study cure rate patient receive standard treatment dose radiation deliver throughout prostate gland . The investigator also compare rate complication study rate complication patient receive standard treatment dose radiation deliver throughout prostate gland .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label , non-randomized , single site , phase I/II study safety utility 11C-Choline PET scan delineation intraprostatic lesion subject localize intermediate risk prostate cancer subsequent Enhanced EBRT ( External Beam Radiation Therapy ) monitor toxicity , therapeutic response recurrence . The estimated total number subject require protocol enrollment baseline 11C-Choline PET scan 63 ; however , protocol complete accrual 29 subject commence Enhanced EBRT outline stop rule require halt accrual . Twenty-nine ( 29 ) subject treat Enhanced EBRT require assess toxicity treatment base statistical analysis outline protocol . Subjects receive fix dose ( 400 MBq , 10 % ) 11C-Choline PET/CT image co-registration 3T MRI image prior Enhanced EBRT two dose 11C-Choline two interval ( 3 6 month ) thereafter . Subjects suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation 11C-Choline proceed Enhanced EBRT , consist dose prescription 78 Gy 25 fraction intraprostatic lesion 68 Gy 25 fraction ( simultaneously ) prostate gland . Subjects without suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation treat Cross Cancer Institute standard care EBRT undergo follow-up biochemical recurrence per protocol determine prognostic value baseline PET finding . Subjects monitor 11C-Choline safety efficacy EBRT safety / toxicity efficacy . 11C-Choline PET image intraprostatic lesion ( ) analyze relative uptake score ( RUS ) , tumor background ratio ( T/B ) SUVmax parameter . Adequate delineation determine lesion tumor background ration ≥2 . This defined section 10 . 11C-Choline PET image parameter correlate measure progression survival include biochemical disease free survival indicator Enhanced EBRT response . Efficacy 11C-Choline delineate Enhanced EBRT evaluate progression survival analysis compare historical data population . Safety 11C-Choline determine : vital sign , blood hematology clinical biochemistry profile ( pre-injection , post-imaging ) adverse event collection . Safety/toxicity 11C-Choline delineate Enhanced EBRT determine adverse event collection , primarily genitourinary gastrointestinal toxicity compare historical data population .</detailed_description>
