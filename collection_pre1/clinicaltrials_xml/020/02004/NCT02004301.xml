	<brief_summary>This single-centre , open-label , non-randomised , two-arm study 12 healthy male volunteer . This study design correlate gastrointestinal transit behaviour delayed-release diclofenac potassium tablet pharmacokinetic ( PK ) absorption profile . We look : 1 . The behaviour tablet ( , quickly break ) 2 . The gastric emptying time tablet ( leave stomach ) 3 . The gastrointestinal transit tablet ( long take travel gut ) 4 . Blood level drug ( diclofenac )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Delayed-release Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tablet test contain drug , diclofenac potassium . Diclofenac potassium non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) take reduce inflammation analgesic , reduce pain certain condition rheumatoid arthritis , gout post-operative pain . The 2 treatment follow : Tablet T4 : Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet time delay 4 h Tablet T6 : Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet time delay 6 h In study use type radioactive material ( know technetium-99m ) routinely used investigation type . A small amount technetium-99m put tablet . Primary Objective A ) To assess site time onset complete release radiolabel two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulation Secondary Objectives B ) To determine gastrointestinal transit parameter two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulation C ) To determine plasma concentration diclofenac PK sample point post-administration two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulation D ) To assess compare two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulation , minimum , follow PK parameter : tlag , tmax , Cmax AUC0-15h</detailed_description>
