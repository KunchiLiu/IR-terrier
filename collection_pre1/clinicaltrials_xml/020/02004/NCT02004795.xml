	<brief_summary>This boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT ) combine image-guided intensity modulation radiotherapy ( IG-IMRT ) patient previously irradiate locally recurrent head neck cancer . The primary end point treatment toxicity response rate . The secondary endpoint time tumor progression , progression-free survival , overall survival change quality life . Head neck ( H &amp; N ) carcinomas recur locally conventional irradiation pose therapeutic challenge . Boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT ) base nuclear capture reaction occur non-radioactive boron irradiate neutron thermal energy yield high energy alpha particle recoil lithium nucleus . The effect alpha 7Li primarily limit boron-containing cell . Preferential uptake boron cancerous tissue achieve use boron carrier derivative phenylalanine , boronophenylalanine ( BPA ) . After administration BPA intravenous infusion , tumor site irradiated neutron , source currently nuclear reactor , like Tsing Hua Open-Pool Reactor ( THOR ) , 2MW research reactor National Tsing Hua University ( NTHU ) Taiwan . Since target radiotherapy , low complication rate BNCT obtain . However , local recurrence BNCT recurrent H &amp; N cancer report several publication . Image-guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) process frequent two three-dimensional imaging , course radiation treatment , use direct radiation therapy utilize image coordinate approve radiation treatment plan . IGRT Cone-Beam CT ( CBCT ) use On-Board Imager ( OBI ) enhance delivery improve outcome treatment create high level precision . By combine BNCT IG-IMRT , expect procure high control rate recurrent H &amp; N cancer acceptable toxicity . This study first BNCT plus IG-IMRT trial treat head neck cancer Taiwan .</brief_summary>

Pathology type like melanoma sarcoma also include . 2 . Prior conventional radiotherapy administer give disease ( except melanoma ) . 3 . Bidimensionally measurable disease MRI and/or CT scan ≦ 12 cm large dimension . 4 . Age great 18 year &lt; 80 year , ECOG performance status ≦ 2 5 . WBC &gt; 2.5 x109/L , neutrophil count &gt; 1.0 x109/L , platelet count &gt; 75x109/L , serum creatinine &lt; 1.25xULN . 6 . Informed consent sign . 7 . Tumor/normal tissue ( T/N ) ratio≧2.5 BPAPET scan . For IGIMRT : 1 . ECOG performance status ≦ 2 2 . No evidence disease progression physical examination CT simulation . 3 . Nutrition support ( feed tube and/or IV fluid ) already give dysphagia , present . 4 . Severity mucositis radiation dermatitis improve downgrading , compare find 2nd 3rd week BNCT . For BNCT : 1 . Lymphoma tumor type expect respond cancer chemotherapy dose conventional radiation therapy safely give . 2 . Patients effective standard treatment option available . 3 . Distant metastasis outside head neck region . 4 . Expecting life le 3 month . 5 . A time interval le 6 month previous radiation therapy . 6 . Prior highdose radiotherapy ( Biological Effective Dose &gt; 70 Gy/35 fraction ) give present recurrent site within one year . 7 . Patients radiation myelitis radiation necrosis brain/brain stem 8 . Time recurrence completion prior surgery le 6 month . 9 . Concurrent systemic cancer treatment include chemotherapy target therapy ( include cetuximab EGFR oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) . 10 . Severe congestive heart failure renal failure . 11 . Pregnancy 12 . Restless patient unable lie sit cast 3060 min . 13 . A cardiac pacemaker unremovable metal implant present head neck region interfere MRIbased doseplanning tumor response evaluation . For IGIMRT : 1 . Any grade IV toxicity BNCT .</criteria>
