	<criteria>Other renal impairment , subject good health determine past medical history , physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram , ( except additional inclusion criterion renal impaired patient ) . Subjects must BMI 18 kg/m2 34 kg/m2 weight least 50 kg 120 kg . Additional criterion renal impaired subject : Subjects must stable renal disease without evidence renal progressive disease define moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73m2 ) severe renal impairment ( eGFR 1529 mL/min/1.73m2 ) . Additional criterion match healthy control subject : Matched least one renal impaired subject gender , race , age ( ± 10 year ) , weight ( ± 20 % ) . An estimated GFR determine MDRD equation within normal range determine eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2 Significant illness , include infection , hospitalization within 2 week prior dose , except renal impaired subject due renal disease may affect significant medical problem require frequent hospitalization . Any surgical medical condition may significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , may jeopardize subject case participation study Subject medical history cardiac disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormality within 6 month prior screen . Subject active history within 6 month prior screen clinically significant hematologic , endocrinologic , pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic , allergic disease , medically document ( clinical condition associate renal impairment renal impaired subject ) . Additional exclusion criterion renal impaired subject : Severe albuminuria &gt; 300 mg/day . Subjects undergo method dialysis . Subjects renal impairment due hepatic disease ( hepatorenal syndrome ) . Subjects clinically significant abnormal finding , consistent clinical disease , upon physical examination , ECG laboratory evaluation . Use prescription nonprescription medication potential interact buparlisib within two week prior dose study . Additional criterion match healthy control subject : Use prescription nonprescription medication vitamins 14 day prior dose . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
