	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well paclitaxel carboplatin radiation therapy paclitaxel work treat human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -positive patient stage III-IV oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving paclitaxel carboplatin radiation therapy paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin Before Radiation Therapy With Paclitaxel Treating HPV-Positive Patients With Stage III-IV Oropharynx , Hypopharynx , Larynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival 2 year patient HPV-positive head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) receive induction chemotherapy follow dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival local-regional control patient HPV-positive HNSCC receive induction chemotherapy dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy . II . To determine incidence acute grade 3+ mucosal esophageal toxicity associate attenuated concurrent chemoradiotherapy patient HPV-positive HNSCC . III . To determine incidence late toxicity patient HPV-positive HNSCC receive dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy . IV . To estimate incidence toxicity ( hematologic non-hematologic ) associate protocol treatment patient trial . V. To estimate response rate HPV-positive induction chemotherapy use carboplatin paclitaxel . VI . To determine effect reduce radiation dose short-term long-term quality life among patient treat chemoradiotherapy . OUTLINE : INDUCTION : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : At least 2 week completion induction chemotherapy , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily 5 day week 5.5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
