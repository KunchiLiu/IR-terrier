	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced/metastatic liposarcoma , osteogenic sarcoma , Ewing/Ewinglike sarcoma soft tissue bone . This study accept diagnosis make investigator 's center . WHO Performance Status 0 , 1 2 . A maximum 1/3 patient cohorts A &amp; B may WHO performance status 2 . At least one prior line systemic therapy sarcoma diagnosis ( neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic disease ) . All acute toxic effect prior treatment resolve NCICTCAE v 4.0 Grade 1 less ( except alopecia ) time sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subject must able swallow retain oral medication . At least one site measurable disease xray/CT/MRI scan define RECIST 1.1 . Baseline image must perform within 28 day Day 1 study . Adequate organ function within 14 day registration INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) : patient prior evidence underlie abnormality coagulation parameter exist , accord write documentation treat physician Evidence progression disease define RECIST 1.1 ( i.e . new disease sit 30 % growth index lesion ) within 6 month registration Patients central nervous system disease eligible enrollment receive prior radiotherapy surgery sit CNS ( central nervous system ) metastatic disease without evidence clinical progression least 12 week therapy . Patients documentation well differentiate liposarcoma ( well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma family ) specifically exclude , owe characteristically slow growth . If high grade area suspect ( dedifferentiation ) , prove pathology analysis ( e.g . primary resection welldifferentiated liposarcoma ) , biopsy must perform demonstrate highgrade dedifferentiate disease . Prior systemic therapy small molecule oral kinase inhibitor , include limited : pazopanib , sunitinib , sorafenib , everolimus , sirolimus , vemurafenib , dasatinib . Previous assignment treatment study . Subjects permanently withdraw study participation allow reenter study . Patients progress placebo specifically allow enroll treatment arm study meet entry criterion . Concurrent , clinically significant , active malignancy within 12 month study enrollment Patients severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease opinion investigator could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Major surgery within 28 day prior study registration patient recover adequately prior surgery Patients receive wide field radiotherapy ≤ 28 day ( define &gt; 50 % volume pelvis bone equivalent ) limit field radiation palliation &lt; 14 day prior study registration patient recover adequately side effect therapy . Patients receive prior systemic therapy &lt; 14 day prior study registration recover adequately toxicity CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 1 le ; prior investigational therapy may give &lt; 5 halflives last dose treatment , &lt; 14 day , whichever great . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg [ NCICTCAE v 4.0 ] repeat measurement ) despite optimal medical management . Active clinically significant cardiac disease include : Congestive heart failureNew York Heart Association ( NYHA ) &gt; class II , Active coronary artery disease , Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy beta blocker digoxin , Unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) , new onset angina within 3 month randomization , myocardial infarction within 6 month randomization3.2.11 Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy Any hemorrhage bleeding event ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 week prior study registration Subjects thrombotic , embolic , venous , arterial event , cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month start study treatment Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection current chronic active hepatitis B C infection require treatment antiviral therapy . Ongoing infection &gt; Grade 2 NCICTCAE v 4.0 Presence nonhealing wound , nonhealing ulcer , benign bone fracture ( patient stress insufficiency fracture e.g . osteoporosis pathological fracture tumor eligible study ) Patients seizure disorder require medication Persistent proteinuria : Grade 3 NCICTCAE v 4.0 ( &gt; 3.5 g/24 h , measure urine protein : creatinine ratio random urine sample ) Interstitial lung disease ongoing sign symptoms time informed consent Pleural effusion ascites cause respiratory compromise ( ≥ NCICTCAE version 4.0 Grade 2 dyspnea ) History organ allograft ( include corneal transplant ) . Known suspected allergy hypersensitivity regorafenib , excipients formulation give course trial . Any malabsorption condition . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , make subject unsuitable trial participation . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition may interfere subject 's participation study evaluation study result . Inability comply protocol require procedure .
