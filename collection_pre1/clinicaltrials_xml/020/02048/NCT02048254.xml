	<brief_title>Study I-125 Brachytherapy Versus Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy Treat Inoperable Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target population patient inoperable salivary gland derive primary recurrent cancer , include local advanced primary salivary gland cancer could resect completely ; recurrent salivary gland cancer could resect completely ; T3/T4 tumor could tolerate surgery due severe combine disease . The subject would divide Iodine-125 radioactive seed permanent interstitial implantation brachytherapy intensity-modulated radiation therapy randomly . During follow-up period , efficacy safety index would monitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose histologically primary recurrent salivary gland cancer may occur either major salivary gland minor salivary gland . The inoperable circumstance include : Primary recurrent salivary gland cancer could resect completely could get negative incision . T3/T4 tumor patient severe medical comorbidities could accept high risk perioperative complication . At least one measurable tumor focus ( accord RESIST 1.1 Standard ) . Karnofsky score &gt; 60 . Survival time predict ≥ 3months ; HGB≥9 g/dL , WBC≥3.0×10^9/L , NEUT≥1.5×10^9/L , platelet count ( PLT ) ≥ 100×10^9/L ; TBIL≤1.5 upper limit normal , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /AST≤3 upper limit normal ; Cera≤1.5 upper limit normal . Male female fertility experiment willing take contraceptive measure . Radioactive therapy history head neck . Suffering malignant tumor recent five year , except skin basal cell carcinoma carcinoma situs cervix . Chemotherapy history . Receiving effective therapy . Distant metastasis .
