	<detailed_description>Providing patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) access remote monitoring , example telephone telemonitoring use wireless technology , reduces deaths hospitalisation may provide benefit health care cost quality life . Remote monitoring patient reduce pressure resource , particularly condition like chronic heart failure , exert large burden health service . These conclusion Cochrane Systematic Review . In Norway cost treatment chronic heart failure vast , concern hospital treatment , daily use medication year , loss quality life patient family caregiver . Generally little knowledge gain billion use . In Norway telemonitoring service establish hence investigation yet publish . Thus seem current evidence effectiveness quality insufficient recommend usage . The structure funding streams Norwegian health service different country conventional service intervention compare previous study , likely heterogeneous . It thus important investigate Norwegian condition . Advanced telemonitoring technology electronic transfer physiological data blood pressure weight currently use research establish routine service several country Europe , amongst Netherlands , Germany United Kingdom . The propose project intend introduce strategy avenue explore promise new service would otherwise available Norway . The service consist daily monitor patient ' weight blood pressure directly home ; automatically securely transmit value server UNN ; monitor value train nurse Heart polyclinic . The primary objective study thus explore whether , compare current care heart polyclinic , introduction home telemonitoring reduce hospital readmission , addition , cost-effective . This line recent direction European telemonitoring programme patient chronic heart failure . This result may define telemonitoring heart failure patient feasible Norway . Identifying successful innovation introduce Norwegian health care service condition cost effectiveness well treatment quality .</detailed_description>
