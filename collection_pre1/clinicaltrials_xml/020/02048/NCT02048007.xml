	<brief_summary>The long-term goal study precisely define role mass azithromycin treatment intervention reduce childhood morbidity increase growth , potential selection antibiotic resistance . The investigator propose set 3 cluster-randomized trial compare community randomize oral azithromycin randomize placebo . To assess generalizability intervention , investigator monitor antibiotic resistance , could potentially limit adoption mass antibiotic treatment . The investigator also assess several measure infectious disease . The investigator hypothesize mass azithromycin treatment reduce childhood morbidity accompany acceptable level antibiotic resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin : Morbidity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator assess childhood infectious disease morbidity macrolide resistance two year , compare community child age 1-60 month receive biannual oral azithromycin community child receive biannual oral placebo . In Niger , third arm - annual treatment person 1 month old - also include . Randomization Treatment Allocation . In site , 30 community within contiguous area 300,000 600,000 individual randomize azithromycin placebo arm . At Niger site , additional 15 community randomize third arm ( azithromycin everyone ) . The investigator use simple random sample separately study site , without stratification block randomization within site . These community randomize pool community eligible sister trial ( Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin ( MORDOR ) - Morbidity Study ; clinicaltrials.gov OPP1032340-A ) . Specific Aims Specific Aim 1 : To assess whether macrolide resistance great population-based community sample pre-school child , clinic-based sample ill pre-school child Specific Aim 2 : To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatment pre-school child eliminate ocular chlamydia hypoendemic area Specific Aim 3 : To assess diversity microbiome nasopharynx , oropharynx , naris , conjunctiva , gastrointestinal tract</detailed_description>
