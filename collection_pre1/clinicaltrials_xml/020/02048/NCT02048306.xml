In addition , patient ' clinical status assess wide range outcome , activity limitation result breathlessness , exercise tolerance health-related quality life . Difficulties associate caregiving experience assess family member . Dyads participate Family-based PR program also invite attend focus group immediately intervention assess perspective intervention . Descriptive statistic use characterise sample . To analyse change outcome measure , data two group compare time point . A sample size calculation use primary outcome perform base previous pilot study . It find statistically significant difference group would detect 21 dyad group . However , PR program usually considerable dropout ( around 30 % ) , 28 dyad recruit group .</detailed_description>
