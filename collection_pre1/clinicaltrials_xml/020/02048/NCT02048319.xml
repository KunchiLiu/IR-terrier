	<brief_summary>Liver cysts fluid fill cavity locate liver . They present 2-11 % general population , typically cause symptom complication . However , small subset patient complaint pain , abdominal fullness distension , dyspnea nausea occur . Currently , aspiration sclerotherapy treatment choice symptomatic patient large dominant liver cyst . However , study report early fluid reaccumulation relative high recurrence rate cyst growth aspiration sclerotherapy ultimately leading re-interventions . In respect , somatostatin analogue promise agent know volume reduce effect patient polycystic liver disease . In study investigator want evaluate effect combine aspiration sclerotherapy multi-receptor binding , long-acting somatostatin analogue Pasireotide . The investigator hypothesize administrate pasireotide aspiration sclerotherapy could prevent early fluid reaccumulation thereby result great reduction cyst diameter . Moreover , investigator expect low rate cyst recurrence subsequently low need re-interventions .</brief_summary>
