	<brief_summary>The investigator recently study marker platelet activation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) find IPF patient significantly increase platelet reactivity compare control demonstrate concentration dependent increase platelet-monocyte complex formation , platelet P-selectin expression platelet fibrinogen bind presence ` platelet agonist Adenosine diphosphate L- Threonyl- L- phenylalanyl- L- leucyl- L- leucyl- L-argininamide ( TFLLR ) . During platelet activation platelet degranulate release numerous profibrotic cytokine include Transforming growth factor beta Platelet derive growth factor recognise important pathogenesis IPF . It therefore plausible observe increased platelet reactivity IPF contribute fibrotic process local activation degranulation release proinflammatory profibrotic mediator within pulmonary circulation . There evidence corticosteroid treatment may alter platelet adhesion , study spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHR ) increase circulate glucocorticoid , suppress p-selectin expression . p selectin transmembrane protein present α granule platelet . P selectin crucial role platelet aggregation platelet-leukocyte interaction , potentially important mechanism initiation and/or progression tissue injury development thrombosis . In study patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbation treat either β agonist alone β agonist 40mg prednisolone compare control group . At presentation COPD patient higher pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) high p selectin fibrinogen level low Antithrombin III level ( AT III ) . The pulmonary artery pressure fibrinogen level find significantly decrease steroid treat group whilst p-selectin level increase non steroidal therapy patient . Rationale Current Study There significant unmet medical need treatment IPF ; medication approve treatment IPF United Kingdom ( UK ) Pirfenidone outside UK none . The main goal current study evaluate effect Fostair biomarkers platelet activation IPF disease investigator believe play pivotal role pathogenesis IPF whether translates clinically beneficial effect Fostair IPF disease .</brief_summary>
