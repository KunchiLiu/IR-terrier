	<detailed_description>Background Hemodynamic management critically ill patient constant challenge intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Commonly use monitoring parameter guide hemodynamic management generally consist measurement pressure ( systemic pulmonary artery pressure , cardiac filling pressure ) flow ( cardiac output measurement use thermodilution method ) . However , cardiac filling pressure flow data know limitation might accurately represent cardiac preload contractility . To date , continuous sequential record hemodynamic parameter limit pulse pressure variation measurement indicator dilution technique . The overall accuracy method well establish comparison measurement cardiac function parameter report trend differently response therapy show limited interdevice agreement . Hemodynamic management critically ill patient base parameter might therefore optimal delay stabilisation patient , lead negative outcome increase use resource . Visualization heart use echocardiography offer advantage direct measurement cardiac volume systolic function . Echocardiography establish tool evaluate cause hemodynamic instability ICU patient visualization cardiac chamber , valve pericardium cardiac functional abnormality . Transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) use first-line approach quick focus examination diagnose acute cor pulmonale , cardiac tamponade major leave ventricular systolic dysfunction . The training necessary reliably perform abbreviate TTE use substantial method readily available every intensivist . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) well diagnostic capability reproducible TTE . A minimum number 31 TEE examination report required intensivists achieve competence TEE drive hemodynamic evaluation ventilate ICU patient . Additionally , repeatedly insert TEE probe require serial evaluation patient hemodynamic status associate small significant risk injury oral esophageal structure . A repeated echocardiographic assessment could potentially provide useful additional information result rapid resolution hemodynamic instability . Using conventional TTE TEE , however , limit feasibility approach due lack time availability appropriately trained staff . In recently publish study feasibility hemodynamic monitoring safety hTEE demonstrate group ninety-four ventilate critically ill patient . In study hTEE examination perform four highly trained intensivist extensive expertise critically care echocardiography . The Department Intensive Care Medicine Inselspital ( KIM ) introduce hTEE January 2012 . The feasibility quality hemodynamic monitoring use hTEE department 's intensivists assess context prospective quality review assessment . The study show echocardiographic examination use hTEE sufficient quality majority examine ICU patient inter-rater reliability intensivists train cardiologist substantial . However , yet study assess impact hemodynamic monitoring hTEE relevant patient outcome available . Given associated cost hTEE device ultrasound probe additional resource requirement train application , efficacy efficiency hTEE monitor comparison standard monitoring establish . The investigated device consist newly develop , commercially available transesophageal echocardiography system . The ImaCor ClariTEE technology ( hTEE ) device produce single-plane two-dimensional image color Doppler capability ( IMACOR , New-York NY , USA ) . The ImaCor probe 5.5 mm detachable probe ; due small size remain situ 72h therefore allows reassessment patient 's hemodynamic progress effect select intervention time . The probe dispose 72h hygienic reason . The probe connect dedicate echocardiographic system allow record digital loop performance basic two-dimensional measurement area distance . It provide robust , rapid user-friendly approach monitor hemodynamic status cardiac function conventional TTE/TEE . Objective The study hypothesis hemodynamic monitoring use hTEE critically ill patient hemodynamic compromise allow expedite reversal circulatory impairment compare standard ICU monitoring . Primary Objective : To assess impact hemodynamic monitoring use ImaCor ClariTEE technology duration amount vasopressor use time reversal shock hemodynamically compromise patient comparison standard monitoring . Secondary Objective : To assess safety tolerability ImaCor ClariTEE probe . Methods Subjects assign one four group stratify method hemodynamic monitoring ( ImaCor v control hemodynamic monitoring ) frequency hemodynamic assessment ( protocolized interval PM v standard monitoring interval SM ) . In patient randomize echocardiography-guided hemodynamic management ( ImaCorPM ImaCorSM ) ImaCor ClariTEE system instal time study inclusion . An ICU consultant ass patient ' hemodynamic condition base hTEE information ( ImaCorPM SM ) available hemodynamic parameter ( ControlPM SM ) . Any change hemodynamic management record .</detailed_description>
