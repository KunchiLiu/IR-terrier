	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether drug call regorafenib might effective treat angiosarcoma . This study patient angiosarcoma gotten bad receive chemotherapy . Regorafenib type drug call kinase inhibitor . Regorafenib interfere kinase protein work . Some kinase cancer cell might normally help cancer cell grow form new blood vessel could fee grow tumor . By block protein , regorafenib may help stop growth certain cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily Oral Regorafenib Chemotherapy-Refractory , Metastatic Locally Advanced Angiosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month daily oral regorafenib ( 160 mg ) previously treat locally advanced/metastatic angiosarcoma patient SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free rate 3 6 month . II . Progression-free survival . III . Overall survival ( 5 year ) . IV . Response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] version [ v ] 1.1 ) . V. Rate duration tumor control ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) . VI . Safety/tolerability regorafenib . OUTLINE : Patients receive regorafenib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
