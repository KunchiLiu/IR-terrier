	<detailed_description>This trial part sub-project multicentre study name `` Interaction nutritional , social-behavioral metabolic factor prevention cardiovascular disease : development nutritional strategy general population '' approve Italian Ministry Health . The sub-project specifically address diet , thermogenesis obesity . 1 . Ephedrine caffeine ( EC ) combination widely use human obesity treatment , still present many herbal preparation sell widespread many country weight loss . It well know drug increase metabolic rate animal human . Ephedrine agonist α β-adrenoceptors ; moreover , induces norepinephrine release sympathetic neuron , thus sympatho-mimetic drug mixed profile . Caffeine increase norepinephrine dopamine release stimulate neuronal activity several brain region . In addition , caffeine antagonize inhibitory effect adenosine sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) . This modulation SNS activity may possible explanation thermic effect EC . In fact , epinephrine activates uncouple protein 1 ( UCP1 ) , member mitochondrial carrier localize inner mitochondrial membrane brown adipocytes . The physiological role UCP1 uncouple oxidative phosphorylation , therefore energy dissipate heat rather convert ATP . UCP1 unique brown adipocyte mitochondrion , although brown-like multilocular adipocytes express UCP1 intersperse within human WAT observe . Actually , UCP1 mRNA detect adipose tissue adult human , estimate 1 100-200 adipocytes human intraperitoneal adipose tissue express UCP1 . It show cold-induced occurrence brown-like adipocytes UCP1 require presence β3-adrenoceptor previously white adipose tissue presence β3-adrenoceptor require full stimulation energy expenditure oxygen consumption white adipose tissue . In addition UCP1 , express exclusively brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , another member mitochondrial anion carrier protein family i.e . uncoupling protein 3 ( UCP3 ) could play physiological role energy homeostasis . It express almost exclusively skeletal muscle exhibit two transcriptional isoforms : long form ( UCP3L ) short form ( UCP3S ) . A brief caloric restriction result ~2- 3-fold increase UCP3 mRNA level lean obese human . 2 . Because , small study do human investigate thermogenic effect EC compare diet , present study examine UCP3 expression skeletal muscle beta-3 adrenoceptor expression adipose tissue pre-menopausal morbidly obese female treat either placebo EC 30 day subsequently underwent bariatric surgery . 3 . Study subject adult female morbid obesity i.e . body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2 select wait list bariatric surgery Department Surgery ( Molinette Hospital , Turin , Italy . During treatment period patient feed hypocaloric diet ( total energy content ~70 % energy expenditure , measure indirect calorimetry ) , contain 20 % protein , 55 % carbohydrate , 25 % fat half monounsaturated , 35 g/day fibre . Patients randomise 30-day treatment either EC ( 200/20mg t.i.d . ) placebo . They hospitalise , whole treatment period , metabolic unit San Giuseppe Hospital-Istituto Auxologico Italiano Piancavallo ( VB , Italy ) . The EC administration start initial dose 100/10 mg t.i.d . first week proceeds full dose 200/20 mg t.i.d . Resting energy expenditure measure indirect calorimetry baseline end study . The study pill ( active compound placebo ) prepare Hospital 's Pharmacy . 4 . In order evaluate drug safety effect cardiac function , blood pressure measure three time day ; electrocardiography echocardiography record baseline every week . After diet drug period , patient transfer Department Surgery ( Molinette Hospital , Turin ) bariatric surgery . The drug treatment ( EC placebo ) stop day surgical intervention . Small biopsy rectus abdominis subcutaneous omental adipose tissue take surgery , immediately frozen liquid nitrogen , store -80°C subsequent analysis . 5 . UCP3S UCP3L mRNA level measure quantitative polymerase chain reaction Department Pharmacology , University Milan . Presence beta-3 adrenoceptor adipose tissue evaluate immunohistochemistry avidin-biotin peroxidase technique use monoclonal anti-human beta 3-adrenoceptor antibody Department Human Anatomy , University Ancona .</detailed_description>
