	<brief_title>Dovitinib Lactate , Gemcitabine Hydrochloride , Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose dovitinib ( dovitinib lactate ) administer concurrently gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) patient advance solid malignancy . II . To characterize safety profile dovitinib , gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel combination patient advance solid malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile dovitinib , nab-paclitaxel , gemcitabine metabolite administer concurrently patient advance solid malignancy . II . To determine preliminary efficacy study combination patient advance solid tumor pancreas adenocarcinoma . III . To explore serum tumor biomarkers predictive efficacy study combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dovitinib lactate . Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 5 day per week , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
