	<brief_summary>Many study show vigorous exercise increase risk develop vascular thrombotic event result sudden death immediately exercise . The outcome study bias several confound variable : subject , type exercise , duration , intensity especially method used evaluation hemostatic capacity . The goal study investigate effect strenuous exercise Calibrated Automated Thrombogram ( CAT ) assay , establish tool detect hyper- hypocoagulabilty condition . We modify CAT assay make also feasible measure TG whole blood ( WB-CAT ) , go one step closer physiology since blood cell present , also avoid centrifugation step . With study would like see whether blood cell also play role increase TG . The objective investigate effect strenuous exercise ( participation Amstel Gold Race ) coagulation haemostatic parameter . We hypothesize strenuous exercise induces prothrombotic phenotype especially test involve blood cell alter prothrombotic phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy subject take medication interfere coagulation willing donate 18 ml blood via venipuncture capillary blood drop via fingerpuncture Amstel Gold Race . Between 18 50 year age . We take 50 year maximal age prevent comorbidity could influence coagulation ( like diabetes , atherosclerosis , peripheral arterial disease , â€¦ ) . Subjects take medication interfere coagulation . Subjects cardiovascular disease serious medical problem . Subjects 18 year 50 year age . Subjects smoke .</criteria>
