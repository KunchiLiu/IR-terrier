	<detailed_description>Nowadays morbid obesity ( BMI ≥ 40kg/m² ) major problem public health industrialized country . About 500 000 patient would affected disease France 2009 . Prevalence morbid obesity raise 0.3 % ( ± 0.1 % ) population 1997 1.1 % ( ± 0.1 % ) 2009 ( Extrapolation data ObEpi 2009 French population ) ( 1 ) . For type patient , long-term effective treatment recognize scientist bariatric surgery . ( 2-4 ) Roux Y Gastric Bypass ( GBP ) consensual procedure , described sixty , indication ( approximately 11000 GBP perform FRance 2012 ( 5,6 ) . This operation consist creation proximal gastric pouch ( 50 cc ) . A Roux Y intestinal loop add create malabsorptive part . 60 80 % excess weight loss describe literature long-terms . Furthermore , improvement remission T2DM , sleep apnea syndrome , arterial hyperpressure , dyslipidemia ) emphasize many trial ( 5 , 7 ) . However 15 20 % handle patient present weight regain 5 year post surgery potentially explain dilation gastric pouch gastro jejunal anastomosis thus decrease restrictive effect . ( 8-11 ) To palliate complication two solution describe . ( 12-15 ; 19 ) The first one consist recalibration gastric poouch surgical approachy . In case , ring silicone polypropylene position around gastric pocket . Other possible solution redo new gastrojejunostomy small size , surgical access ( laparotomy laparoscopy ) . These intervention delicate important peritoneal adhesion present rate significant morbidity especially perform laparotomy . The pure medical care allow long-term result stable . ²² A therapeutic dead end report often type patient . A new possibility recently describe . ( 17-18 ) A recalibration realize suture perform endoscopic approach level gastro jejunal anastomosis gastric pouch APOLLO Endosurgery OverStitch . The digestive surgery endoscopic way rapidly expand . The first result seem promising ( resumed weight loss ) owe estimate randomized study compare new process medical conventional treatment . A single-blind , randomize , forward-looking study , multicenter , comparative two parallel group patient present weight regain GBP thus organize . The main objective estimate efficiency APOLLO Endosurgery OverStitch technique versus non-interventional strategy . The secondary endpoint study morbidity procedure , evolution quality life patient , medical economic impact innovation 24 month .</detailed_description>
