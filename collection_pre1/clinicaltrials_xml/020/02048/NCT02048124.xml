	<brief_summary>Background : There ongoing interest develop Endoscopic Ultrasound /Fine Needle Aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) needle provide tissue core biopsy true histological ( rather cytological ) evaluation . By slightly modify traditional EUS-FNA needle , new needle name `` ProCor '' develop hope obtain core sample thus increase diagnostic yield . Objective : In research project , propose conduct prospective trial compare result obtain two type needle : 25g standard needle ( 25gS ) 25g ProCor needle ( 25gP ) . EUS-FNA Biopsies obtain 25S 25P needle lesion ; randomisation sequence set order determine two needle first use ( 25S 25P ) . The cytological histological diagnosis make ; . histological diagnosis , pathologist first establish presence absence tissue core ( define measurable cylinder tissue ) . The pathologist ass adequacy specimen : cellularity ( score 1 `` poor '' ; score 2 `` good '' ; score 3 `` excellent '' ) , [ 14 ] sample bloodiness ( score 1 `` minimal '' ; score 2 `` moderate '' ; score 3 `` significant '' , presence absence malignancy ( `` positive '' / `` negative '' / `` suspicious '' / inconclusive ) . Results continuous variable summarize use mean ± SD , . categorical variable use proportion . The 25S 25P group compare use Chi-square test categorical variable , Student test continuous variablesTwo-sided p value less 0.05 consider statistically significant . Data analyze use SPSS v 15.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago IL ) statistical software .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Diagnostic Yield Solid Lesion Biopsies Performed EUS-FNA Using 25d ProCor Needle Versus Standard 25g Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives study The primary objective compare diagnostic yield biopsy perform EUS-FNA use 25d ProCor needle versus standard 25g needle . The primary outcome diagnostic yield define : sensitivity presence cancer base analysis EUS-FNA sample . The secondary objective : 1. compare size `` core '' sample produce two type needle . 2. compare incidence severity immediate complication associate two type needle Methods Design : This prospective clinical study validation new instrument ( ProCor biopsy needle ) application clinical medicine , namely diagnosis cancer . Endoscopic procedure : Informed consent patient obtain procedure single research assistant . All EUS examination perform conscious sedation ( midazolam , fentanyl ) one two experience endosonographers accord standard procedure CHUM use linear echoendoscope . , If lesion consider solid EUS-FNA consider clinically indicated safe , patient enrol randomisation envelope open . EUS-FNA Biopsies obtain 25S 25P needle lesion ; randomisation sequence set order determine two needle first use ( 25S 25P ) . EUS-FNA pass perform without stylet . One `` needle pas '' define 5 stroke 4 different area lesion . The material first 2 needle pass ( one 25S 25P ) express formalin look core sample . Material next 2 needle pass ( one 25S 25P ) express onto slide cytological analysis . Ease puncture score qualitatively poor ( scored 1 ) , good ( scored 2 ) excellent ( scored 3 ) . Immediate complication assess record nurse and/or physician procedure well procedure patient monitor recovery room least 60 minute discharge . The area investigate biopsy pancreas , retroperitoneal and/or mediastinal lymph node . Cytological Histological analysis : Samples needle pass stain use standard Papanicolaou stain analyze one experienced pathologist blind needle type . The cytological histological diagnosis make ; . histological diagnosis , pathologist first establish presence absence tissue core ( define measurable cylinder tissue ) . The pathologist ass adequacy specimen : cellularity ( score 1 `` poor '' ; score 2 `` good '' ; score 3 `` excellent '' ) , [ 14 ] sample bloodiness ( score 1 `` minimal '' ; score 2 `` moderate '' ; score 3 `` significant '' , presence absence malignancy ( `` positive '' / `` negative '' / `` suspicious '' / inconclusive ) . Diagnostic yield Diagnostic yield define sensitivity presence cancer base analysis EUS-FNA sample . The gold standard presence cancer define basis least one follow two criterion : positive cytological histological result malignant disease clinical follow ( clinical worsen radiologic evidence progression within 6 month follow FNA ) . Data collection Clinical data collect prospectively saved database . In addition demographic , include : - size location ( pancreas , lymph node , liver , adrenal gland , others ) target lesion - technical procedure variable ( FNA path , , number needle pass , needle visibility , ease puncture , needle failure , cellularity , bloodiness ) - cytological diagnosis - final diagnosis - immediate complication . Research data project-related document preserve 15 year end study . Statistical analysis Results continuous variable summarize use mean ± ( Standard Deviation ) SD , . categorical variable use proportion . The 25S 25P group compare use Chi-square test categorical variable , Student test continuous variablesTwo-sided p value less 0.05 consider statistically significant . Data analyze use SPSS v 15.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago IL ) statistical software . Sample size The sample size calculate study non-inferiority . Assuming sensitivity cancer 85 % 25S needle difference sensitivity 15 % clinically significant , sample size 112 patient per group would need ( α = 0.05 β = 0.2 ) . Since perform approximately 400 EUS-FNA biopsy solid lesion annually , . expect study could complete within approximately 6 month .</detailed_description>
