	<brief_summary>Patients heart and/or lung failure sick patient hospital system . In severe case often need long period specialist care Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) Australia New Zealand . Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) extremely specialise costly form life support , utilised patient close death last resort save life . This form life support use many year baby child relatively new adult . Whilst evidence emerge positive effect ECMO adult , lot unknown research require . Another essential therapy assist patient recovery illness provision artificial nutrition . This liquid formula deliver stomach nutritionally rich fluid provide vein . Until recently nutrition under-emphasised critically ill , however , become clear targeted nutrition positively affect person 's outcome vital long period intensive care hospitalisation . There limited data nutrition affect outcomes ECMO patient ( positive negative ) . We know limited study patient receive less nutrition patient , something particularly concern give less nutrition lead longer hospital stay link high hospital mortality . We also think adult patient ECMO need nutrition appear lose weight patient illnesses intensive care ; however confirm . It thus essential understand effect relatively simple vital therapy sick patient . This study propose collect information current feeding practice patient ECMO describe factor inhibit allow provision nutrition understand issue exist , develop strategy improve delivery nutrition determine area research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim Our primary aim : 1. describe current nutrition therapy practice 2. profile barrier enablers successful feeding patient require VV ( veno-venous ) VA ( veno-arterial ) ECMO whilst ECMO insitu 7 day post ECMO removal . Hypothesis We hypothesise patient receive VA VV ECMO receive inadequate amount predict nutrition requirement ( include energy protein ) subject frequent episode nutritional delivery interruption . Study design A 12 month prospective , observational study approximately 10 site across Australia New Zealand . Data collect commencement ECMO 7 day removal . All patient eligible study data collect primary dietitian research coordinator site . Data collection confine variable available routine practice easily available dietitian .</detailed_description>
