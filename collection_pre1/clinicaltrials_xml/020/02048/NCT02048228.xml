	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel , addition aspirin , cornerstone therapy patient suffer Acute coronary syndrome . However , platelet inhibitory response clopidogrel varies substantially among individual . Several loss-of-function polymorphism identify may influence clinical outcome patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) treat clopidogrel . Mounting evidence suggest crucial role loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 genetic variant . Carriers CYP2C19*2 allele 30 % high risk major adverse clinical event compare non-carriers . CYP2C19*2 alone also associate increased mortality stent thrombosis . These finding lead American Food Drug Administration issue box warn clopidogrel state poor metabolizers may receive full benefit drug . Thus , routine genotyping context dual anti-platelet therapy necessary . Individual dual anti-platelet treatment feasible give presence treatment alternative ticagrelor dependent gene-based metabolic activation demonstrate great clinical efficacy clopidogrel . Individualized administration ticagrelor may potential successfully minimize adverse ischemic event . 200 patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome stable coronary artery disease eligible enrollment . Patients randomly assign strategy genotyping ( use Taqman genotyping method ) standard treatment . CYP2C19*2 carrier give 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily , non-carriers patient standard treatment group give 75 mg clopidogrel daily . At end 5 day antiplatelet treatment , efficacy treatment strategy evaluate use light transmittance aggregometry ( LTA ) method .</detailed_description>
