The standard treatment use one two blood pressure medicine , either ACE inhibitor ARB . However , medicine always completely effective stopping/reversing kidney disease . Some study previously suggest another type medicine , call sitagliptin , normal use treat diabetes may also help prevent diabetic kidney disease get bad . This study perform test effectiveness sitagliptin compare placebo , along stable dose ACE inhibitor ARB , determine whether reduce protein level urine . Protein level urine marker severity kidney disease .</brief_summary>
