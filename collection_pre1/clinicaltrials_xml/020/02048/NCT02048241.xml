	<detailed_description>Aggressive child often alienate parent , separate peer , place special education segregate aggressive child . While predatory ( i.e . plan , goal direct , reward driven ) aggression responsive pharmacologic treatment , non predatory ( impulsive , paranoid , irritable ) aggression ( DSM-IV-TR `` Intermittent Explosive Disorder '' ) often . Intermittent Explosive Disorder characterize discrete episode failure resist aggressive impulse result serious assault destruction property . In child , due limit ability damage hurt others , seriousness aggressive impulse indicate ( ) frequency severity tantrum ( b ) fact severity proportion provocation , ( c ) intent damage hurt present ( ) pattern event cause impairment . The level aggression study equivalent moderate severe Oppositional Defiant Disorder severity due tantrum rather passive aggression ( Modified Overt Aggression Score 15-50 ) . For 20 year blood pressure medication , guanfacine ( Tenex ) , also use impulse control ( e.g . Attention Deficit Disorder , Tourette 's Syndrome ) calm sympathetic nervous system hyper-aroused ( e.g . opiate nicotine withdrawal ] . Both impulsivity hyper arousal also promote intermittent explosive aggression . If guanfacine treat impulsivity hyper arousal , logical ask guanfacine treat intermittent explosive aggression . Shire Pharmaceuticals modify guanfacine molecule create long acting preparation ( Intuniv ) FDA recently judge safe effective Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) child age 6-17 . Secondary analysis data pivotal study lead indication reveal ADHD child , Intuniv also reduce oppositional-defiant symptom . Better impulse control ( ADHD child ) and/or decrease sympathetic arousal ( common intermittent explosive aggression ) plausible explanation . This Investigator Sponsor Protocol ( ISP ) seek replicate prospectively anti-aggression finding . Since Intuniv could benefit non-ADHD aggressive child , child mild moderate Intermittent Explosive Disorder eligible . Anti-psychotic anti-convulsant medication ( current treatment Intermittent Explosive Disorder ) serious side effect ( weight gain , metabolic syndrome ) always effective . Intuniv neither stimulant , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant . Intuniv FDA approve treatment Intermittent Explosive Disorder . In addition medication placebo , child receive modify form Parent Management Training , standard psychotherapy oppositional symptom , administer child psychiatrist . It address coercive reciprocal social interaction characterize microenvironment oppositional child . Fifty child , age 6-12 Intermittent Explosive Disorder randomly assign eight week double blind Intuniv plus Parent Management Training placebo Parent Management Training . Titrated four week maximum dose 4 mgs .09-.12 mgs/kg/day , maintain dose four week . At end treatment , treat physician break blind offer open label treatment eight week .</detailed_description>
