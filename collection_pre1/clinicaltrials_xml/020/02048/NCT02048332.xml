	<brief_summary>In research study , want learn use donor-derived cytotoxic T-cells ( CTLs ) treat viral infection occur allogeneic stem cell transplant . A cytotoxic T cell T lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) kill cell infected ( particularly virus ) . Allogeneic mean stem cell come another person . These CTLs cell specially design fight virus infection happen bone marrow transplant . We ask people undergone undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant enroll research study , viral infection common problem allogeneic stem cell transplant cause significant complication include death . Stem cell transplant reduce person 's ability fight infection . There increase risk get new viral infection reactivation viral infection patient past , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) adenovirus ( ADV ) . There anti-viral medicine available treat CMV , EBV ADV infection , though patient respond standard treatment . Moreover , treatment viral infection expensive time consuming , family often administer prolonged treatment intravenous anti-viral medication , patient require prolonged admission hospital . The medicine also side effect like damage kidney reduction blood count , study try find easy way treat infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The stem cell match donor ask give u blood donation CTLs generation . In laboratory , treat blood sample select cell help fight virus . The cell grow special piece DNA ( vector ) make cell effective fighting virus . We grow cell laboratory stock virus fight cell patient use future . We freeze cell store freezer laboratory . If patient sign virus blood transplant give cell help fight infection . If sign cell help fight infection , may give cell . The patient may get cell 4 time , one month treatment . If patient show sign virus , cell stay freezer . Following CTL infusion , ( ) monitor physical exam daily inpatient weekly outpatient well blood test twice weekly inpatient weekly outpatient 30 day last infusion cell . The patient 2 teaspoon ( 10 mL ) blood drawn cell infusion week infusion 4 week month possible 1 year last infusion , monitor viral response .</detailed_description>
