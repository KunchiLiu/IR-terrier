	<brief_title>Tablet-guided Versus Freehand ( Tab-Guide ) Ventriculostomy : Study Protocol Test Accuracy Ventriculostomy Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Design The Tablet-guided versus freehand ventriculostomy ( TABGUIDE ) study perform 2-arm randomize control single-center trial compare intervention group use guide placement ventricular catheter control group receive standard ( free-hand ) ventriculostomy blind endpoint ( catheter tip location ) assessment . Setting The present study compliance Helsinki Declaration . The protocol study approve Ethics Committee Human Research ( CER ) Medical Faculty University Geneva , Switzerland ( reference number : CER 13-175 ) . At planned start study 01 . March 2014 , study center start randomization . Randomization The randomization start soon possible consent study obtain . Any patient meeting inclusion criterion violate exclusion criterion may participate TABGUIDE study randomize either guide freehand ventriculostomy , thus define two distinct group `` guide `` `` freehand `` . Online randomization perform treat physician study center use permuted block , ensure equal number patient study arm . Interventions - Surgical technique The study conduct neurosurgical department swiss single center university hospital adult patient indication ventricular drainage ( hydrocephalus , slit ventricle , pseudotumor cerebri ) . Data management monitoring perform Geneva study center statistical analysis one author ( NS ) . For guidance , easy-to handle instrument assist mini-I-pad ( mini-tablet ) application software ( Apple Inc. ) use order achieve precise placement ventricular catheter every-case basis . The catheter may place external drainage internal ( ventriculoperitoneal , VP ) shunting . For patient guide group , catheter placement perform operating theatre anesthesia routine sterile condition antibiotic prophylaxis . The phone-assisted technique use guide place ventricular catheter burr hole previously describe detail . The difference use easy-to-use portable mini-tablet available neurosurgeon instead phone . In brief , patient position draped typical sterile fashion ventriculostomy ( necessary enlarge shunt placement ) . Using standard adult perforator ( 14 mm ; AESCULAP , Germany ) , frontal burr hole make . The guide instrument consist base three pin order rigidly place bone surface burr hole . A semicircular guide rod mount base angle scale engrave . Within guide rod , tube individually adjust one orientation different angulation range -600 600 . Different tube design inner diameter 2 , 2.5 , 3 mm order guide catheter different size . At respective angle adjustment , tube fix guide rod mount screw . The base open one side enable view insert instrument towards low open tube . The guide tool position parallel midline along engraved linear marking base instrument . Thereby , rectangular insertion towards sagittal convexity individual insertion angle towards coronal tangent entry point establish via tube . After dura opening , appropriate trajectory choose , catheter insert accord precalculated insertion angle . After tactile feedback enter ventricle , stylet remove . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) drainage ensure ventricular catheter sufficiently place . Catheters deem suboptimally place reposition necessary . We rely length marking ventricular catheter , possible , flow distal catheter ensure catheter move fixation skin continue provide conduit CSF . The remainder possibly follow shunt procedure connection Ommaya reservoir perform standard technique . The classical freehand technique use anatomical landmark catheter place anterior horn lateral ventricle burr hole anterior coronal suture pupillary line ( level Kocher ` point , point surface cranium 2.5 cm midline 1 cm anterior coronal suture ) . The target ipsilateral frontal horn anterior foramen Monroe avoid chorioid plexus . The right nondominant side prefer . The catheter direct freehand use external landmark coronar plane towards ipsilateral medial canthus sagittal plane external auditory meatus . A post-procedural CT scan brain perform within 24 hour part standard care postoperative control earlier case postoperative CSF drainage problem . Mini-Tablet application Regular digital imaging ( DICOM ) view software , commonly use clinic , evaluate radiological imaging , integrate simple measurement tool ( e.g . distance angle measurement ) . This technique use define trajectory entry point frontal paramedian convexity towards foramen Monroe coronal section . Then , measurement take determine angle trajectory respective tangent entry point skull surface . An I-Phone ( Apple Inc. , USA ) software application available use , import anonymous image material . This image coronal section lateral ventricle show level anterior commissure . The next step define paramedian entry point surface skull tap finger respective spot . Then , two foot virtually place skull surface . A rectangular trajectory orientation tube show dotted line shift necessary . The angle deviation rectangular insertion give software value . In addition , finger may place target within ventricle , length catheter give distance value . As alternative , CT scan ( level : coronal section lateral ventricle show level anterior commissure ) photograph use angle calculation . Consent procedure Patients capable consenting inform study detail may may agree participate . If patient his/her legal representative refuse consent inclusion advice independent physician , patient 's study participation longer possible . In case , however , patient his/her legal representative ask give consent evaluation already acquire data . The detailed explanation study patient , legal representative carry use appropriate explanation word depend previous medical knowledge respective person her/his level education . During explanation , respective person ask regular basis she/he understand conveyed information question arise . In addition verbal explanation patient/legal representative give leaflet contain study detail . After read leaflet respective person give much time she/he demand decision study participation . This study evaluate outcome intervention perform often emergency situation . Since approximately half patient able give inform consent admission , informed consent procedure study delay so-called emergency procedure . If neither patient capable give informed consent family representative ( informed consent ) available due time , independent neurosurgeon involve patient 's treatment trial may ask study approval . This option introduce consent procedure data smart-phone guide ventriculostomy suggest potentially beneficial effect measure patient - however perform small group 35 patient . Therefore shall categorically withhold patient capable decide whether participate study legal representative . As soon legal representative / family representative available and/or patient capable consent study , must ask give informed consent . Sample Size Analysis Sample size analysis estimate ( hit miss rate ) base result observational study . In recent single center study group accuracy ventricular catheter placement , use anatomic landmark versus neuronavigation CT-laser guidance , ventricle hit 69.2 % catheter insertion ( 31 % miss rate ) use anatomical landmark ( non-assisted ) , compare 82.3 % use guidance ( neuronavigation CT-guidance , p=0.043 ) ( submit data ) . The placement non-assisted significantly likely place extraventricularly use guidance ( OR 3.73 , 95 % , Confidence Interval ( CI ) 1.24 , 11.19 , p=0.019 ) . Given data retrospective study ventricular catheter ( context ventricular-peritoneal shunt ) , similar rate 25-45 % 4-7 malpositioning described . To detect decrease incidence malpositioning 35 % 20 , 151 patient two study arm need gain power 80 % , use alpha error 5 % . The final plan study size include randomize 302 patient .
