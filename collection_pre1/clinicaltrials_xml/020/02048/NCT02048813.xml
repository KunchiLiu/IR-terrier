	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study ibrutinib rituximab see well work compare fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab treat patient untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine phosphate cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . It yet know whether fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab may work good ibrutinib rituximab treat patient untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Rituximab Compared With Fludarabine Phosphate , Cyclophosphamide , Rituximab Treating Patients With Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability Ibrutinib-based induction therapy prolong progression free survival ( PFS ) compare standard fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) chemoimmunotherapy young patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient base treatment arm . II . Monitor assess toxicity treatment Ibrutinib-based induction relative standard FCR chemotherapy . III . To compare quality life ( QOL ) CLL patient first 6 month treatment among patient receive Ibrutinib-based induction therapy relative standard FCR chemoimmunotherapy . IV . To compare QOL long-term CLL patient receive continuous therapy use Ibrutinib CLL patient complete FCR therapy . V. Determine effect pretreatment clinical biological characteristic ( e.g . disease stage , immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene [ IGHV ] mutation status , fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) clinical outcome ( e.g . complete response , PFS ) different arm . VI . Determine minimal residual disease ( MRD ) status assess flow cytometry different time point treatment effective surrogate marker prolong PFS overall survival . VII . Compare genetic abnormality dynamic intra-clonal architecture CLL patient treatment chemoimmunotherapy ( CIT ) non-CIT approach explore relationship treatment resistance . VIII . Explore effect FCR Ibrutinib-based therapy T-cell immune function . IX . Conduct confirmatory validation genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) associate efficacy toxicity fludarabine-based therapy prior Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) analysis E2997 trial . X . Evaluate ability prognostic model incorporate clinical biologic character predict response therapy clinical outcome ( PFS , OS ) . XI . Evaluate signal network downstream B-cell receptor patient receive Ibrutinib-based therapy . XII . Collect relapse sample study mechanism resistance FCR Ibrutinib-based therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 1 ( day 1 2 course 2 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 7 course . In absence disease progression , patient may continue ibrutinib PO QD . ARM B : Patients receive rituximab see Arm A fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 year .</detailed_description>
