	<detailed_description>- 180 patient suffer active Crohn 's disease evidence mucosal ulceration evaluate take GLPG0634 match placebo daily addition stable background treatment . The population include 50 % anti-TNF naïve patient 50 % subject previously expose anti-TNF . - The study consist 2 part , total treatment duration 20 week . Randomisation Part 1 stratify accord subject 's previous anti-TNF exposure , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level Screening oral corticosteroid use Day -1 . However , Week 10 , subject re-randomized automatically stratify accord subject 's clinical response ( reduction Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) 100 point ) , previous anti-TNF exposure corticosteroid use Day -1 receive GLPG0634 200 mg q.d. , 100 mg q.d . dos , match placebo q.d . blind fashion . In Part 2 , continue study Week 20 . - As efficacy parameter , ability achieve clinical response remission , endoscopic response &amp; remission well mucosal heal GLPG0634 give daily compare placebo evaluate 10 week treatment . In subject achieve clinical remission Week 10 , maintenance remission assess Part 2 study . - During course study , patient also examine side effect may occur ( safety tolerability ) , amount GLPG0634 present blood ( Pharmacokinetics ) well effect GLPG0634 disease- mechanism action-related parameter blood stool ( Pharmacodynamics ) determine . Also , effect different dos dose regimen GLPG0634 administration subject ' quality life evaluate .</detailed_description>
