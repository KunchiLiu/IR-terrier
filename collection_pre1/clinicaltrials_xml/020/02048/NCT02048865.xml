	<brief_summary>Cancer patient increase risk develop blood clot vein compare non-cancer patient . Cancer patient develop blood clot lead reduce life expectancy , delayed cancer treatment , decrease quality life . Prevention effective way decrease complication associate blood clot vein . Although previous clinical trial show benefit use medication prevent blood clot vein ambulatory cancer patient , study inconclusive demonstrate exist blood thinner significantly reduce rate blood clot cancer patient . One possible explanation relate fact study include large proportion cancer patient low risk develop blood clot vein . We propose identify cancer patient high risk develop blood clot use validated tool time cancer diagnosis . The identified high risk cancer patient ask participate trial test safety efficacy new oral medication use prevent blood clot patient undergo surgery . We enrol 574 patient 7 Canadian center ( Ottawa , Halifax , Montreal , Vancouver , Sault Ste . Marie , Toronto Hamilton ) . 287 patient receive study drug 287 receive inactive substance . Analysis perform assess safety superiority study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients hold malignancy 7 28-fold high risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) non-cancer patient ( 1 ) . Since cancer patient currently treat outpatient setting , acute episode VTE important implication care due effect reduce life expectancy , high rate VTE recurrence , therapeutic failure , delay chemotherapy risk bleeding anticoagulation . The best treatment acute episode VTE prevention ( thromboprophylaxis ) . Although previous clinical trial show benefit use thromboprophylaxis ambulatory cancer patient , study inconclusive convincingly demonstrate exist anticoagulant significantly reduce rate VTE cancer patient . Possible explanation relate fact study include large number cancer patient whose risk VTE low consequence , benefit anticoagulation become dilute large proportion low risk cancer patient . To increase success thromboprophylaxis cancer outpatient , propose , first , include validate method predict risk VTE time cancer diagnosis ( 2 , 3 ) . This strategy facilitate identify cancer patient high-risk VTE , optimize risk-to benefit ratio anticoagulation . Second , ass safety efficacy new oral anticoagulant cancer patient represent attractive alternative extend use thromboprophylaxis . As choice , new oral agent administer fixed dos , require laboratory monitoring , minimal interaction additional drug provide pain free alternative patient require injection . Reference List 1 .
