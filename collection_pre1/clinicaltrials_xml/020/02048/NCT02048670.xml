	<brief_summary>This pilot study focus assistance external prosthetic device , BalanceBeltTM provide : 1 ) assessment 2 ) treatment patient Chronic Subjective Dizziness ( CSD ) . The BalanceBelt sensitive detector movement anterior/posterior medial/lateral plane provide person wear device vibro-tactile feedback person orientation respect gravity . The device full self contain device comfortably wear around waist light weight shirt . The device non-FDA approve final stage beta test . Patients CSD permanent vestibular deficit , underutilize vestibular signal develop visual somatosensory dependence . The investigator expect BalanceBeltTM reset error provide patient reliable motion stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : Hypothesis : # 1The use BalanceBelt™ provide differential information body sway movement specific clinical balance gait task patient CSD currently available routine measure . Hypothesis : # 2 The use BalanceBelt™ provide rapid rate reduction patient symptom compare historical data traditional habituation therapy method . Aims , purpose , objective : # 1 Motion detector contain BalanceBeltTM use record information subtle change posture gait think occur patient CSD tactors turn . The goal portion study improve diagnostic strategy CSD . Aims , purpose , objective : # 2 In second portion study investigator test benefit one week intensive rehabilitation program use BalanceBeltTM tactors activate 10 patient CSD . The goal study develop treatment quicker effective current therapy . Background : Chronic subjective dizziness ( CSD ) second common condition identify patient refer Mayo Clinic persistent dizziness . The investigator manage nearly 500 patient CSD year . CSD syndrome persistent non-vertiginous dizziness unsteadiness may worsen patient ' motion , exposure challenge visual stimulus busy shop area , performance precision visual task read . CSD develop 25 % patient follow medical event acutely disrupt balance . Once establish , CSD may last many year , even problem trigger resolve . As result , CSD cause considerable distress functional impairment , even extent work disability disruption family social life . Over last decade , Mayo Clinic Integrated Neurotology team , investigator around world develop two treatment strategy CSD . One use serotonergic medication sertraline ( Zoloft ) venlafaxine ( Effexor ) . The variation vestibular balance exercise know vestibular habituation . These therapy reduce symptom 60-80 % patient administered expert field . However , important shortcoming . They time-consuming , take minimum 2-3 month diligent treatment achieve best result . They usually achieve partial reduction symptom , improve patient ' functioning , fall short cure . They make patient bad , rather well , use clinician unfamiliar . A new theory alter postural control mechanism CSD suggests could diagnose accurately treated quickly use external vestibular prosthesis enhance sensory feedback vestibular exercise . A suitable prosthesis BalanceBeltTM , currently final beta test BalanceTek , company develop . This device show efficacy reduce sway behavior patient bilateral vestibular hypofunction . For patient deficient vestibular system belt provide information miss lack vestibular system cue detect sway lean behavior , hence draw attention information miss . The BalanceBeltTM comfortable , self-contained unit worn light weight shirt around waist . It sensitive motion detector small tactors vibrate skin four location provide information posture motion . Patients CSD permanent vestibular deficit , underutilize vestibular signal develop visual somatosensory dependence . The investigator expect BalanceBeltTM reset error provide patient reliable motion stimulus . The investigator propose two preliminary study use BalanceBeltTM patient CSD . In first study , investigator use motion detector contain BalanceBeltTM record information subtle change posture gait think occur patient CSD . This goal study improve diagnostic strategy CSD . The investigator compare postural movement record BalanceBeltTM tactors turn quiet stance , normal walking ( Dynamic Gait Index ) , functional reach test , Sensory Organization Test 10 patient CSD 10 age gender match normal individual . In second study , investigator test benefit one week intensive rehabilitation program use BalanceBeltTM tactors activate 10 patient CSD . The goal study develop treatment quicker effective current therapy . Study Design : For Hypothesis aim # 1 : Ten consecutive patient , age 25-70 year , diagnose CSD completion routine evaluation Dizziness Balance disorder laboratory evaluation Behavioral Medicine program dizziness , would recruit participation study . If patient agree participate patient individually place follow evaluation wear BalanceBelt™ tactors turn record element turn . Each test standard evaluation tool use Vestibular Balance Laboratory routine basis : 1 . Dynamic Gait Index - evaluate gait normal walking condition head turn , walk around two object floor , step shoe box , walk different speed , walk stop 180 degree turn , walk 3 standard step hand rail . During evaluation physical therapist audiologist guard subject time walk subject subject wear harness use test # 3 hand grab prevent fall . 2 . Functional Reach Test - subject stand stationary position reach single arm far without take step . Here physical therapist audiologist guard patient performance test , subject harness use # 3 hand grab prevent fall . 3 . Sensory Organization Test - 6 condition standard evaluation balance control perform dynamic platform record sway movement A/P dimension sensory input proprioception vision vary platform visual surround movement . The subject wear full chest harness fasten roll bar subject prevent fall . For patient age gender match normal ( ± 5 year ) volunteer go evaluation . The time test take 45 minute . Normal subject recruit write advertisement visitor / accompany person patient Mayo Clinic . Each normal subject go office vestibular examination consist direct monitoring nystagmus position gaze without visual fixation present . Patients also undergo head thrust test visual fixation present headshake test visual fixation absent . Pursuit saccade office examination perform hear screen pure tone . If abnormality reveal screen normal volunteer advise formal testing perform via primary care physician also notify . For Hypothesis aim # 2 : Ten consecutive patient , age 25-70 year , diagnose CSD live within 30 minute drive time Rochester Mayo campus ask participate habituation therapy activity typically use treatment CSD intensive treatment program use exercise home first week . The patient use BalanceBelt™ tactors activate . The typical therapy evaluation pre-therapy take addition Visual Analog Scales related intensity symptom provoke visual motion , head movement walk visually complex environment . These measure take end first week intensive therapy return visit check exercise activity prior continue progressive home treatment . The one week intensive therapy perform prior start recommend medication medication change CSD . The therapy conduct one Physical Therapists certify Vestibular Balance therapy . Following intensive therapy patient continue therapy activity medication trial standard currently CSD patient . Data Analysis : Statistical Considerations Power Statement : Power analysis use pilot study . Data Analysis Plan : For Hypothesis aim # 1 : The outcome parameter BalanceBelt™ represent total amount sway sway activity A/P M/L direction compare CSD patient normal age match volunteer via Wilcoxon rank-sum test mean comparison . For Hypothesis aim # 2 : The visual analog scale score pre &amp; post one week intensive therapy compare 10 subject use also Wilcoxon test mean comparison . Endpoints As pilot study fix endpoint use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject population : 20 patient diagnosis Chronic Subjective Dizziness ( CSD ) 10 normal volunteer . Subjects 2570 year age inclusive pregnant woman may participate . Patients CSD primary diagnosis cause balance dizziness complaint provide Behavioral Medicine Program Dizziness , division Department Psychiatry &amp; Psychology . Normal volunteer negative history otologic &amp; neurologic disorder history dizziness balance problem . Normal volunteer normal finding screen office examination peripheral central vestibular system involvement ( see method detail examination ) screen normal symmetrical hearing loss explainable origin . Patients positive indication test peripheral and/or central vestibular system involvement felt influence symptom report beyond CSD alone . Patients mobility restriction would prevent participate test intensive therapy trial . Subjects hear impairment interferes oral communication .</criteria>
