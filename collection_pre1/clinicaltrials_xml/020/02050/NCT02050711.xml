	<brief_summary>The effect pulmonary rehabilitation patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) base systemic outcome measure , however , little known effectiveness intervention patient ' lung function . The forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , despite gold standard assess lung function COPD , poorly responsive pulmonary rehabilitation . Thus , objective responsive outcome measure assess effect pulmonary rehabilitation lung function need . Computerized respiratory sound found sensitive indicator , detect characterize severity respiratory disease measure , however potential detect change pulmonary rehabilitation never explore . Therefore , study aim assess effect pulmonary rehabilitation characteristic computerize respiratory sound patient COPD . A randomize control study one group undergo pulmonary rehabilitation ( n=25 ) group receive standard care ( n=25 ) conduct . The pulmonary rehabilitation program include exercise training ( 3*week ) psychoeducation ( 1*week ) . Computerized respiratory sound , lung function , exercise capacity , quadriceps muscle strength , health-related quality life health service use assessed group , baseline , immediately post-intervention follow-up ( 3 6 month PR ) . Descriptive inferential statistic use . It expect significant change occur characteristic computerized respiratory sound patient enrol pulmonary rehabilitation group , comparison patient receive standard care . Thus , computerized respiratory sound could provide simple , objective non-invasive measure ass lung function change pulmonary rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
