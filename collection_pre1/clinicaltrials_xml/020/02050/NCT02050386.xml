	<brief_title>The Brain Alerting Mechanism Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two part involve study : Part # 1- Paperwork , Computer-based cognitive test , Physical function test , EEG record - Potential participant pre-screened time initial phone call sure fit guideline research study . - Participants give Informed Consent document . This Informed Consent review private location ; participant give much time participant need consider enrol study . Participants may want discus information friend family . Participants may ask question time study visit . - If participant choose sign form , agree participate , participant screen inclusion/exclusion factor related MRI scanning . All woman age 62 give pregnancy test , base urine sample . - Investigators review detailed Medical History form participant , ask question participant participant family 's medical history . - Investigators ask participant complete brief physical activity questionnaire ask question participant daily level physical activity . - Participants ask complete several computer task meant measure participant cognitive ability ( like memory attention ) , take 30 minute . - Participants also ask complete short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) , look participant ability sit stand , walk short distance , balance , take 30 minute . - Participants also ask participate EEG recording session . An EEG cap , select participant head size , place participant head . The cap contain small electrode record participant brain electrical activity . During part study , participant sit comfortable chair watch picture computer screen , listen sound headphone , rest . This take 1 hour . - Participants also ask undergo cold pressor test ( CPT ) and/or sham stimulation . CPT involve immerse either participant hand foot cold water one minute . Sham stimulation involve immerse either hand foot room temperature water one minute . - Finally , participant transport someone involve study ( passenger van golf cart ) McKnight Brain Institute MRI Center . Or , participant prefer , next portion visit schedule another day . Part # 2- MRI Scan The following procedure take place Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center McKnight Brain Institute- MRI brain scan , do day Part # 1 , different day participant schedule convenience . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure allow doctor look inside body use scanner sends strong magnetic field radio wave . This procedure use routinely medical care safe people , participant monitor entire MRI scan case problem occur . The risk MRI : - The MRI scanner contain strong magnet . Therefore , participant may able MRI participant type metal implanted participant body , example , pace device ( heart pacer ) , metal participant eye , certain type heart valves brain aneurysm clip . Someone ask participant question participant MRI . - There much room inside MRI scanner . Participants may uncomfortable participant like close space ( `` claustrophobia '' ) . During procedure , participant able talk MRI staff speaker system , , event emergency , participant tell stop scan . - The MRI scanner produce loud hammer noise , produce hearing loss small number patient . Participants give earplug reduce risk .</detailed_description>
