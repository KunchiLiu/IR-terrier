	<brief_summary>Injecting local anesthetic anesthetize nerve group nerve ( 'nerve block ' ) effective way eliminate pain surgery . There instance would beneficial patient nerve block resolve quickly rather wait naturally wear . For example , sciatic nerve block freeze low leg foot typically take 18 hour resolve , surgeon patient prefer motor function discharge . The investigator wish perform randomize , control trial determine infusion solution saline 'wash ' nerve block surgery allow patient pain-free still able move leg foot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale Peripheral nerve block provide effective surgical anesthesia target specific body region avoid unpleasant side-effects general anesthesia . Additionally , infusion local anesthetic ( LA ) solution perineural catheter provide superior analgesia compare opioid painkiller reduces incidence opioid-associated side effect . Most study date focus efficacy agent extend block duration , thereby maximize pain relief patient receive nerve block . However , occasion rapid effective block reversal need . For example , interscalene brachial plexus block upper extremity surgery frequently cause paralysis diaphragm due inadvertent anesthesia phrenic nerve . A method 'wash ' local anesthetic around phrenic nerve case would beneficial , especially patient pre-existing pulmonary respiratory disease . Saline washout LA may additional safety benefit since LAs myotoxic ; reduce exposure muscle LA solution maintain anesthesia would increase safety peripheral nerve block . Several study demonstrate epidural washout use normal saline ( NS ) Ringer 's lactate follow epidural block facilitates rapid recovery motor function sensation let block resolve . However , study date address whether washout effective reversal peripheral nerve block . Our limited clinical experience suggest bolus NS perineural catheter rapidly effectively restore phrenic nerve function follow interscalene block , preliminary laboratory experiment indicate continuous washout 0.9 % NS reduce half time require normal diaphragm function follow injection lidocaine around phrenic nerve . Unclear , however , mechanism NS able resolve block . Thus , investigator wish investigate optimal approach block reversal resolution . Study objective To demonstrate infusion NS use clinical set modify property nerve block patient receive nerve block surgery post-operative analgesia . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize NS deliver perineural catheter 'wash ' nerve block point motor function restore maintain anesthesia sensory nerve fiber . Procedure Using seal envelope system ( see ) , patient recruit study randomize Control Study group . Baseline motor sensory function assess record ( see method ) . Control group patient undergo ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block describe previously . A bolus 20 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine/0.5 % bupivacaine deliver catheter-over-needle unit ( e.g. , B.Braun Contiplex C equivalent ) provide surgical anesthesia low extremity . After withdraw needle , catheter leave place throughout operation provide conduit deliver rescue analgesia require ( see criterion ) . Patients Study group undergo procedures surgery . After surgery , patient bring recovery room assessment motor function sensation anesthetize region . Study group patient receive washout infusion regimen ( e.g. , continuous infusion 3 mL per hour 3 mL bolus 0.9 % NS ) . Control group patient receive infusion solution , run 1 mL/hr maintain catheter patency . After patient transfer ward , motor sensory assessment ( see ) perform hourly full motor function return . Once motor function return completely , washout infusion stop . The patient monitor sensory function hourly maximum 8 hour first dose oral pain medication rescue analgesia require . If patient 's pain score ( determine Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) score 0-10 , 0 = pain 10 = worst pain ever ) &gt; 5 , patient complain severe pain , nerve block reinitiated deliver bolus local anesthetic mixture catheter . A member clinical research team follow patient every 24 hour post-surgery ( maximum 72 hour discharge hospital , whichever happen first ) record motor sensory data pain score . Sensory motor assessment Sensory assessment perform measure current perception threshold ( CPT ) use Neurometer ( Neurotron , Inc. , Baltimore , MD , USA ) , validated device sensory assessment . The investigator experience use Neurometer CPT measurement able perform sensory assessment device easily efficiently . Briefly , pair adhesive electrode ( Neotrode II , ConMed Corp. , Utica , NY , USA ) connect Neurometer attach big toe ankle leg block . The Neurometer set three different frequency - 2000 Hz , 250 Hz , 5 Hz - stimulate Aβ ( large fiber/motor ) , Aδ ( large fiber/pain ) , C ( small fiber/pain ) fiber , respectively . A member research team increase current manually patient report feel `` electrical '' sensation area electrode attach . The reading time record CPT . The data collector also note current reach maximum level , define complete sensory blockade . Motor function assess record voluntary motor response low extremity . The investigator grade plantar flexion dorsiflexion foot base follow scale : 0 = normal movement , 1 = decrease movement , 2 = movement . Motor block deem complete score 2 record plantar flexion dorsiflexion . This grade scale describe assessment motor function follow popliteal sciatic nerve block . Data recording analysis The clinical research team member record patient demographic information ( age , height , weight , gender ) , NRS score surgery , information nerve block infusion regimen . This individual also assess motor function ass sensory response ( see ) . Data record data sheet transfer Excel spreadsheet statistical analysis . Comparisons group perform Student 's t-test . Qualitative data report either absolute number percentage analyze Chi-square analysis Fisher 's exact test , whichever appropriate . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Sample size calculation The primary endpoint study time return full motor activity . Several report demonstrate popliteal sciatic nerve block average duration 14-16 hour . Our preliminary result phrenic nerve block suggest , follow bolus washout solution , time recovery reduce approximately 50 % versus time spontaneous recovery . The investigator assume conservatively 70 % Study group ( washout ) patient 25 % Control group patient full motor activity pain 8 hour . Using parameter α value 0.05 β value 0.2 , determine 19 patient per group ( 38 total ) require demonstrate statistically significant difference . To compensate study protocol violation and/or loss follow-up , 20 patient recruit group ( 40 total ) . Randomization Prior subject recruitment , member study team involve data collection create series 40 slips paper indicate allocation group ( Study Control ) intervention ( washout regimen control ( 1 mL/hr infusion ) regimen ) . The slip put random order place opaque envelope . The envelope seal number sequentially . During study , patient return post-anesthesia recovery room , attend regional anesthesiologist open envelope determine intervention patient receive . If anesthesiologist PI , remove area colleague initiate infusion . Blinding Both investigator participant blind study . Investigators blind one member study team collect data another study team member analyze data . All study participant nerve block catheter connect infusion pump ; however , Study group patient receive washout regimen . Control group patient solution run 1 mL/hr maintain catheter patency . The pump display show infusion rate mask tape opaque cover prevent patient data collector know patient 's allocation group .</detailed_description>
