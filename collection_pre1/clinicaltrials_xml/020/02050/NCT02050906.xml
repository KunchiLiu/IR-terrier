	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare effect intensive lifestyle intervention standard care treatment functional limitation ( FL ) , body composition ( BC ) , quality life ( QOL ) prostate cancer ( PC ) patient androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . II . To determine feasibility deliver intensive lifestyle exercise dietary intervention PC patient undergoing ADT . III . To identify intermediate variable account beneficial effect lifestyle intervention functional limitation QOL . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : EXERCISE COMPONENT : Patients undergo 1 hour intensive exercise comprise 30 minute aerobic exercise 30 minute resistance exercise twice weekly week 1-6 , weekly week 7-8 , independently week 7-12 .
