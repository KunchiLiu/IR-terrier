	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration response metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) , carboplatin paclitaxel follow maintenance metformin compare primary duration remission within patient control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine situ effect metformin lethal-7 ( let-7 ) expression determine situ hybridization . ( Phase Ia ) II . To determine feasibility use core biopsy perform ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequencing . ( Phase Ia ) III . To determine epigenomic effect metformin via RNA-sequencing ( Seq ) . ( Phase Ia ) IV . To determine biologic effect metformin evaluation pre post metformin tumor sample phosphorylated ( p ) adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) -activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( avian ) ( myc ) , mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) phosphorylated v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 ( pAKT ) . ( Phase Ia ) V. To assess safety tolerability metformin carboplatin paclitaxel patient platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer . ( Phase Ib ) OUTLINE : Phase Ia : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 twice daily ( BID ) day 8-21 . Phase Ib : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride BID day 1-21 , paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
