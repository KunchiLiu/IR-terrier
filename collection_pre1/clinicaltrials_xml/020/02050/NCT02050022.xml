	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) progressive disease characterize loss lung function , lead breathlessness , poor quality life , loss productivity , increase mortality . The World Health Organization estimate COPD third lead cause death worldwide 2020 , account 7 million death annually . COPD patient frequently experience 'lung attack ' , breathlessness , cough , sputum production dramatically increase , lead urgent office visit , emergency admission hospitalization . Lung attack reduce patient quality life cost Canadian health care system nearly $ 4 billion dollar year direct indirect cost . Lung attack effectively manage identify treat early , symptoms lung attack often overlap common condition heart failure , pneumonia even influenza . Because test separate lung attack condition , doctor struggle accurately diagnose lung attack early stage drug effective . This lead delay even incorrect diagnosis inappropriate treatment . This research address critical need . Our goal improve COPD patient care develop new blood test help identify patient early stage lung attack . Doctors able use test treat lung attack earlier stage currently possible . These blood test enable doctor personalize management COPD meet need individual patient . Hypothesis : New biomarker blood test use good identify manage patient COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) define acute event characterize worsen patient 's respiratory symptom beyond normal day-to-day variation lead change medication ( case antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid ) . In case AECOPD , patient experience gradual crescendo-like increase shortness breath , cough purulent sputum production day week . At peak , patient may experience extreme shortness breath ( sometimes describe `` breathless paralysis '' ) uncontrollable paroxysms cough purulent sputum production . AECOPDs complex physiological event . In 70-80 % case , AECOPDs precipitate bacterial viral respiratory tract infection . However , patient develop acute symptom ( e.g. , runny nose , cough fever ) progress AECOPDs experience spontaneous resolution symptom . Furthermore , many patient COPD harbour pathogenic organism airway develop AECOPD symptom . Thus , factor , include host inflammatory response , likely play role pathogenesis AECOPDs . Prompt recognition treatment AECOPD prodromal period abrogate full blown attack . Thus identify treat AECOPDs early ( physician ' office ) , emergency visit , hospitalization , even death significantly reduce . However , easy symptom AECOPD ( especially early course ) non-specific easily confused ailment heart failure , allergy , even upper respiratory tract infection . Since biochemical test clinician order objectively confirm AECOPD , AECOPD miss entirely misdiagnosed , lead delay treatment case wrong treatment , may result devastate consequence include respiratory failure , hospitalization even death . Once patient full blown attack stage AECOPD , treatment modestly helpful relieve symptoms hospitalization often required resolve . The median duration hospitalization AECOPD Canada 10 day , follow average 3 month convalescence . Unfortunately , case , full recovery never achieve patient continue experience rapid decline lung physical function ( compare patient hospitalize AECOPD ) . The 3 year mortality rate follow hospitalization 50 % , hospitalization emergency visit avoidable early detection , diagnosis treatment AECOPD . Indeed , COPD lead cause preventable hospitalization Canada . However , without simple blood test primary care physician ( PCPs ) order office , early diagnosis feasible . The primary objective study identify blood biomarkers diagnose AECOPD . Following informed consent , blood sample collect patient admitted exacerbation day 1 , 3 7 hospitalization 30 day 90 day post-hospitalization . Sputum sample also collect day admission AECOPD etiologic phenotyping . All patient receive standard anti-exacerbation care hospital , include systemic corticosteroid antibiotic follow hospital transition team consist nurse , physiotherapist respiratory therapist special expertise COPD care . Following informed consent non-exacerbating patient , blood sample collect used comparison exacerbate patient sample .</detailed_description>
