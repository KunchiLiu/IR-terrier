	<brief_summary>Fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture common usually treat conservatively . Symptomatic care consist protect weightbearing hard-soled shoe , air-cast walking boot , below-knee walking cast successful . Several paper report early rehabilitation may decrease ankle stiffness , muscle bone atrophy , aid early return activity . However , early motion ankle joint may risk displacement fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture . However , study use hard-sole shoe protect weightbearing allow motion ankle joint successful result . Clapper et al . compare result hard-soled shoe walk cast fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture report avulsion fracture heal uneventfully result similar two . However , randomize control trial . Devices air-cast walk boot , plaster slipper , Jone 's dressing also use treatment . However , decide compare result hard-soled shoe short leg walk cast treatment fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture . We hypothesize 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) assess 6 month fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture treat protected weightbearing hard-soled shoe inferior protect weightbearing short leg walk cast superior short leg walk cast respect time return normal daily life patient 's satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hard-soled Shoe Versus Short Leg Walking Cast Fifth Metatarsal Avulsion Fracture : A Randomized Multicenter Noninferiority Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study noninferiority , randomize controlled trial patient present multiple center . The primary outcome measure 100mm VAS assess 6 month fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture . 100mm VAS compare experimental group ( hard-soled shoe ) control group ( short leg walk cast ) 6 month follow-up examination . The 100mm VAS widely use self assessment tool evaluate pain fracture . The secondary objective determine whether hard-soled shoe superior short leg walk cast respect time return normal daily life patient 's satisfaction . The sample size determine use method appropriate noninferiority trial , assume 90 % power significance level 0.05 . We perform pilot study 18 patient assess 100mm VAS 6 month . Pooled standard deviation 16.6 . To find whether hard-soled shoe inferior short leg walk cast fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture , 74 patient require 90 % power low limit one-sided 95 % confidence interval difference two treatment noninferiority margin -10 . We assume drop-out rate 20 % . Adding number , 96 patient require study . Determination noninferiority margin base clinical significance . Todd et al . report study 48 patient minimum clinically significant difference 100mm VAS 13mm difference less amount , even statistically significant , unlikely clinical significance . We decide noninferiority margin 10 mm difference less amount adequate prove noninferiority experiment group ( hard-soled shoe ) control group ( short leg walk cast ) . After 1 week immobilization short leg posterior splint , patient randomize experiment group ( hard-soled shoe ) control group ( short leg walk cast ) . Randomization stratify study center . Block randomization use investigator blind block size use ensure allocation concealment . Delayed union define lack bridge callus 3 5 cortex 12 week . Nonunion define lack cortical bridge clearly visible fracture line , 14 week post injury . If subject discontinue prior completion 6 month , last observation carry forward intent-to-treat analysis . Subjects cross treatment arm , example , patient experiment group ( hard-soled shoe ) change short leg walk cast control group ( short leg walk cast ) change hard-soled shoe , analyze accord initial group allocation intent-to-treat analysis . Additionally , as-treated ( per-protocal ) analysis also conduct patient complete 6 month follow-up protocol assign . Although previous study documented increase risk reduction loss protect weightbearing hard-soled shoe protocol , safety rule put place assure patient , clinician , health research ethic board safety patient priority . Reduction loss primary outcome , monitor carefully regardless publish evidence . A safety rule establish priori eliminate dissent among research team participate surgeon stop study event apparent adverse outcome relate protected weightbearing hard-soled shoe . If difference great three spontaneous reduction loss occur group , intervention would halt . A reduction loss metal failure define one occur without patient instigation inappropriate activity . The reduction loss monitor study personnel involve outcome assessment .</detailed_description>
