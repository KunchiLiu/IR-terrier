	<brief_title>A Chart Review Rituximab Plus Repeated Cycles Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) usually respond increase platelet count treatment steroid , patient experience recurrence.Rituximab useful treatment patient recurrent ITP ; many hundred patient treat . 30-40 % patient achieve complete remission ( CR : platelet count &gt; 150 x 109/l ) initial treatment . However , patient relapse 1 3 year initial treatment suggest long-term `` cure '' occur 20 % initial patient . An increased rate durable CRs therefore desirable goal . One approach would use rituximab maintenance ; however , strategy result long term B cell suppression . Dexamethasone also use achieve `` cure '' ITP , especially adult near diagnosis . An initial study suggest approximately 50 % patient would achieve long-term response one 4-day cycle high dose ( 40 mg/day ) dexamethasone . A follow study suggest 3-4 cycle dexamethasone would better 1 cycle . Finally , recent publication suggest rituximab plus one cycle dexamethasone superior dexamethasone alone , &gt; 50 % CR rate 6 month . Based publish activity rituximab dexamethasone disorder , patient receive treatment combine dexamethasone rituximab . We review data patient receive one course dexamethasone together rituximab relapse refractory ITP order determine response rate , duration response , toxicity combination , clinical predictor response group .</detailed_description>
