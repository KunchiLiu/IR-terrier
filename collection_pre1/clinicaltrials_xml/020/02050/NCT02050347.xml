	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph gland cancer call Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) ( disease refer `` lymphoma '' `` leukemia '' ) . The lymphoma leukemia come back go away treatment ( include best treatment know cancer ) . Because standard treatment cancer time , subject ask volunteer gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No one way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , hop work together . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer ; show promise , strong enough cure patient . T cell kill tumor cell normally enough kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person . The antibody use study call anti-CD19 . This antibody stick cancer cell substance outside cell call CD19 . CD19 antibody use treat people lymphoma leukemia . For study , CD19 antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . The T lymphocytes also contain CD28 , stimulate T cell make last long . Treatment CD19/CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell activity lymphoma leukemia cell make patient affected disease . In study , investigator go see treatment work even well make cell healthy stem cell donor . If investigator able collect blood stem cell donor , collect blood subject make CD19/CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell . These CD19/CD28 chimeric receptor T cell investigational product approve FDA . The purpose study find big dose chimeric T Cells safe , see long T cell chimeric receptor last , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help people lymphoma leukemia stem cell transplantation donor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject his/her donor give blood make CD19/CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell laboratory . These cell grow frozen . To make T cell , donor/subject 's blood stimulate growth factor make T cell grow . To get CD19 antibody CD28 attach surface T cell , antibody gene insert T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help investigator find T cell blood use special laboratory test . Subjects follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . When subject enrolls study , s/he assign dose CD19/CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell receive cancer treatment 6 week cell infusion . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , subject 's level circulating T cell relatively high , s/hemay receive treatment cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) fludarabine ( chemotherapy drug ) T cell . If subject already receive chemotherapy , may need . The subject give injection cell vein IV assign dose . The injection take 10 minute . The research staff follow subject clinic injection 4 hour . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , subject seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , s/he may able receive 5 additional dos T cell . These additional infusion would least 4-6 week apart dose level receive first time lower dose . There medical test treatment . To learn way CD19 chimeric receptor-T cell work long last body , extra blood drawn .</detailed_description>
