	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well sorafenib tosylate , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery work treat patient high-risk stage IIB-IV soft tissue sarcoma . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin hydrochloride ifosfamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving sorafenib tosylate , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery may effective treatment soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic response rate ( &gt; = 95 % necrosis ) preoperative treatment sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) , epirubicin ( epirubicin hydrochloride ) , ifosfamide , hypofractionated radiation high risk soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy , include wound complication rate . II . To estimate time-to-event rate , include overall survival , overall disease-free survival , distant disease-free survival , local disease-free survival patient high risk soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall treated preoperative sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy postoperative sorafenib plus chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-71 85-155 , epirubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 minute , ifosfamide IV 90 minute day 15-17 , 36-38 ( ifosfamide ) , 57-59 , 99-101 , 120-122 , 141-143 . Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) day 36-45 surgical resection day 78 . Patients positive margin , undergo EBRT boost day 91-98 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , yearly 2 year .</detailed_description>
