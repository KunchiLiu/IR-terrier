	<brief_summary>Measurement skin reactivity cat dander sample obtain different method . Subjects assess study conventional skin prick test positive ( histamine ) , positive ( standardized cat dander extract ) negative allergen control ( diluent ) fulfil in- exclusion criterion , . A screening prick test perform order confirm positivity ( cat dander allergy ) . A scratch test perform participant positive screen prick test , order measure skin reactivity cat dander , originate three different body area cat .
