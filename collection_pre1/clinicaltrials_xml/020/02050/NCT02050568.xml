	<detailed_description>Aim project Since year 2003 , Glostrup/Herlev Hospital devise novel technique , urethral pressure reflectometry ( UPR ) , measurement pressure cross-sectional area female urethra . UPR able separate continent woman woman stress urinary incontinence ( SUI , define involuntary leakage increase abdominal pressure ) . The method validate used five DMSc Ph.D. theses stand alone field . ( 1-5 ) A great percentage woman undergo surgery genital prolapse ( characterized portion vaginal canal protrude open vagina ) develop SUI surgery , researcher yet find answer occurs . Thus , great need knowledge regard mechanism continence woman genital prolapse . The hypothesis UPR may use uncover change female urethra genital prolapse surgery , reveal significant difference parameter woman develop SUI surgery . Background Genital prolapse common problem woman . A Scottish study reveal 9.5 % woman undergo genital prolapse surgery live . ( 6 ) Unfortunately , SUI frequently see operation . A randomized study conduct amongst woman genital prolapse , without preoperative SUI , show 32 % developed SUI operation . ( 7 ) The sunken bladder , see genital prolapse anterior ( front ) part vagina , believe mask SUI lead kink urethra and/or compression urethra since bladder sewn place surgery , kink compression eliminate . ( 8 ) Urinary tract symptom traditionally associate anterior genital prolapse ; however , Danish study reveal SUI common woman repair genital prolapse posterior ( back ) part vagina , maybe even due mechanism ( compression urethra ) . ( 9 ) Efforts make predict likelihood patient develop SUI genital prolapse surgery , however , common test , show disappointing positive predictive value range 23 % 53 % negative predictive value 74 % 86 % . ( 10 ; 11 ) A mid-urethral sling gold standard treatment SUI . ( 12 ) To avoid SUI genital prolapse surgery , clinic choose treat patient sling , simultaneously . However , patient SUI require surgery . To avoid one patient undergo surgery SUI , six ten patient must treat sling genital prolapse surgery . ( 13 ) A Dutch study conduct 907 woman , show 39 % woman already preoperative SUI , actually experienced improvement condition . Therefore , believe may reasonable await effect prolapse surgery instead perform concomitant anti-incontinence surgery . ( 14 ) Also , mid-urethral sling associate risk complication ; survey conduct 809 woman , show 20.9 % postoperative complication , bladder injury bleeding . ( 15 ) There international consensus use mid-urethral sling woman undergo genital prolapse surgery . ( 13 ; 16-18 ) Therefore , great need knowledge know-how regard mechanism continence woman genital prolapse , surgery . UPR UPR measure pressure cross-sectional area simultaneously mean acoustic reflectometry . A thin highly flexible polyurethane bag place urethra ; bag connect probe PVC tube . A digital signal processor generate sound , send probe bag . The reflection bag record relayed computer convert profile urethra . At moment device exist 3 prototype . Material methods The suitable woman expect included examined two-year period . The participant inform study outpatient clinic , doctor . To qualify participant set inclusion exclusion criterion must meet . With drop-out rate 15 % , sample size 30 ensure sufficient statistical power . Women either anterior posterior genital prolapse examine , group consist 30 woman . The POP-Q system ( pelvic-organ-prolapse quantification system ) apply grade genital prolapse , patient ask complete ICIQ-SF questionnaire ( International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form ) . The patient examine UPR relaxing , squeeze straining , six week surgery . The preoperative measurement conduct without anterior/posterior part vagina hold place vaginal pessary . A stress test , woman ask cough three time bladder fill 300 ml saline , also conduct , also without anterior/posterior part vagina hold place vaginal pessary . In order investigate reproducibility measurement , preoperative examination repeat 15 woman anterior genital prolapse 15 woman posterior genital prolapse .</detailed_description>
