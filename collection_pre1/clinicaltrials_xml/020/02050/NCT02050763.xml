	<detailed_description>Research Team : Rakai Health Sciences Program Data collection propose dissertation analysis do research team investigator Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) establish 1988 focus HIV/AIDS research , include evaluation health education condom promotion . Over time activity increase nature volume expand include laboratory clinical research , randomize trial new prevention strategy , health professional training , expand community service include HIV voluntary test counseling , provision HIV antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , general HIV-related medical care , prevention mother-to-child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) , family planning service . In 2002 , Rakai Program become International Center Excellence Research ( ICER ) , sponsor National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) . The core RHSP 18-year community-based longitudinal Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) , within RHSP implement multiple interdisciplinary study . Over 150 peer-reviewed paper generate RCCS nested study . Data Source : Rakai Community Cohort Study All data propose analysis derive Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) conduct survey interview every 12-18 month consent people age 15-49 ~5,000 household 47-50 community throughout Rakai . These 47-50 community represent 7 % 720 community situate Rakai District . The RCCS include participant reside trading center agrarian village , representative rural southwestern Uganda . Each RCCS participant receive unique , life-long study identification number use link data time RHSP study . RCCS write informed consent form cover study participation , sample archive future assay include genetic testing , linkage RCCS data RHSP database , permission re-contact participant study . Trial Design The SHARE intervention trial use cluster randomize control design study region rather individual select receive ( receive ) exposure intervention , consent adult community offer treatment ( intervention ) . The community-based approach select offering partner violence prevention intervention individual without involve intimate partner would achieve holistic result . IPV involve member couple prevention must likewise target . The SHARE intervention trial do via Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) operate ~50 community aggregate 11 study region ( categorized rural semi-urban ) prior trial sexually transmitted disease control HIV transmission prevention conduct 1994 1999 . A previous FP outreach trial ( 1999 2002 ) randomize communities,35 SHARE study build prior randomization whereby SHARE intervention implement 4 region ( Buyamba , Kabira , Kalisizo , Katana ) total 11 RCCS research area . . For current trial , four six FP intervention cluster randomly assign IPV intervention arm . The process use select region exposure SHARE trial build previous cluster randomize trial ( CRT ) conduct 1999 2002 assess impact family plan outreach via social marketing Rakai . For family planning CRT , 5 cluster randomly select receive standard family planning service 6 cluster assign intervention arm receive additional family planning information , counseling , contraceptive method government service provider community-based volunteer agent use social marketing strategy . Condom use promote control intervention area . Findings indicate family planning outreach via social marketing significantly increase hormonal contraceptive use decrease pregnancy rate . No differential find , however , condom use study arm . In 2005 , 4 6 family planning intervention cluster randomly assign intervention arm SHARE trial . The remain 2 family planning intervention cluster , well 5 family planning control cluster assign control arm SHARE intervention trial , make total 7 control region SHARE trial . The decision allocate 4 community intervention base budgetary constraint preclude large number intervention area . RCCS round intervention trial implementation Data 2 round RCCS , R1 R2 , analyze propose study : R1 = baseline , pre-intervention ( Feb 2005-Jun 2006 ) R2 = post-intervention follow-up ( Aug 2006-Apr 2008 ) R3 = post-intervention follow-up ( Jun 2008-Nov 2009 ) Baseline interview conduct 4 intervention 7 control region via RCCS February 2005 June 2006 . SHARE roll 4 intervention region August 2005 November 2006 . SHARE activity introduce intervention region baseline data collection complete entire study area . Because region survey via RCCS order annual/semi-annual round , estimate intervention community approximately length exposure SHARE point follow-up . Independent/Dependent Variables Confounders Independent ( exposure ) variables There 2 independent variable propose study : RCCS round arm trial 1 . RCCS round : 1 . Pre-intervention baseline ( R1 ) 2 . Post-intervention follow-up time 2 ( R2 ) 3 . Post-intervention follow-up time 2 ( R3 ) 2 . Arm trial 1 . Intervention arm 2 . Control arm Dependent ( outcome ) variables The primary dependent variable past year experience IPV ( victimization among woman , perpetration among men ) . Secondary outcome variable include number non-marital sexual partner , condom use past 6 month , alcohol use last sex HIV incidence . All dependent variable determine baseline , post-intervention time 1 time 2 . Confounders Potential confounding variable assess baseline determine comparability arm . The association potential confounders outcomes interest assess univariate analysis , potential covariates include ; age , sex ( gender ) , education , marital status , religion , pregnancy-status , reproductive/fertility preference , HIV-status , use VCT , household socio-economic status . We also assess association sexual behavior IPV/HIV acquisition . Intention Treat An intention treat approach use participant evaluable data outcome measure include analysis randomization arm . Retention rate estimate arm . Analysis Plans The propose statistical analysis follow four key step . Step 1 - Establish baseline comparability First , characteristic study participant assess pre-intervention ( baseline ) control intervention region . Comparability two arm baseline important design final statistical analysis model capable adjust difference assess impact intervention minimal confounding . Pre-intervention data outcome variable , socio-demographic covariates analyze , use descriptive statistic graphic display control intervention community . Exploratory analysis include frequency dichotomous categorical variable , use X2 Fisher 's exact test difference proportion . Continuous variable assess mean median use t-tests Wilcoxon rank test . Step 2 - Investigate association intervention exposure primary/secondary outcomes The second analytic step investigate association intervention exposure primary secondary outcome ( past year IPV , condom use , alcohol use sex , number non-marital partner HIV incidence ) use univariate regression analysis . Covariates ( characteristic behavior ) find correlate outcomes interest univariate model p &lt; 0.15 significance level include subsequent multivariate model . Step 3 - Construct adjust multivariate model Adjusted multivariate regression model construct outcomes find significantly predict intervention exposure . Details provide subsequent section data model power calculation 3 aim propose dissertation research . Proposed Data Modeling Power Calculations Research Aim AIM 1 - Intimate Partner Violence Outcome To assess impact SHARE + RHSP community service report victimization perpetration physical and/or sexual IPV past 12 month , compare impact RHSP community service alone . Statistical Modeling Aim 1 The measure past year experience IPV analyze separately physical sexual IPV model categorically . Three category physical violence use : ( 1 ) None ( referent ) ; ( 2 ) Moderate physical IPV ; ( 3 ) Severe physical IPV . Two category sexual violence use : ( 1 ) None ( referent ) ; ( 1 ) Any sexual violence . Participants report experience ( victimization perpetration ) physical sexual IPV past 12 month count experienced outcome . The proportion type IPV tabulate follow-up visit , unadjusted difference trial arm assess use χ2 Fisher 's exact test . The proportion type IPV calculate separately men ( perpetration ) woman ( victimization ) . Behavior change evaluate baseline follow-up ( i.e . second post-trial follow-up ) time individual intervention region expose SHARE intervention one year . Linear regression model fit estimate marginal distribution repeat outcome compare within-individual behavior change relation exposure non-exposure intervention . The following equation use Yit denote absence/presence type IPV every unit time t. Yit = β0 + β1G + β2T + β3 ( G×T ) + β4X1 ... + βkXk +εit Covariates include multivariate model characteristic behavior find correlate IPV outcome univariate analysis p &lt; 0.15 . Models also adjust statistically significant lack comparability trial arm baseline . Statistical inference individual covariates base Wald statistic , model fit assess log likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) . The difference follow-up baseline measure IPV calculate separately intervention control region difference change assess null hypothesis DiD : ( IPV-IntFup - IPV-IntB ) = ( IPV-CF - IPV-Cb ) . The statistical significance interaction coefficient , β3 , obtain use Wald statistic , model fit assess log likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) . All hypothesis test two side significance level 0.05 . Behavioral variable find change significantly post-trial follow-up analyze repeated fitting linear model analysis stratify age group , type community ( rural vs. urban ) , important variable investigate behavior change associate specific characteristic individual population . Power Calculations Aim 1 Data impact SHARE + RHSP community service past year IPV analyze present ( 1 ) percent change ( reduction increase ) lack thereof report IPV outcome group ( intervention control ) baseline follow-up ; ( 2 ) difference percent change IPV outcome intervention control group . For Aim 1 , power estimate calculate ass study 's power measure percent change ( reduction increase ) IPV baseline follow-up , assume comparability percentage report pre-intervention arm . Thus , study power estimate calculate primary outcome past year IPV base ( 1 ) set sample size round data collection , ( 2 ) baseline prevalence type ( physical sexual ) IPV ( 3 ) assumption regard expect magnitude decline type IPV might result SHARE intervention combine RHSP HIV prevention activity . Two set power calculation use physical IPV ( moderate severe combine ) sexual IPV . The sample size fix per Table 3 . STATA 1059 use estimate power detect minimum percent reduction , assume two-sided α = 0.05 approximate intervention population 3,500 approximate control population 11,100 time point . Baseline prevalence different IPV type base RCCS data suggest 20 % woman experience physical IPV 14.5 % experienced sexual IPV year survey . It thus estimate study 80 % power detect little 7 % reduction proportion individual report physical IPV little 16 % reduction proportion individual report sexual IPV arm baseline follow-up . AIM 2 - Sexual Risk Behavior Outcomes To assess impact SHARE + RHSP community service report sexual risk behavior , include non-marital partnership past year , condom use past 6 month use alcohol sex among men woman compare impact RHSP community service alone . Statistical Modeling Aim 2 The three measure past year sexual risk behavior analyze separately non-marital partnership , condom use past 6 month , alcohol use last sex . All outcome model categorically . Non-marital partner Number non-marital sex partner past year model categorical outcome : ( 1 ) non-marital partner ( referent ) ; ( 2 ) one non-marital partner ; ( 3 ) two non-marital partner . Condom use past 6 month Condom past 6 month model categorically : ( 1 ) condom use ( referent ) ; ( 2 ) inconsistent use ; ( 3 ) consistent use . Alcohol use last sex Alcohol use last sex model categorically : ( 1 ) alcohol use last sex ( referent ) ; ( 2 ) alcohol use last sex . The proportion type sexual risk behavior report tabulated follow-up visit , unadjusted difference trial arm assess use χ2 Fisher 's exact test . The proportion type IPV calculate separately men woman behavior change evaluate baseline follow-up . Linear regression model fit estimate marginal distribution repeat outcomes67 compare within-individual behavior change relation exposure non-exposure intervention . The following equation use Yit denote absence/presence type sexual risk behavior every unit time : Yit = β0 + β1G + β2T + β3 ( G×T ) + β4X1 ... + βkXk +εit The remainder description statistical method Aim 2 identical Aim 1 . Power Calculations Aim 2 Estimates calculate ass study 's power measure percent change ( reduction increase ) sexual risk behavior baseline follow-up , assume comparability baseline arm . Again , study power estimate calculate base ( 1 ) set sample size round data collection ( 2 ) baseline prevalence , derive Rakai data , type sexual risk behavior . Three set power estimate calculate . Non-marital partner : Rakai data indicate approximately 61 % men 10 % woman one non-marital sex partner past year,49 propose analysis 80 % power detect small 3 % reduction men 11 % reduction woman time one time two arm . Condom use : Data condom use last six month available . But estimate 6.5 % men 3 % woman consistently use condom use past year . 49 Based finding , estimate propose analysis power detect small 15 % increase consistent condom use among woman small 23 % increase consistent condom use among men . Alcohol use last sex : Previous Rakai finding suggest 75.5 % men 37 % woman drink alcohol sex . Based finding , estimate propose analysis power detect small 2 % 5 % decrease alcohol use sex among men woman , respectively . AIM 3 - HIV Incidence Outcome To assess impact SHARE + RHSP community service HIV incidence . Statistical Modeling Aim 3 For Aim 3 , data 3 round RCCS analyze . Person year ( PY ) exposure cumulate baseline last negative HIV result person remain negative , midpoint interval last negative test first positive test seroconverters . HIV incidence estimate per 100 PY . The primary analysis intention-to-treat , use log link Poisson distribution estimate incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) HIV acquisition . Random effect model use account intra-region correlation . All model adjust study region . In univariate analysis assess covariates associate HIV acquisition p &lt; 0.15 determine potential confounders inclusion multivariate model . Models also adjust statistically significant baseline difference randomization arm . Potential covariates include term sex , age , sexual risk behavior , community baseline prevalence HIV . Homogeneity treatment effect men woman assess test sex treatment interaction . Results model use estimate number HIV infection prevent intervention ~4.5 period per 100 participant . Power Calculations Aim 3 Assuming 75 % annual retention two follow interval post-intervention , estimate ~4,753 PY exposure intervention group ~16,969 PY exposure control group . The power detect minimal IRRs person time estimate use STATA 1059 assume two side α =0.05 HIV incidence estimate 1.5/100 PY among woman 1.4/100 PY among men . The study 80 % power detect 36 % low HIV incidence intervention compare control community time follow-up . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Several step take RHSP ensure safety confidentiality research participant . Because secondary data analysis , main risk breach confidentiality participant record , interview lab result reveal third party . Informed consent document retain locked filing cabinet store room , accessible senior investigator designate staff . All questionnaire sample identify pre-printed study ID number , names remove . All questionnaire store secure , lock facility field station Kalisizo permanent store Entebbe . Only designated staff member access record . All computerized data base contain study ID number list link study number names keep separately password protect computer accessible senior data manager . Files lab result maintain separate safe computer file , study ID number , contain personal identifier . The RCCS interview study conduct respondent ' home central location ( refer `` hub '' ) . Interviews do complete privacy language Luganda experience same-sex interviewer use structured questionnaire . Recognizing research IPV raise important ethical methodological challenge beyond posed general population health research , RHSP investigator follow recommendation develop WHO regard safe ethical conduct domestic violence research .
