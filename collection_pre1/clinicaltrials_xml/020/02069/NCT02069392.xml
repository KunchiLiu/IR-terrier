	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia mark problem attention , memory problem solve . These deficit predict long-term functional outcome ability live independently maintain employment , ameliorate currently available medication . Cognitive training improves function degree , approach time- resource-intensive . The current project aim enhance accelerate benefit people schizophrenia derive cognitive training administer nicotine training session . This would provide proof principle type treatment intervention improve cognitive symptom schizophrenia . The current project aim determine whether intermittent presence nicotine cognitive training exercise people schizophrenia shorten training period necessary induce significant clinically relevant improvement enhance improvement see train period specify length . Hypothesis 1a : Nicotine administration train increase size measured effect train intervention , accelerate time course performance enhancement MCCB training exercise progression parameter . Hypothesis 1b : The large training effect Nicotine Group persist beyond end intervention . Hypothesis 2a : Within-session progress training exercise large presence nicotine presence placebo . Hypothesis 2b : These acute nicotine-induced performance elevation persist beyond presence nicotine subsequent non-drug training session , give evidence acute facilitation learning process .</brief_summary>
