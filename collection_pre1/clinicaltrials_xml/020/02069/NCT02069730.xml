	<brief_summary>This study select drug therapy patient salivary gland cancer . The study two phase : molecular profiling phase ( phase 1 ) treatment phase ( phase 2 ) . In molecular profiling phase study , participant provide sample tumor tissue test change certain gene show whether certain drug treatment useful others . Once participant undergone molecular profiling , offer drug treatment depend result . Certain drug treatment design target certain gene change . If matching drug treatment , participant offer treatment ( either outside clinical trial within clinical trial ) . If gene change change gene drug treatment available certain change , participant offer study drug , Selinexor . Cancer uncontrolled growth cell . Research show one way cancer cell grow uncontrollably certain protein , call exporter protein , present high level body . These protein prevent certain protein important protect cell become cancerous important control growth cell , work . The study drug Selinexor new class drug call Selective Inhibitor Nuclear Export ( SINE ) block exporter protein work may allow protein work slow stop tumor grow .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria ( Phase 1 , Molecular Profiling ) : Have available archival tumor tissue fresh tumor specimen diagnostic histological tissue molecular profiling . Histological cytological proof malignant salivary gland tumor ECOG performance score 02 Documented evidence recurrent metastatic disease Inclusion Criteria ( Phase 2 , Treatment ) : Interpretable result molecular profiling molecular profiling phase study Advanced recurrent metastatic salivary gland cancer curative therapy exist Evidence clinical radiological disease progression time study treatment At least one measurable target lesion define RECIST 1.1 Must adequate hematological , liver , renal cardiac function No concomitant use drug may prolong QTc interval No history serious cardiac illness No serious medical condition might aggravate treatment limit compliance . Central nervous system metastasis permit provide clinically stable Able take oral medication evidence bowel obstruction , infectious/inflammatory bowel disease No active malignancy site 18 year age old Measureable disease define RECIST v1.1 Not receive concurrent investigational agent If match treatment context another phase I trial , eligibility criterion enrol trial use instead criteria trial Exclusion Criteria ( Phase 1 , Molecular Profiling ) : Refuses tumor tissue undergo molecular profile Not enough tumor tissue molecular profile Life expectancy le 3 month Exclusion Criteria ( Phase 2 , Treatment ) : Had stop previous treatment show clinical radiological evidence disease progression Have receive drug treatment assignment specific arm enrolment treatment phase ( phase 2 )</criteria>
