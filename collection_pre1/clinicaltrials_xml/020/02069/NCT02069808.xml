	<brief_summary>Disprove null hypothesis follow : Among investigator 's egg bank donor undergoing ovulation induction recombinant FSH medication per treatment protocol outline , use adjunctive LH activity medication Menopur ™ , result number mature oocytes recover cryopreserved egg donor treat Menopur™ . Objectives : Compare efficacy recombinant FSH ( Follistim ™ ) without adjunct LH activity medication Menopur ™ volunteer egg bank donor . Efficacy define : 1 . # Days ovarian stimulation GnRH agonist trigger . 2 . Peak serum estradiol level day GnRH agonist trigger . 3 . Number follicles &gt; 15 mm average diameter day GnRH agonist trigger . 4 . Number mature oocytes recover cryopreserved . Study type : Randomized prospective clinical trial . Patient selection : Voluntary egg donor satisfy screen criterion FDA Michigan Egg Bank : Age range 18-to 39 year . BMI 18 25 . Resting antral follicle count 16 great . Cycle day 3 FSH &lt; 10 mIU/ml . AMH &gt; 2.0 ng/ml . Study design : Two groups- Group A- Recombinant FSH Follistim ; Group B- Recombinant FSH Follistim adjunct Menopur . Both group use GnRH agonist trigger 36 hour prior egg retrieval . Random number generator patient assign basd odd even number . Number subject : 25 group . Total 50 subject . This take account possible cycle cancellation poor ovarian response patient elective withdrawal result least 20 subject group complete study . Primary measure outcome : number mature oocytes recover cryopreserved . Secondary measure outcome : 1 . # Days ovarian stimulation GnRH agonist trigger . 2 . Peak serum estradiol level day GnRH agonist trigger . 3 . Number follicles &gt; 15 mm average diameter day GnRH agonist trigger .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The investigator 's Center study human oocyte cryopreservation vitrification since July 1 , 2008 ( Western Institutional Board Review -WIRB Pro . Nr : 20081080 , WIRB Study Nr . : 1100421 ) . The first phase investigator 's study ass efficacy oocyte cryopreservation among voluntary egg donor end point outcomes include rate oocyte thaw survival , fertilization , embryo development , implantation , clinical pregnancy , live birth infant health . The rationale start egg donor represent population woman likely optimal egg quality short turnaround time vitrification thaw , IVF embryo transfer appropriate egg recipient patient . If investigator could establish good outcome egg quality optimal , would good hope provide reliable egg cryopreservation technology woman need fertility preservation face treatment cancer ; illnesses treatment harm egg ; woman choose personal egg bank woman wish avoid excess embryo creation moral religious ground . The investigator 's study observation outcome use previously cryopreserved donor egg equivalent fresh donor egg : 90 % mature oocytes survive thaw , 76 % thaw oocytes fertilize normally ICSI , 98 % recipient woman day 5 embryo transfer one two embryo transfer , implantation rate 42 % , 60 % recipient woman achieve clinical pregnancy , 58 % live birth rate birth defect observe 40 baby deliver technology Center . In begin 2012 , open second phase investigator 's study include woman need fertility preservation indication mention . No outcomes yet know due expect time deferment oocyte cryopreservation use . The favorable outcome donor egg bank IVF lead investigator 's establish Michigan Egg Bank . On October 22 , 2012 , American Society Reproductive Medicine announce new practice guideline oocyte cryopreservation technology consider mainstream medical therapy long consider experimental medical care . The investigator 's closed WIRB study November , 26 , 2012 . Rationale : Ovarian stimulation egg donation provide offering safest simplest process egg donor . Avoiding complication ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome assure recruitment harvest good quality oocyte main goal care investigator 's volunteer egg donor . Use FSH medication GnRH antagonist GnRH agonist trigger protocol choice investigator 's egg donor . The investigator 's egg donor experience complication rapid recovery . GnRH antagonists show suppress endogenous ovarian androgen synthesis . In use GnRH antagonist , adjunctive LH low dose hCG combine FSH medication mainstream assumption assure sufficient endogenous ovarian testosterone present substrate estrogen synthesis normal folliculogenesis . In effort improve patient compliance simplify use medication investigator 's egg donor , investigator wish examine efficacy recombinant FSH without additional separate medication adjunct LH activity form Menopur ™ .</detailed_description>
