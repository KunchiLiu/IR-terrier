	<brief_summary>In France , lung cancer lead cause death induce cancer . Therapeutic advance make therapy unresectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor block Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , erlotinib . This drug usually induce rapid shrink NSCLC tumour explain RECIST criterion less reliable erlotinib cytotoxic drug 8 week treatment . Among patient unresectable NSCLC , 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluoro-L-thymidine ( 18F-FLT ) 18F-2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 18F- FDG ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) identify early responding patient well progression-free survival erlotinib first line second third line . To date , none medico-economic study conduct determine strategy cost-effective . The purpose study confirm early metabolic image 18 F-FLT 18FFDG PET could theranostic issue identify fourteenth day erlotinib ( second line ) subject respond erlotinib , i.e . 6 week prior morphological evaluation base new RECIST 1.1 , typically do week 8 erlotinib treatment . A health economics ancillary study achieve . Indeed , recent therapeutic improvement , particular target therapy NSCLC , improve quality life life expectancy , also induce important increase health cost . According study , mean cost treatment NSCLC increase factor 3 10 last year . More efficient strategy would permit stop early objective endpoint , expensive therapy main achievement thoracic oncology . The potential clinical impact work 1 ) stop early erlotinib non-responders replace another treatment deterioration physical status , 2 ) reduce risk side effect cost unnecessary treatment 3 ) propose customization treatment first line therapy .</brief_summary>
