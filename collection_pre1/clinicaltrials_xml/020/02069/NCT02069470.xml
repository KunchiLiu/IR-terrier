	<detailed_description>Denmark low survival cancer compare European country . This could explain inadequate organization cancer investigation . In order improve , 34 fast track pathway organ specific cancer diseases establish year 2008-2010 . In 2011 fast track pathway non-specific serious symptom . Another reason could delay general practice . Cancer general practice low prevalence condition . Each general practitioner ( GP ) see 8-10 new cancer patient per year . 50 % cancer patient present non-specific symptom even organ specific alarm symptom positive predictive value cancer often low 5 % . The investigator know cancer patient increase use general practice prior diagnosis 25 % wait 20 day general practice referral . A study show 20 % Danish GPs assume hypothetical cancer risk high 50 % refer 50 year old man cancer fast-track pathway . The late Danish Cancer Plan include CME key strategy lower GP threshold refer patient cancer fast track pathway . The aim study investigate effect CME early cancer diagnosis . This measure change - GP knowledge , attitude risk assessment . - GP referral behavior assess primary care interval use fast track referral . - GP´s cancer hit rate , cancer patients´ tumor stage treatment 1 year survival . Methods/Design The study conduct step wedge control design base quasi-cluster randomization . GPs cluster receive CME control GPs another cluster yet receive CME . GPs cluster divide intervention group reference group depend whether participate CME . In august 2012 invitation participate present study send 859 general Practitioners ( GPs ) Central Denmark Region . GPs ask complete form patient refer fast-track diagnostic pathway cancer within 8-month period ( September 2012 - May 2013 ) . Data include present symptom , GP-estimated cancer risk ( predictive value ) referral time , date referral date first presentation cancer relate symptom general practitioner . To increase completeness data , every week , investigator receive data regional database patient refer cancer diagnostic pathway . The refer GP-practice remind non-included patient . In order link collect data follow registry use : - The Civil Registration Number ( CRN ) , unique 10-digit personal identification number assign every permanent temporary Danish Residents - The Hospital Discharge Registry comprise The Patient Administrative System ( PAS ) hold administrative information hospital activity . Data include date hospital admission type admission . - The Danish Cancer Registry ( DCR ) hold information cancer diagnose Denmark . - MedCom data web interface ( referral hotel ) include electronic referral letter send general practice hospital . - Danish National Health Insurance Service Registry ( NHSR ) hold information contact general practice service provide . The CME-intervention The CME-course 3-hour meeting . Guided available evidence literature follow issue consider important . - A multifaceted interactive teaching method . - Knowledge transfer base patient case create close relation every day practice . - An emotional experience facilitate change attitude . An educational film create occasion . The film illustrated series consultation GP patient . Following topic choose : - Faster investigation increase survival . - Predictive positive value cancer symptom . - False reassurance negative test pit fall . - Delay make appropriate cancer referral . - Difficulties use fast track pathway cancer . - Difficulties communicate cancer risk . Statistical analyse The outcome analyze generalized linear random-effects model random effect GPs . Based data assess whether model inter correlation within practice within cluster require , whether intervention effect assume equal GPs , random interaction . Analyses perform full GP-population ( `` intention intervene `` ) 3 subgroup GPs ; GP participate CME , Colleague participate , even GP neither colleague participate CME .</detailed_description>
