	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study genetics predict risk bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis jaw patient cancer receive zoledronic acid . Zoledronic acid anti-resorptive drug use part cancer treatment . A serious side effect drug death jawbone , commonly call bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis jaw ( BRONJ ) . Genetic research may help doctor understand risk factor BRONJ likely get BRONJ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics Predicting Risk Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis Jaw Patients With Cancer Receiving Zoledronic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop pharmacometric model predict jawbone zoledronic acid ( Zol ) concentration oncologic patient conduct prospective cohort study Zol pharmacometrics BRONJ patient , measure drug plasma , urine , jawbone tissue obtain surgical treatment BRONJ . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To clinically assess validate predictive pharmacometric model , develop risk model BRONJ oncologic patient receive intravenous Zol . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive zoledronic acid IV 30 minute day 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
