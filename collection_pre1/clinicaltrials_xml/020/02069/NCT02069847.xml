	<brief_summary>Surgery historically mainstay treatment advance pre-malignant lesion early esophageal cancer . However , esophagectomy associate significant morbidity mortality . With advance therapeutic endoscopy , grow interest application endoscopic resection mucosal ablative technique treatment disease . Esophageal stricture ( ES ) formation become increasingly recognize complication extensive endoscopic mucosal ablation and/or resection . The resultant symptomatic stricture development significantly impair patient 's quality life . Endoscopic therapy esophageal stricture balloon dilation and/or local steroid injection invasive , costly , associated potential risk perforation . Recently , oral corticosteroid introduce prevention esophageal stricture endoscopic submucosal dissection . Budesonide synthetic steroid topical anti-inflammatory property high first-pass metabolism ; thus , potentially less systemic absorption side effect . Hypothesis : Oral budesonide prevents esophageal stricture formation patient underwent radical endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) advance premalignant esophageal lesion superficial esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Budesonide Prevention Esophageal Strictures After Endotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal stricture ( ES ) formation widely recognize adverse event radical EMR ESD . Indeed , ES common complication radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) , report incidence range 5 % 12 % . A single-center retrospective study report ES formation 67 % 73 patient EMR least 50 % esophageal circumference . Similarly , incidence ES development ESD 70-90 % mucosal defect involve three-quarters esophageal circumference . In aggregate , extent esophageal mucosal defect follow endotherapy appear consistent predictor ES formation . Prevention ES development follow endotherapy significantly improve patient 's quality life possibly reduce potential risk cost associate treatment ES repeat endoscopic balloon dilation ( EBD ) . Glucocorticoids evaluate potential preventive therapy ES base anti-inflammatory property inhibitory effect collagen deposition . Oral prednisolone show effective preventive strategy ES formation . However , prolong use systemic oral steroid associate multiple adverse effect . Budesonide synthetic steroid topical anti-inflammatory property high first-pass metabolism ; thus , potentially less systemic absorption side effect . Most recently Mayo Clinic Rochester develop new budesonide capsule formulation . Alike viscous budesonide budesonide capsule open powder mixed honey pancake syrup . A similar formulation currently use pilot study treatment eosinophilic esophagitis . The advantage budesonide capsule improve taste comparison viscous budesonide originate budesonide respules unpalatable . Study aim : 1 . The aim study prospectively record experience budesonide prevention esophageal stricture formation endotherapy ( mucosal resection , submucosal dissection ) part routine medical care . 2 . The data compare outcomes well-annotated historical control underwent similar procedure similar follow without budesonide exposure . 3 . If sufficient efficacy see , data use plan prospective control clinical trial . All patient study group receive standard medical care experimental intervention perform .</detailed_description>
