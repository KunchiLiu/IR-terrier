	<brief_summary>The guiding question study : U.S. adaptation successful Scandinavian approach ( TIPS ) early detection substantially reduce duration untreated psychosis ( DUP ) improve outcomes beyond establish first-episode service ( FES ) ? The primary aim study : 1 . To determine whether early detection intervention reduce DUP US , compare usual detection . Early detection ( ED ) implement one US community ( New Haven , CT ) , usual detection effort continue another ( Boston , MA ) . DUP measure admission correspond first-episode service ( STEP &amp; PREP ) community , one year throughout ED implementation . The investigator hypothesize DUP reduce significantly early detection site compare usual detection site ; 2 . A secondary aim determine whether DUP reduction augment outcomes establish FES outcomes U.S . The investigator measure symptom , function engagement treatment entry 1 year site . The investigator hypothesize short DUP one FES ( STEP ) predict reduce distress illness severity entry well early outcomes STEP compare PREP .</brief_summary>
