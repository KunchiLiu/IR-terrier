	<brief_summary>Some patient head neck cancer benign tumour head neck receive radiotherapy neck part treatment . The large artery neck , carotid artery , often include area treat radiotherapy . There evidence show radiotherapy blood vessel result thicken furring artery wall year treatment . This thickening may result stiffen narrowing artery . Current research aim towards detect radiotherapy-related change carotid artery earlier stage towards use new radiotherapy technique avoid treat blood vessel possible . The question whether use preventive medicine like aspirin cholesterol-lowering tablet help reverse process currently unanswered . The aim study compare thickness ( intima-medial thickness ) carotid artery wall time ( period 5 year ) follow radiotherapy thickness carotid artery receive radiotherapy . There many cause thicken artery ( high blood pressure , high cholesterol level diabetes ) may affect ability measure effect radiotherapy change artery wall . In order address , ideal look process patient one side neck treat use side comparison . The study also investigate earlier sign radiotherapy-related change , stiffen artery wall , inflammation artery wall ( early sign radiotherapy-related change ) marker blood may indicate process take place . The null hypothesis study : - In irradiated carotid artery , mean intimal-medial thickness one year follow radiotherapy unirradiated artery . - The incidence carotid artery stenosis irradiate unirradiated carotid artery - Arterial wall strain one year follow radiotherapy irradiate unirradiated carotid artery . - Microbubble ultrasound able detect Inflammation carotid artery radiotherapy early marker atherosclerosis ; microbubble ultrasound demonstrate dose radiotherapy inflammation begin . - Serum biomarker level increase time baseline radiotherapy wo n't correlate IMT arterial strain .</brief_summary>
