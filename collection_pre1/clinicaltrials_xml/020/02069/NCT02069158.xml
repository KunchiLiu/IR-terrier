	<brief_summary>This phase Ib single arm , open-label , multiple dose , dose escalating , safety , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study combination PF-05212384 paclitaxel carboplatin . The study conduct adult patient advance breast , NSCLC , ovarian endometrial , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) Head Neck ( HNSCC ) cancer indication use paclitaxel carboplatin . Successive cohort patient receive escalate dos PF-05212384 combination paclitaxel carboplatin , start dose level determine 60 % single agent MTD . The study consist two part : dose find part ( Part 1 ) expansion part ( Part 2 ) . During Part 1 patient breast , NSCLC , ovary endometrial , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) Head Neck ( HNSCC ) cancer enrol . During Part 2 , patient ovarian cancer enrol . In Part 1 , 3+3 design employ . Once MTD combination define Part 1 , Part 2 perform good definition safety profile , potential antitumor activity pharmacodynamic effect combination ; conduct least 12 patient ovarian cancer . Approximately 40 patient expect enrolled study overall .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year . Histological cytological diagnosis advanced/metastatic breast , NSCLC , ovarian endometrial , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) Head Neck ( HNSCC ) cancer indication use paclitaxel carboplatin . For patient enrolled Part 1 , lesion may measurable non measurable ; patient enrol Part 2 , least one measurable lesion request . All patient must provide archive fresh tumor sample ; pair fresh tumor biopsy mandatory patient enrol Part 2 ( baseline Day 22 Cycle 1 ) . ECOG Performance Status must 0 1 . Adequate Bone Marrow Function , include : 1 . Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/mm3 ( ≥1.5 x 109/L ) ; 2 . Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 ( ≥100 x 109/L ) ; 3 . Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL . Adequate renal function , include : serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min calculate use method standard institution . Adequate Liver Function , include : 1 . Total serum bilirubin ≤1.0 mg/dL Aspartate Alanine Aminotransferase AST &amp; ALT ) ≤2.5 x ULN ; ≤5.0 x ULN liver involvement secondary tumor . 2 . Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN ; ( ≤5 x ULN case bone metastasis ) . Adequate glucose control , include previous diagnosis diabetes mellitus HbA1c &lt; 7 % . Adequate cardiac function , include : 12 Lead ECG normal trace non clinically significant change require medical intervention . Resolved acute effect prior therapy baseline severity Grade 1 CTCAE except AEs constitute safety risk Investigator judgment . Serum/urine pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) negative screen baseline . Female patient must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period trial least 90 day completion treatment . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period trial least 90 day completion treatment . The decision effective contraception base judgment principal Investigator designate associate . Willingness ability comply study schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test procedure . Written informed consent . More 2 prior line chemotherapy advance disease Part 1 , 1 prior line chemotherapy advance disease Part 2 . Resistance platinum agent ( progression treatment within 3 month stop treatment ) . Prior treatment weekly paclitaxel tumor progression . Preexisting neuropathy ≥ G2 . Patients know active brain metastasis . Patients previously diagnose brain metastasis eligible complete CNS treatment recover acute effect radiation therapy surgery prior start study medication , discontinue corticosteroid treatment metastasis least 4 week neurologically stable . Chemotherapy , radiotherapy ( palliative radiotherapy lesion follow tumor assessment study , ie , non target lesion ) , biological investigational agent within 4 week start study treatment ( 6 week mitomycin C nitrosoureas ) . Any surgery ( include minor procedure lymph node biopsy , needle biopsy , and/or placement portacath ) within 4 week start study treatment fully recover side effect previous procedure . For patient enrol Part 2 , prior therapy agent know propose active action PI3K and/or mTOR complete within last 6 month . Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease : A myocardial infarction within 12 month . Uncontrolled angina within 6 month . Congestive heart failure within 6 month . Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome . Any history ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular Fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) . Any history second third degree heart block ( may eligible currently pacemaker ) . Heart rate &lt; 50/minute pre entry electrocardiogram . Uncontrolled hypertension . Current use anticipate need food drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor . Because inhibition CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase PF 05212384 exposure lead potential increase toxicity , use know strong inhibitor ( strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : grapefruit juice grapefruit/grapefruit relate citrus fruit ( eg , Seville oranges , pomelo ) , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole , posaconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , telithromycin , verapamil , indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , nefazodone , lopinavir , atazanavir , amprenavir , fosamprenavir delavirdine , troleandomycin , mibefradil , conivaptan ) permit 10 day prior first dose study drug discontinuation . Concurrent administration herbal preparation current anticipate need food drug know substrate UGT1A9 ( eg , propofol , acetaminophen , propranolol ) , PF05212384 strong inhibitor , permit 10 day prior first dose study drug discontinuation . Current anticipate need food drug know potent CYP3A4 inducer . PF05212384 metabolism may induce take strong CYP3A4 inducer ( eg , phenobarbital , rifampin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifabutin , rifapentin , clevidipine , St. John 's Wort ) result reduce plasma concentration . Therefore co administration study drug combination strong CYP3A4 inducer permit 10 day prior first dose study drug study treatment discontinuation . Breast feeding intercurrent pregnancy ; use highly effective contraception agree continue highly effective contraception 90 day last dose investigational product . Any mental disorder would limit understand render informed consent and/or compromise compliance requirement protocol .</criteria>
