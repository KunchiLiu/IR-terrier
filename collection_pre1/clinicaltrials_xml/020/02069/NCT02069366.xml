	<detailed_description>The total time participant involve study 4 visit , outline : Visit 1 : Questionnaires , Screening , Orientation : During visit potential participant learn study procedure , sign inform consent document , fill packet form ask race ethnic background , use drug alcohol physical mental health . Visit 2 : Behavioral Tests : During visit participant complete several computer task , study staff measure reaction time psychophysiological measures.The task participant perform show three different image aversive stimulus ( e.g . loud burst noise mild wrist shock ) may follow one image time , image may never follow noise mild wrist shock . The participant need try predict whether aversive cue occur base image show ask repeatedly rate scale likely think noise/shock occur image . Lastly , session participant also ask report level anxiety scale 0 100 . Visit 3 : Behavioral Tests Drug Placebo MRI scan : For safety reason participant allow take drug least 24 hour visit , use marijuana least 2 week . Participants require pass urine drug test ( pregnancy test woman ) breathalyzer test allow continue visit . The participant also allow drive home visit , arrange friend family member pick taxi call research staff . The participant view image previous day ( Visit 2 ) , may experience aversive stimulus Visit 2 . The participant ask rate much expect experience aversive stimulus image also ask report level anxiety scale 0 100 . However , 2 hour task begin , participant ask swallow capsule contain either marijuana-like drug ( Dronabinol ) placebo ( sugar pill ) . Dronabinol Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug dose ( 7.5mg ; one time ) unlikely effect last beyond duration study visit . About every 30 minute take pill , participant fill questionnaires mood feeling moment . There three additional task participant perform visit well . The first task involve look unpleasant image scenes either maintain emotional response image , use technique study staff practice participant reinterpret content image less unpleasant way . The second task involve view series black white line draw single object decide whether would fit shoe box . The third task involve view white fixation cross black background participant relaxes . Visit 4 : Behavioral Tests MRI scan : This visit similar Visit 2 . Participants participate type task inside MRI scanner , study staff measure reaction time psychophysiological respond brain activation . Participants view image previously , may experience aversive stimulus Visit 2 . Participants ask rate much expect experience aversive stimulus image also ask report level anxiety scale 0 100 . Lastly participant also complete another decision make task involve single object similar previous day ( Visit 3 ) .</detailed_description>
