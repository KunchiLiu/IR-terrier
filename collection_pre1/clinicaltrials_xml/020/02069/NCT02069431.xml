	<brief_summary>The life expectancy old Americans continue increase , person age &gt; 65 year represent fast grow segment US population ( Manton et al. , 1995 ) . While prolongation life remain important public health goal , goal even great significance extend life involve preservation capacity live independently function well physically , cognitively , socioemotionally ( Katz et al. , 1983 ) . Therefore , identification proven intervention maintain function across domain prevent disability major public health challenge ( Branch et al. , 1991 ) . Greater physical cognitive independence old adult show crucially influence social integration old age ( Cornwell &amp; Waite , 2009 ) , result significant increase quality life reduction risk morbidity mortality , social stress , anxiety , depressive symptom ( Bassuk et al. , 1999 ; Seeman , 1996 ) . A promising candidate promote functional level across physical , cognitive , socioemotional domain neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) ( Barraza et al. , 2013 ; Bartz et al. , 2011 ; Feifel et al. , 2012 ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al. , 2011 ; Szeto et al. , 2012 ) . Combining neuroendocrine behavioral approach ( e.g. , performance-based measure physical cognitive function ) , propose multidisciplinary research therefore set clarify extent intranasal administration OT period 4 week reduce inflammation improve physical cognitive function old men . Constituting complementary piece IRB approve currently ongoing Faces Study ( IRB # 39-2013 ) , project also allow examination interaction OT 's effect physical health , cognition , socioemotional function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview : - Initial screen visit - 3 baseline study visit - 4-week treatment phase - 3 study visit treatment - Follow-up phone contact All study visit conduct Institute Aging McKnight Brain Institute University Florida . The treatment phase take place participant 's home . The participant assign chance receive either oxytocin placebo . The placebo substance , like salt water , look like give way oxytocin contain oxytocin . Neither participant research assistant know type dose get . This information cod securely store away data analyzed , information available need . Screening Visit : Together information obtain phone pre-screening investigator already conduct , main purpose screen visit find participant eligible participate study . - The investigator ask participant question health condition recent activity investigator review participant 's current past medical health well education live situation . - The participant short physical exam license physician include measurement blood pressure pulse , brief consultation go participant 's medical review . This clinical doctor visit routine medical care , visit confirm participant 's eligibility participate study . Next , participant 's vision test . The participant ask view rotate C-shape identify direction break C face . The C get large small depend participant 's response another task shade grey C background vary . Then physical status participant determine base follow activity : - The participant ask walk his/her usual pace distance 13 foot ( 4 meter ) two ( 2 ) separate time . - The participant ask stand sit position , without use arm . If able perform task , ask stand sit chair five ( 5 ) time fast . - The participant ask maintain balance stand three different position , 1 ) foot together , 2 ) heel one foot beside big toe foot , 3 ) heel one foot front touch toe foot . - A blood draw ( ~30milileters ~2 tablespoon ) urine collection ( ~2mL ~0.14 tb ) follow . Result blood or/and urine testing may indicate participant participate study . The blood test also use determine level oxytocin occur normally participant 's blood determine level inflammation body . If incidental clinically significant finding occur , investigator inform give copy lab result . The participant also encourage see primary care physician . - Some blood saliva sample ( ~2mL ~ 0.14 tb ) participant ask provide help find activity gene may impact perform test . All sample store locked space Institute Aging . Baseline Visit 1 : - The investigator ask participant engage series test answer questionnaire related physical , auditory ( hear ) , social emotional functioning . - The first test learn remember task . This follow Physical Test Battery : - The participant ask walk 6 minute . - The participant also ask walk distance 33 foot ( 10 meter ) three time . They ask walk distance another three time count loud . - The participant ask perform upper- lower-body muscle strength endurance assessment - The participant ask respond various questionnaire related physical health . Auditory Test Battery The participant ask complete task require listen attend desire stimuli presence compete message noise . Socioemotional Test Battery The participant ask complete questionnaire measure social emotional health , include question measure current mood , general level trust , level loneliness , drive identify emotion thoughts others respond appropriate emotion . These question also measure participant 's selflessness concern well-being others , emotional attention clarity , anxiety level , personality . Baseline Visit 2 : - At begin visit , ask participant recent activity . - The participant ask participate electroencephalography ( EEG ) record session , record electrical activity along scalp . An EEG cap , select participant 's head size , place head . The cap contain small electrode record brain electrical activity . During part study , participant sit chair watch picture computer screen listen sound headphone , rest . - While record EEG , participant 's eye movement monitor eye tracker . The eye-tracking camera place front brief calibration procedure track participant 's eye movement view stimulus screen hear sound . - Before task start , participant receive detail information chance ask question may task EEG eye tracking procedure . The participant also chance work practice trial . - After EEG eye track recording , investigator ask participant amount pain experience last 6 month . - This followed brief sensory testing . In particular , investigator apply pressure several sit participant 's face body . The pressure slowly increase , participant ask tell investigator begin feel discomfort mild pain . As soon participant indicates feel pain , pressure remove . Also , investigator tap participant small nylon tip knee back hand ask participant indicate painful feel . The investigator twice site . Baseline Visit 3 : - At begin visit , investigator ask participant recent activity . - If participant assign MRI/MRS portion study investigator ensure eligible safe participate scan session day . - The participant practice task work MRI scanner . The task involve view geometrical shape , face , image object scene . The participant receive detail information chance ask question may task MRI procedure go scanner . - At point , participant shuttle McKnight Brain Institute , get settle MRI scanner , assistance train researcher . - While participant rest comfortably scanner , investigator ask work task mention MRI machine produce image brain , well scan brain rest . The participant scanner le 60 minute . - The investigator ask participant engage series test respond questionnaire related memory think process . - This Cognitive Test Battery comprises : - Tasks ask participant attend , respond , remember various stimulus computer screen paper . Intervention Phase : - The participant self-administer either oxytocin placebo nose use nasal spray bottle . The spray administer twice day 4 week . The investigator give participant guidance administer spray ask keep log book oxytocin/placebo administration . - In addition , treatment phase investigator ask participant fill short diary social activity engage day well emotions experience . - In Week 1 4 intervention phase , participant fit device ( i.e. , bio-harness ) allow investigator measure physiological function participant 's body heart rate breathing rate , period 24 hour participant engages daily activity . The participant ask wear typical day , representative normal daily activity . The 24-hour period one participant travel town . A trained research assistant visit participant home fit take bio-harness . The bio-harness comfortably fit chest strap around participant 's upper body . It generally affect clothes participant wear , water resistant , participant able pursue large majority daily activity usual manner . - During treatment phase , research assistant call participant week ask whether experience drug side effect problem health . Post-Treatment Visit 1 : - The investigator ask participant question health condition recent activity . - The participant physically examine ( include vitals ) supervision license physician . - Another blood draw ( ~30mL ~2 tb ) conduct run blood test determine level oxytocin treatment phase well level inflammation participant 's body . Urine ( ~2mL ~0.14 tb ) collect ensure adverse change occur treatment phase . The sample store locked space Institute Aging . - The investigator ask participant engage series test respond questionnaire related recent activity well physical , auditory ( hear ) , social emotional functioning . These measure similar one intervention phase . Post-Intervention Visit 2 : - At begin visit , investigator ask participant recent activity . - The investigator ask participant participate ERP eye track recording similar one treatment phase . - The investigator also ask participant engage series test respond questionnaire related memory think process . These measure similar one treatment phase . - This followed brief sensory testing , similar one take place treatment phase . Post-Intervention Visit 3 : - At begin visit , investigator ask participant recent activity . - If participant assign MRI/MRS portion study investigator ensure participant eligible safe participate scan session day . The participant practice task work MRI scanner , similar one engage treatment phase . - At point , participant shuttle McKnight Brain Institute , get settle MRI scanner , assistance train researcher . - The participant scanner le 60 minute . - The investigator ask participant engage series test respond questionnaire related memory thought process , similar one engage treatment phase . - Upon completion study , investigator tell participant general goal study answer question may 1-Week Follow-Up Phone Call : - A research assistant call participant one week participant 's last study visit inquire whether experienced drug side effect health problem . The genetic material obtain blood , saliva , urine sample store end study . By temporarily store genetic material , investigator able examine importance different oxytocin gene well gene yet know involved people think behave . When longer sufficient amount blood , saliva , urine sample analysis , sample become degraded , participant request write sample destroyed , remain genetic material destroyed . The genetic material accessible research staff label identification number , participant 's name . The University Florida sell sample use DNA cloning .</detailed_description>
