	<detailed_description>Depending emerge safety data Phase 1a study 54F28-001 continue dose escalation , additional high dose level OMP-54F28 may evaluate study . Alternative dose schedule OMP-54F28 may explore base emerge nonclinical clinical data safety , PD , PK efficacy . The start dose new dose schedule choose result AUC equivalent high dose level clear previously study dosing schedule . No dose escalation OMP-54F28 allow within dose cohort . Sorafenib 400 mg give orally twice daily ( PO BID ) . Sorafenib dose schedule total daily dose &lt; 800 mg ( e.g . Sorafenib 400 mg daily ) may evaluate study depend emerge safety data study .</detailed_description>
