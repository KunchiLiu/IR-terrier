	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery procedure promote weight loss limit amount food consume reduction size stomach decrease absorption nutrient reorganize bypass portion small intestine . Among procedure use induce weight loss , sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) initially develop early 90 's restrictive component biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch ( BPD-DS ) . It offer laparoscopy staged-approach order reduce peri-operative complication high-risk patient . The second step surgery ( i.e . duodenal switch ) plan sufficient weight loss obtain . However , observe patient experience appreciable weight loss SG alone , require second-stage surgery , thus avoid side-effects malabsorptive surgery . This lead surge popularity SG stand-alone operation , relative technical simplicity , feasibility , good outcome . Multiple mechanism postulate induce metabolic recovery weight loss follow surgery . The independent effect component BPD-DS SG never investigate human within well-controlled study design . The general objective present project assess impact component BPD-DS SG , either combine separate , physiological variable potentially responsible metabolic recovery . Patients randomize undergo one three surgical sequence : 1 ) SG follow BPD-DS one year later ; 2 ) BPD-DS follow SG one year later ; 3 ) SG BPD-DS within single operation . A series test perform baseline , 1 year , 2 year initial surgery . We propose two Specific Aims asses 1 ) impact surgical component hormonal determinant metabolic recovery ; 2 ) impact weight loss response subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue function improvement . This project help good understand mechanism underlie metabolic recovery follow weight loss surgery .</brief_summary>
