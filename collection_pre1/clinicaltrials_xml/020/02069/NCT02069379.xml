	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance , primary component metabolic syndrome , escalate phenomenon United States , confers increase risk depression mood disorder , particularly woman . The relationship metabolic mood disorder may mediate endogenous opioid activity limbic brain region . We propose examine affective state μ- opioid system function insulin resistant woman , change response insulin sensitize treatment , follow specific aim hypothesis : Establish relationship insulin resistance , affective state , μ-opioid receptor function . 1 . Insulin resistant woman great μ-opioid receptor availability baseline , large response stress challenge non-insulin resistant woman 2 . Insulin resistant woman great negative affective state baseline , great emotional response stress challenge non-insulin resistant woman . 3 . Mediational analysis reveal relationship insulin resistance negative affect mediate μ-opioid receptor function neural activation amygdala nucleus accumbens affect-regulating region . Examine effect insulin regulation μ-opioid receptor function affective state . 1 . Improved insulin sensitivity accompany decreased μ-opioid receptor availability baseline reduce response stress challenge . Degree change baseline receptor availability response stress challenge treatment correlate degree insulin regulation . 2 . Improved insulin sensitivity associate improved affective state baseline , reduce emotional response stress challenge . Degree change affective state emotional response stress challenge treatment correlate degree insulin regulation . 3 . Mediational analysis reveal change affective state insulin regulation mediate change μ-opioid receptor function neural activation amygdala nucleus accumbens . The expected result would suggest role endogenous μ-opioid system mediate relationship metabolic function emotional process .</brief_summary>
