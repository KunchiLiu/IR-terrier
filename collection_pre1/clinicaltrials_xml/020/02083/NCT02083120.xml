	<brief_summary>The effect nasal high-flow ( NHF ) therapy patient chronic obstructive hypercapnic respiratory failure still sufficiently know yet . The aim study step-by-step generation physiological data gas exchange respiration high flow therapy use nasal cannula AIRVO 2 device provide NHF , lead analysis effect high flow PCO2 level , exercise capacity , quality life gas exchange long term home treatment compare standard low flow long term oxygen therapy ( LOT ) . Hypothesis : NHF LOT therapy show difference measure mean overnight transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure ( PCO2 ) four week treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage 1 : Respiratory Physiology . Aim Stage investigate effect nasal High Flow ( NHF ) therapy patient progress stage COPD , measure physiologic parameter like tidal volume , breathe frequency expiratory PCO2 concentration . Stage 2 : Efficacy short term NHF . Aim Stage evaluate efficacy two flow rate ( 20 L/min 35 L/min ) regard alveolar ventilation overnight therapy . For reason , patient two PSG sleep study hospital stay , 20 L/min 35 L/min NHF therapy randomize order . Stage 3 : Home Care monitoring . Aim Stage compare long term influence NHF LOT PCO2 level randomise crossover , 4 week treatment . Stage 4 : Long Term Home Care monitoring . Aim stage long term follow ( 12 month ) patient examine compliance sufficient NHF therapy . Patients retain NHF therapy responder ( PCO2 improvement stage 3 least 2 mmHG NHF versus LOT ) willing able use NHF patient log . All patient monitor next 12 month . After 6 month control phone call .</detailed_description>
