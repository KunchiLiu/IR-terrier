	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity class II III increase rapidly past 25 year Canada USA . This alarm situation significantly increase number bariatric surgery perform North America ( 101,645 surgery 2011 ) . Indeed , bariatric surgery demonstrate long-term efficacy maintain significant weight loss lower mortality , reduce health-care cost obesity . Unfortunately , bariatric surgery always present optimal result term weight loss resolution comorbidities , may cause perioperative complication . The effectiveness bariatric surgery number perioperative complication influence various factor initial weight physical fitness/activity . For reason , various expert recommend regular physical activity order optimize result bariatric surgery decrease perioperative morbidity . However , interventional study include pre-surgery exercise training available literature . Preliminary result show supervised Pre-Surgical Exercise Training ( PreSET ) feasible improve physical fitness quality life decrease embarrassment exercise ( Baillot et al . 2013 ) . However , 71.3 % ( n = 57 ) patient refuse participate PreSET explain refusal schedule , reduce mobility distance hospital . Telehealth grow often use rehabilitation cardiac pulmonary patient . Indeed , allow provide equal access care people geographically remote physically economically disadvantage . Studies show telehealth improve quality health care , may effective face face meeting improve health patient . The recent decrease cost related equipment make intervention modality accessible . However , study available subject await bariatric surgery . Hypothesis Objectives : Investigators hypothesize Telehealth Pre-Surgical Exercise Training ( telePreSET ) feasible improve health , physical fitness , quality life , compliance satisfaction subject . The aim study evaluate feasibility `` Clinique medico-chirurgicale du traitement de l'obésité de Sherbrooke '' ( CMCTO ) telePreSET impact health , physical fitness , quality life satisfaction subject . Method : 6 subject await bariatric surgery recruit . In addition usual care , subject perform bariatric surgery additional session supervise endurance resistance exercise training . Subjects instructed perform two supervise exercise session per week telehealth plus one without supervision 12 week . The following outcome assess different group telePreSET , 12 month bariatric surgery : 1- physical fitness ( 6MWT , maximal strength , symptom-limited cardiac exercise test ) ; 2-health related quality life ( Laval questionnaire ) ; 3-weight , height , body composition ( bioelectrical impedance scale ) ; 4-comorbidities metabolic parameter ( file blood sample ) ; 5-exercise belief ( Physical Exercise Belief questionnaire ) ; 6-physical activity ( GPA Questionnaire actimeter ) . The feasibility assess satisfaction questionnaire concern PA management , dropout compliance rate , well number injury accident . Issue : The result research give u preliminary data future project order improve support bariatric surgery candidate assure optimal result health . Also , contribute advancement scientific knowledge , absent current literature population .</detailed_description>
