	<brief_title>Comparison Between Rigid Functional And Elastic Bandage For Stabilizing Ankle Support During The Member Of The Chute Football</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The popular sport worldwide football , therefore , interest detect factor may interfere practice . These factor already investigated literature , particular kick , gesture perform frequently , whereas situation achieve main goal : score . For particular effort need balance run , base body balance ankle joint , responsible sense position movement body . Any deficit joint may interfere functional performance individual . The football player use rigid elastic bandage prevent optimize performance . The use bandage different condition study , however analyze performed sport gesture scarce . Therefore , study aim evaluate influence two type bandage ankle dynamic balance activity power support limb kick biomedical instrumentation muscle . Participate study 180 individual practice football , half consist professional athlete half consist sedentary individual commit sport football point life , age 20 35 year sexes . All perform task control shot force platform one foot . Electrical activity electromyography superf√≠ciedos long short fibular muscle , tibialis anterior gluteus medius collect . The Gesture Controlled Shooting ( GCC ) consist follow phase : - At signal researcher , individual go center platform reach , stand one foot execution kick , whereupon cycle throughout GCC ; - After shoot ball vertically , participant expect reach maximum height descent ball , run kick member support platform , shall hold convenient time hit target ; - The effort must make medial region foot ; - The goal task hit ball target , accurately ; - After foot contact ball execution kick , individual remain leg support visual focus direct target moment search signal leave platform foot hold kick following foot contact force platform ; - Cycle task complete . 18 kick perform , 9 dominant leg 9 non-dominant low limb follow situation : without bandage , bandage rigid elastic bandage . To analyze data , use ANOVA test significance level 5 % . After test , correlation also carry Pearson data obtain three situation shoot . Therefore expected dynamic balance muscle activation influence positively use different type tap , possibly show kind application effective use sport football .</detailed_description>
