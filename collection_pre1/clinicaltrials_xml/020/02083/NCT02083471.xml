	<brief_title>Cow 's Milk Hen 's Egg Hyposensitization Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Egg , milk cereal allergy important food allergy Finnish child , prevalence western country 1-4 % . In individual food-allergy maintain adulthood . The mainstay treatment IgE-mediated milk egg allergy avoidance diet carry epinephrine injector case allergic reaction . Avoidance diet difficult negative effect quality life . Accidentally milk egg cause life-threatening reaction , even lead death . Recent study suggest specific oral tolerance induction ( SOTI ) provide treatment option child continue allergy high success rate . It obvious oral immunotherapy impact milk egg specific immune response , mechanism treatment study little effect cell molecular level practically unknown . There neither laboratory study monitor efficacy predict outcome advance early stage treatment . No research data available humoral IgE , IgG4 Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) responses cell-mediated cytokine response induce individual major cow 's milk egg allergen component oral immunotherapy . No tool exist forecast outcome treatment . Aims The study aim specific oral tolerance induction adult allergic cow 's milk hen 's egg . Oral immunotherapy involve take small amount allergen , slowly increase amount . Consequently , elimination diet may wholly partially cancel , without fear serious allergic reaction . Another aim explore change antibody-mediated cell-mediated immune response individual component cow 's milk egg allergens tolerance induction compare effect treatment . Materials methods The study recruit 40 adult patient either milk egg allergy . Eligibility criterion : 1 ) adult 16 year , 2 ) elevate serum level specific IgE ( ≥ 5 kU/l , ( kilounit per liter ) milk egg ) positive skin-prick- test ( ≥ 5 mm , milk egg ) , 3 ) positive milk- egg-challenge . The recruited subject meet entry criterion randomize tolerance induction group receive milk egg ( n = 20 ) control group follow avoidance diet ( n = 20 ) . Oral immunotherapy involve initially take small amount allergen , slowly increase amount gradually maintenance dose reach . Up-dosing monitored hospital . Thereafter , patient continue daily use milk egg home . Skin-prick-tests milk egg specific allergen component perform , symptom questionnaire fill blood sample take commencement study , maintenance dose reach 12 month initiation study . Patient visit carry outpatient clinic part normal routine . Commercially available ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Phadia ) specific allergen component examine ( IgE IgG4 ) , well IgA , IgA1 IgA2 . Cow 's milk allergen component : alfa-lactalbumin , beta-lactoglobulin , casein , lactoferrin bovine serum albumin , egg allergen component : ovomucoid , ovalbumin , conalbumin lysozyme . Mononuclear leukocytes isolated blood sample culture 37 ° C incubator 10^6 cell per millilitre RPMI ( Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium ) medium contain 5 % autologous plasma cow ' milk allergen component : alfa-lactalbumin , beta-lactoglobulin , bovine serum albumin , casein lactoferrin , egg allergen component : ovomucoid , ovalbumin , conalbumin lysozyme . Mitogen use positive control medium without stimulation negative control . Milk egg allergen component clean Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removal Gel column ( Thermo Scientific Pierce Chemicals ) remove effect endotoxins cell stimulation . Lymphoproliferation study use three parallel sample cytokine expression study use two parallel sample ( Luminex/Lincoplex : interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , IL-5 , IL-10 , IL-12 , IL-13 , IL-17 , IL-18 , IL-22 , IL-23 , IL-27 , interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) transform growth factor beta ( TGF-β ) ) . Ethical consideration Study follow instruction regulation use biomedical research . The Turku University Ethics committee approve study 15th February 2011 . Each participant give write informed consent . Research participation voluntary may suspend without reason time study refusal termination shall affect patient 's treatment . Patient sample data collect process store accord instruction regulation use biomedical research . Estimate , schedule result Patient visit carry outpatient clinic part normal reception allergy patient entail additional cost patient . The expense relate antibody-mediated cell-mediated immune response study cover external funding . The study begin autumn 2014 aim complete spring 2016 . The result publish international scientific journal .</detailed_description>
