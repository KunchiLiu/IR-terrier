	<brief_summary>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) significant risk factor dementia . Persons MCI experience cognitive change , typically affect memory ; great experience `` normal '' age . However , cognitive change MCI , unlike dementia , significant enough markedly interfere functional independence . In addition cognitive change , people MCI also experience elevate symptom depression anxiety , add risk develop dementia . Close family also impact relative 's MCI show mild physical ( e.g. , increased incidence systemic health problem high blood pressure ) mental health decline ( e.g. , elevate symptom associate depression anxiety ) similar , though severe , experienced caregiver relative dementia . Programs aim behavioural intervention real potential reduce and/or prevent negative health outcome associate MCI future dementia promote positive behaviour change . We wish scientifically establish utility behavioural intervention aim address need person MCI close family member , ultimate goal lower current future susceptibility mental health decline chronic disease people live MCI . We 8 session ( 16 hour ) program , participant MCI close relative together first half session , devote primarily enable positive lifestyle choice . In second hour group split , MCI client engage memory train close family member participate psychosocial intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Intervention Living With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following outcome multicomponent behavioural intervention expect . MCI participants show : 1 ) Improved functional memory 2 ) Increased engagement leisure activity 2 ) Improved instrumental activity daily live 4 ) A reduction neuropsychiatric symptom ( e.g. , depress mood , irritability ) Family member MCI relatives show : 1 . Improvement ability adapt effectively manage challenge pose live relative experience cognitive decline 2 . Improvement mood 3 . Improvement one health relate behaviour These expect outcome base previously present pilot show improved ability deal problem face cognitive decline due MCI , previous research one u demonstrate self-perceptions well problem solve skill associate positive intervention outcome , previous research show improvement mood well-being dementia caregiver follow psychosocial intervention , previous finding improve memory knowledge strategy use people MCI experience similar intervention . In research expect outcome additionally investigate follow hypothesis : 1 . The degree cognitive , functional , neuropsychiatric impairment exhibit MCI client baseline influence degree benefit experience MCI client family member expect outcomes outline . . In MCI client degree impairment may limit gain achieve great impairment may reduce ability self-initiate sustain behavior change . ii . Conversely , family member , degree impairment MCI relative may enhance gain achieve past research suggest family member whose relative MCI exhibit great neuropsychiatric symptom may gain early intervention , family member report significant depressive symptom time spend provide support . 2 . Based past research expect level program participation ( e.g. , attendance , engagement program material exercise ) influence degree benefit experience MCI client family member outcome measure . METHODS Participant Identification Recruitment . Participants propose research consent individual MCI close family member , recruit referral clinical program . After referral receive , program begin , research assistant telephone individual MCI identify family member order explain study , obtain verbal consent , gather preliminary demographic information . To confirm potential MCI participant meet accept clinical research criterion amnestic MCI ( either single multiple domain ) complete clinical assessment , include clinical interview brief cognitive testing , 3 month prior start participation program . Clinical assessment result review two clinical neuropsychologists ( KM , AT ) involve initial development and/or continue provision clinical program , extensive experience diagnose MCI research purpose . In addition ensure MCI participant meet recognize criterion amnestic MCI , descriptive data use investigate previously mention hypothesis examine predictor effectiveness . To clarify , family member permit participate relative diagnose MCI clinical triage process ( interview plus brief cognitive assessment ) . A family member would still welcome participate program relative MCI decline attend drop , although date yet happen . Notably , program clinical service , volunteer research study require participation program . Design . This study use randomize waitlist control design . Because heavy demand clinical program , naturally-occurring waitlist approximately 3 month . Thus , three month prior new program session , research volunteer program 's clinical waitlist randomly assign waitlist-control treatment group use random number generator . This random assignment conduct volunteer complete baseline test . Research show baseline test influenced participant knowledge expectation indeed pilot test show influence whereby treatment group report poor functional skill compare waitlist group absence discernible group difference . Thus , design attempt control influence anticipate treatment outcome measure treatment waitlist-control group undergo three evaluation time period : baseline pre-test random assignment ; repeat test 10 week ( serve post-test measure waitlist control group repeat-pre-test measure treatment group ) repeat test 20 week ( serve post-test measure treatment group 1 month follow-up repeat post-test measure waitlist group ) . The group comparison allow u determine efficacy program comparison program examine waitlist-control group test schedule 1 versus test schedule 2 , treatment group test schedule 2 versus test schedule 3 . All individual , regardless initial group assignment , tested involvement program permit u determine individual difference degree benefit obtain program . Although 3-month follow-up session current program format , test time period include experimental design control group comparison due program frequency ( 4 per year ) length naturally occur waitlist ( 3 month ) . To determine effectiveness intervention , use battery include paper-and-pencil questionnaire fill home , telephone interview , on-site group test . Sample size . Sample size estimate MCI intervention determine base previous research ; caregiver intervention , calculate use effect size ( g ) meta-analysis Cohen 's power table . For behavioural intervention aim MCI , previous research show large significant behavioural change ( Î·p2 = .28 - .33 ) sample size 24 per group . For caregiver intervention similar nature , effect size improvement variety outcome measure range g = .22 .52 . For comparison use alpha .05 power .80 , estimate statistically significant effect sample size 30 46 per population group small effect ( i.e. , measure mood ) less 8 per group large effect ( i.e. , measure cop ) . Given multiple comparison , plan recruit 60 ( 30 MCI , 30 family member ) treatment group 60 ( 30 MCI , 30 family member ) waitlist control group . Based recent annual attendance 111 people clinical program ( 66 MCI 45 family ) , anticipate difficulty recruit number participant two year grant period . Based drop-out rate 11 % previous study , recruit 144 ( 72 MCI 72 family member ) two year order retain 120 ( 60 MCI 60 family member ) participant final sample . Analyses . Prior conduct analysis impute miss data SAS v 9.2 use multiple imputation method assume miss data miss random ( MAR ) miss completely random ( MCAR ) . This model-based strategy miss data provide significantly well parameter estimate strategy mean substitution listwise deletion miss case . To test hypothesis intervention result improved leisure engagement , mood , functional skill MCI improve health-related behaviour , mood , adaptive problem solve family member separately consider MCI participant family member examine program effectiveness compare treatment waitlist-control group respective post-test assessment measure use repeat measure analyse covariance ; baseline score use covariates order reduce between-subject variance enhance detection between-group difference . We also perform qualitative thematic analysis response social validity measure evaluate clinical significance intervention provide information improvement intervention . To test hypothesis influence cognitive behavioural characteristic MCI participant intervention outcomes [ namely MCI client great impairment show least benefit ; however , family member show benefit ] use multiple regression investigate factor moderate change family member ' health behaviour , mood , adaptive skill MCI participant leisure activity engagement , mood , functional skill . Specifically , examine predictive contribution ( ) MCI client 's ability ( degree neuropsychiatric symptomatology level everyday functioning , obtain self family report , level cognitive impairment , obtain direct assessment MCI client ) , ( ii ) MCI client ' intervention-related change memory strategy knowledge use ( objective self-report measure obtain directly MCI client ) benefit obtain measure outcome measure change score pre-test post-test . Feasibility . The program offer regular clinical service , free cost participant , four program offer year . In past year , 86 client MCI 67 family member participate . We currently 13 MCI client 12 family member waitlist next series begin April , addition list occur almost daily . Although participation research requirement attendance clinical program , high rate past participant recruitment people access intervention program , demonstrate previous program evaluation . The assembled team clinician researcher significant clinical expertise normal abnormal cognitive aging , design implement effective cognitive intervention normal neurological population , health outcome associate caregiving caregiver intervention . Drs . Murphy ( lead investigator ) Rowe ( neuropsychologists ) Ms. Climans ( social worker ) directly involve craft current provision program execute research study . Drs . Troyer ( neuropsychologist also involve craft intervention protocol ) , MacKenzie ( psychologist ) , Dawson ( scientist background occupational therapy ) provide ongoing consultation regard project execution , measurement outcome , analysis interpretation finding base relevant area expertise .</detailed_description>
