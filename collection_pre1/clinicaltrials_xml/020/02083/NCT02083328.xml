	<brief_summary>The aim investigate influence caffeine heart rate variability performance 3 min exercise test different population group ( able-bodied , paraplegic tetraplegic subject ) . In general , investigator interested difference heart rate variability caffeine supplementation subject exercise performance enhance use type supplementation . Another objective see whether difference able-bodied disabled subject . Tetraplegic subject show previous study Low-Frequency-component ( LF ) heart rate variability increase catecholamine ingestion caffeine . Therefore investigator think , tetraplegic subject ` show ergogenic effect exercise performance intake caffeine . On hand , paraplegic subject show similar difference heart rate variability ingestion caffeine able-bodied subject . Paraplegic subject benefit caffeine supplementation increase exercise performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct placebo-controlled , double-blind randomise study protocol . Every subject undergo three test session sport medicine Nottwil . At first visit , investigator check subject fitness use health questionnaire specific question disease family health history . Additionally , subject perform maximal exercise test ( ramp protocol arm crank ergometer ) measure maximal oxygen uptake , maximal heart rate maximal power output . After little break , subject perform familiarization trial arm crank ergometer . They perform exactly test perform later two test session . Minimum two day later subject visit sport medicine Nottwil first test session . At first , answer specific question sleep , recent training , recent nutritional intake actual health condition . Afterwards , lie 10min rest 9min blood pressure measure . With heart rate monitor HRV measure 5 min supine position afterwards 6 min sit position . Metronomic breathing ( 15x/min ) mandatory simulate metronome . During HRV measurement also tidal volume measure . As first HRV measurement session finish , blood withdrawal take measure catecholamine concentration . Then , measurement complete , supplement ( either caffeine placebo ) ingest gelatine capsule . After ingestion capsule , subject 40 min break read something relax . During 40 min physical activity ingestion nutrition prohibit . After 40min , second HRV measurement start . The process measurement exactly first HRV measurement . They lay 10min rest blood pressure measurement 9 min . Afterwards 5min HRV measurement supine position 6min measurement sit position . Tidal volume measure HRV measurement . When second HRV measurement session finish , second blood withdrawal take . That mean , one hour ingestion either placebo caffeine , catecholamine analyse second time . If blood take , warm start . After standardised warm lactate concentration blood analyse take 10 ul blood earlobe . The subject ask evaluate warm rate perceive exertion ( follow Borg scale ) . If everything order , 3min exercise test start . During test , respiratory parameter measure use Oxycon Pro device ( device measure oxygen consumption ) . Just finish 3 min exercising , second time lactate concentration measure rate exertion use Borg scale . After short 5min break third HRV measurement start . Again HRV measure 5min time supine position 6min time sit position . Tidal volume measure whole HRV measurement . With HRV measurement first test session finish second test session conduct least two day later randomise manner . The first session familiarization trial finish around 75 min . For two test session subject sport medicine around 2 hour . In follow chart , test session visually display . The administrated dose caffeine define 6mg per kg bodyweight subject . Caffeine fill gelatine capsule . Also placebo ( Mannitol ) fill gelatine capsule subject ingest amount capsule supplement . 30 subject test total . In group 10 subject participate . That mean 10 healthy able-bodied subject , 10 tetraplegic ( C5-7 , American Impairment Score ( AIS ) A ) 10 paraplegic ( sub Th8 , AIS A ) subject test . As easy find 10 physically active , completely injured tetraplegic subject , number 10 subject sufficient pilot study . As investigator know previous study conduct disabled subject , level lesion one critical point . Therefore , investigator try include subject almost lesion level sensory motoric completely lesioned . This could aid u homogenous group different population . Inclusion criterion : healthy , non-smoking men , minimal 3x45min physical activity per week , tetraplegic ( C5 C7 ) paraplegic ( sub Th8 ) , complete lesion , 6 month rehabilitation program Exclusion : drug supplement influence heart rate variability , Diabetes</detailed_description>
