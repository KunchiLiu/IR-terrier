	<brief_title>Evaluation Protective Efficacy Vaccine Derived From Synthetic CS Protein Plasmodium Vivax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective control , blind clinical trial , design establish protective efficacy induce vaccine PvCSP human volunteer without history malaria . Study subject This study require involvement two type volunteer : - Parasite donor : 5-15 P. vivax-infected patient serve parasite donor experimental infection mosquito , enrol endemic area . - Volunteers immunization : Two group volunteer immunized vaccine PvCSP . A group 16 people without previous exposure malaria ( naive ) another 16 people history previous malaria infection ( pre-immune ) . Methodology Recruitment infect patient : Parasite donor recruit among P. vivax infect patient attend diagnostic center endemic area . Infection mosquitoes Blood donor use feed three day old mosquito artificial membrane feeding technique . At day 7 sample mosquito examine determine degree infection dissection mosquito gut . On day 14 , small amount mosquito good degree infectivity use infect challenge volunteer . Recruitment pre-immune naive volunteer : Volunteers immunization stage recruit city Cali , non-endemic region , Buenaventura , malaria endemic region , various activity conference , meeting mean approved IRB like poster flyer . Immunization : Volunteers immunize vaccine ( n=16 ) placebo ( n=16 ) . Follow Up Volunteers medical vigilance first hour follow immunization detect adverse reaction . After first hour period medical exam make . Eight hour immunization , volunteer telephone assess physical condition . Any adverse event ( AE ) register . Subsequent follow make day next immunization 1 2 week next immunization new clinical evaluation AE report . Volunteers educate contact research staff moment . Infection volunteer Immunized volunteer challenge day ~150 study , 1 month third immunization bite 3±1 infected mosquito . The `` feeding cage '' place forearm volunteer 10 minute , allow feed window , wich cover mesh surface place volunteer 's skin . Volunteers educate sign symptom malaria daily telephone contact first 6 day . Between day 7 23 volunteer ask go Clinical Trials Unit daily order establish presence absence disease thick blood smear sample collect retrospective real time PCR P. vivax . From day 23 day 31 , volunteer receive physical laboratory evaluation every day daily telephone contact . Once patient present sign symptom disease curative treatment immediately provide , 15 ml blood drawn , use immune response assessment . If volunteer develop disease follow-up period , day 31 give antimalarial treatment . Treatment Volunteers treat antimalarial drug approve Colombian Ministry Social Protection : chloroquine ( three ( 3 ) dos : 600 mg initially , follow 450mg 24 , 48 hour ) , associate primaquine ( 30mg/día ) 14 day . All volunteer ask return two week start treatment thick blood smear test ensure cure malaria .</detailed_description>
