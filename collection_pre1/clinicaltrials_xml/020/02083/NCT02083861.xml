	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure effectiveness wearable therapeutic ultrasound device patient stage I stage II knee osteoarthritis . The ability device reduce pain , increase mobility , increase range motion muscle strength affect leg , improve quality life patient knee osteoarthritis evaluate . While use ultrasound treat pain establish field , ability deliver low intensity , therapeutic ultrasound daily basis new . The use wearable ultrasound device deliver daily , low intensity , long duration ultrasound approve FDA pain relief , relief joint contracture , relief muscle spasm , increased circulation ; however , yet indicate relief knee osteoarthritis . The interventional device study self-applied patient worn daily 4 hour continuous therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable LITUS Device Osteoarthritis Knee : Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This eight week study clinically evaluate effect low intensity long duration ( LITUS ) ultrasound device symptom patient suffer knee osteoarthritis . The device , SamÂ® FDA-cleared use . For first two week study , baseline data collect patient report pain score ( VAS ) actigraph worn patient digitally record mobility data . During follow 6 week , patient self-apply wearable low intensity ultrasound device affect knee 4 hour daily . Each day study , pain score ( VAS ) mobility data ( actigraph ) record . A quality life assessment ( WOMAC ) , muscle strength range motion assessment ( JTech ) perform prior patient begin protocol conclusion protocol . 80 subject recruit neighbor community study site . The study design reach target patient population include rural citizen socioeconomic disadvantaged individual non-pharmacotherapies exist manage pain . Subjects randomly assign active ( 60 % ) placebo group ( 40 % ) . The sponsor investigator blind type device patient assign . The study monitor external monitor data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) .</detailed_description>
