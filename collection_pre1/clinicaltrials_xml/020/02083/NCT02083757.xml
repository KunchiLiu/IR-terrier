	<brief_title>Fluid Responsiveness Predicted PtcO2 Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical determination intravascular volume extremely difficult critically ill patient . Although hemodynamic maximization propose , approach associate risk fluid overload excessive inotropic support . Therefore , fluid optimization see significant step forward show decrease complication . Significant effort devote define develop simple mean predict fluid responsiveness , i.e . whether patient benefit fluid administration . Passive leg raise ( PLR ) , bedside perform test , could use accurately predict fluid responsiveness condition . However , parameter provide information fluid responsiveness volume expansion PLR invasive time-consuming . A completely noninvasive atraumatic parameter predict fluid responsiveness might need urgently . Transcutaneous partial pressure oxygen ( PtcO2 ) , measure detect tissue ischemia inadequate perfusion , might reflect change cardiac output , thus predict fluid responsiveness . The purpose study study feasibility predict fluid responsiveness transcutaneous partial pressure oxygen critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
