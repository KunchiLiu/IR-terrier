	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate utility treating patient experience poor graft function allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize peripheral stem cell combine ( PBSC ) ex-vivo-expanded BM-drived mesenchymal stem cell third-party donor . Our first objective evaluate effect treatment poor graft function , second object investigate safety treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Combined With Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment Poor Graft Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) cure many hematologic disease . However , poor graft function ( PGF ) important complication allo-HSCT occur 5-27 % patient , associate considerable mortality relate infection hemorrhagic complication . Treatment PGF usually involve prescription hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , second transplantation , method associate dismal effect even significant risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue , cord blood . Clinical application human MSCs include improve hematopoietic engraftment , prevent treat graft-versus-host disease allo-HSCT . Some study show MSCs combine PBSC cord blood could useful improve engraftment HSCT . Several report suggest MSCs might effective treatment PGF . However , efficacy MSCs single-drug treatment PGF unsatisfactory previous study . Therefore , present study , G-CSF mobilize PBSC use combined MSCs patient PGF allo-HSCT .</detailed_description>
