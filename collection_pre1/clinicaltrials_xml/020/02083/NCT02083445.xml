	<brief_summary>Circulating progenitor cell ( CPC ) treatment may great potential recovery neuron brain function . Our group report exposure intermittent hypobaric hypoxia superficial muscle electrostimulation able increase concentration CPC peripheral blood human . Therefore , believe physical activity exposure intermittent hypobaric hypoxia period , increase CPC blood subject suffer severe Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) one year ago , promote regeneration functional cognitive recovery . The study primary end-point improve physical psychological functioning participant TBI program exercise , muscle electro-stimulation ( ME ) and/or intermittent-hypobaric-hypoxia ( IHH ) . Secondary end-points increase maintain CPC also study possible relationship physical psychological improvement participant Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) . In order achieve objective investigator design randomize control trial include patient suffer severe TBI one year previously physical psychological sequela . Exercise , muscle electro-stimulation ( ME ) and/or intermittent hypobaric hypoxia ( IHH ) program apply twelve week . Psychological physical stress test carry program CPC measure beginning , every two week , end program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical , experimental , case control prospective study . Inclusion criterion : patient suffer severe TBI one year previously physical psychological sequela , male sex , age 20-60 year old . Patients epilepsy include . The study approve institution 's Research Ethics Committee inform consent obtain patient . A program three day per week twelve week apply active group : one , exercise muscle electrical stimulation , , exercise , muscle electrical stimulation IHH chamber exposure . Control group participant follow day cognitive activity one day per week 12 week . Psychological physical stress test carry program . Psychological test evaluate feature language work ( verbal memory-RAVLT ) , Trail Making Test ( TMT A B ) , Stroop Test , work memory capacity attention ( WAIS III ) , information processing speed ( WAIS III ) , orientation verbal fluency ( Barcelona test ) , executive function ( WAIS III Tower London test ) estimate premorbid intelligence index ( vocabulary , WAIS III ) . Reduced Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT-G ) evaluate work memory component . Physical grade maximum stress test perform cycle ergometer increase progressively workload , order evaluate physical capacity adaptation different intensity effort . CPC ( CD34+ ) measure peripheral blood accord previously use method ( Viscor et al. , 2009 ) , begin , every two week , end program ( blood sample always obtain exercise session ) . Statistical analysis : data express mean , median , standard deviation interquartile range appropriate . The continuous variable compare use Mann-Whitney U test . Wilcoxon sign rank test Friedman test use repeat measure . All test perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) v.13 . Statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
