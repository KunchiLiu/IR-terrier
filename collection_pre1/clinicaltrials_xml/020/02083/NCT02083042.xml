	<brief_title>Clinical Validation Lophius Biosciences Kit T-Track® CMV Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe clinical complication include acute rejection opportunistic infection solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) mainly cause inadequate impairment cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) immunosuppressive therapy . In particular CMV responsible increase morbidity mortality reveal need either prophylactic preemptive antiviral treatment . Recipients negative CMV serology ( R- ) receive graft seropositive donor ( D+ ) high risk develop CMV-associated complication . Therefore , patient usually receive antiviral prophylaxis whereas patient intermediate risk ( D+/R+ D-/R+ ) treat either prophylactically preemptively . Although prophylaxis efficient , also accompany harmful side effect high cost . Thus , need personalize antiviral well immunosuppressive therapy optimally treat patient improve long-term patient graft survival . The detection protective threshold functional CMV-reactive cell may help predict onset viral complication , thereby minimize harmful side effect . Currently available tool measure CMV-specific cellular immunity reveal striking limitation include lack standardization necessitate commercially available standardize test system . The Lophius kit T-Track® CMV represent highly standardize sensitive diagnostic tool ass functionality network clinically relevant CMV-reactive effector cell . It base stimulation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) urea-formulated immunodominant CMV protein , pp65 IE-1 , subsequent quantification CMV-specific CMI ( spot form colony ) use highly sensitive IFN-γ ELISpot . This study aim assess suitability Lophius Biosciences kit T-Track® CMV determine CMV-specific CMI renal transplant recipient schedule preemptive antiviral treatment strategy . Furthermore , investigate result obtain T-Track® CMV suitable define cut-off value CMV-specific CMI mediate protection CMV reactivations related complication . Moreover , possible association CMV-specific CMI measure T-Track® CMV clinical complication include acute rejection episode opportunistic infection analyze well influence immunosuppressive treatment patient ` HLA type viral immunity .</detailed_description>
