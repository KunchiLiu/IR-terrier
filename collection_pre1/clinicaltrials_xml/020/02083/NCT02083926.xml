	<detailed_description>Roughly one-third one-half patient generalized SAD experience significant clinical benefit current evidence-based treatment SAD pharmacotherapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) venlafaxine cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Failure anxiety relief patient SAD source substantial morbidity , distress , decrease quality life . Novel pharmacological treatment need improve patient outcomes SAD . Converging line evidence neuroimaging pharmacological study support importance glutamate abnormality pathogenesis SAD . In Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) study , elevate glutamate creatinine ratio find anterior cingulate cortex SAD patient compare healthy control . Elevated thalamic glutamine level demonstrate patient SAD . Pre-clinical rodent study also establish strong link glutamate regulation anxiety . Ketamine potent antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , major type glutamate receptor brain . Ketamine routinely use anesthetic induction dissociative property . However research study , ketamine effective treatment reduce symptom depressive possibly anxiety disorder . In multiple controlled clinical study , ketamine produce rapid antidepressant effect unipolar bipolar depression . Ketamine 's anti-depressant effect peak 1-3 day follow infusion . Ketamine 's antidepressant effect observe long ketamine metabolize excrete body ketamine 's sedative dissociative effect dissipate . The result several clinical study suggest ketamine may also significant anxiolytic effect . Patients major depressive disorder give single ketamine infusion show strong significant reduction comorbid anxiety symptom . A trial include 11 depressed patient demonstrate significant reduction anxiety symptom ( Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) ) follow ketamine infusion . This improvement support one early placebo-controlled trial ketamine demonstrate psychic anxiety item one 4 ( 21 ) item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) demonstrate significant improvement ketamine infusion . The investigator goal conduct randomize , placebo-controlled crossover study explore efficacy time course action intravenous ketamine treatment SAD .</detailed_description>
