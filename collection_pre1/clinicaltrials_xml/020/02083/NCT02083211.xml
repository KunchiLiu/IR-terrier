	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives 1 . To determine global survival patient treat mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 patient cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse first line treatment . 2 . To determine disease free survival patient treat mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse first line treatment . 3 . To determine anti-tumoral response mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 patient cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse first line treatment . 4 . To determine progression time patient cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse first line treatment treat mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 combination chemotherapy . 5 . To evaluate safety mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 treat patient cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse first line treatment combination Cisplatin/Vinorelbine chemotherapy . 6 . To evaluate appear HAMA response patient treat mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 . 7 . To evaluate diminishing associate symptoms patient cervical tumor epithelial origin relapse treat mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 . 8 . To evaluate quality life group use questionnaire QLQ C-30 QLQ CX 24 patient cervical cancer ( See appendixes ) . 9 . To evaluate toxicity use V3 Toxicity criterion . 10 . To evaluate cardiac toxicity MUGA cardiac USG group . 11 . For feasibility purpose conduct MUGA Rs MG Mexican patient evaluate cardiac function order compare study clinical evaluation Whenever possible , researcher shall perform pre-treatment biopsy ass EGF-R expression characteristic use immunohistochemical technique . EGFR expression constitute inclusion criterion trial correlate retrospectively antitumor clinical response patient pre-treatment biopsy perform . A QLQ-c30v3 test apply characteristic evaluate impact disease treatment patient 's functioning physical , psychological social area . The QLQ Cx24 Questionnaire specific instrument measuring quality life patient cervical cancer different clinical phase . TREATMENT INDUCTION PHASE : 200 mg mAb Nimotuzumab administer week ( 12 week ) combination Platin base chemotherapy ( Cisplatin/Vinorelbine ) cycle administer every 21 day ( 6 ) . Both therapy administer endovenously . Response assess 3rd chemotherapy + mAb v placebo cycle physical examination , CAR , MRI . IF THERE IS A PARTIAL RESPONSE OR STABLE DISEASE line RECIST , patient shall continue plan treatment 6th CT + mAb v placebo cycle complete . In case PROGRESSION , another treatment scheme consider accord researcher criterion . Following 6th Chemotherapy + mAb v placebo cycle patient assess 28 day physical examination , MRI CAT measure lesion RECIST criterion . 6th cycle evaluation base basal target lesion measure begin study . IF STABLE DISEASE OR ANTITUMORAL RESPONSE IS ESTABLISHED patient continue next plan study phase . In event PROGRESSION , second line chemotherapy consider . During second line chemotherapy evaluation , Nimotuzumab administration every 14 day maintain FOLLOW-UP THERAPY : In case STABLE DISEASE ANTITUMORAL RESPONSE ( complete partial ) , mAb hR3 v Placebo dose maintain every 14 day without chemotherapy concomitancy phase patient show progression . mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 administer endovenously 250 mL saline solution 30 min . infusion ambulatory . Following drug administration , patient remain health care institution least 4 hour order guarantee immediate adverse reaction detection appropriate treatment . EVALUATION OF RESPONSE Survival patient determine moment inclusion death , two year . Therapeutic success consider occur patient survive 10.5 month branch treat mAb Nimotuzumab , difference group less 4 month mAb group great 10.5 month . Therapeutic failure consider occur patient survive 6.5 month habitually report literature , median survival patient treat Platinum IMAGE RESPONSE CRITERIA : An evaluation target lesion make ( complete response , partial response , progressive disease , stable disease ) HAMA RESPONSE WITH ELISA EGF-R EXPRESSION The EGF-R expression evaluate sample tumor patient use Immunohistochemical technique . The pre-inclusion EGFR expression constitute inclusion criterion , correlate retrospectively antitumoral clinical response . DETERMINATION OF KRAS , KI 65 , P53 . Evaluation QLQ- 30 Cx24 questionnaire do cycle 3 6 first line chemotherapy , 3rd 6th cycle second line chemotherapy . ADVERSE EVENTS All adverse event trial document patient 's file report form case . Every adverse event report include strat date , termination date , severity , possible relation drug study ( occurrence AE , description AE , intensisity AE , casualty relation , attitude follow AE ) Severity adverse event evaluate accord follow taxonomy : Serious adverse event ( Grade 3 ) : Event threaten life patient . Hospitalization patient require possible interruption drug study . Moderate adverse event ( Grade 2 ) : Patient require symptomatic treatment continue customary daily actvities . A frequent evaluation require adverse event disappears . Mild adverse event ( Grade 1 ) : Patient may continue daily activity requiere complementary pharmacological treatment . Characterization Adverse Events Main researcher evaluate adverse event determine relation drug study accord follow possible case . He/she record his/her evaluation Adverse Event Report . 0.- Unrelated The adverse event relate use drug study temporal causal relation identify effect ( use drug study ) 1 . - Possibly relate There temporal association cause effect may relate ethiologies ( probable cause ) . The relation drug study exclude . 2 . - Probably relate There temporal association although possible probable cause Reporting Adverse Events make follow : 1 . Report monitor later 24 hour patient still study . 2 . Reporting adverse event within 30 day patient finish study . 3 . A summary clinical history prepare include detailed description adverse event ( regardless adverse event might associate drug procedure study ) . 4 . All serious adverse event shall report Institutional Ethic Committee Research Host Hospital 5 . A Report Adverse Events make use Health Secretariat format A report deliver monitor perform pertaining action . Why Study Cardiac Function In different toxicity , cardiac toxicity mention previously one side effect treatment chemotherapy . In study , molecular target direct VEG + chemotherapy study , demonstrate cardiac toxicity , make necessary consider . Currently , evaluation cardiac function take place Nuclear Medicine establish safe , effective , low-cost method . Basal , MUGA ECG measurement make prior chemotherapy cycle 6 first line CT . In case second line chemotherapy , measurement make cycle 3 6 . The importance quality life mean : good state mental , physical , social health patient survive cancer ( Brunner et al.1995 ) . Patients treat radiotherapy vs. surgery , local advance cervical cancer , demonstrate achieve quality life two year treatment compare control group ( Klee et al . 2000 , Cull et al . 1993 ) . The EORTC develop validate program order evaluate quality life patient suffer cancer ( , cervical breast cancer ) treatment . The QLQ-c30v 3 ( Holzner et al . 2001 , Fayer et al . 2002 , Aaronson 1993 ) , characteristic evaluate impact disease treatment patient 's functioning follow area : physical , psychological , social . Recently , QLQ Cx 24 questionnaire ( Greimel et al . 2006 ) specific instrument measuring quality life patient cervical cancer , validate EORTC . It capacity ass quality life different clinical stage ; evaluate aspect female reproductive system , sex life , discomfort cause local treatment ; Cronbach Alfa coefficient 72 % -82 % ; disadvantage questionnaire must self-evaluative , majority patient help due fact 80 % population incomplete primary school education . Basal measurement make prior chemotherapy cycle 3 , cycle 6 first line chemotherapy . In case second line chemotherapy , measurement make begin second line chemotherapy cycle 3 6 chemotherapy . During follow-up , Questionnaires QLQ 30 CX 24 preform every 6 month first two year afterwards , annually completion 5 year . FOLLOW-UP Post-study follow-up visit make every 3 month first 2 year ; every 4 month third year ; every 6 month follow year , later , annually progression . The information collect period follow : Limited clinical history physical examination ; performance status assessment include weight tumor lesion measurement lesion measure physical examination image study : BH , QS , PFH ; relapse , progression recurrence date . Cardiac function assess MUGA every 6 month first year later , annually . Evaluation Questionnaires QLQ- 30 Cx24 perform every 6 month follow-up first twol year , , annually 5 year . Blinding procedure method code treatment open access . Main clinical researcher ultimate person responsible appropriate patient attention he/she determine patient shall continue treatment researched event adverse event appear bear risk life patient . In clinical site , researcher pharmaceutical person responsible institution provide sealed envelope state treatment patient receiving . If patient need clinical management due presence severe unexpected adverse event related product study require know treatment patient receiving , randomization envelope open . Opening randomization envelope justify severe unexpected averse event present . In case , procedure follow explanation procedure shall record patient 's clinical history . Sealed envelope contain treatment assign patient prepare designated person CIM Regulatory Affairs Department he/she also label vial base randomized list state treatment patient receiving .</detailed_description>
