	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) highly prevalent condition often affecting individual prime life , cause severe reduction quality life productivity , well social isolation , anxiety , depression . FMS recently estimate affect approximately 2.6 % Israeli population . Over last decade , repeatedly show Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) primary motor cortex ( M1 ) induce analgesic effect experimental pain , well various chronic pain condition , possibly activate intrinsic pain-modulation system . Thus , purpose study explore efficacy H1 deep TMS treatment FMS patient . In addition , investigator attempt assess effect dTMS perception modulation pain patient suffer FMS . The study take place Shalvata Mental Health Center , After receive hospital 's BRI approval . Forty FMS patient 18-65 year age sign inform consent form , randomize active arm ( dTMS ) placebo arm ( sham-dTMS ) . Twenty treatment deliver subject period 4 week . At base-line subject complete series epidemiological clinical questionnaire ( assess symptom FMS , depression , pain , anxiety ) , well pain sensation modulation test . At termination study two week final treatment questionnaire physical measurement re-administered final assessment post-treatment status comparison initial status The importance study lie potential : 1 ) provide evidence efficacy dTMS treat patient suffer FMS 2 ) enhance investigator understand pathophysiology FMS underlie pain perception modulation mechanisms 3 ) explore role Dorso-Lateral-Prefrontal-Cortex ( DLPC ) modulate pain possible target therapeutic intervention FMS .</detailed_description>
