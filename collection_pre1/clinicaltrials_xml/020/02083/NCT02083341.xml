	<brief_summary>Muscle tension dysphonia ( MTD ) disable voice disorder cause severe voice change , neck pain , voice fatigue . Current therapy modality treat disorder include multiple visit qualify speech language pathologist ( SLP ) rehabilitation voice exercise focus laryngeal/neck massage . Access service difficult long waitlists often cover current public health insurance locally available many patient Ontario . The goal study demonstrate reduction symptom improvement vocal function apply external vibration device key site ( e.g . jaw , neck , skull base ) commonly identify source abnormal muscle tension injury certain voice disorder , specifically MTD . This study also investigate effect external vibration voice quality classically trained singer ( CTSs ) . Certain desirable acoustic quality singer ' voice accessible larynx extrinsic muscle relax state . Muscle misuse vocal strain common problem performer , result condition require surgery speech therapy , may lead loss income . Similar vocal warm exercise contribute prevention vocal injury , external vibration expect improve muscle perfusion acute set may direct effect vocal fold cover viscosity . Both study group randomize receive either external vibration device sham device . The sham device look identical experimental device vibration component remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Muscle tension dysphonia primarily treat voice therapy qualify SLP . One key therapy tool MTD laryngeal extrinsic muscle massage along voice respiratory exercise . Access specialize service difficult due limited expertise travel distance . The goal study demonstrate reduction symptom improvement vocal function apply external vibration device key site ( e.g . jaw , neck , skull base ) commonly identify source abnormal muscle tension injury certain voice disorder , specifically MTD . If study show demonstrable benefit , patient would train self administer treatment along home program therapy exercise . This novel therapy would improve delivery care allow speech therapy service widely accessible reduced number therapy session require . The potential long term effect would decrease wait time access specialize service lessen need return visit due symptom recurrence . The second part study investigate effect external vibration voice quality CTSs . Certain desirable acoustic quality singer ' voice accessible larynx extrinsic muscle relax state . Muscle misuse vocal strain common problem performer , result condition require surgery speech therapy , may lead loss income . Similar vocal warm exercise contribute prevention vocal injury , external vibration expect improve muscle perfusion acute set may direct effect vocal fold cover viscosity .</detailed_description>
