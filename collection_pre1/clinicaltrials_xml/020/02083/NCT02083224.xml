	<brief_summary>Clinical cancer genetics emerge new field medical oncology , incorporate routine oncology practice many lead medical institution North America Europe . Cancer genetics study genetic factor contribute carcinogenesis . In last 5-10 year , gene responsible various well-defined hereditary cancer syndrome clone . These include BRCAJ/2 gene hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome , A4PC gene Familial Adenomatous Polyposis , mismatch repair gene ( hMLH1 , hMSH2 , hPMS1 , hPMS2 , hMSH6 ) hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) . One goal clinical cancer genetics service identify family risk hereditary cancer syndrome , provide genetic counseling , offer genetic test appropriate . The identification causative gene hereditary cancer syndromes together advent genetic test start impact clinical management . The ability identify gene mutation cancer family allow predictive testing , stratify at-risk family member carrier benefit aggressive surveillance and/or preventive option , non-carriers may spar unnecessary surveillance . Appropriate use genetic testing ultimately result medical cost reduction . The investigator hypothesize clinical characteristic genetic factor contribute hereditary cancer Singaporean Asian population distinct describe Western patient .</brief_summary>
