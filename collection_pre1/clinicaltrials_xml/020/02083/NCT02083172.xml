	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate agreement hemodynamic measurement obtain use Ultrasound Cardiac Output Monitor ( USCOM® ; USCOM Ltd. , Sydney , Australia ) , reference standard determine 2 Dimensional echocardiography ( 2D-echo ) measurement group hemodynamically stable unstable pediatric patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2D-echo standard-of-care tool non-invasive hemodynamic assessment child . The use 2D-echo require highly trained personnel , assessment may take anywhere 30-45 minute . The feasibility real time hemodynamic assessment therefore limit 2D-echo . USCOM introduce non-invasive bedside hemodynamic monitoring tool utilizes continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound . As USCOM easily portable , measurement take several minute conduct trained physician nurse , become attractive method real time hemodynamic monitoring unstable patient . While USCOM validation study conduct adult , neonatal pediatric population , follow concern raise : ) Pediatric data agreement USCOM standard method CO measurement ( i.e . 2D-echo , pulmonary artery catheterization ) conflict study report acceptable agreement , others report poor agreement ; b ) USCOM validation agreement study previously conduct primarily hemodynamically stable population . Its performance hemodynamically unstable mechanically ventilated patient study date pediatric population.USCOM currently promote real-time tool assess hemodynamic status , direct care unstable child without adequate evidence . Therefore , study essential inform validity USCOM whether use 2D-echo real time hemodynamic monitoring child feasible available .</detailed_description>
