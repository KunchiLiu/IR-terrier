	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) genetic lipoprotein disorder characterize elevation low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) &gt; 95th percentile age gender . Affected individual may show clinical manifestation ( xanthoma , xanthelasmas premature arcus corneus ) although manifestation see less frequently early diagnosis treatment . Untreated , FH lead atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , primarily coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . There least three accepted definition FH , base absolute LDL-C level ( MedPed criterion ) , Simon-Broome criterion include fix cut-point LDL-C , presence DNA mutation xanthomas FH Dutch Criteria ( Netherlands ) . There well-developed FH Registries Netherlands , United Kingdom , Spain , France , US , newly establish US FH Foundation . In United Kingdom , report economic advantage treat FH reveal lipid-lowering statin therapy would lead 101 few cardiovascular deaths/1000 patient FH give treatment . The cost save cardiovascular event estimate $ CAN 592 million UK relative index case identify treat , compare treatment give . This cascade test strategy successfully apply Netherlands family FH probands detected mutation , thus allow statin treatment family member risk early coronary heart disease . In Canada , burden disease estimate approximately 83,500 patient , base allele frequency 1/500 . In province Quebec , allele frequency approximately 1/270 number affect subject approximately 29,000 . Left untreated , FH men develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) third decade life woman , fourth decade . When identify treat early , life expectancy normal . The purpose initiative create registry subject FH across Canada design identify subject FH improve health healthcare delivery . Rare diseases lipoprotein metabolism ( orphan disease ) also include ( SMASH registry ; Systems Molecular Approach Severe Hyperlipidemia ) . This registry include clinical , biochemical demographic information . Specimens ( plasma/serum DNA ) collect biobanking . The registry make available clinician manage patient care , identify relative screen treatment ( cascade screening ) , provide advice general practitioner support collaborative study biomedical , clinical , health outcome health economics research . Access anonymized data registry give researcher , clinician , biopharmaceutical industry government peer-reviewed process . The Mission Canadian FH Registry bring together multi-disciplinary group physician , basic clinical researcher improve delivery care patient severe lipoprotein disorder , especially FH , foster collaborative research . Our Vision create Canada-wide network academic clinic , integrate lipid specialist , endocrinologist cardiologist treat patient high standard care create collaborative research environment . Using `` hub spoke '' model , registry extend various community link primary care physicians provincial academic center . The Goals improve care patient FH reduce cardiovascular disease population high risk . Given wide geographic distribution patient FH , plan provide `` hub spoke '' model specialize care . The hub would base province center recognize national level expertise lipoprotein disorder advance laboratory facility ( medical biochemistry , specialized assay , ultracentrifugation , genetic testing ) . Radiating center clinic treat patient FH . We propose three-tier registry ( local , provincial Canada-wide ) . The local database would nominative , use solely clinic center contain information obtain local investigator use clinical purpose . The provincial database use encrypt number , without identifier provincial health insurance number , used generate province-specific health outcome , resource utilization , health economics comparative epidemiological/genetic/clinical feature across province . The Canadian database would anonymous serve generate country-wide statistic , public awareness research collaboration . All procedure relate FH registry follow uniform standard operation procedure ( SOP ) . The various step associate inclusion patient within FH Registry follow : subject high LDL-C , secondary cause rule , FH Criteria satisfy , consent form sign , clinical evaluation , baseline lipid profile , demographic info , family history , longitudinal follow-up ( annual data capture ) . If patient family history FH , start cascade screening . If FH criterion satisfy begin study patient ask enter SMASH registry severe disorder lipid metabolism . The database software fulfill follow criterion : must comply privacy regulation province , use password allow limited access , access tailor site . It must allow researcher access strictly control condition peer-review . The software must flexible enough allow easy data entry capture provincial Canadian database . Cost consideration also issue . The choice software make yet . Biobanking perform individual site , available . Plasma/serum , DNA , tissue ( e.g . skin biopsy ) potentially include . The consent form specific section deal DNA banking possibility DNA may send central laboratory analysis . The informed consent also stipulate plasma/serum DNA sample may analyze academic collaborator outside Canada industry ( pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology ) . Data entry site perform use nominative information cod specific institution ( hospital ID number ) . In addition , subject 's provincial health insurance number enter unique identifier assign ( instance BC_000001 ; QC_000001 ) . As FH highly familial nature , parent , sibs first-degree relative subject also enter , know . While subject distinct identifier , family relationship record . Completely anonymous data make available researcher , policy maker , government industry per need basis . Physicians site able retrieve information pertinent site . Access database grant investigator submit write request Scientific Board clearance give consultation Advisory Board . Both level government ( provincial National ) give similar access , pharmaceutical industry biopharmaceutical industry . Potential benefit Patients . Patients access expert care field lipoprotein disorder CVD prevention . In many case , optimal treatment severe hypercholesterolemia may best provided expert field . They access on-going clinical trial novel therapy . Furthermore , individual patient offer family screen identify affect member would benefit early diagnosis treatment . The identification new FH case cascade screen prof cost-effective aligns aim provide personalized medicine patient severe lipoprotein disorder . Clinicians . The registry provide local ( i.e . clinic hospital ) framework diagnose patient accord accept international criterion FH , follow subject time perform cascade screening ( first , second third-degree relative ) , cost-effective strategy screen potentially affected subject . The registry also link clinician network specialize clinic favor collaborative investigator-initiated research participation multi-center study . The availability biobanking allow storage plasma/serum DNA future research . Biomedical researcher . The identification novel gene FH rare lipoprotein disorder lead well understand metabolic pathway eventually potential novel therapeutic target . In addition , gene-gene gene-environment interaction research may shed light mechanism disease . clinical-scientists opportunity develop investigator-initiated research , use pan-Canadian registry biobanking resource platform . Researchers health outcome health economics , social , gender ethnic research access database collaboration provincial administrative database . Biopharmaceutical Industry . The biopharmaceutical industry access group lipid expert across Canada , link internationally , harmonize database subject FH rare lipoprotein disorder . They access network establish clinic unified database . Access registry database provide review intend research . This data important determine health economics . Government . This initiative allow development clinical practice guideline , determine resource allocation accord need , identification rare ( orphan disease ) lipoprotein disorder require specific technique , extracorporeal LDL filtration homozygous FH . The initiative allow framework set-up collaborative research peer-review system ( HSFC , CIHR ) . Health outcomes health economic study allow resource allocation quality control . Finally centralize genetic testing would provide molecular diagnostics cost-effective manner , require . This initiative dovetail CIHR C-CHANGE initiative concern harmonization cardiovascular preventive guideline Canada . To data , country harmonize CVD prevention guideline . Knowledge translation training . Individual academic institution strong biomedical research commitment offer undergraduate graduate-level training field lipid lipoprotein within country-wide collaborative research environment . Several center offer post-doctoral fellowship clinician PhDs lipoprotein metabolism , health outcome health economics research . This training highly qualified personnel expect contribute academic economic engine country . A formal training course , align National Lipid Association , provide certification treatment lipoprotein disorder . The establishment clinical practice guideline adult pediatric patient enable clinician hone clinical practice high standard . By use well establish conference across Canada , aim integrate novel knowledge yearly conference program across Canada disseminate information practice physician health care professional .</detailed_description>
