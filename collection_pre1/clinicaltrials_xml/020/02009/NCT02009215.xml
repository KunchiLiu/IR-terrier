	<brief_summary>We propose evaluate community-level impact intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) malaria schoolchildren clinical outcome malaria transmission , use cluster-randomised design Jinja , Uganda . Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) administer schoolchildren monthly six round treatment one school year . Outcomes measure use survey community , schoolchildren , mosquito vector . Our proposal also include health service research evaluate potential feasibility take programme scale , guide future research implementation intervention , help shape policy Uganda elsewhere Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objective : The primary objective study evaluate impact IPT malaria schoolchildren use monthly DP , compare current standard care ( IPT ) , community-level indicator malaria transmission . We test hypothesis malaria transmission , measure prevalence asexual parasitaemia entomological inoculation rate ( EIR ) , low community surround intervention school , surround control school . Study site : The study conduct Jinja district , Uganda . Clusters : A cluster define one primary day school plus 100 close household surround school . The cluster define prior randomisation use digitally enumerate map . We plan include approximately 84 cluster study , one school per cluster ; half randomise IPT intervention , half control . Randomisation : Randomisation conduct trial statistician , directly involved field activity . Primary school stratify type ownership ( public vs private ) . Restricted randomisation employ ensure balance type school geographical location . Study population : The intervention deliver child attend participate primary school randomise intervention group . The IPT intervention : IPT dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) deliver school locate intervention cluster . Treatment administer participate student monthly , 6 round IPT one school year , blind . Administration DP : All enrol student receive DP ( Duo-cotexcin , Holley Cotec Pharmaceuticals ) give day 3 consecutive day . DP dose accord weight-based guideline . Full-strength DP tablet ( 40/320mg ) administer orally study personnel , treatment directly observe . Evaluation procedure : Outcomes measure survey community , schoolchildren , mosquito vector . In addition , safety IPT monthly DP , potential feasibility IPT intervention also assess . 1 . Community survey . Cross-sectional survey community resident live household randomly select cluster conduct baseline end intervention.The community survey consist two component : ( 1 ) household survey questionnaire administer head household , ( 2 ) clinical survey include laboratory test household resident . The primary outcome community survey parasite prevalence measure microscopy . In final community survey , plan enroll 105 participant per cluster ( 8820 total ) . 2 . School survey . Cross-sectional survey student randomly select cluster school conduct baseline end intervention . The primary outcome school survey parasite prevalence measure microscopy . In final school survey , plan enroll 13 student per cluster ( 1092 total ) . 3 . Entomology survey . Mosquitos collect use Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) light trap 5 randomly select household 20 cluster study arm ( 100 household per arm , 200 total ) , use list randomly generate enumeration database . Each house sample month duration study . The primary outcome entomology survey EIR . 4 . Safety monitoring . Students enrol intervention evaluate prospectively serious adverse event . To assess impact monthly IPT DP risk cardiotoxicity , sub-set participant ( n=189 ) select use convenience sampling ( intervention arm ) participate cardiac monitoring pharmacokinetic study . 5 . Qualitative assessment . A qualitative study run alongside main trial , investigate potential feasibility integrate intervention routine health service school system . We conduct historical review publish unpublished literature programme integrate health intervention education sector ; ethnographic observation intervention activity ; in-depth interview key stakeholder , teacher health worker . Analytical plan 1 . Quantitative survey : All data analyse basis intention-to-treat , , community resident school child take part final survey classify participate intervention control accord randomization assignment cluster survey , regardless whether ( child ) receive intervention . The primary outcome prevalence asexual parasitaemia community survey . Prevalence asexual parasitaemia school survey EIR secondary outcome measure . An individual-level approach analysis use due large number cluster per arm . For binary outcome , generalise linear Poisson model log link function use . The effect intervention quantify calculation prevalence risk ratio . For quantitative outcome , linear regression model use . The effect intervention quantify calculation difference mean outcome . Rate ratio use describe effect intervention rate . An estimate coefficient variation , k , provide overall community survey age group ( define stratify sample ) . The probability selection final community survey relate sample frame determine expect parasite prevalence ( varies age ) age category ; &lt; 5 year , 5-15 year , &gt; 15 year . Therefore , age structure study population representative community population whole . Because look community effect use inverse probability weight base age population structure cluster record census survey . In practice , individual assign one three weight , generate use census survey , base age record final community survey . Population estimate prevalence obtain use svy command cluster primary sample unit age-related inverse probability weight . Children select school survey randomly select stratification class . Households select entomological survey also randomly select . No weight therefore require analysis either school entomological survey . The effect intervention also assess use adjust analysis . The cluster-specific prevalence mean baseline survey adjust available . Variables collect baseline community survey , imbalanced trial arm , likely prognostic outcome adjust . Secondary analysis conduct ass whether effect intervention differs age group school type . The effect intervention outcome examine age group school type test interaction conduct . 2 . Qualitative data : The data analysis field note in-depth interview follow bottom-up approach , identify repeat pattern data . Field note cod daily basis use qualitative data analysis software , NVivo ( QSR International , Cambridge , MA ) . Transcripts cod line-by-line , later develop theme theoretical construct group base cod together . A cod template develop refine . Following cod process , themes theoretical construct develop field note interview transcript , analysis conduct reference literature theory regard school-based cross-sectoral intervention . Following analysis , interpretation take apply stance , seek specific challenge opportunity method content intervention support implementation IPT .</detailed_description>
