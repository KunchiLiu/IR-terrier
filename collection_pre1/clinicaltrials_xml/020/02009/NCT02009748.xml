	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation Cirrhotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis liver slowly progressive disease high number complication like hepatic encephalopathy , gastrointestinal bleeding , ascites , renal failure hepatocellular cancer lead death . Cirrhosis cause death increase progressively mortality data general population . This terminal liver disease complication chronic viral hepatitis , alcoholism metabolic disorder , genetic non-genetic predisposition , may link nutritional aberration precursor effect illness . Previous study suggest chronic liver disease may relate high prevalence vitamin D deficiency gastrointestinal disorder vitamin D absorption highly reduce . Patients cirrhosis often present malnutrition one limiting factor intestinal malabsorption portal hypertension due liver disease . Beside nutrition main source vitamin D sunlight ultraviolet-B inducing conversion 7-dehydrocholesterol vitamin D skin ; therefore limit sunlight exposure skin may lead inadequate vitamin D status . Vitamin D biologically inactive hydroxylated liver 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) main circulate metabolite use classification vitamin D status . 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) D ) produce conversion enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase kidney . This vitamin D metabolite show high affinity vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) compare 25 ( OH ) D. After bind activation VDR three percent human genome regulate . Among main role vitamin D metabolites regulate calcium bone homeostasis , also show non-skeletal effect relevance development several chronic disease . In context , vitamin D deficiency associate increase risk cancer , cardiovascular , autoimmune , infectious disease , Based finding , significantly reduce risk mortality show patient oral vitamin D supplementation randomize controlled study . Our previously publish study present prospective association vitamin D level occurrence hepatic decompensation . Furthermore vitamin D deficiency associate high mortality cirrhotic patient dependent liver dysfunction . Concerning aspect main point investigate study whether low vitamin D status consequence increase deterioration liver synthesis may even contribute liver dysfunction . Low synthesis vitamin D skin result reduce sunlight exposure malnutrition and/or malabsorption cirrhotic patient . On hand , organ dysfunction may impair activity 25-hydroxylase liver . Despite mentioned correlation vitamin D deficiency liver dysfunction still insufficient evidence recommend oral vitamin D supplementation concomitant therapy clinical practice exists adequately design randomize control trial evaluates necessary daily oral dose vitamin D. We aim address issue present study finding study lead implementation treatment strategy maintain sufficient vitamin D status cirrhotic patient .</detailed_description>
