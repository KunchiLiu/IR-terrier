	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance compare medication test whether medication real effect clinical study ) , parallel-groups study conduct 2 clinical research center ( CRC ) US . Approximately 56 participant , age 25-70 year , T2DM inadequately control either metformin monotherapy combination therapy metformin DPP-4 inhibitor , enrol . The study 3 phase : pre-treatment , double-blind treatment , post-treatment . Pre-Treatment Phase consist screen visit ( Week -5 ) , 14 day Single- Blind Placebo Run-in period , follow 14 day Single-Blind Placebo Baseline Period , participant randomize ( 1:1 ) one 2 treatment group , either canagliflozin placebo . Double-Blind Treatment Phase begin Day 1 , end approximately Week 25 , participant assess least biweekly outpatient visit telephone contact . Canagliflozin treatment initiate 100 mg/day , up-titration 300 mg/day , consistent approve INVOKANA® US Prescribing Information 2013 . During post-treatment phase , follow-up visit occur within approximately 28 day last dose study drug . At baseline 24 week treatment canagliflozin , hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity assess use tracer label euglycemic clamp technique ; hepatic fat content determine use 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) ; beta cell function ( insulin secretion rate beta cell glucose sensitivity ) assess mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) ; substrate oxidation energy production rate measure use indirect calorimetry euglycemic clamp MMTT . During study , participant remain stable dose regimen metformin combination metformin DPP-4 inhibitor therapy , unless investigator considers dose modification medically necessary . The total study duration participant participate study approximately 34 week .</detailed_description>
