	<criteria>Male female subject great equal 18 year age age legal consent . Must BMI less equal 32.0 kg/m2 . Subjects must diagnosis SIADH prior randomization . Persistent euvolemic hyponatremia , evidence 3 serum sodium assessments 120 133 mmol/L , inclusive drawn locally follow : one screening period , second checkin Day 1 , third Day 0 ( 1224 hour prior dose ) , serve baseline value efficacy endpoint Subjects relatively intact renal function , ie , estimate glomerular filtration rate use CKDEPI formula great equal 60 mL/min/1.73m2 . Ability provide write , informed consent prior initiation trial related procedure , ability , opinion PI , comply requirement trial . Sexually active male practice highly effective method birth control trial 30 day last dose trial medication remain abstinent trial 30 day last dose , sexually active female childbearing potential practicing highly effective method birth control trial 30 day last dose trial medication remain abstinent trial 30 day last dose , female subject nonchildbearing potential ( surgically sterile postmenopausal [ 1 year post menses ] ) . If employing birth control , 1 follow highly effective method ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) must use : vasectomy , tubal ligation , intrauterine device contain hormone ( Mirena ) , combine oral contraceptive , hormone implant hormone injection . Daily use diuretic within 14 day prior screen assessment randomization requirement constant diuretic use reason . Clinically assess hypovolemic state . Inability respond thirst . Subjects perceive thirst . Subjects anuria . Urgent need raise serum sodium acutely . Urinary outflow obstruction unless subject , , catheterize trial . Severe hepatic impairment . ChildPugh Class C ( score 10 great ) . Subjects receive medication give purpose raise serum sodium undergo qualify serum sodium assessment . Specifically : Hypertonic saline ( include normal saline challenge ) within 8 hour qualify serum sodium screen assessment ; Urea , lithium , demeclocycline , conivaptan , tolvaptan within 4 day qualify serum sodium screen assessment ; Loop diuretic ( eg . furosemide , bumetanide , torsemide ) within 48 hour qualify serum sodium screen assessment ; Other treatment ( include normal saline oral sodium contain supplement ) purpose increase serum sodium within 24 hour qualify serum sodium screen assessment . Final determination make consultation sponsor . Subjects medication induce SIADH stable medication 3 month . CYP3A4 inhibitor take within 5 elimination halflives within 96 hour dose , ever time longer . Final determination make consultation sponsor . CYP3A4 inducer take within 72 hour 5 elimination halflives ( eg , rifampin , St. Johns Wort ) . Chemotherapy agent give previous 7 day prior dose within 5 elimination halflives agent ; whichever longer . Clinically significant abnormality past medical history , Screening physical examination , investigator 's sponsor 's opinion may place subject risk interfere outcome variable include absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug . This include , limited , history concurrent cardiac , hepatic , renal , neurologic , endocrine , GI , respiratory , hematologic , immunologic disease . History drug and/or alcohol abuse within 6 month prior Screening . History current hepatitis acquire immunodeficiency syndrome carrier HBsAg , antiHCV , and/or HIV antibody . History significant drug allergy . A positive alcohol test and/or drug screen substance abuse Screening upon Checkin clinical site . Subjects take investigational drug within 30 day precede trial entry . Any history significant bleeding hemorrhagic tendency . A history difficulty donate blood . The donation blood plasma within 30 day prior dose . Consumption alcohol and/or food beverage contain methylxanthines , pomelo fruit , grapefruit , grapefruit juice , Seville oranges , Seville orange juice within 72 hour prior dose . Exposure substance know stimulate hepatic microsomal enzyme within 30 day prior Screening ( eg , occupational exposure pesticide , organic solvent ) .

Subjects supine blood pressure , rest great equal 3 minute , high 140/90 mmHg low 100/50 mmHg . The sponsor may allow exception deem clinically significant . Subjects supine pulse rate , rest great equal 3 minute , outside range 40 90 bpm . The sponsor may allow exception significant . History serious mental disorder , opinion investigator , would exclude subject participate trial . Any subject , opinion investigator , participate trial . Subjects pregnant breastfeeding . A negative serum pregnancy test must confirm prior randomization female subject childbearing potential . Subjects Type 1 diabetes .</criteria>
