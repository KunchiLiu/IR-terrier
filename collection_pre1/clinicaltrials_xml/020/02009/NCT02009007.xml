	<brief_summary>Liberal fluid administration one risk factor develop acute lung injury ( ALI ) thoracic surgery . Therefore , investigator try restrain fluid administration , case intraoperative hypotension , investigator often administer vasoactive agent inotropes . One lung ventilation ( OLV ) routinely employ thoracic surgery decrease arterial oxygenation oxygen delivery brain also decrease . In study , investigator compare dopamine phenylephrine respect maintain cerebral oxygen saturation major thoracic surgery . The investigator hypothesis dopamine well phenylephrine maintain cerebral oxygen saturation thoracic surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 'restrictive ' intraoperative fluid regimen , avoid hypovolaemia limit infusion minimum necessary reduce major complication complex surgery . This restrictive fluid regimen especially relevant thoracic surgery since acute lung injury know related large amount fluid administration operation treat hypotension . One study suggest , every 500-mL increase perioperative fluid , odds ratio 1.17 develop ALI lung resection . Slinger suggest fluid restrict point maintain urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h , vasopressor may use tissue perfusion inadequate . Therefore , restriction fluid administration treatment hypotension cause major hemorrhage vasoactive agent could basic concept thoracic anesthesia . Patients undergo lung resection surgery usually receive one lung ventilation ( OLV ) . Decrease systemic oxygenation occur OLV due intrapulmonary shunt . During OLV , significant decrease cerebral oxygenation ( SctO2 ) also know occur low SctO2 relate postoperative complication . Because endpoint hemodynamic optimization improve oxygen delivery major organ , understand administration vasoactive agent affect cerebral perfusion oxygenation , important organ body major clinical relevance . Recently publish study show near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) -guided brain protection protocol might lead reduce neurocognitive complication improve postoperative outcome . However , data agent dopamine phenylephrine , commonly use age operation hypotension , good maintain cerebral oxygen saturation thoracic surgery . Therefore , investigator try compare dopamine phenylephrine continuous infusion respect maintain SctO2 major thoracic surgery . In addition , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) develop around 6 % patient lung resection surgery AKI relate poor prognosis prolong duration hospital admission.Therefore , investigator also try find agent good maintain urinary output operation reduce postoperative AKI . The investigator also find difference postoperative delirium incidence dopamine phenylephrine continuous infusion . The primary aim study ( ) investigate effect phenylephrine dopamine continuous infusion cerebral SctO2 ( ii ) identify hemodynamic variable [ mean blood pressure , cardiac output , heart rate ( HR ) , stroke volume ( SV ) ] responsible change cerebral SctO2 induce phenylephrine dopamine treatment .</detailed_description>
