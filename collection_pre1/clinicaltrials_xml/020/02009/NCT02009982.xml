	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness cardioneuroablation treatment neurocardiogenic syncope ( NCS ) , also know `` vaso-vagal '' syncope . Syncope general term passing spell neurocardiogenic syncope specific form passing spell cause sudden drop heart rate blood pressure . Although specific mechanism NCS well understood , believe people prone develop passing spell specific situation stand long period time , pain nausea . In situation , body reacts paradoxical reflex lead drop blood pressure heart rate cause pass . Certain types medication use treat NCS include beta-blockers , midodrine florinef , among others . However , none medication particularly effective prevent pass spell many people continue episode despite try different medication . Cardioneuroablation new form treatment NCS . The term ablation mean use wire make small electrical burn heart . Ablation use many year treat electrical disturbance heart use ablation treat NCS new application . The goal cardioneuroablation identify area within heart believe initiate reflex trigger drop heart rate blood pressure lead pass . In preliminary study , suggest cardioneuroablation may significantly effective medication prevent passing spell people NCS . Hypothesis : Cardioneuroablation vagal input leave atrium may serve effective treatment modality prevention NCS blunt initial trigger cascade lead symptom syncope .</brief_summary>
