	<brief_summary>Both hydromorphone morphine administer part spinal anesthesia help improve pain control cesarean delivery . In study , investigator go determine dos medicine provide optimal pain control woman undergo cesarean delivery limit side effect relate medicine . The investigator hypothesize dos hydromorphone morphine provide optimal pain control without significant side effect 100 microgram 150 microgram , respectively . The investigator hypothesize respective optimal dose , side effect less hydromorphone group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Opioids Pain Control After Cesarean Delivery : Determining Optimal Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia common anesthetic technique use Cesarean delivery United States across world . Intrathecal opioids administer along local anesthetic spinal anesthesia Cesarean delivery provide postoperative analgesia . The effectiveness intrathecal morphine post-Cesarean pain control well establish , effectiveness intrathecal hydromorphone patient population limit case report small retrospective study . No prospective study conduct establish effectiveness intrathecal hydromorphone post-Cesarean pain . Hydromorphone study extensively substitute intrathecal morphine patient chronic noncancer pain . In fact , recent consensus article place hydromorphone first line therapy along morphine intrathecal pain management . Its ability treat post-Cesarean pain administer epidural space know quite time , effect intrathecal space less establish . In patient undergo Cesarean delivery , intrathecal dos 40 100 microgram report provide good pain score postoperatively minimal side effect . Doses 300 microgram use , lead excellent pain control without respiratory depression , significant pruritus nausea . Although reduce pain , intrathecal opioids associate side effect include pruritus , nausea , respiratory depression . A meta-analysis review twenty-eight study investigate intrathecal morphine versus placebo demonstrate moderate increase incidence pruritus , nausea vomit . In fact incidence nausea IT morphine report 33 % . While hydromorphone similar chemically morphine , metabolize differently . Differences pharmacokinetics may allow difference side effect profile . Hydromorphone lipid soluble morphine . This decrease spread within intrathecal space enhances penetration dorsal horn spinal cord interaction opioid receptor occur . Some study find hydromorphone cause less nausea pruritus morphine , others . Although opioid-induced respiratory depression rare event , study evaluate intrathecal hydromorphone post-Cesarean delivery pain report case respiratory depression . The optimal dose intrathecal morphine analgesia follow Cesarean delivery still debate efficacy intrathecal hydromorphone study extensively patient population . The investigator aim identify dose medication provide good pain relief without cause significant side effect . The investigator perform comparative analysis drug optimal dose .</detailed_description>
