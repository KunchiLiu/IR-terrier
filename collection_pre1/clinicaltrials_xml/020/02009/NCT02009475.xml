	<detailed_description>Introduction : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patient suffer early fatigue functional aerobic impairment . Their reduced cardiac output O2 delivery peripheral muscle shift patient consistent anaerobic metabolism , thus , CHF patient rely anaerobic metabolism even everyday life activity . This metabolism lead shift muscle fiber type mainly slow twitch , oxidative type I fiber fast twitch , glycolytic type IIb fiber . Monocarboxylate proteins MCT1 MCT4 transport lactate cross membrane . MCT1 responsible lactate uptake MCT4 responsible efflux excess lactate . Exercise training know improve quality life CHF . We hypothesize exercise training might change MCT1 4 expression distribution . Accordingly , change may also affect lactate clearance recovery , may contribute beneficial effect exercise training CHF patient . Methods : New-York Heart association ( NYHA ) class II-III CHF patient assign experiment . At baseline upon train conclusion undergo test battery . The test battery include heart rate , blood pressure measurement , echocardiographic evaluation . All participant fill `` Minnesota live heart failure '' questionnaire . Subsequently , basal blood lactate assess undergo measurement follow lactate clearance-rate evaluation . Randomly patient assign one two experimental train group : ( A ) High intensity interval train ( HIT ) ; ( B ) Continuous moderate aerobic training ( MAT ) . Each volunteer train twice week 12 week , accord his/hers assign train protocol accordance exercise training guideline .</detailed_description>
