	<criteria>The patient must ≥18 year age . The patient must angina pectoris define Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification , document silent ischemia , positive functional study . The patient plan intervention two lesion coverable single stent locate separate major epicardial territory . Each lesion/vessel must meet following criterion : De novo lesion The target lesion reference site must visually estimate ≥ 2.5 mm ≤ 4.0 mm diameter . The target vessel must major coronary artery major branch visually estimate stenosis ≥ 50 % &lt; 100 % . The visually estimate target lesion length must ≤ 34 mm ( DESyne Novolimus Eluting CSS ) ( Arm A ) * . The visually estimate target lesion length must ≤ 34 mm ( DESyne BD Novolimus Eluting CSS ) ( Arm B ) * ≥ TIMI 1 coronary flow . *Subject commercial availability product size specific region/country . The patient must acceptable candidate coronary artery bypass surgery . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within seven ( 7 ) day procedure must agree use reliable method contraception time screen 12 month index procedure . The patient patient 's physician agree followup schedule . The patient guardian inform nature study agree provision provide write informed consent , approve appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee respective clinical site . The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , ticlopidine , clopidogrel , mTOR inhibitor class drug , cobalt chromium alloy , methacrylate polylactide polymer , sensitivity contrast adequately premedicated . The patient female , intend get pregnant within next year . Target vessel ( ) require staged procedure post index hospitalization discharge 9 month index procedure . There untreated significant lesion &gt; 40 % diameter stenosis remain proximal distal target site plan intervention . Previous placement stent within 10 mm target lesion . Total occlusion TIMI 0 coronary flow target vessel . Restenosis lesion The proximal target vessel target lesion severely calcify visual assessment . Aortoostial location , unprotected leave main lesion location , lesion within 5 mm origin LAD LCX . Lesion involvement significant side branch ( branch diameter &gt; 2 mm ) would cover stenting . High probability treatment PTCA stenting require treatment lesion . The patient suffer myocardial infarction within past 72 hour CK CKMB return normal time index procedure . The patient history bleed diathesis coagulopathy refuse blood transfusion . The patient suffer stroke , transient ischemic neurological attack ( TIA ) significant gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed within past six month . The patient renal insufficiency determine creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl . The target lesion , target vessel proximal target lesion , contain thrombus . Documented leave ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 25 % . The patient recipient heart transplant . The patient extensive peripheral vascular disease precludes safe sheath insertion extreme anticoagulation . The patient medical illness ( i.e. , cancer congestive heart failure ) may cause patient noncompliant protocol , confound data interpretation associate withlimited life expectancy ( i.e. , less one year ) . The patient simultaneously participate another investigational device drug study . Patient must complete primary followup phase previous study . Trials extend followup phase commercially available product consider investigational study . Patients may enrol one time trial . Patients unable unwilling cooperate study procedure .</criteria>
