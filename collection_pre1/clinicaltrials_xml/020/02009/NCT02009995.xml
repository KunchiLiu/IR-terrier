	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Resistance exercise training free weight weight machine clearly improves glucose ( sugar ) control type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . However , many patient T2D would prefer attend exercise facility , reason cost and/or convenience . Coinvestigator Jonathon Fowles develop pilot-tested home-based exercise program people T2D use resistance band . However , effect resistance-bands training ( glucose control T2D evaluate high-quality randomize trial . SPECIFIC AIMS To determine effect six month progressive home-based resistance band train ( RBT ) versus RBT people T2D blood glucose control ( HbA1c , primary outcome ) , waist circumference , heart disease risk factor , quality life . METHODS A total 100 T2D participant randomize 2 arm : home-based RBT ( RBT-H ) aerobic training ( ATO ) . Both group accumulate 150 minute per week aerobic exercise walking . The resistance exercise workout include 12 exercise , target major muscle group . RBT-H subject complete exercise home periodic supervision . SIGNIFICANCE The global burden type 2 diabetes increase , complication illness occur primarily whose glucose control fair poor . If exercise training resistance band improve glucose control , could beneficial large number patient travel gym afford gym membership . If resistance exercise adopt patient , likely morbidity associate type 2 diabetes decrease . This particularly true training also improve quality life , people thus inclined continue exercise long term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Resistance exercise training free weight weight machine clearly improve glycemic control type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . However , many patient T2D would prefer , able attend exercise facility , reason cost , comfort convenience . Coinvestigator Dr. Jonathon Fowles develop home-based exercise program people T2D use resistance band . Before-after study use intervention find improvement glycemic control , strength , blood pressure . However , effect resistance-bands training ( RBT ) glycemic control T2D evaluate high-quality randomize trial . RESEARCH QUESTIONS To determine effect six month progressive home-based RBT plus aerobic exercise , versus home-based aerobic exercise alone , previously-sedentary people T2D . METHODS After 2-week run-in period ass adherence , 100 T2D subject currently engage regular exercise randomize equal number 2 arm : primarily home-based RBT ( RBT-H ) aerobic control ( ATO ) . Both group complete aerobic training : accumulation 150 minute per week walk jogging , measure accelerometer . The RBT workout include 12 distinctive exercise , target major muscle group . Subjects train group lead Kinesiologist ( exercise specialist ) twice per week two week run-in . After randomization , RBT-H group perform RBT three time per week . RBT-H participant perform RBT three time per week primarily home , supervise group session weekly week 1-4 , every 2 week week 5-8 , every 4 week thereafter ensure proper form appropriate progression . Adherence RBT verify direct supervision group session , completion detail exercise logs home-based group session . Participants photograph log session email photo designate email address . Study outcome assess baseline , 12 24 week post-randomization . Dietary advice standardize repeated session dietician , dose medication alter glucose , lipid BP hold constant unless change medically urgent . Primary analysis intention-to-treat , use repeat measure mixed model . Per-protocol analysis do include subject complete &gt; 70 % prescribed exercise session end-of-study outcome measure . SIGNIFICANCE The global burden type 2 diabetes increase , complication illness occur primarily whose glycemic control fair poor . If home-based exercise training resistance band improve glycemic control vascular risk factor , could beneficial large number patient prefer travel gym afford gym membership . If resistance exercise adopt patient , likely morbidity associate type 2 diabetes decrease . This particularly true training also improve quality life , people thus inclined continue exercise long term .</detailed_description>
