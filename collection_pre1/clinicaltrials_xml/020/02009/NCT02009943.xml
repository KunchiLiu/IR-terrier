	<brief_summary>The inflammatory response associate surgical critical illness rapidly induce functional iron deficiency , characterize hypoferremia , decrease transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) , hyperferritinemia , iron-deficient erythropoiesis ( IDE ) . This functional iron deficiency contribute intensive care unit ( ICU ) anemia increase pack red blood cell ( pRBCs ) transfusion requirement . The goal iron supplementation critically ill surgical patient reverse serum iron debt , eliminate IDE , improve anemia , decrease pRBCs transfusion . Issues surround iron supplementation patient population include formulation , dose , route administration , mitigation complication iron overload , include infection . The investigator first randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) iron supplementation critically ill surgical patient compare enteral ferrous sulfate 325 mg thrice daily placebo ( NCT00450177 ) . Although significant reduction pRBCs transfusion requirement iron group observe , low injury severity , intolerance enteral medication , predominance traumatic brain injury limited generalizability . In second multicenter RCT , investigator compare intravenous iron sucrose 100 mg thrice weekly placebo among critically ill trauma patient ( NCT01180894 ) . Iron supplementation dose increase TSAT marginally ( normal range ) increase serum ferritin concentration significantly ; however , effect IDE , anemia , pRBCs transfusion requirement . In instance iron supplementation increase risk infection , despite relatively high incidence mark hyperferritinemia ( serum ferritin concentration &gt; 1,000 ng/mL ) iron group . The severity serum bone marrow iron debt observe trial lead u investigate alternative dose scheme deliver large quantity bioavailable iron safely . Ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM ) novel iron-containing complex allow administration large replenishment dose iron ( 750 mg ) short infusion period . Several pharmacodynamic property FCM render appeal use treatment functional iron deficiency associate surgical critical illness , include short infusion time , control , sustain delivery iron target tissue relatively long period time ( one week ) , minimal hypersensitivity reaction . Increased efficacy comparable safety report FCM compare iron sucrose treatment outpatient iron-deficiency anemia . There currently data regard efficacy FCM indication functional iron deficiency associate surgical critical illness . The aim current pilot trial compare two novel dose scheme treatment function iron deficiency surgical ICU patient , involve delivery large total dose iron compare NCT00450177 NCT01180894 . The investigator hypothesize iron supplementation FCM , compare iron sucrose placebo , effective equally safe replace serum iron debt .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL ) . Functional iron deficiency : 1 . Serum iron concentration &lt; 40 ug/dL 2 . TSAT &lt; 25 % 3 . Serum ferritin concentration &gt; 28 ng/mL &lt; 72 hour ICU admission . Expected ICU length stay ≥ 7 day . Age &lt; 18 year . Active bleed require pRBCs transfusion Iron overload ( serum ferritin concentration ≥ 1,500 ng/mL ) . The serum ferritin concentration acute phase reactant increase critical illness regardless total body iron [ 3 ] . Substantial level hyperferritinemia ( serum ferrinin concentration &gt; 1,000 ng/dL ) observe NCT00450177 NCT01180894 without increase risk infection despite low TSAT IDE . For reason , believe relative hyperferritinemia ( serum ferritin concentration 500 1,500 ng/dL ) neither harmful indicative bone marrow iron availability . Infection , define use US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) guideline , exception ventilatorassociated pneumonia ( VAP ) , define clinical suspicion pneumonia along low respiratory tract culture ≥ 105 colony form unit per mL . Chronic inflammatory condition ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondilitis ) . Preexisting hematologic disorder ( e.g. , thalassemia , sickle cell disease , hemophilia , von Willibrand 's disease , myeloproliferative disease ) . Macrocytic anemia ( admission mean corpuscular volume ≥ 100 fL ) . Current recent ( within 30 day ) use immunosuppressive agent . Use recombinant human erythropoietin formulation within previous 30 day . Pregnancy lactation . Legal arrest incarceration . Prohibition pRBCs transfusion . Stay ≥ 48 hour duration ICU transfer hospital . History intolerance hypersensitivity iron . Moribund state death imminent .</criteria>
