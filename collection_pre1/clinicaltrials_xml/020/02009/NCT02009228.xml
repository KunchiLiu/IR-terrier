	<brief_summary>Minimally invasive surgery become standard treatment many gynecologic disease process . In last decade , numerous study demonstrate laparoscopic approach various gynecologic oncology conditions-particularly early-stage endometrial cervical cancer well select pelvic masses-is feasible result shorter hospital stay , improve quality life comparable surgical oncologic outcomes abdominal staging.For instance , typical gynecologic robotic surgical procedure require Two three 5-mm port one 12-mm laparoscopic port . Recently , even less invasive alternative conventional laparoscopy surgery develop : laparoendoscopic single-site surgery ( LESS ) , also know single-port surgery . Single port laparoscopy attempt enhance cosmetic benefit minimally invasive surgery minimize potential morbidity associate multiple incision . Preliminary advance LESS apply urologic gastrointestinal surgery demonstrate technique feasible provide optimal surgical technical expertise advance skill optimal instrumentation available . Recently , several publication show single port laparoscopic surgery feasibility gynecologic surgery include oophorectomy , cystecomty , myomecomty . To knowledge , sample size recent publication single port surgery include cystectomy myomecomty small . Furthermore , study lack comparison single port convectional laparoscopic surgery . Base recent study demonstrate either single-port conventional approach use LAVH , single-port LAVH technique yield less postoperative pain ( Chen et al. , Obestet Gynecol , 2011 ) . The purpose study assess feasibility single port laparoscopic surgery treatment benign gynecologic disease .</brief_summary>
