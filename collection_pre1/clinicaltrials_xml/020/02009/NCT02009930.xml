	<brief_title>Assessment Coronary Artery Calcium Active Duty Enlisted Military Members With 10 More Years Service</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While military make stride towards improve health habit service member , many aspect military culture negatively affect cardiovascular health military member . Smoking/tobacco use , poor eat habit Meals Ready-to-eat ( MRE ) ready access fast food establishment base , inconsistent exercise , socioeconomic status enlist member stress deployment factor contribute increase risk cardiovascular disease military service . Currently calculation patient 's Framingham risk score commonly use method calculate patient 's cardiovascular risk , calculation base age , smoke history , blood pressure , lab value compare general population 's risk . By use cardiac CT scan , Coronary Artery Calcium ( CAC ) score calculate used estimate degree atherosclerosis already present patient 's coronary artery , thus establish risk future cardiovascular event . CAC score patient-specific way identify cardiovascular risk . The purpose study assess prevalence atherosclerosis enlist military member least 10 year service one cardiovascular risk factor determine risk cardiovascular event high predict Framingham score . If CAC score demonstrated accurate , particularly likely detect risk , may use future good risk stratify population military . The CAC result patient could also motivate factor create change military culture attempt mitigate risk create healthy fight force .</detailed_description>
