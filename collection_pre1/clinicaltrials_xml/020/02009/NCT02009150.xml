	<brief_summary>Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging ( 3D MIRA ) new infrared imaging technology use Real Imager 4 ( RI4 ) develop Real Imaging . This technology generate 3D metabolic map base sophisticated machine learn technology , provide objective risk assessment presence malignant tumor . The procedure non-invasive , comfortable involve ionize radiation . Moreover , Real Imaging 's 3D Functional MIRA unaffected breast density therefore ideal evaluate patient mammographically dense breast . The purpose clinical study assess ability novel technology detect clinically occult breast cancer cohort woman high risk breast cancer . We hypothesize combination screen mammography metabolic screening ( 3D MIRA ) result significantly high breast cancer detection rate .</brief_summary>
