	<detailed_description>[ During screen period treatment period , visit within ±3 day schedule time . ] Screening Period : Visit 1 occur Week -8 subject require washout and/or statin , cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ( CAI ) , statin-CAI stabilization . This include subject : - Were previously omega-3 drugs/supplements ; - Require adjustment addition permit statin , CAI , statin-CAI combination ; - Have permit stable dose statin , CAI , statin-CAI combination least 4 week prior Visit 1 ; and/or - Need washout bile acid sequestrants , fibrates , niacin , supplement know alter lipid metabolism . For subject require washout and/or statin , CAI , statin-CAI stabilization , Visit 1 ( Week -8 ) screening procedure perform . Subjects return Visit 1a ( Week -2 ) first qualify lipid measurement . For subject require washout , Visit 1 occur Week -2 . All screening procedure perform visit include first qualify lipid measurement . At Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) , subject return second lipid qualify measurement . If Visit 2 subject average TG ≥500 mg/dL ( 6 mmol/L ) &lt; 2500 mg/dL ( 28 mmol/L ) , TG measurement may repeat one additional time Visit 2 ( Visit 2a ) . The subject 's qualifying measurement would average Visit 1 1a + Visit 2 + Visit 2a ( repeat measurement ) . To eligible randomization , subject must qualify TG ≥500 mg/dL ( 6 mmol/L ) &lt; 2500 mg/dL ( 28 mmol/L ) . Of total number subject , approximately 50 % qualify TG &gt; 885 mg/dL ( 10 mmol/L ) &lt; 2500 mg/dL ( 28 mmol/L ) . Once approximately 50 % total subject reach TG group , enrollment subject specific TG criterion stop . Subjects equally allocated treatment group . [ At screen visit , subject receive counsel regard National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes ( TLC ) diet receive basic instruction follow diet . See Appendix C. ] Treatment Period : At Visit 3 ( Week 0 ) , approximately 116 subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive daily olive oil 2 g Epanova 2 g. Subjects stratify lipid-altering drug ensure balance allocation subject users non-users follow permit lipid-altering drug treatment group : statin , CAI , statin-CAI combination . During treatment period , subject return site Visit 4 ( Week 6 ) , Visit 5 ( Week 10 ) , Visit 6 ( Week 12 ) efficacy safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
