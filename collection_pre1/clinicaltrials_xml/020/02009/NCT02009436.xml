	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect best dose azacitidine treating patient lung cancer stage IV return previous treatment ( recurrent ) . Azacitidine drug use chemotherapy may stop tumor cell grow spread activate gene help prevent cancer growth , call tumor suppressor gene . As people age , gene silence chemical reaction occur naturally body , exposure environmental factor smoke . Azacitidine may help reverse process restore function tumor suppressor gene . Delivering azacitidine directly lung inhalation may work well treat lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability toxicity inhale Vidaza速 ( azacitidine ) special emphasis pulmonary toxicity . II . To determine minimum effective dose inhale Vidaza速 require induce re-expression relevant 5 candidate tumor suppressor gene ( cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [ p16 ] , h-cadherin [ H-Cad ] , opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like [ OPCML ] , secrete frizzled-related protein 1 [ SFRP-1 ] , ras association domain family 1 [ RASSF1A ] ) silence 20-50 % bronchial tissue heavy smoker lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics inhaled Vidaza速 . II . To determine change global methylation pattern bronchial epithelium ( bronchial tissue sample ) pre post treatment . III . To determine change methylation pattern exhale breath . IV . To evaluate efficacy inhaled Vidaza速 intra-thoracic tumor ( response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion intrapulmonary lesion ) . V. To estimate progression free , intra-thoracic tumor progression free overall survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive azacitidine via nebulizer 20 minute daily ( QD ) day 1-5 15-19 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue treatment case-by-case basis discretion principal investigator Institutional Review Board . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
