	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study identify effective brief intervention reduce short-term risk suicide attempt `` real world '' military triage setting , identify potential mechanism change underlie intervention ' impact subsequent suicide attempt . We randomize 360 patient one three commonly-used crisis intervention deliver routine care mental health triage system : ( 1 ) Treatment As Usual ( TAU ) ; ( 2 ) Crisis Response Plan ( CRP ) ; ( 3 ) Enhanced Crisis Response Plan Reasons For Living ( E-CRP ) . The following hypothesis test : 1 . The enhanced crisis response plan ( E-CRP ) intervention contribute significantly decrease risk suicide attempt hospitalization follow-up relative crisis response plan alone ( CRP ) treatment usual ( TAU ) . 2 . The crisis response plan ( CRP ) intervention contribute significantly decrease risk suicide attempt hospitalization follow-up relative treatment usual ( TAU ) . 3 . Greater ambivalence suicide faster recall reason live mediate relationship intervention reduce risk suicide attempt follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CRP propose alternative TAU short-term management suicidal patient widespread use , never empirically test . The CRP purport reduce suicide risk via unique mechanism directly suicide risk , notably suicidal ambivalence ( i.e. , relative balance wish live wish die ) problem solve . Because suicidal ambivalence gain support active mechanism reduce suicide risk , present study also seek augment underlie mechanism directly engage suicidal patient discussion reason living , thereby potentially increase potency CRP . The present study therefore entails component analysis crisis intervention . As , anticipate ordered effect , whereby CRP E-CRP condition show significantly good outcome TAU , E-CRP demonstrate significantly well outcomes standard CRP condition .</detailed_description>
