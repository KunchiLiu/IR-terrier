	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well trametinib combination chemotherapy work treat patient refractory advanced biliary gallbladder cancer remove surgery . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give trametinib effective combination chemotherapy treat patient biliary gallbladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Biliary Gallbladder Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival ( OS ) patient refractory advanced biliary cancer randomize Arm 1 : trametinib compare randomized Arm 2 : chemotherapy ( either 5-fluorouracil [ fluorouracil ] leucovorin [ leucovorin calcium ] capecitabine ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event trametinib patient population . II . To assess response rate ( RR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient randomize Arm 1 : trametinib patient randomize Arm 2 : chemotherapy ( fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] capecitabine patient population ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 16-gene expression signature predictive mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) efficacy evidence improved RR , PFS , OS . II . To evaluate effect trametinib inflammatory cytokine explore potential association response rate survival . III . To estimate lean soft tissue fat mass weight gain result treatment trametinib vs. capecitabine patient advance refractory biliary cancer . IV . To bank tissue sample future correlative study include next generation sequence whole genome methylation assay . NOTE : These potential future correlative study perform amend protocol relevant detailed information include specific arm assay approved Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive 1 2 treatment regimen discretion investigator . ARM IIA : Patients receive leucovorin calcium intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IIB : Patients receive capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
