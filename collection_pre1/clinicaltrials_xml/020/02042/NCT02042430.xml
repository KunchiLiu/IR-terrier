	<brief_title>Epacadostat Before Surgery Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III-IV Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine extent INCB024360 ( epacadostat ) alters number cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine extent INCB024360 alter number character tumor infiltrate lymphocyte IHC gene signature microarray analysis . II . To determine extent INCB024360 alters character cellular content peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ascites fluid determined multiparameter flow cytometry . III . To determine extent INCB024360 alters PBMC ascites fluid transcriptomes . IV . To determine whether INCB024360 alters ongoing nascent anti-tumor response antigen associated ovarian cancer ( e.g. , cancer/testis antigen 1B [ NY-ESO-1 ] , preferentially express antigen melanoma [ PRAME ] mesothelin ) well memory viral response ( influenza A ) , chronic viral response ( cytomegalovirus ) . V. To assess safety tolerability INCB024360 . VI . To determine extent regimen INCB024360 normalize serum kynurenine/tryptophan ( Kyn/Trp ) ratios alter tumor microenvironment assess ascites intra-tumor Kyn/Trp ratio time surgery , one day stop INCB024360 . VII . To associate observed change expression IDO1 protein IHC tumor tumor infiltrate cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive epacadostat orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 undergo surgery day 15 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In circumstance medical administrative reason delay surgery , treatment epacadostat may continue 3 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
