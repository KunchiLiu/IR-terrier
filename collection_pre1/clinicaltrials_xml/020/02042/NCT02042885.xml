For dose escalation part : Patients exhaust standard treatment option recurrent refractory cancer ( ovarian cancer , cervical squamous cell carcinoma , breast cancer , salivary gland cancer , endometrial cancer ) Histologically cytologically document diagnosis cancer Measurable disease accord RECIST Version 1.1 prostate cancer also evaluable disease accord Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) eligibility criterion ovarian cancer also evaluable disease ( nonmeasurable ) accord Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) criterion Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 ( 1500/mm3 ) platelet ≥100 × 109/L ( without platelet transfusion within last 4 week first study drug administration ) , haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Screening Alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase ≤2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN ( exception : patient liver metastasis allow aspartate aminotransferase ≤5 × ULN alanine aminotransferase ≤5 × ULN ) screen Albumin ≥26 g/L Screening Concurrent prior treatmentrelated toxicity Grade 2 high . Exception : toxicity view investigator clinically significant safety risk Investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) administration . Previous treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy anticancer therapy within 4 week first dose study drug ( least 6 week mitoxantrone , nitrosurea , bicalutamide ) . Treatment systemic glucocorticosteroids 2 mg dexamethasone equivalent per day case treatment ≤2 mg dexamethasone equivalent per day : 1 . Dosing change within 6 week Screening 2 . The patient 's cancer respond glucocorticosteroid intake Radiation therapy within 4 week prior first dose IMP . Treatment systemic IMP clinical trial within 28 day Screening Visit .
