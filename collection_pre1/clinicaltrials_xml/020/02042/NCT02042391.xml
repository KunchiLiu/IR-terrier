	<brief_summary>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) differ clinically lymphoma general ( immunocompetent ) population due high incidence frequent association Epstein-Barr virus . Previous clinical trial show remarkably good response rituximab well chemotherapy . The PTLD-1 trial demonstrate efficacy safety sequential immunochemotherapy 4 course rituximab IV follow 4 cycle CHOP chemotherapy . Compared trial rituximab monotherapy PTLD , median overall survival extend 2.4 6.5 year . Compared previous trial chemotherapy , complication reduce . In addition , note patient already good response first four cycle rituximab good overall . As consequence , PTLD-1/3 trial introduce risk-stratification sequential treatment accord response first 4 course rituximab monotherapy . Those patient complete remission go receive four course rituximab whereas receive rituximab CHOP chemotherapy . Interim result demonstrate safe restrict chemotherapy treatment manner thus establish concept treatment stratification base response rituximab . The PTLD-2 trial next step development strategy . Compared PTLD-1/3 trial , key difference use subcutaneous instead intravenous rituximab application . Interim result ongoing trial patient follicular lymphoma ( NCT01200758 ) show subcutaneous administration result increase blood level non-inferior remission rate . Furthermore , stratification strategy refine base observation previous PTLD-1 PTLD1/3 trial : Risk group define base response rituximab therapy also international prognostic index ( IPI , well-established lymphoma risk score ) transplant organ . The major advantage new stratification extend low-risk group eligible subcutaneous rituximab monotherapy : Patients low risk disease progression , define achieve complete remission first four course subcutaneous rituximab monotherapy IPI 0 2 achieve partial remission interim staging , go rituximab monotherapy . Patients high IPI achieve partial remission , patient stable disease interim stag non-thoracic transplant recipient progressive disease interim stag consider high risk . These patient go 4 cycle rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy similar PTLD-1/3 protocol . Thoracic transplant recipient refractory rituximab consider high risk go rituximab subcutaneous plus alternating chemotherapy CHOP DHAOx . The trial hypothesis new protocol improve event-free survival , measure integrate unfavorable event death , disease progression treatment complication , particularly infection , low risk-group compare result PTLD-1 trial . In high-risk patient data PTLD-1 PTLD-1/3 trial show current treatment sufficient control disease . Death due disease progression observe 80 % patient . Here , rituximab combine alternate chemotherapy cycle CHOP DHAOx ( +GCSF ) may increase treatment efficacy acceptable toxicity profile . In summary , PTLD-2 trial test substitution subcutaneous intravenous rituximab update stratification strategy deescalates treatment low risk escalate treatment high risk improve overall efficacy safety PTLD therapy .</brief_summary>
