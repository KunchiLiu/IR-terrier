	<brief_summary>Before la surgery : Transthoracic cardiac echography do systematically , measure among thing size leave atrium . During surgery : Surgery extracorporeal circulation : tissue sample harvest right atrium ( one clamping aorta ( T0= pre-ischemia sample ) , immediately declamping aorta ( T1= post-ischemia sample ) . Surgery without extracorporeal circulation : tissue sample right atrium CABG ( T0 ) second sample CABG ( T1 ) . In parallel harvesting cardiac tissue , blood sample take different time ( H0 , H3 , H24 ) correlate tissue data systemic data . These take anesthetist . After surgery : Holter ECG set 7 day continuous record . Each patient fill observation notebook . The biological sample analyse immediately biological data obtain recorded observation notebook .</brief_summary>
