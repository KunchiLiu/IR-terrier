	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Carfilzomib Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible study , begin first cycle treatment carfilzomib . Each cycle 28 day . On Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-12 : - Participant receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . The first 2 dos participant receives may lower late dos . This reduce risk allergic reaction . On Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 Cycles 13 beyond : - Participant receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . Participant drink least 6-8 cup ( 8 ounce ) fluid per day start 2 day first day treatment long doctor asks . During Cycles 1 2 , participant receive fluid vein dose carfilzomib . Before participant receives carfilzomib , give standard drug ( allopurinol , dexamethasone , antibiotic , anti-fungals , and/or anti-virals ) help decrease risk side effect . Participant may ask study staff information drug give risk . When participant receives drug Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 , monitor side effect 1 hour receive study drug . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Participant neurological exam check weakness , numbness pain hand foot . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If participant 's doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . - If participant 's doctor think need , ECHO MUGA . - If participant able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . ( Cycles 2 beyond ) On Days 2 , 9 , 16 cycle : - Participant 's vital sign measure . On Days 8 15 cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If participant able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , Cycle 12 , every 3 cycle : - If study doctor think need , participant CT scan , MRI , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . - If study doctor think need , participant gastrointestinal endoscopy colonoscopy . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug 3 year . Participant longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study complete long term follow-up phone call . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 30 day , participant finish take study drug return clinic follow test procedure : - Participant physical exam . - Participant neurological exam check weakness , numbness pain hand foot . - Participant EKG check heart function . - Blood ( 3-5 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - Participant CT scan and/or x-ray check status disease . - Participant PET/CT scan check status disease . - If participant 's doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspiration - If participant 's doctor think need , colonoscopy/gastrointestinal endoscopy . - If participant able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . Long Term Follow-Up : After participant 's end-of-treatment visit , call every 6 month 1 year see find treatment receive since stop study treatment . These call take 2-3 minute . In addition phone call , participant 's medical record may review well . This investigational study . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type multiple myeloma . This drug investigational treatment MCL . Up 60 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
