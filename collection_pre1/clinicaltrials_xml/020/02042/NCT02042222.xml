	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease disorder red blood cell ( RBCs ) abnormally shape . This result painful episode , serious infection , chronic anemia ( decrease number red blood cell ) , damage body organ . Hydroxyurea therapy offer significant benefit infant , child , adolescent sickle cell anemia . These include reduction frequency pain crisis acute chest syndrome ( inflammation lung ) increase hemoglobin ( oxygen-carrying protein ) blood . Patients hydroxyurea receive maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) specific great clinical benefit receive standard low dose . There , however , way currently predict MTD individual patient . As , MTD patient currently determine gradual increase dose several month . This process time-consuming , require monthly clinic visit , delay benefit hydroxyurea therapy . Our research group come equation could use predict patient 's MTD use baseline clinical laboratory measure start hydroxyurea treatment . The purpose research study compare use equation predict MTD current standard practice gradually increase hydroxyurea dose MTD reach . We want see use predictive equation allow u achieve MTD faster side effect standard practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Dose Escalation Predict Treatment With Hydroxyurea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To eligible participate study , patient must decide want begin hydroxyurea therapy . Patients choose participate study assign randomly ( like flip coin ) one two hydroxyurea treatment group . Both group patient receive hydroxyurea treatment , determination start hydroxyurea dose different two group : 1 . Group 1 : The standard ( dose increase ) group : Patients assign group treat follow method currently standard patient start hydroxyurea institution . All patient start dose 20 milligram per kilogram body weight . Dose change make every eight week patient judge MTD . 2 . Group 2 : The alternative ( dose-prediction ) group : Patients assign group predict MTD determine use dose-prediction equation start directly dose . Patients group assess clinic two week start treatment , monthly see side effect hydroxyurea . We also check see MTD reach . Once decide patient reach maximum dose , continue monitor two additional clinic visit ( approximately eight additional week ) complete collection end-of-study biological blood urine sample ensure late harmful effect hydroxyurea . The maximum time patient study 12 month start hydroxyurea therapy . Patients also ask participate 2 optional associate study . 1 . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study : The purpose study analyze body 's absorption clearance hydroxyurea . Patients participate study receive one-time dose hydroxyurea , blood sample collection follow time point : right dose hydroxyurea , 15 minute , 30 minute , 60 minute , 2 hour , 4 hour dose . There total six blood sample draw , half teaspoon ( 2 milliliter ) . 2 . Biologic study : The purpose study determine effect hydroxyurea therapy blood urine marker severity sickle cell disease . Patients participate study one blood sample 2 teaspoon ( 10 milliliter ) urine sample collect start hydroxyurea therapy . Another blood urine sample collect complete study . These sample use analyze marker associate follow disease process sickle cell disease : 1. inflammation , blood vessel damage oxidative stress . 2. blood viscosity . 3. early kidney disease . 4. early brain disease . 5. altered function white blood cell , red blood cell , platelet .</detailed_description>
