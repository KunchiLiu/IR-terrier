	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether use FDA approve endoscopic bipolar catheter ( EndoHPB ) ablate tissue malignant tumor within pancreatic duct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Probe Management Unresectable Bile Duct Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only small proportion patient biliary obstruction cause cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer suitable surgical resection . Therefore patient malignant biliary obstruction need palliation jaundice relieve symptom pruritus , malabsorption , sepsis minimize potential hepatorenal complication . Restoring biliary flow relief jaundice primary goal palliation obstructive biliary malignancy . Drainage endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ECRP ) establish safe approach percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ( PTC ) low risk bile leak , infection hemorrhage . ECRP first approach relieve malignant biliary obstruction sometimes technically possible stent patient approach , PTC need undertaken . Self expand mesh metal stent ( SEMS ) introduce back 1990s . Problems still arise use covered stent cholecystitis , pancreatitis tumor overgrowth end stent , study show covered stent actually reduce problem tumor ingrowth consequent stent occlusion . EndoHPB deploy via ERCP PTC route . By use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy heat tissue duct prior insertion stent , surround tissue becomes coagulate may may delay tumor growth time stent lumen become block . Thereby allow increase period need intervention stent deployment . If EndoHPB use luminal RF demonstrate effective luminal tumor ablation , may additional role form neoadjuvant therapy cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
