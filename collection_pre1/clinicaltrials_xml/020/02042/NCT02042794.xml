	<brief_summary>Liver resection operation remove diseased part liver . The liver supply two vessel , hepatic artery portal vein supply 25 % 75 % respectively total blood flow 50 % oxygen vessel . During liver resection standard practice clamp vessel ( Pringle 's manoeuvre ) , avoid bleeding . Clamping vessels deprives unaffected liver nutrient require survival . Reinstating blood supply cause damage pour harmful substance liver , accumulate clamping . We hypothesize clamp oxygen rich hepatic artery cause less damage liver . Our aim compare Pringle manoeuvre portal vein clamping , identify latter result less tissue injury thereby few complication . Initially aim conduct pilot study . The main objective ensure patient successfully recruit data capture complete . The secondary outcome development infective complication 30 day follow surgery , bleed blood transfusion requirement , heart/chest complication , recovery liver function , growth remnant liver , death within 30 day follow surgery , length high dependency unit/hospital stay quality life 3 month surgery . There publish literature safety method event intraoperative problem , procedure convert standard Pringle manoeuvre . The Liver Unit St James 's University Hospital four surgeon perform around 270 liver cancer resection per year , nearly 160 bowel cancer spread . Considering team 's experience research liver surgery , believe well place conduct trial safe efficient manner .</brief_summary>
