	<brief_summary>Introduction : Chronic pelvic pain unknown pathology condition affect men woman . condition define pelvic pain last minimum 6 month without know etiology eg . cancer , infection inherent anatomical abnormality . Low intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( LIESWT ) enable practitioner deliver small amount energy approximately 5 cm skin patient without damage skin . This show increase blood flow accelerate healing could also beneficial chronic pelvic pain patients.The purpose study investigate effect LIESWT chronic pelvic pain . Methods : All patient treat Birthe Bonde clinic , Copenhagen , Denmark . The investigator anticipate include 100 chronic pelvic pain patient study . include patient randomize two group : active treatment sham treatment . All patient require provide urine sample semen sample prior final inclusion . Samples analyze microbial growth . Furthermore , patient undergo digital rectal exploration finally patient require provide informed consent order include study . A Storz Doulith SD1 T-Top ( CE1275 ) use generate shockwaves . Patients receive treatment week symptom seize maximum 6 time . Each treatment consist 3000 shockwaves apply perineum energy density 0.25-0.40 millijoule ( mJ ) /mm2 frequency 3 hz . Participants fill questionnaire one week treatment , one week , four week , twelve week last treatment . Possible gain study : The investigator hope provide evidence treatment consequently able offer treatment alternative limited array treatment exist group patient today . Ethics , funding , publication : The study perform compliance Helsinki declaration . External funding apply yet receive . Participants inform source external funding . The result study publish soon possible , preferably peer-reviewed international journal .</brief_summary>
