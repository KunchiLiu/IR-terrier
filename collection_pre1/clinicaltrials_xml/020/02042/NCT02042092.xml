	<brief_summary>This study cross sectional comparison Color Doppler Ultrasonography ( CDUS ) Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) patient diagnose sLVV . The supraaortic large vessel ( aorta , carotid , subclavian , vertebral , axillary artery ) temporal artery fifty patient suffer sLVV examine CDUS MRA . The image evaluate 2 blind expert ( one CDUS one MRA ) . In addition , intima medium complex ( IMC ) thickness large vessel temporal artery measure CDUS 100 sex age match control sLVV patient . Blood sample patient control collect order perform genetic cytokine analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose cross sectional study recruit 50 patient diagnosed sLVV . All patient recruit study referral outpatient clinic Department Rheumatology , Hospital Southern Norway Trust . The diagnosis base previous CDUS , MRA , CTA and/or biopsy temporal artery . The patient classify accord specific set classification criterion GCA ( 11 ) TA ( 12 ) . The patient undergo CDUS evaluation supraaortic large vessel temporal artery . In addition , thorough clinical assessment perform CDUS visit . A blood sample test acute phase response ( CRP ESR ) biochemical parameter part standard care also collect . Within one week CDUS evaluation , MRA thoracic aorta , supra-aortic vessel temporal artery perform . The image examination upload anonymously database two external expert blind patient ( one CDUS one MRA ) evaluate data . The complete evaluation form uploaded database . The ultrasound examination perform use high-end equipment , Siemens S-2000 high , medium frequency linear ( 18 MHz superficial vessel medium frequency 13 MHz deep vessel ) phased-array transducer ( examination aorta ) . The supraaortic vessel thoracic aorta evaluated Gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo sequence fat saturation 1.5 Tesla MRI equipment . In examination , measurement intima-media complex ( IMC ) thickness perform . The high IMC thickness measurement record longitudinal transverse film ( &gt; 3 sec length B color Doppler mode CDUS ) . Positive examination consider measurement IMC thickness &gt; 1.5 mm aorta , carotid , subclavian &gt; 1.0mm vertebral axillary artery . For temporal artery , presence halo ( circumferential , hypoechoic thickness IMC transverse/longitudinal view ) consider positive finding . Stenoses 50 % modality also record . Retrograde flow vertebral artery CDUS examination also consider positive finding . Additionally , 100 healthy individual match sex age sLVV patient examine supraaortic large vessel temporal artery CDUS . The IMC thickness healthy individual measure CDUS , recording label stored database Department Rheumatology , Hospital Southern Norway Trust , Kristiansand . The CDUS MRA image submit external expert evaluation use specific evaluation form ( Appendix ) . Both expert blind clinical , laboratory previous image finding patient . In addition , level inflammatory cytokine , chemokines vascular marker ( e.g . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 ) blood sample patient sLVV measure compare healthy control . Whole blood , plasma serum sample store -70 oC analyze expression panel inflammatory cytokine Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) relate method . Total RNA prepare whole blood . All blood sample store Revmabiobank Hospital Southern Norway Trust Kristiansand .</detailed_description>
