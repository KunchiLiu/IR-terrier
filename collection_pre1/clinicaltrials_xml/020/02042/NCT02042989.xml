	<brief_title>MLN9708 Vorinostat Patients With Advanced p53 Mutant Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level MLN9708 vorinostat base join study . Up 4 dose level MLN9708 vorinostat combination test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level combination . The first group participant receive low dose level combination . Each new group receive high dose either MLN9708 vorinostat group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination MLN9708 vorinostat find 4 dose level fill . Up additional 14 participant enrol high dose level study drug combination . The dose study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take MLN9708 capsule mouth every 7 day ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 every cycle ) . You swallow MLN9708 capsule whole 8 ounce ( 1 cup ) water . Each capsule swallow separately sip water . Do break , chew , open capsule . Each dose take empty stomach , least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If miss dose , take soon remember , long next schedule dose least 72 hour ( 3 day ) away . You take double dose make miss dose . If vomit take dose , wait next schedule dose . Do take additional dose . You take vorinostat capsule mouth Days 1-21 cycle , follow break 7 day . You swallow vorinostat capsule whole water . Do break , chew , open capsule . Vorinostat take food . If miss dose , take soon remember , long next schedule dose least 12 hour away . You take double dose make miss dose . If vomit take dose , wait next schedule dose . Do take additional dose . It important tell doctor side effect study . If side effect abnormal test result , may ask return clinic test side effect abnormal test result improve . Your dose study drug may change and/or may give drug help control side effect . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 : ° Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check liver kidney function . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . At end Cycles 2 beyond : - You CT , PET , and/or MRI scan check status disease . If doctor think need , may measurement sooner . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . Tumor marker use check status disease . Any time doctor think need : - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) collect pregnancy test . - You EKG check heart function . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , develop new health problem , longer able follow study direction . You may choose stop take study drug time . You tell study doctor right away think longer take part study . The study doctor talk safely stop take study drug . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 7 teaspoon ) draw routine test , test kidney liver function , tumor marker test . - You CT , PET , and/or MRI scan check status disease . If doctor think need , may scan perform sooner . This investigational study . MLN9708 FDA approve commercially available . MLN9708 currently use research purpose . Vorinostat FDA approve commercially available treat advance cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 56 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
