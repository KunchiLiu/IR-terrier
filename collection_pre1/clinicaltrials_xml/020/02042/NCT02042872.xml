	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid Administration Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immobilization associate disuse osteoporosis . Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) produce syndrome acute skeletal immobilization immediate irreversible unload involved skeletal region result accelerated bone loss . In addition rapid bone loss , also complication hypercalciuria , hypercalcemia , nephrolithiasis , renal insufficiency . In report , much 50 % regional bone mass lose within first year paralysis . A depletion regional bone magnitude greatly increase risk fracture , associate morbidity increase cost care . Often , fracture occur minimal non-obvious trauma may pass undiagnosed vary lengths time due absence pain sensation . The acute complication fracture may include hemorrhage , deep venous thrombosis , autonomic dysreflexia . Long-term complication include functional deformity , non-union , infection , heterotopic calcification , significantly longer healing time . The sociology-economic consequence include minimum 1 2 week hospitalization potential need increase level attendant care . This study address efficacy bisphosphonate , zoledronic acid ( Reclast : 5 mg ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc. , East Hanover , NJ ) , prevention bone loss associate acute SCI . Prevention regional osteoporosis person SCI would reduce morbidity associate fracture , know secondary complication immobilization . Thus , quality life would improve term employment responsibility ( reduction day absent employment income lose ) personal activity ( recreational endeavor , independence , ease one performs activity daily live ) . Individuals SCI may engage securely activity without fear fracture , tremendous psychological benefit .</detailed_description>
