	<brief_title>Treatment Comparison Antibiotics Versus Vaginal Lactic Acid Non-pregnant Women With Acute Symptomatic Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) common cause vaginitis woman childbearing age , estimate prevalence 29 % general population woman age 14 49 year . Women symptomatic BV may present malodorous discharge off-white , thin , homogenous fishy smell especially intercourse . However , minority woman BV symptomatic . Regardless symptom , may importance treat woman BV , condition associate serious risk , increase risk preterm birth pregnant woman , particular vulnerability acquisition sexually transmit disease ( STD ) , include gonorrhea , chlamydia trachomatis , genital herpes HIV possibly high risk pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) . Moreover , endometrial bacterial colonization , plasma-cell endometritis , postpartum fever , post-hysterectomy vaginal cluff cellulitis post-abortal infection seem associate BV . The pathophysiology BV consist change microbiologic composition vaginal flora . In healthy vaginal flora , lactobacilli predominant bacteria , produce lactic acid H2O2 , maintain pH &lt; 4.5 inhibit growth organism . In BV , concentration H2O2-producing lactobacillus reduce specie become prevalent , notably Gardnerella vaginalis , Prevotella specie , Porphyromonas specie , Bacteroides specie , Peptostreptococcus specie , Mycoplasma hominis , Ureaplasma urealyticum , Mobiluncus specie . These vaginal anaerobe produce carboxylase enzyme , break peptide amine , get volatile malodorous increase pH . More amines increase vaginal transudation squamous epithelial cell exfoliation , lead typical discharge BV . With increased pH , Gardnerella vaginalis adhere squamous epithelial cell create biofilm . The mechanism floral imbalance occur clear , sexual activity seem major risk factor , BV occur sexual inactive woman . Additionally , multiple new sexual partner , frequency vaginal intercourse , vaginal douching , cigarette smoking also identify risk factor , whereas use condom protective effect . BV diagnose use clinical criterion Gram stain . For standard clinical use , practical diagnostic criterion propose Amsel et al.. Amsel criterion include : ( ) adherent grayish-white discharge ; ( b ) positive whiff test ( fishy odor vaginal discharge addition 10 % potassium hydroxide ) ; ( c ) elevate vaginal pH ( pH &gt; 4.5 ) ; ( ) presence clue cell microscopy . The diagnosis BV make , 3 4 symptom present . A Gram stain ( Nugent Score ) consider gold standard laboratory method diagnose BV determines relative concentration Gram-positive lactobacillus , Gram-negative Gram-variable rod cocci curve Gram-negative rod characteristic BV . BV resolve spontaneously one-third non-pregnant one-half pregnant woman . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommend treatment non-pregnant woman symptomatic BV relieve vaginal symptom sign infection . Treatment also indicate prevent postoperative infection asymptomatic infection prior abortion hysterectomy . Some expert recommend treat woman BV , reduce risk acquire STDs . The treatment choice BV oral metronidazole 500 mg orally twice day 7 day . Other recommend regimen metronidazole gel 0.75 % , one full applicator ( 5 g ) intravaginally , day 5 day ; clindamycin cream 2 % , one full applicator ( 5 g ) intravaginally bedtime 7 day . Alternative regimen tinidazole 2 g orally daily 2 day ; tinidazole 1 g orally daily 5 day ; clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily 7 day ; clindamycin ovule 100 mg intravaginally bedtime 3 day . Oral metronidazole consider treatment choice cure rate 80 - 90 % . Although available antibiotic therapy produce good result short term , symptomatic BV persist recurs 1 month approximately 11 % 29 % patient . At 3 month , recurrence BV report 50 % 70 % patient , long-term recurrence approach 85 % . Although cause recurrence know , find vaginal biofilm Gardnerella vaginalis Atopobium vagina persist treatment , probably explain high recurrence rate . In vitro study lactobacilli able disrupt biofilm reduce risk BV . Thus , investigate , recolonizing vagina healthy stain H2O2-producing lactobacillus could prevent relapse treatment . Systemic review trial investigate probiotic treatment BV find sufficient evidence efficacy . Acidification another treatment option , lower vaginal pH encourage growth lactobacillus . In one study , acid gel effective metronidazole treatment BV . Similarly , observational study , use acetic acid vaginal gel treatment BV significantly reduce rate recurrence . However , data treatment prevention efficacy acidification scarce controversial . Objective The principal exploratory goal present pilot study assess efficacy Gynofit® vaginal gel ( lactic acid glycogen ) compare oral metronidazole treatment BV . Methods In pilot study clinical efficacy treatment assess use Amsel criterion , diagnostic criterion use standard clinical practice . The Nugent score , laboratory method diagnose BV , measure well confirm clinical finding . Finally , subjective BV symptom assess mean questionnaire determine subjective effectiveness treatment .
