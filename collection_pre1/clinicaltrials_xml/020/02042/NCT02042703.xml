	<brief_summary>The purpose study use special eye imaging technique , anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( AS-OCT ) , image lens ( curve , transparent part eye help see clearly direct image light onto back eye ) note change exfoliation syndrome . Exfoliation syndrome common condition many way show eye , include formation deposit eye , shakiness lens complicate cataract surgery , high chance develop type glaucoma call exfoliation glaucoma . In study plan collect image measure exfoliation deposit lens AS-OCT , take high resolution picture eye without require contact eye . We compare lens image subject exfoliation syndrome subject primary open angle glaucoma cataract . This type imaging could use patient know diagnosis exfoliation syndrome track disease progression see respond possible treatment . We also hope image technology detect early change currently unaffected eye , could useful predict patient may develop disease .</brief_summary>
