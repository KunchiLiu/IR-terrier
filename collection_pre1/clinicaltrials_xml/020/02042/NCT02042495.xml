	<detailed_description>Aim 1 To determine whether , among patient endometrial cancer , treatment currently approve insulin sensitize drug metformin increase decrease pathway activation distal insulin receptor endometrial cancer tissue . Aim II To compare specified biomarkers endometrial cancer patient receive metformin . Our goal compare follow biomarkers patient metformin administration : Ki-67 , TUNEL assay apoptosis level , phosphor-AMPK , phosphor-IGF-1R , phosphor-IRS1 , phospho-Akt , phospho-S6 , phosphor-mTOR , pACC . All patient diagnose endometrial cancer present Jewish General Hospital surgical treatment invited participate .</detailed_description>
