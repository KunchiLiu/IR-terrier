	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Regarding Beneficial Effects Omega-3 Fatty Acids Cardiometabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The typical Western diet recognize insufficient amount omega-3 fatty acid ( particular EPA DHA ) . These fatty acid several know health benefit , include improvement heart health , metabolic syndrome , inflammation . These benefit occur omega-3 fatty acid regulate myriad cellular function . In order increase level omega-3 fatty acid body , individual must either consume marine product take omega-3 rich dietary supplement , fish oil . While fish oil supplement commonly consume people , recognize everyone respond supplement manner . Therefore study aim improve understand people respond differently dietary supplement . The goal research accomplish use number approach : 1 . The investigator examine fish oil supplementation lead enrichment EPA DHA various cell throughout body ( erythrocytes , adipose tissue , etc ) . 2 . The investigator determine dynamic change EPA DHA incorporation different cell-types distinct phase dietary intervention study ( e.g . supplementation subsequent wash period ) . 3 . The investigator study fish oil supplement influence various blood marker cardiometabolic health ( e.g . triglyceride , cholesterol , glucose , C-reactive protein , etc ) whether modulate individual 's genotype .</detailed_description>
