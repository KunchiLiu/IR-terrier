	<brief_title>Oligofructose-enriched Inulin Treatment Mild Moderate Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) colon manifest mucosal inflammation ulceration . The disease affect various length colon . It cycle period symptomatic relapse asymptomatic remission . During relapse , patient suffer frequent passage watery diarrhea may contain blood mucous . Currently pharmacological treatment mild moderate UC consist 5 amino salicylic acid ( 5 ASA ) , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent azathioprine ( Imuran ) , metabolite 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) cyclosporine . Although 5-ASA medication well-tolerated relatively safe , systematic review show successful induce remission 50 % patient . Systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive cyclosporine , azathioprine 6-MP considerable toxicity limit use patient . Therefore alternative current standard therapy search . The pathogenesis UC think due combination genetic , environmental immunological factor . Several study show among environmental factor , commensal intestinal bacteria play important role etiology UC . Patients UC demonstrate general increase bacterial mucosal adherence inter-epithelial cell penetration . Mucosal biopsies UC show increased concentration potentially pathogenic strain enterobacteria ( Escherichia coli group ) , Bacteroides Clostridium specie , relative decrease protective organism Faecalibacterium Bifidobacteria , compare healthy individual . In search treatment UC direct influence bacterial factor , effort direct alter composition intestinal microflora favour protective organism Lactobacilli Bifidobacteria , also call probiotic bacteria . Several probiotic formula ( VSL # 3 Mutaflor - E. coli Nissle 1917 ) show efficacy induction maintenance therapy UC pouchitis . As alternative oral supplementation probiotic bacteria , prebiotics easily produce cost-effective substitute . Prebiotics oligosaccharide enzymatically hydrolyze small intestine , however serve substrate fermentation probiotic bacteria colon . Prebiotics occur nature ; inulin derive chicory oligosaccharide present edible plant . Human study healthy volunteer consume diet supplement oligofructose inulin demonstrate significant increase luminal bifidobacteria strict anaerobe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii . These colonic bacterial group show alter cytokine production toward anti-inflammatory profile stimulate dendritic cell IL-10 production . In addition fructo-oligosaccharides fermentation colon result improve short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production , particular butyrate , important energy metabolism , cell differentiation regulation immune response colon . Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , subset Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) characterize disturbed microbial community ( dysbiosis ) mark decrease strict anaerobe , particular Faecalibacterium spp . Roseburia ssp . addition low production SCFA . Based finding oligofructose-enriched inulin ( Beneo™ Synergy1 ) chosen use trial . Primary Hypothesis : Synergy-1 prebiotic food ingredient use safely treatment mild moderate UC , daily oral administration Synergy-1 result clinical improvement and/ remission disease . Secondary Hypothesis : The improvement clinical disease daily oral administration Synergy-1 correlate : - decrease inflammatory marker biopsy ( IL-1β , TNF-α ) feces ( calprotectin ) , - modulation mucosal luminal intestinal microbiota towards protective bacteria decrease potential pathogenic bacteria . Objectives : This pilot study evaluate use Synergy-1 safe , efficacious tolerable treatment active mild moderate left-sided UC . Treatment Endpoints : 1 . Primary Endpoint : Clinical improvement define decrease Mayo score ≥ 3 total Mayo score remain ≥ 3 . 2 . Secondary Endpoint : Remission 9 week treatment ( clinical endoscopic remission define score 0 rectal bleed stool frequency part Mayo together score 0 1 sigmoidoscopic portion Mayo . The total Mayo score must great 2 . 3 . Safety Tolerability Endpoints : 1 . Tolerability : Withdrawal rate due intolerable drug side effect include , limited : unacceptable flatulence , abdominal rumbling , bloating , abdominal pain diarrhea . 2 . Safety : Number patient experience toxic severe adverse event ( AE ) treatment period well stool culture test positive intestinal pathogen . Studies Evaluate Mechanisms Action Synergy-1 : - Intestinal microflora change mucosal biopsy fecal sample , use DGGE 16S rDNA-tags pyrosequencing . - Decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β TNF- α mRNA , RT PCR assay colonic biopsy . Decrease amount calprotectin feces . - Short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production metabolism use gas chromatography ( GC ) qRT-PCR measurement SCFA stool , bacterial butyryl-CoA-transferase monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) mucosal sample . Study Population : 25 individual enrol study . Subjects select base Inclusion Exclusion criterion ( see Eligible Criteria Session ) .
