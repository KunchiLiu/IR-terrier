The Cognitive Aids Roles Defined ( CARD ) new concept cognitive aid address well-documented issue teamwork crisis management . It rely large identification card specially design team member profession role . During life threaten clinical situation , CARD protocol focus clarification individual role distribution task crisis management rather create additional algorithm identify either list action take dose medication . This study aim evaluate clinical impact introduce CARD protocol obstetrical emergency situation ( `` code 333 '' ) clinical practice The Ottawa Hospital .

	<detailed_description>The CARD protocol offer innovative yet simple solution barrier crisis management literature already identify . The study part research program investigating strategy improve crisis management . After complete several simulation study cognitive aid , crisis management debriefing , pilot CARD study , investigator aim explore investigate impact intervention patient care . The concept self-organizing team explicitly define role may enhance patient safety . The CARD approach crisis management relevant broad number situation , discipline , profession . The CARD protocol easily exportable critical situation include intra-hospital arrest , trauma , critical care patient . The concept self-organizing team define role may ultimately enhance patient safety . The investigator anticipate proposal challenge traditional way think cognitive aid , may advance theory two field cognitive aid team work crisis management . The CARD card associate role list task specifically design code 333 . In 'baseline ' phase , research assistant review Birthing Unit record daily determine code 333 call precede 24 hour . Outcome measure collect establish baseline team performance . In order account 'team training effect ' identify 'CARD effect ' , group receive didactic simulation crisis management teaching , train `` case site '' include CARD teach contemporaneous `` control site '' receive team training without CARD . After train period site , CARD implement `` case sight '' code 333s `` control site '' continue without CARD . Maternal neonatal outcomes well team performance ( time delivery ) continue prospectively collect throughout .</detailed_description>
