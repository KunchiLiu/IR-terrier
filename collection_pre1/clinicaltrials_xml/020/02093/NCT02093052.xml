	<detailed_description>Children randomly assign receive ABC intervention control intervention ( DEF ) infancy . These two group , plus group low-risk child , study early middle childhood . Of interest difference parent child outcome result intervention . Hypothesis 1 : Neglected child whose parent receive ABC intervention low-risk comparison child show good inhibitory control neglected child whose parent receive DEF intervention . Hypothesis 2 : Children ABC intervention condition low-risk comparison child show good emotion regulation child DEF condition . Hypothesis 3 : Children ABC intervention condition comparison child show less reactive aggression less hostile attributional bias child DEF condition . Hypothesis 4 : Children ABC condition comparison child show normative cortisol production child DEF condition . Although expect sustain change parent critical sustain change child behavior , several alternative model test . First , possible parent change result intervention child 's infancy , positive outcome child regardless whether change parent sustain . If case , early parenting mediate effect intervention control later parent . Second , concurrent parent critical child functioning , current parent mediate intervention effect child outcome control early parenting . Third , longitudinal modeling parent child behavior allow analysis cross-lagged association use structural equation model . Such modeling examine concurrent transactional association parent child . We also examine association change behavioral biological level . Longitudinal modeling use examine model change parent behavior influence child outcome .</detailed_description>
