	<brief_summary>Background : Induced sputum ( IS ) noninvasive methodology evaluate airway inflammation large number pulmonary disease , i.e , Asthma , Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Interstitial Lung Diseases . Several study define normal value cut-off point technique base cellular component IS , percentages eosinophil , neutrophil , macrophage CD4/CD8 ratio T cell lymphocyte . However , normal value cut-off point lymphocyte percentage indicative pathology yet establish validate . This component IS considerable clinical value . Similar constituent IS , provide biological insight pathogenesis respiratory disorder contribute establish diagnosis guide treatment management variety airway disease . The purpose study define normal value cut-off point lymphocytes IS among individual respiratory disorder healthy volunteer , verify current reference value percentage eosinophil , neutrophil CD4/CD8 ratio IS . Methods : A Cross Sectional study include database 900 patient participate various study conduct Pulmonary Laboratory Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center 2005 2012 establish . The study population include patient diagnose various pulmonary disease group healthy volunteer serve control . The cut-off normal value lymphocyte , eosinophil neutrophil percentage CD4/CD8 ratio IS define use ROC curve evaluate sensitivity specificity . The comparison different value literature do use Spearman rank correlation . The result study provide supplementary information lymphocyte count IS identify treat various respiratory disease .</brief_summary>
