	<brief_summary>Our study evaluate use topical intravenous ( IV ) Tranexamic Acid ( TXA ) spine surgery . The purpose TXA prevent clot surgery reduce blood loss . When use intravenously , show safe , efficacious , effective reduce transfusion requirement blood loss spine surgery . We want evaluate effect use TXA topically intravenously see reduces blood loss child undergo major surgery compare IV TXA</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Tranexamic Acid Major Paediatric Spine Deformity Surgery : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood loss major paediatric spine surgery significant , well establish patient undergo surgery substantial risk require blood transfusion perioperative period ( 1-4 ) . Given cost associate risk allogeneic blood product transfusion ( 5-7 ) , significant effort direct towards reduce transfusion requirement various method blood conservation ( 8-12 ) . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) synthetic antifibrinolytic function competitive blockade lysine-binding site plasminogen , plasmin , tissue plasminogen activator result inhibition fibrinolysis clot degradation ( 13 ) . When use parentally , show safe , efficacious , effective reduce transfusion requirement blood loss perioperative period various orthopaedic procedure , include major surgery spine ( 14-23 ) . A grow body literature support topical application TXA low extremity joint reconstruction , among procedure ( 24-29 ) , saline solution contain TXA place directly surgical incision prior closure . Two randomize control trial compare topical TXA placebo use lumbar fusion laminectomy case . Both trial demonstrate significant reduction perioperative blood loss use topical TXA compare placebo , report adverse event ( 36 , 37 ) . While intravenous TXA proven efficacy reduce perioperative blood loss , despite routine use major paediatric spine surgery , blood loss transfusion requirement remain significant ( 14-23 ) . Thus , method reduce perioperative blood loss child clinical significance . As highlight , topical TXA clearly demonstrate excellent local anti-fibrinolytic action . Furthermore , apply within surgical incision , negligible increase serum TXA concentration ( 33-35 ) . We therefore propose randomize trial evaluate effect topical TXA perioperative blood loss use addition intravenous TXA major paediatric spine surgery . In , seek evaluate whether additional benefit may confer direct application TXA within incision intravenous already provide IV TXA . To date , question evaluate surgical literature .</detailed_description>
