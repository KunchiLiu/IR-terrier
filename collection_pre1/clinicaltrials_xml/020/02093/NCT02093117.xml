	<brief_summary>Background . Patients undergo neurosurgical procedure experience high rate postoperative respiratory failure compare broad surgical population . Lung-protective ventilation strategy , include alveolar recruitment maneuver may beneficial . Despite potential benefit , effect high level continuous airway pressure intracranial pressure , brain swell cerebral perfusion must define prior apply intervention neurosurgical population . Objectives . The primary objective determine effect alveolar recruitment maneuver subdural pressure patient undergo supratentorial tumour resection . The secondary objective determine effect alveolar recruitment maneuver 1 ) brain bulk score 2 ) cerebral perfusion pressure patient undergo supratentorial tumour resection . Hypothesis . The investigator hypothesize alveolar recruitment maneuver 30 cm water 30 second result clinically-important ( &gt; 3 mmHg ) increase subdural pressure . Methods . This single center , randomize , cross-over study enroll 30 American Society Anesthesiogists Classification I-III patient schedule undergo supratentorial brain tumour resection Vancouver General Hospital . All patient receive standardize general anesthetic include invasive blood pressure monitoring . After removal bone flap , subdural pressure measure use sterile 22-gauge plastic cannula . Brain bulk assess use validate 4-point scale . After baseline arterial subdural pressure determination brain swell assessment , patient randomize receive either recruitment maneuver 30 cm water 30 second sham recruitment maneuver 5 cm water 30 second . Maximal subdural pressure minimum MAP maneuver note , neurosurgeon ask score brain bulk . After 2-minute equilibration period , protocol repeat alternate group allocation . Statistical Analysis . Our sample size calculation , base primary outcome ( subdural pressure ) , determine sample size 22 patient would allow u detect difference 3.5 mmHg subdural pressure assume type I error 0.05 , type II error 0.2 two-sided significance testing . The subdural pressure recruitment maneuver compare sham maneuver analyze use pair t-test . The brain bulk score compare use Wilcoxon sign rank test . All data analysis perform STATA 12.1 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patient ( great 18 year age ) schedule craniotomy resection supratentorial brain tumour American Society Anesthesiologist 's class I III eligible participate . Patient alter level consciousness unstable/deteriorating neurologic status preoperatively exclude . In addition , neurosurgeon considers mass effect great safely participate patient exclude . Baseline subdural pressure measure prior randomization Patients subdural pressure great 20 mmHg exclude . Other exclusion criterion include significant cardiac disease ( e.g . ejection fraction &lt; 40 percent , significant valvular disease , pulmonary hypertension ) , sepsis , hypovolemia prior lung resection history pneumothorax .</criteria>
