	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo-controlled Study Assess Efficacy Safety Eltrombopag Rescue Isolated Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia Patients With Gynecologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For phase III study , double-blind randomize , placebo control , parallel-group design conduct evaluate efficacy eltombopag . Each subject randomly assign either Arm A ( eltombopag ) Arm B ( placebo ) 2:1 ratio . The primary objective compare response rate two treatment arm , Therefore , two-proportion z test consider sample size chosen achieve 95 % power detect clinically meaningful difference level significance=0.05 . A difference 40 % clinical response consider clinically meaningful difference two treatment arm ( 75 % eltombopag vs. 35 % placebo ) . It require total sample 83 subject ( 55 eltombopag 28 placebo ) . According 10 % loss screening failure , 90-100 subject ( 60-67 eltombopag 30-33 placebo ) recruit .</detailed_description>
