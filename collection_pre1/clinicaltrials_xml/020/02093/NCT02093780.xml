	<brief_summary>In present study , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) patient remission stage disease randomize two group : Alberta anti-inflammatory diet Canada 's Food Guide diet . The element Alberta anti-inflammatory diet previously show role decrease risk UC development management UC-related symptom relapse . Since primary outcome interest relapse rate two group , disease status assess monthly use appropriate tool . In order find underlying mechanism relate propose diet decrease flare rate , laboratory evaluation , mainly marker inflammation relate gut microbiome conduct . In present study , investigator also perform state-of-the art metabolomics test , order study dietary change change end metabolite . In addition , investigator able explore metabolomic profile participant predict future UC relapse . This study last 6 month baseline wherein study subject receive appropriate dietary instruction addition stable dos maintenance drug therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized `` Alberta '' Diet Prevention Relapse Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent research suggest habitual dietary may play important part treatment inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , systematically explore . Habitual intake diet rich `` anti-inflammatory '' nutrient ( e.g . n-3 fatty acid , polyphenols ) , soluble fiber prebiotics ( e.g . inulin ) , probiotic ( improve gut microbiota ) may lead major improvement IBD disease . Ultimately , investigator interest study extent habitually eat food , source important nutrient dietary component , might help people IBD live Alberta . Thus , information nutrient dietary component must translate food dietary pattern acceptable accessible people Alberta . This study compare effectiveness 2 different approach , either structure , personalize menu plan construct dietitian ( intervention group ) vs. general advice follow Canada 's Food Guide dietitian ( control group ) , promote uptake adherence appropriate diet . The control group receive care intervention group far access register dietitian . In intervention group , nutritional advice offer follow structure four-week menu plan include recipe nutrition tip . The menu plan emphasize specific food show literature improve IBD symptom . In control group , nutritional advice general emphasize principle outline Canada 's Food Guide . Each control participant provide daily serve size allowance four food group . Each participant sole responsibility decide food select food group ; specific food highlight . Objectives : To evaluate propose Alberta anti-inflammatory diet effective prevention relapse ulcerative colitis well determine protective mechanism Study Design : Randomized control clinical trial Study Population Number Subjects : 70 patient ulcerative colitis clinical remission Duration Treatment : 6 month Primary Endpoint : Patient relapse rate 6 month Secondary Endpoints : Changes : 1 ) Time relapse ; 2 ) Patients ' quality life study period ; 3 ) Mucosal inflammation , measure fecal calprotectin baseline , month 1 , 3 , 6 relapse ; 4 ) Partial Mayo score baseline monthly , relapse ; 5 ) Laboratory marker inflammation Subject visit : 1 . Screening Visit - Assessment inclusion exclusion criterion - Obtainment Informed Consent - Medical History - Pregnancy Test - Partial Mayo score 2 . Visit Month 0 ( baseline ) , 1 , 3 , 6 ( relapse ) - Focused Physical Exam Medical History - Partial Mayo score - Fecal sample Calprotectin luminal microflora analysis - Blood urine sample metabolomic analysis , inflammatory marker test specify appendix 2 . - Dietary counseling - Questionnaires specify appendix 2 . - Sigmoidoscopy ( relapse ) 3 . Visit Month 2 , 4 , 5 - Telephone interview dietician - Partial mayo score - Questionnaires specify appendix 2 Studies Evaluate Mechanisms Action Alberta anti-inflammatory diet : - Compositional change intestinal microbiota fecal sample , use pyrosequencing - Host microbial metabolomics serum urine sample use gas chromatography nuclear magnetic resonance - Evaluations inflammatory marker ( fecal calprotectin , serum interleukin ( IL ) -6 , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</detailed_description>
