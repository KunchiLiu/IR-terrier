	<brief_title>Translational Companion Protocol GOG229O</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Visits : The following test procedure perform regular study visit GOG02290 : During screen Day 28 ( +/- 3 day ) : - You tumor biopsy check biomarkers . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw test biomarkers circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . CTC test check many tumor cell blood . Between Day 3 Day 5 Day 56 ( +/-3 day ) : -Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw test biomarkers CTCs . Length Study : After blood biopsy sample collect , participation study . This investigational study . Up 40 participant enrol multicenter study . Up 25 take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Histologic confirmation original primary tumor require . Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : Endometrioid adenocarcinoma , serous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify ( N.O.S. ) . 3 . Patients must tissue available molecular analysis . This tissue obtain time current recurrence archival tissue primary diagnosis recurrence . 4 . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must &gt; /=10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; /=20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . Measurable disease lesion must amenable pre post treatment biopsy . 5 . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . 6 . Patients must eligible high priority Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) protocol , one exist . In general , would refer active GOG Phase III protocol Rare Tumor protocol patient population . 7 . Patients must GOG Performance Status 0 1 . 8 . Recovery effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ) Patients free active infection require antibiotic ( exception uncomplicated UTI ) b ) Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior registration c ) Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include chemotherapy immunotherapy , must discontinue least three week prior registration . Any investigational agent must discontinue least 30 day prior registration ) Any prior radiation therapy must discontinue least four week prior registration e ) At least 4 week must elapse since patient underwent major surgery ( e.g. , major : laparotomy , laparoscopy ) There delay treatment minor procedure ( e.g. , tumor core biopsy ) . 9 . Patients must one prior chemotherapeutic regimen management endometrial carcinoma . Initial treatment may include chemotherapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy , consolidation/maintenance therapy .

Patients MAY HAVE receive noncytotoxic ( biologic target ) agent ( ) part initial treatment and/or management recurrent persistent disease , state exception ( see NOTE ) . Prior hormonal therapy allow , must discontinue least one week prior registration . NOTE : Prior therapy PI3K inhibitor , AKT inhibitor and/or mTor inhibitor ( e.g. , everolimus , temsirolimus ) NOT allow . Prior therapy MEK inhibitor ( e.g. , AZD6244 selumetinib ) NOT allow . 11 .

All prior treatmentrelated toxicity must CTCAE v4 grade &lt; /=1 ( except alopecia ) time randomization . 13 . Patients abnormal fast glucose value &gt; 160mg/dL screening exclude . In addition , patient Type 1 diabetes also exclude ; however , patient Type 2 diabetes allow diagnosed &gt; /=6 month prior enrollment , present regular hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) &lt; /=8 % screening . 14 . Patients must able swallow retain orallyadministered medication must clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . 15 . The effect trametinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason MEK inhibitor well GSK2141795 know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior randomization . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 16 . Patients must 18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available use trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . 17 .

Capsules must crush chewed ; nasogastric Gtube administration allow . 10 . Known Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection ( unless clear ) exclude . 11 . Current use prohibit medication . The following medication nondrug therapy prohibit : ) Other anticancer therapy study treatment . ( Note : megestrol [ Megace ] use appetite stimulant allow ) . b ) Concurrent treatment bisphosphonates permit ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose study therapy . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates patient without bone disease permit , except treatment osteoporosis . c ) Because composition , PK , metabolism many herbal supplement unknown , concurrent use herbal supplement prohibit study ( include , limited , St. John 's Wort , kava , ephedra [ huang ] , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone [ DHEA ] , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng ) . 12 . History current evidence/risk Retinal Vein Occlusion ( RVO ) Central Serous Retinopathy ( CSR ) : History RVO CSR , predispose factor RVO CSR ( e.g . uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , uncontrolled systemic disease hypertension , diabetes mellitus , history hyper viscosity hyper coagulability syndrome ) ; Visible retinal pathology assess ophthalmic exam consider risk factor RVO CSR : Evidence new optic disc cupping ; Evidence new visual field defect automate perimetry ; Intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm Hg measure tonography 13 . History evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : LVEF &lt; LLN ; A QT interval correct heart rate use Bazett 's formula QTcB &gt; /= 480 msec ; History evidence current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia ( exception : patient control atrial fibrillation &gt; 30 day prior randomization eligible ) ; History acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial Infarction unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting within 6 month prior randomization ; History evidence current &gt; /= Class II congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system ; Treatmentrefractory hypertension define blood pressure systolic &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg control antihypertensive therapy ; Known cardiac metastasis ; Subject intracardiac defibrillator pacemaker 14 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 15 .
