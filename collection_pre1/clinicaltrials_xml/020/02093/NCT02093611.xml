	<brief_summary>We hypothesize adenosine-5'-triphosphate ( ATP ) supplementation able enhance motor unit recruitment simultaneously blunt decline power reaction time typically see repetitive sprint . This give researcher well understand mechanism ATP supplementation augment power , especially high fatiguing condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Examine Effects ATP Supplementation Muscle Excitability Reaction Time During Following Repeated Sprint Bout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy participant similar training status previously test enrolled study . The participant randomly assign either placebo supplementation 400 mg ATP per day 14 day . The supplement take morning last dose take 30 min prior test last day . Testing perform baseline 14 day supplementation . Ten successive sprint conduct Wingate apparatus previously demonstrate decrease muscle excitability . After sprint , muscle excitability , reaction time , vertical jump power measure . In addition blood sample obtain supplementation complete blood hematology chemistry analyse perform . It expect ATP supplementation may help maintain muscle excitability power successive sprint session .</detailed_description>
