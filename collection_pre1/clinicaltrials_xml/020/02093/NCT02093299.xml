	<brief_summary>Stroke patient give prophylactic treatment clopidogrel prevent new stroke . Some patient ( investigator n't know precisely many , previous study indicate 4-34 % ) call non-responders , measure blood sample patient . These patient may increase risk less effect treatment therefore high risk new stroke . The investigator want investigate clopidogrel non-responders clinically increase risk new stroke follow patient two year . With study investigator aim ensure patient get best prophylactic treatment reduce risk early death dependency others .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background purpose Patients , stroke , increase risk new stroke . Clinical trial prove inhibition blood platelet reduce risk new stroke . Unfortunately patient respond ( non-responders ) anti-platelet treatment . Patients respond might great risk new stroke compare patient respond ( responder ) anti-platelet treatment . These clinical trial take account unknown number patient unresponsive ( non-responders ) inhibition blood platelet treatment thereby poorer prophylactic treatment necessary high risk early death , disability depend upon others . Trials anti-platelet regime ( acetylsalicylic acid ) show 33 % stroke patient non-responders 10 time increase risk vascular death , myocardial infarction stroke first two year stroke start treatment . Therefore likely great clinical importance identify non-responders optimize therapy . Today Clopidogrel drug-of-choice prophylactic stroke treatment . To knowledge one study non-responder problem Clopidogrel prophylactic treatment stroke patient . Due genetic difference , data study ca n't transfer Danish patient . The Clopidogrel non-responder problem study group patient show 34 % patient Clopidogrel non-responders . This project great significance patient , relatives socioeconomic . The non-responder problem study Danish population patient respond drug-of-choice receive another treatment . By good prevent patient another stroke thereby minimize risk previous death , loss function depend upon others . The study knowledge first systematically study risk stroke patient prophylactic Clopidogrel treatment non-responders . The study one several study research-fellowship Department og Neurology , Roskilde University Hospital . Project summary Stroke patient admit Stroke Unit include project . Patients receive Clopidogrel 2 week discharge call outpatient clinic undertake blood sample determine whether Clopidogrel responder non-responders . The patient follow outpatient clinic every 3 month two year doctor project nurse outpatient visit alternate phone call ensure patient follow prescribe treatment determine patient new stroke . We estimate 200 patient include study . Design , recruitment , method . The study double blind follow-up study non-responders Clopidogrel systematic statement healthcare data suspect influence result study . Patient admit stroke receive prophylactic treatment Clopidogrel day discharge include study orally write informed consent . Ethics The study follow Helsinki Declaration 1984 , modify 41 . World Congress Hong Kong 1989 . The study already report local Datatilsynet approve local ethic committee ( Region Sjællands Videnskabsetiske Komite ) . The study pending approval Danish Medical Agency ( Sundhedsstyrelsen ) . Blood sample take study delay time start prophylactic treatment . Patients study treated patient include study . Project benefit In Denmark 10 000 people suffer stroke every year . Some dy almost instantly others disable life recover fully . These patient increase risk new stroke . Today treatment stroke limit small percentage patient know prophylactic treatment important . Reducing risk stroke reduces risk early death , disability depend upon others . The project thereby benefit patient study , future stroke patient relatives socio economics . The project externally monitor Good Clinical Practice unit Denmark change project protocol report local ethic committee ( Region Sjællands Videnskabsetiske Komite ) Danish Medical Agency ( Sundhedsstyrelsen ) .</detailed_description>
