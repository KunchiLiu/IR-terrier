	<brief_summary>The lack precise diagnostic technique cerebral vasospasm associate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) limit ability detect treat phenomenon . Surveillance Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography ( TCD ) main medical instrument utilized monitor radiographic vasospasm follow TBI , yet drawbacks inaccuracy , highly operator dependent . HS-1000 device , investigational vasospasm detection device , potential safely diagnose ass vasospasm minimal discomfort patient , allow new modality vasospasm measurement tool . We aim evaluate correlation collect analyzed data HS-1000 device clinical finding TCD test post-subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) patient .</brief_summary>
