	<brief_summary>The goal project collect information support later clinical trial effectiveness specially adapt dental environment child difficulty tolerate oral care dental clinic . We hypothesize adapt sensory environment dental office modify sound , sight , smell tactile experience result decrease anxiety , increased cooperation , few behavior problem child Autism Spectrum Disorders , less extent typically develop child especially dental anxiety . This potential contribute increase child comfort well safer , efficient , less costly treatment large population , potentially one-fourth child may benefit sensory adapt dental environment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensory Adapted Dental Environment Enhance Oral Care Children With ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal R34 NIDCR Planning Pilot Data Grant collect information support later clinical trial effectiveness specially adapt dental environment child difficulty tolerate oral care dental clinic . Within project , two group child study : child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) typically develop child , include over-reactive sensory stimulation . Commonly , child exhibit anxiety negative behavioral reaction confront experiential aspect dental visit exposure bright fluorescent lighting , touch around mouth , texture smell various oral care product . We pilot tested sensory adapt dental environment ( SADE ) examine effect reduce anxiety behavioral problem among targeted group child . The SADE intervention include adaptation dim light , exposure soothe music , application special vest provide deep pressure sensation calm . If preliminary assessment produce promising result , later comprehensively test intervention full-scale randomized clinical trial , support U01 award . The specific aim R34 grant promote ability conduct future trial : 1 . Developing manual SADE intervention assess intervention 's feasibility . 2 . Collecting preliminary data intervention 's effectiveness potential cost-savings . 3 . Pilot test recruitment strategy assessment battery use anticipated trial . 4 . Developing system document data management future trial . 5 . Generating proposal U01 award conduct plan trial . Research participants 45 ethnically diverse child age 6-12 year , 22 ASD 23 typically develop . Each child underwent two dental cleaning four month apart : dental clean standard dental environment dental clean sensory adapt environment . For group child ( i.e. , ASD typically develop ) , two condition compare effect anxiety negative behavioral reaction , measure videotape coding , psychophysiological index , various rating scale .</detailed_description>
