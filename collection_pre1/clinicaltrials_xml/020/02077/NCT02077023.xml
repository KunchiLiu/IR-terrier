	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) affect lives million people one large cause death disability country . Huge improvement make prevention treatment CVD last decade . However , comparison country show England could still better improve CVD mortality rate - demonstrate recent Lancet article Global Burden Disease Study . Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy publish Department Health call improve outcome people risk cardiovascular disease reduce premature mortality rate CVD improve prevention , diagnosis treatment , bring service standard best . To prevent disease improve health , essential understand disease arise , conversely , many case , . To , necessary study distribution natural history disease population identify agent responsible ; effective strategy plan . Epidemiology involve study population rather direct study individual enhance practice medicine increase understanding disease arise might manage individual society whole . Stroke one top three cause death England lead cause adult disability . Approximately 110,000 stroke 20,000 Transient Ischaemic Attacks ( 'mini stroke ' ) occur England every year . There least 300,000 people England live moderate severe disability result stroke . Stroke cost Â£7 billion year . Most stroke cause occlusive arterial disease ( obstruction vessel provide oxygen rich blood ) , around 15 % due atrial fibrillation ( AF ) irregular heart rhythm , 15 % associate carotid stenosis . Many could avoid people AF Carotid artery stenosis identify treat appropriately antithrombotic , anti-hypertensive lipid-lowering drug well encourage stop smoking . Some young patient tight carotid stenosis , well treat medically , avoid future stroke appropriate carotid intervention . The effect know risk factor vary enormously one population another , still substantial uncertainty important different setting importance change time . By understand medical , social ethical factor affect community health , solution public health problem could develop . Having access large dataset range cardiovascular screening test provide Life Line Screening , enable u reliably study distribution natural history stroke asymptomatic British Irish population ass risk factor responsible . We identify large cohort people asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis ( CAS ) AF , drawn attend Life Line Screening appointment UK conduct prospective study ass number cardiovascular event cohort compare group participant without CAS AF . The study consist observational , prospective study prevalence risk factor AF , CAS stroke amongst 5,200 people voluntarily attend cardiovascular screening appointment provide Life Line Screening . Participants complete detailed questionnaire provide information : prior disease ; current medication ( i.e . anti-hypertensive , lipid-lowering anti-platelet therapy ) ; exercise ; alcohol intake ; smoke history ; relevant family medical history ; physical measurement ( include height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure ) . They test follow condition : AF ; CAS ( Duplex scan ) ; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( aortic ultrasound ) ; Peripheral Vascular Disease ( ankle-brachial pressure index ) . They provide write report advise consult GP discuss abnormal result . The company record anonymised data research database . This cohort long-term ( 5 year ) follow via annual interview and/or health questionnaire determine contemporary risk stroke group ( asymptomatic CAS and/or AF versus CAS and/or AF ) . As study quantitative clear numerical interpretation , Mann-Whitney test t-test use statistical analysis . The median interquartile range use summarise continuous variable age . Data appropriate documentation store minimum 10 year completion study .</detailed_description>
