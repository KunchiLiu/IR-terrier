	<brief_summary>Rationale background : Predictive factor need discriminate chemoradiotherapy responder non-responders individualize treatment regime . Various cytokine play role process affect tumour growth metastasis . Furthermore , cytokine might influence treatment response . Various cytokine abnormally express colorectal cancer patient , associate colorectal cancer determine response chemoradiotherapy . Therefore investigator want investigate whether level circulate cytokine could predict response preoperative chemoradiotherapy patient rectal cancer . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesis vary level circulate cytokine blood rectal cancer patient may predict response preoperative chemoradiotherapy . Study design : This study explorative clinical pilot study investigator collect 4 ml blood selection rectal cancer patient regular venipuncture , preoperative chemoradiotherapy surgery . Cytokines measure blood plasma tumour healthy tissue resection specimen use multiplex immunoassay . Plasma cytokine measurement link pathological response identify cytokine correspond level predict response preoperative chemoradiotherapy patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Furthermore , blood plasma cytokine measurement surgery compare evaluate effect tumour resection immune response . In addition , preoperative blood plasma cytokine level compare cytokine level normal tumour tissue test whether circulate cytokine level representative tissue cytokine level . Study population : Thirty patient ( ≥18 year ) locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma eligible preoperative chemoradiotherapy ( oral capecitabine 45-50 gray ( Gy ) total ; fraction 1.8-2 Gy ) surgery . Country recruitment : The Netherlands</brief_summary>
