	<brief_summary>The objective study test compare effectiveness cost-effectiveness four supplementary food treatment moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM ) normal programmatic setting Sierra Leone . Study participant receive one four test food vary energy nutrient density well amount provide . 1 . Super Cereal Plus ( SC+ ) 800 kcal/d , 215 g/d ( Control group ) 2 . Super Cereal ( SC ) oil sugar 998 kcal/d - 200 g SC 20 g oil 20 g sugar , per day 3 . Corn-soy Blend 14 ( CSB14 ) oil 978 kcal/day - 150 g CSB14 45 g oil , per day 4 . Plumpy'Sup - 500 kcal/d , 92 g/d This prospective , randomise , control effectiveness trial . Aims 1 . ( Impact ) To compare effectiveness four supplementary food treatment moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM ) normal programmatic setting Sierra Leone . 2 . ( Cost ) To estimate relative cost-effectiveness ( marginal cost per child recover MAM , relative comparison group , SC+ ) implement feed program use commodity , take consideration cost procurement/production distribution 3 . ( Process ) To evaluate determinant effectiveness include : consumption adherence , preparation compliance , targeting/sharing supplement , food component preparation , adverse effect food , water contamination , hygiene health behavior , SES , food security , perceive barrier Outcomes 1 . Recovery MAM 1 . Percent child recover MAM ( define achieve mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) ≥ 12.5 cm 12 week ) 2 . Percent default/non-response : child recover 12 week 3 . Percent relapse : child become MAM within 6 month recovery 2 . Mean number week recovery Hypothesis The child MAM feed Super Cereal oil sugar , CSB14 oil Plumpy'Sup similar recovery outcomes child feed Super Cereal Plus . Null : The child MAM feed Super Cereal oil sugar , CSB14 oil Plumpy'Sup different recovery outcomes child feed Super Cereal Plus .</brief_summary>
