	<detailed_description>Background : Gastroesophageal resection gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma massive surgical intervention . Nevertheless , surgery treatment significant long-term survival . Currently , gastroesophageal cancer surgery perform upper laparotomy follow thoracotomy Department Surgical Gastroenterology , Rigshospitalet , Denmark . However , minimal invasive technique ( MIT ) , e.g . robotic assist laparoscopy , progress implement field hypothesize beneficial patient , aspect well conventional laparoscopic surgery [ 1 ] . The benefit MIT believe due several factor , small surgical stress response [ 2 ] less pain [ 3 ] result early mobilization , mention . When reconstruct gastrointestinal continuity , gastric tube prepare upper part remain stomach . It challenge visualize , remain stomach adequate blood supply . Earlier study show 70 % reduction blood flow , upper part remnant stomach [ 4-6 ] , ischemia one significant cause anastomotic leakage [ 7 , 8 ] . Anastomotic leakage occur 10 % patient fatal 50 % . Furthermore , recent study originate investigator department demonstrate , patient experience anastomotic leakage gastroesophageal cancer resection , significantly reduce long-term survival , even early death postoperative complication account [ 9 ] . The overall 5-year survival rate patient without anastomotic leakage 20 35 % , respectively . Therefore , sufficient blood flow area anastomosis paramount concern . Different technique use attempt assess microcirculation gastroesophageal resection [ 5 , 10-13 ] . However , none technique proven practical , reliable , time-efficient , therefore routinely implemented clinical setting . During open gastroesophageal resection , hypotension common ( systolic blood pressure le 90 mm Hg experience 30 % patient ) probably accompany reduce gastric microcirculatory flow . The hypotension may due several factor ; - Sympathic nerve system blockage due thoracic epidural neuraxial anesthesia : Several study find reduce splanchnic flow epidural anesthesia , associate decrease systemic resistance mean arterial pressure [ 14 , 15 ] . The impact time-point activation epidural analgesia , complication postoperative period unknown . An unpublished study ( Nielsen T : `` Increased cardiac output Whipple 's procedure pancreatic cancer '' ) suggest early activation operation lead significantly longer stay recovery ward surgery . - The initial manipulation viscera , result mesenteric traction reflex ( also call eventration syndrome ) vasodilatation secondary hypotension [ 16 , 17 ] . The reason mesenteric traction reflex unknown , believe elicited traction mesenterial blood vessel , result local release prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) endothelium . This reflex mainly show occur pancreatic , gastric aortic surgery , manipulation mesenteric root inevitable [ 18-21 ] . PGI2 potent vasodilatator , inhibitory effect platelet aggression vascular smooth cell proliferation [ 22-24 ] . Microcirculatory measurement : Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging ( LSCI ) relatively new technique microcirculatory monitoring . When laser light encounter surface object , random interference effect generates , call laser speckle contrast . The speckle pattern change depend velocity object , possible get information regard object 's movement , fluctuation speckle pattern . By measure concentration velocity blood cell , tissue perfusion may assess LSCI technique . A real-time non-touch measurement make large field ( 0.5 cm x 0.7 cm 15 cm x 20 cm ) . The camera place distance 20-30 cm measure relative flow ( flux ) region interest . The measurement depth 1-2 mm infrared light reflect circulate erythrocyte micro-vessels . Hypothesis aim : Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery alters hemodynamics microcirculation splanchnic system reduce release vasoactive substance , PGI2 , compare open surgery . With study , investigator wish evaluate hemodynamic fluctuation gastric microcirculation , correlate serum level PGI2 different stage surgery robotic assist laparoscopic surgery open surgery , respectively . Methods : 2 × 25 consecutive patient select robotic assist laparoscopic open surgery . Hemodynamic assessment accord standardized method . Blood sample drawn : 1 ) induction anesthesia , 2 ) peritoneum first enter , 3 ) 15 min . surgery , 4 ) liberation stomach , 5 ) abdominal skin closure , 6 ) extraction gastric conduit thorax , 7 ) formation anastomosis , 8 ) thoracic skin closure , 9 ) 18 hour surgery . LSCI use measure microcirculation two location ( 3 cm pylorus site anastomosis ( body ) ) stomach five time open surgery , twice thoracic part robotic assist laparoscopic surgery . Statistics : Statistical power-calculation carry expected difference occurrence mesenteric traction reflex patient operate open vs. MIT . By use sample size 50 comparing percentage group one 55 % group two 12 % [ 17 ] , requirement 18 patient group calculate order obtain statistical power great 0.80 α-level &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
