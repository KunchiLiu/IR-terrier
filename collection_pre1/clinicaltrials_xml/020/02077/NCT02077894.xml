	<brief_summary>Objective : The objective study identify genetic cause inherit eye condition whole exome whole genome sequencing . This include identifying mutation know gene novel gene recognize condition , well identify mutation novel gene previously uncharacterized genetic condition involve eye . Study Population : We plan recruit 310 participant , include probands eye condition study unaffected family member . Ideally unaffected family member parent proband . Design : Participants recruit pre-existing NIH protocol , NEI Evaluation Treatment protocol ( 08-EI-0169 ) , NEI Screening protocol ( 08-EI-0102 ) , Genetics Uveal Coloboma protocol ( 13-EI-0049 ) . Self-referred patient patient refer outside clinician screen eligibility pre-existing NIH protocol . Phenotyped patient eligible participation unaffected family member undergo genetic counseling provide blood sample exome genome sequencing . Biological relationship confirm prior exome genome sequencing . Sequence data analyze primary variant associate proband eye condition incidental finding , recommend American College Medical Genetics guideline . All sequence variant deem clinically relevant validate CLIA-certified laboratory result return participant in-person . Outcome Measures : This etiologic study generate molecular information previously-recognized condition participant molecular diagnosis , well molecular information previously uncharacterized condition involve eye .</brief_summary>
