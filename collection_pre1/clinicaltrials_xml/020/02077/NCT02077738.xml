	<brief_summary>The effectiveness , safety tolerance/comfort high-frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) prolong mechanical ventilation patient remain unknown . This study aim test hypothesis HFCWO could produce great clearance volume sputum , great improvement rate serial change chest X-ray ( CXR ) , great wean success rate extubation Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation ( PMV ) patient intra-tracheal intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HFCWO Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For 20 year , study attempt examine effectiveness , safety tolerance/comfort HFCWO management surgical non-surgical patient impaired bronchial secretion clearance , include neuromuscular disorder , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis , blunt thoracic trauma , hospitalize critical cardiac/abdominal/thoracic surgery . However , outcome HFCWO PMV patient remain unknown . This parallel-design , randomize controlled trial aim test hypothesis HFCWO could produce great clearance volume sputum , great improvement rate serial change chest X-ray ( CXR ) , great wean success rate extubation PMV patient intra-tracheal intubation . Moreover , safety tolerance/comfort HFCWO PMV patient removal endotracheal tube also evaluate .</detailed_description>
