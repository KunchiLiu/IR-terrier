	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II trial design evaluate combination immunotherapeutic agent indoximod standard care chemotherapy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel subject metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . The phase 1 portion design identify regimen-limiting toxicity ( RLT ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination . The phase 2 portion study evaluate potential efficacy combination . All subject receive standard 28-day gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen . Twice daily oral indoximod administer concurrently continuous 28 day cycle . In phase 1 portion , dose escalation indoximod begin 600mg/day potentially escalate 1200mg/day . There intra-subject dose escalation . Regimen-limiting toxicity consider toxicity relate indoximod significantly limit administration backbone chemotherapy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel . The period determination dose-limiting toxicity initial 28 day treatment . The recommended phase 2 dose include assessment toxicity occur later time point . Once RP2D determine , phase 2 portion study initiate . In phase 1 phase 2 , every 2 cycle subject repeat image ass response . Corollary biomarkers assess interval PET-CT 1st 8 week cycle . Up 18 patient enrol phase 1 portion study 80 patient enrol phase 2 portion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient definitive histologically cytologically confirm metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . The definitive diagnosis metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma make integrate histopathological data within context clinical radiographic data . Patients islet cell neuroendocrine neoplasms exclude . Initial diagnosis metastatic disease must occur ≤8 week prior entry study . Patient one metastatic tumor measurable per RECIST 1.1 CT scan ≤4 week prior entry study ( MRI , patient allergic CT contrast medium ) . Patients nodal metastases alone even nodal metastasis formally consider M1 disease Life expectancy great 3 month . Male nonpregnant nonlactating female , ≥18 year age . If female patient childbearing potential , evidence regular menstrual period , must negative serum pregnancy test ( βhCG ) document within 7 day prior first administration study drug . The effect indoximod develop human fetus unknown . For reason indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance fetus , sexually active woman childbearing potential must agree use two form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Use contraception abstinence continue minimum 1 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , discontinue study drug inform treat physician immediately . Also men discourage father child treatment . Patients must receive previous radiotherapy , surgery , chemotherapy investigational therapy treatment metastatic disease . Prior treatment gemcitabine and/or nabpaclitaxel adjuvant setting allow , provide least 6 month elapse since completion last dose linger toxicity present . Patients receive immunomodulatory therapy ( include vaccine ) treatment cancer . Patient adequate biological parameter demonstrate follow blood count Baseline ( obtain ≤14 day prior treatment initiation ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 ( 75 × 10^9/L ) Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥9 g/dL . Patient follow blood chemistry level Baseline ( obtain ≤14 day prior randomization ) : AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × upper limit normal range ( ULN ) , unless liver metastases clearly present , ≤5 × ULN allow Total bilirubin ≤ULN , patient know Gilbert 's syndrome allow 3x ULN . Serum creatinine within normal limit calculate clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient serum creatinine level institutional normal value Patient acceptable coagulation study ( obtain ≤14 day prior randomization ) demonstrate prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal limit ( ±15 % ) . If patient coumadin suggest switch patient low molecular weight heparin product include enoxaparin ( Lovenox ) fondiparinux ( Arixtra ) , feasible INR must ≤ 3 . Patient clinically significant abnormality urinalysis result ( obtained ≤14 day prior randomization ) . Patient Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 . Patients asymptomatic jaundice prior Day 1 . Significant symptomatic amount ascites drain prior enrollment . Pain symptom stable require modification analgesic management prior enrollment . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive ( receive prior enrollment ) investigational agent metastatic disease . Patient known brain metastasis , Patient locally advance disease . Lymph node metastasis even consider M1 disease official stag criterion . History malignancy last 3 year . Patients prior history situ cancer basal squamous cell skin cancer eligible . Patients malignancy eligible cured surgery alone surgery plus radiotherapy continuously diseasefree least 3 year . Patient active , uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection ( ) require systemic therapy . Patient known historical active infection HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. Patients active autoimmune disease ( i.e . psoriasis , extensive atopic dermatitis , asthma , IBD , M.S. , uveitis , vasculitis ) , chronic inflammatory condition , condition require concurrent use systemic immunosuppressant steroid reason would exclude study . Any patient allotransplant kind would exclude well . This would include xenograft heart valve avoid potential risk immune reaction cause valvular degeneration . Mildintermittent asthma require occasional betaagonist inhaler use mild localized eczema exclude . Patient undergone major surgery , diagnostic surgery ( ie , surgery do obtain biopsy diagnosis without removal organ ) , within 4 week prior Day 1 treatment study . Patient history allergy hypersensitivity study drug excipients . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study , breastfeed discontinue .</criteria>
