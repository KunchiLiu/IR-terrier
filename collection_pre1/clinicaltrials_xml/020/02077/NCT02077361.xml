	<brief_summary>A project develop Edmonton , Alberta , Canada enable male patient choroideremia access clinical trial replaces defective gene normal copy . This experiment design show transfer normal copy gene eye safe may improve sight patient . Only Canadian subject meet criterion recruit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Clinical Trial Retinal Gene Therapy Choroideremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study involve total 6 male patient . Screening patient medical record determine patient eligibility . Patients receive subretinal injection rAAV2.REP1 vector train vitreoretinal surgeon one eye . Each patient follow 24 month treatment assess primary secondary endpoint study use number outcome measure . However , follow-up continue study annual basis minimum ten year . Data continue analyzed member study group study complete .</detailed_description>
