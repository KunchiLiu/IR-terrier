	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine whether elderly people rehabilitation set show high adherence self-training use computer-based-learning game ( i.e . call serious game ) perform conventional exercise . Secondly study explores extend balance mobility performance vary accord mode self-training . The primary study hypothesis elderly people practice longer frequently serious game conventional exercise booklet . The secondary hypothesis patient experience significant high improvement balance capacity use serious game compare patient perform conventional exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Are Serious Games Promoting Mobility Attractive Alternative Conventional Self-training Elderly People ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The Swiss population , Europe general , get old . Due evolve demographic trend , need develop specific healthcare service age group become crucial . From international literature , evidence-based finding demonstrate physical ability elderly people increase , institutional placement mortality reduce specific inpatient rehabilitation program ( Bachmann , Finger et al . 2010 ) . Adults 65 year old carry aerobic physical activity least 150 minute moderate intensity 75 minute high intensity week . Besides strongly recommend senior adult perform strengthen exercise minimum twice week activity promote balance minimum thrice week ( WHO 2010 ; NIH 2013 ) . In order increase training intensity thus independence activity daily live , old patient admit Kliniken Valens instruct customized self-training program , addition usual rehabilitation service . As therapist-assisted session , self-training program lead significant improvement patient 's physical performance ( Olney , Nymark et al . 2006 ) represent therefore proven , efficient cost-effective intervention inpatient setting . However , compliance elderly people execute self-training exercise varies considerably . These program often consider tedious boring , prematurely stop ( Phillips , Schneider et al . 2004 ) . An alternative increase patient 's motivation could serious game practice . Kliniken Valens already experience promising result computer-based game Nintendo Wii® ( Schnurr Oesch 2012 ) . Methods : In study participant categorize 4 stratum accord Berg Balance Score ( BBS ) ( ≤ 44 ≥45 ) computer skill . Subsequently allocate randomly either intervention group control group . In addition usual rehabilitation service provide clinic , participant group entitle 2 additional time-slots ( 2 x 30 min/day ) devote self-training 10 day intervention period . This protocol ensure condition participant perform self-training exercise . For safety measure , participant low BBS ( &lt; 45 ) perform program siting , whereas high BBS ( ≥45 ) practice stand position ( front bench ) . The time frame intervention phase ( t1 t2 ) last 10 work day start self-training exercise instruct . In word , t1 equates approximately day 4 patient 's admission clinic t2 10 work day later , i.e . approximately day 16 admission . Intervention group : The participant instruct experienced physiotherapist serious game Kinect® . Additionally , participant wear Fit Bit® ( activity tracker device ) encourage walk climb stair instead use escalator . Finally participant ask write logbook , frequency duration self-training session . Control group : As usual rehabilitation service , experienced physiotherapist arrange customized self-training program , instruct exercise deliver hand-out . Additionally , patient encourage walk climb stair instead use escalator . Finally participant ask write logbook , frequency duration self-training session . Data collection : Data self-training 's intensity ( primary outcome ) extract logbook post-intervention ( t2 ) i.e . 10 work day intervention phase . The Berg Balance Scale Falls Efficacy Scale ( secondary outcome ) complete blinded researcher pre- post-intervention ( t1 t2 ) i.e . approximately day 1-2 admission day 16-17 admission . Data analysis : Data analyze use statistical software social science ( SPSS ) . The statistical analysis two group perform follow normal distribution data , unmatched t-test . For non-normal distribution , Mann-Whitney U test use .</detailed_description>
