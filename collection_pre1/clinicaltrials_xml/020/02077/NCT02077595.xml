	<brief_summary>Recently , non-invasive brain stimulation become powerful tool basic research clinical application . Among several non-invasive brain stimulation technique , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) receive attention . About DC stimulation , change polarity could modulate spontaneous neuronal activity make effect decision making , language , memory , sensory perception , pain . In spite concept transcranial alternate current stimulation ( tACS ) novel , AC relatively safe compare DC , research reveal AC might potentially effect cortical excitability . However , still many area AC stimulation remain unknown , mechanism , application , potential influence cortical excitability .</brief_summary>
