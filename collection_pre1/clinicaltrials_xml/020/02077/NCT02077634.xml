	<brief_summary>This exploratory Phase 2 multicenter , randomize , open-label study randomization allocation ratio 1:1 [ abiraterone acetate + prednisone + LHRH-therapy ( Arm A ) versus abiraterone acetate + prednisone ( Arm B ) ] . For group patient receive dose 1000 mg abiraterone acetate 10mg prednisone daily ( QD ) . Study drug administer 4 x 250-mg abiraterone acetate tablet prednisone administer 5 mg orally twice day ( BID ) . Patients randomize LHRH-therapy group receive LHRH-therapy receive prior enter trial . 70 medically castrate male patient metastatic CRPC show tumor progression non- mildly-symptomatic enrol approximately 12 German study site .</brief_summary>
