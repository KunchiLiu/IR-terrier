	<brief_summary>NAFLD ( non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , NAFLD ) common liver disease high morbidity seriously influence people 's health . In clinical , two major Traditional chinese medicine ( TCM ) pattern pattern `` liver depression spleen deficiency '' pattern `` damp-heat interior '' , According TCM pattern , treatment effective , use worldwide . While development metabonomics provide tool investigate correlation TCM pattern metabonomics promote development TCM . Currently research NAFLD pattern base metabolomics limit . Our study undertaken investigate correlation TCM pattern metabonomics , evaluate application urinary metabonomics NAFLD : whether use TCM pattern auxiliary classification NAFLD . In addition , investigator also aim discover novel biomarkers noninvasive early diagnosis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . In study , urine sample human three divide group ( healthy control , group `` liver depression spleen deficiency '' pattern group `` damp-heat interior pattern ) collect , 4℃ , 15 min 3000 rpm centrifuge - 80℃ cryopreserved . The metabolic profile change analyze Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer ( GC/MS ) principal component analysis ( PCA ) , partial least squares-discriminate analysis ( PLS-DA ) orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analysis ( OPLS-DA ) . Furthermore , biochemical examination also carry compare among three group . Base literature survey , investigator infer metabolic difference two pattern NAFLD . If investigator hypothesis correct , investigator find different metabolite use discriminate NAFLD healthy population , different pattern urinary metabonomics . The result attractive mean lot : prove importance four diagnosis method TCM use differential analysis metabonomics ; validate classification TCM syndromes scientific ; shed light study TCM syndromes ; find biology marker help diagnosis , treatment pattern discrimination .</brief_summary>
