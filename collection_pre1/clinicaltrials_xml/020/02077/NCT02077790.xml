	<brief_summary>This study support substantial equivalence SS-1000 predicate device Pentacam . Primary Objective -The primary objective trial evaluate precision SS-1000 Pentacam measure anterior segment parameter eye , include Corneal Curvature , Corneal Thickness , Anterior Chamber Depth Cornea Volume . Secondary Objectives - To investigate repeatability ( intra-instrument ) SS-1000 Pentacam measure anterior segment parameter eye - To investigate reproducibility ( inter-instrument ) SS-1000 Pentacam measure anterior segment parameter eye - To investigate agreement SS-1000 Pentacam measure anterior segment parameter eye Study design -The trial design prospective precision trial follow factor : The trial conduct one investigational site . The site three SS-1000 device three Pentacam device available . Three certify operator ( # 1 , # 2 # 3 ) randomly assign one set device ( one SS-1000 one Pentacam ) , operator effect confound instrument effect . All participant one visit undergo set assessment . Each assessment consist 2 consecutive reading ( M1 , M2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate Precision Agreement SS-1000 Pentacam Repeatability Reproducibility Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Nonsignificant Risk ( NSR ) Devices The two device SS-1000 Pentacam consider non-significant risk device conduct trial adhere abbreviate requirement Investigational Device Exemption ( 21CFR812.2 , 2011 ) . 2 . Overall Trial Design The trial design prospective precision trial follow factor : The trial conduct one investigational site . The site three SS-1000 device three Pentacam device available . Three certify operator ( # 1 , # 2 # 3 ) randomly assign one set device ( one SS-1000 one Pentacam ) , operator effect confound instrument effect . All participant one visit undergo set assessment . Each assessment consist 2 consecutive reading ( M1 , M2 ) . To ensure high physiological stability eye measurement do least 3 hour subject awake ( Lattimore MR , 1999 ) . To decrease diurnal variation subject , measurement exclude screening measurement perform within 2 hour window . All measurement perform constant dim light condition . Subject advise keep eye close scan prevent eye dryness . If subject experience eye dryness subject allow extra time recover measurement . 3 . Randomization 3.1 Trial eye If subject one eligible eye pathology , eye select trial eye . If subject two eligible eye , without pathology , trial eye randomly select toss coin ( Head=right eye , Tail=left eye ) . The eye use measurement . 3.2 Order examination Randomization schedule generate use computer use determine order device ( SS-1000 vs. Pentacam ) order instruments/operators ( instrument set # 1 , instrument set # 2 instrument set # 3 ) . 4 . Masking The corneal condition ( thin , normal thick ) available operator obtain data determination repeatability reproducibility . 5 . Discussion Design The trial design serve purpose evaluate agreement precision ( total precision / repeatability / reproducibility ) performance characteristic SS-1000 Pentacam . The precision result use evaluation substantial equivalence SS-1000 Pentacam . This trial design use cohort subject minimize subject variability . Each subject undergo examination 3 operator 3 instrument 2 replicates condition . This design provide head-to head comparison total precision , agreement , repeatability reproducibility . The between-operators confound assessment trial objective automatically assess investigational device . Hence , potential bias minimum term interpretation trial result . Potential bias may occur due fatigue subject and/or operator . Thus , minimize bias order device randomly assign . To avoid confound factor ( e.g . visit ) subject assessments do one visit , subject undergoes 12 measurement . The duration test estimate last least 1 hour consider upper limit subject fatigue eye irritation due dryness . Once subject start experience dryness eye , subject able fixate keep eye open without blink measurement take place . To prevent eye dryness subject eye close measurement . All device evaluate use set subject allow direct comparison investigational device predicate device . 6 . Trial Population A total 66 eye 66 subject meet follow inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion recruit : 6.1 Inclusion Criteria Subjects/eyes meet follow criterion eligible trial : - Subject Inclusion Criteria 1 . Female male age 22 year old time screen 2 . Able fixate internal fixation 3 . Able open eye sufficiently enable full image area 4 . Written inform consent obtain subject investigational assessment - Eye Inclusion Criteria 5.Eyes one follow cornea condition ( Francis BA , 2008 ) : 1 . Normal cornea ( CCT 511-580 µm without pathology ) 2 . Thin cornea , i.e . previous refractive surgery , corneal ectasia , keratoconus ( CCT ≤510 µm without pathology ) 3 . Thick cornea , i.e . Fuchs ' dystrophy , bullous keratopathy , corneal edema ( CCT &gt; 580 µm without pathology ) 6.2 Exclusion Criteria Eyes meet one follow criterion exclude trial : 1 . Use rigid contact lens within one week start trial 2 . Use soft contact lens within 24 hour trial measurement 3 . Aphakic eye 4 . Eyes history intraocular , corneal surgery , except refractive surgery 5 . Currently mydriatic and/or miotic medication affect ocular physiology 6 . Seriously ill unconscious subject , mentally ill person , mentally handicap person , person unable read write When eye subject eligible , one eye randomly select . To ensure recruitment eye range corneal thickness , inclusion criterion . 5 control : 1 . Normal cornea ( 22 eye ) 2 . Thin cornea ( 22 eye ) 3 . Thick cornea ( 22 eye ) . 6.3 Subject identification All subject enrol must identifiable throughout trial . This do use 3-digit subject number start 001 allocated subject enrollment determine investigator . 6.4 Subject Withdrawal The subject advise informed consent form he/she right withdraw trial time without reason . The subject may also withdraw trial investigator 's Tomey 's discretion time . In case subject drop trial withdrawn trial , withdrawal page case report form ( CRF ) complete . On withdrawal page investigator record date withdrawal , person initiate withdrawal primary reason withdrawal . Subjects withdraw trial replace . 7 . Visit Schedule Assessments 7.1 Visit The following procedure perform visit : • Obtain write informed consent trial procedure perform • Obtain demographic data ( age , race , sex ) . • Obtain corneal characteristic pathology . • Screening SS-1000 Pentacam . • Recording concomitant medication . • Assess compliance inclusion exclusion criterion . - Imaging 3 device 3 instruments/operators random order Two reading SS-1000 ( 1 ) Operator # 1 Two reading Pentacam ( 1 ) Operator # 1 Two reading SS-1000 ( 2 ) Operator # 2 - Two reading Pentacam ( 2 ) Operator # 2 - Two reading SS-1000 ( 3 ) Operator # 3 - Two reading Pentacam ( 3 ) Operator # 3 - AE recording occur relation trial procedure .</detailed_description>
