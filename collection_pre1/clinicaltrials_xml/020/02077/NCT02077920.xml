	<brief_summary>Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) common patient receive mechanical ventilation , associate long hospital stay , increase treatment cost , high rate morbidity mortality . VAP report occur 8 % -67 % mechanically ventilated patient ( 20 % -28 % report ) mortality rate 24 % -50 % , 2-3 time mortality rate mechanically ventilate patient without VAP . In patient infected multi-resistant bacteria , mortality rate may high 76 % . The diagnosis , treatment , prevention VAP therefore important . Strategies prevent VAP crucial reduce medical cost increase survival rate critically ill patient . These strategy mainly involve semi-reclining position head bed raise least 30°-45° , oral care , suction subglottic secretion , selective decontamination digestive tract , proper hand washing , avoidance reduction proton pump inhibitor , avoidance excessive sedation , control plasma glucose level . At center , VAP mainly cause bacterial colonization upper respiratory tract via aspiration . This study compare four intervention include oropharyngeal decontamination subglottic suctioning bronchoscopy , aim develop prevention strategy minimize development VAP mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients assess follow : CABDC ABBAA BCDDA CCCDB CACBA BBABC BAAAD DCDAC CDBAA DACDD AAACB CDBCB ACCDB BBAAD BCACC DDBCA ADCAD DABCD CBAAB DDDCD AABAB ACBCD BCCBA ADCDB CBCAB CDDCA CDDDD ABCDA ABDCB CBADD ADDBA BBCCD ABBBD DCDAC BBCCB DADBB CDBDA DBBAC AC Adverse Events : Adverse event occur endotracheal intubation , mechanical ventilation , oral cleanse chlorhexidine , suction oropharyngeal secretion bronchoscopy record . All adverse event include laboratory abnormality record , even think unrelated medical intervention . The severity adverse event correlation experimental drug carefully record case report form . The relationship adverse event drug resistance categorize certainly relevant , probably relevant , possibly relevant , possibly irrelevant , certainly irrelevant . The proportion adverse event categorize certainly relevant , probably relevant , possibly relevant calculate . Severe adverse event record table report director unit sponsor within 24 hour . Severity Assessment : The severity adverse event categorize mild , moderate , severe . A mild adverse event define event sign symptom easy tolerate nausea , vomit , transient localize pain . A moderate adverse event define event result persistent pain . A severe adverse event define event result prolonged hospitalization , disability , reduce ability work , risk death , congenital malformation . The outcomes adverse event record . Patients withdraw trial adverse event follow complete resolution event . The investigator judge whether adverse event related administration experimental drug , record justification decision . Data Management : Completed case report form collect clinical coordinator data enter database . After check accuracy , data lock . After unblinding , data categorize accord four group patient . Statistical Analysis : Numerical data describe percentage , measurement data mean ± standard deviation . Abnormally distribute data describe median interquartile range ( 25th-75th percentile ) . Comparisons Baseline Data : Numerical data compare group use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . Measurement data normal distribution analyze single- multi-factor analysis variance . Data high heterogeneity compare use non-parametric test Tamhane 's T2 test . Measurement data non-normal distribution compare use non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test . Groups compare baseline different time point enrollment . Comparisons Efficacy : Analgesic sedative effect compare among group use Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test . For factor show significant difference among group , pairwise comparison analyze use non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test . Mean value compare group use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test . Data Processing : All statistical analysis perform use SAS software . Two-sided P value calculate . For Fisher 's exact test , P value calculate directly . A value P &lt; 0.05 consider significant , P &lt; 0.01 consider highly significant . Quality Assurance : This study one principal investigator , one research investigator , four investigator . The clinical protocol strictly implement . An independent inspector appoint monitor clinical trial . Quality Control Parameters Measured : The parameter record measure accord standard operate quality control procedure , use standard national unit measurement . Test report form fully complete include date , parameter test , test result , normal range . Ethical Standards : The investigator investigator-authorized personnel explain benefit risk participate clinical trial patient , patient 's legal representative . Written inform consent obtain prior study entry ( performance test administration drug ) . The original consent form store investigator . Data Retention : The investigator responsible maintain database keep data lock future analysis . In accordance principle good clinical practice China , data keep least 5 year .</detailed_description>
