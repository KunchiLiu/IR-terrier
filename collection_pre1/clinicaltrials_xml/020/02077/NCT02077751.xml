	<brief_summary>Objective : To gather safety efficacy BioRBC data adult subject previously develop transient BioRBC antibody responses redo observe adverse clinical laboratory ( i.e. , positive BioRBC antibody titer ) outcomes determine RBC kinetic study result differ previous study . Hypothesis : BioRBC survival study perform adult subject previously develop transient BioRBC antibody response : 1 ) associate adverse clinical laboratory event ; 2 ) experience second transient , BioRBC antibody response ; 3 ) display pattern RBC survival identical prior dose BioRBCs dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary . Subjects eligible study include adult study subject older 18 year positive antibody response BioRBCs previous BioRBC study University Iowa , Adult BioRBC Redosing Safety Protocol Page 3 6 BioRBC antibody sero-negative . The study begin IRB approval . The information summary IRB consent form use prior study include statement indicating subject would re-contacted future research . Written inform consent obtain prior study . The total number subject available study 4 , i.e. , subject previously identify form antibody BioRBC follow autologous BioRBC transfusion . Removal subject . Subjects free withdraw study discretion . The investigator also free withdraw study subject study reason non-compliance , inability conduct require study assessment Investigators determine best interest subject . The reason subject withdrawal document . The Investigators attempt collect safety data withdrawn subject . Study design . This open Phase 1 study 4 subject identify developed antibody BioRBCs — negative antibody — re-dosed BioRBCs . This conduct single study site University Iowa . As illustrated protocol diagram figure , follow screen enrolment , subject donate 100 mL whole blood collect CPD preservative RBC concentrate prepare accord standard methodology procedure include original 2006 FDA IND application minor modification study sample time . Specific Aims . Using dose biotin label autologous RBCs ~30 % previous dose determine 20 wk post-transfusion study period whether study subject : 1 . Develop second BioRBC antibody response great , less , equal subject 's previous response . 2 . Experience fall Hb/Hct , rise reticulocyte count , and/or decrease RBC survival follow appearance BioRBC antibodies ; 3 . Experience clinical sign symptom follow appearance BioRBC antibody . 4 . Have detectable BioRBC enrichment throughout entire study period ( possible previously large BioRBC dose ) . Dose duration . A single dose BioRBCs include density biotin label RBCs study previously survival study . On first day study , fresh ~100 mL aliquot autologous RBC collect label biotin density 6 , 18 , 54 128 μg/mL RBC . Immediately prepare four population BioRBC density , four density combine , mixed , gravimetrically determine weight blood infuse intravenously . An aliquot infusate save analyzed determine dose density administer . All labeling conduct use approve sterile instrument material certify laminar flow containment hood minimize potential bacterial contamination . Two aliquot BioRBC infusate save : 1 ) one endotoxin test subject Adult BioRBC Redosing Safety Protocol Page 5 6 develop transfusion reaction ( encountered ~35 adult subject study date ) ; 2 ) aerobic bacteria culture potential contamination label process . Although culture result available prior infusion , available event subject develop symptom bacterial infection , e.g. , fever .</detailed_description>
