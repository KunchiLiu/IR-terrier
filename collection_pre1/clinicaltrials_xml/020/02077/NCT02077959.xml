	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide pidilizumab see well work treat patient multiple myeloma come back ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , pidilizumab , block cancer growth block ability cancer grow spread . Giving lenalidomide pidilizumab may work well treat relapse refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Pidilizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , safety efficacy CT-011 ( pidilizumab ) combination lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) ass efficacy term overall response rate patient relapse/refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 pidilizumab intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 3 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
