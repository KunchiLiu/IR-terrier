	<brief_summary>The overall goal study establish new pre-rehabilitation program prevention muscle injury legs healthy people serve military injured individual muscle waste follow leg injury . The specific goal include : 1 ) amount exercise cause injury healthy muscle lower leg healthy people ; 2 ) effect intervention ( pre-rehabilitation program ) decrease easily muscle low leg injure healthy people ; 3a ) amount exercise cause injury muscle recently injure recover 3b ) effect new pre-rehabilitation program muscle low leg muscle recently injure still recover . For first goal , investigator determine easily muscle get injure specific exercise 6 healthy , condition men woman . Participants perform different amount exercise low leg muscle see easily muscle damage . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use estimate much damage occur different level exercise . For second goal , investigator examine effect new pre-rehabilitation program decrease easily muscle get damage exercise first goal . The investigator invite healthy people participate goal . The investigator use MRI , blood marker , pain way assess muscle damage 10 people pre-rehabilitation program exercise 10 new program . The third goal focus ) determine easily muscle get injure recently recover trauma ( 5 people participate part third goal ) , b ) determine pre-rehabilitation program decrease easily muscle recover trauma get injured exercise ( 10 people participate part third goal ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 26 healthy adult 15 adult recently experience muscle atrophy conservative treatment orthopedic low leg/ankle/foot injury require surgery require immobilization participate . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use estimate much damage occur different level exercise . The investigator use T2 MR show sensitive injury muscle damage . There four group protocol outline : Healthy Muscle Group : Six subject enrol group . MRI measure perform baseline 48 hour post-exercise , large amount muscle damage typically observe . They test maximum strength dorsiflexors undergo eccentric exercise protocol lower legs Biodex vary load . Approximately two day exercise protocol , participant another MRI low leg ass change T2 relaxation time construct muscle edema/damage . Stretch-Contract Pre-rehabilitation Group All subject test initially MRI , blood work creatine kinase level ( CK ) , subjective report pain , range motion ( ROM ) low leg/ankle , maximum strength dorsiflexors . They also receive `` stretch-contract '' protocol one leg consist follow : 5 second passive stretch dorsiflexors , follow immediately 5 second active isometric contraction dorsiflexors , 5 second rest/relaxation period . This cycle continue duration ~5 minute . Stretch-Contract Control Group All subject test initially MRI , blood work creatine kinase level ( CK ) , subjective report pain , range motion ( ROM ) low leg/ankle , maximum strength dorsiflexors . This group receive `` stretch-contract '' protocol . Muscle Atrophy These subject undergo MRI strength test baseline also assess CK level , pain report , ROM . They receive eccentric load paradigm dorsiflexor muscle involve leg use isokinetic dynamometer vary load . All exercise test perform isokinetic dynamometer physical therapist receive extensive train piece exercise equipment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion control subject [ primary target Reserve Officer Training Corps ( ROTC ) personnel ] : 1 ) healthy individual age 1840 year ; 2 ) ankle range motion leg test 0 degree plantarflexion 30 degree plantarflexion . Exclusion criterion control subject ( primary target ROTC personnel ) : 1 ) previous history trauma and/or surgery low extremity may limit function ; 2 ) neurological , vascular , cardiac problem may limit function ; 3 ) diabetes ; 4 ) previous traumatic head injury posttraumatic stress disorder ; 5 ) contraindication MRI e.g . : pacemaker , metal implant MRI compatible , pregnancy , severe claustrophobia ; 6 ) currently perform exercise program specifically target dorsiflexor muscle . Inclusion criterion subject muscle atrophy : 1 ) individual age 1840 year injury low leg require immobilization surgical intervention ; 2 ) ankle range motion leg test 0 degree plantarflexion 30 degree plantarflexion . Exclusion criterion subject muscle atrophy : 1 ) previous history trauma and/or surgery low extremity , injury immobilize , may limit function ; 2 ) neurological , vascular , cardiac problem may limit function ; 3 ) orthopedic condition affect contralateral , uninvolved low extremity may limit function ; 4 ) diabetes ; 5 ) previous traumatic head injury posttraumatic stress disorder ; 6 ) contraindication MRI e.g . : pacemaker , metal implant MRI compatible , pregnancy , severe claustrophobia .</criteria>
