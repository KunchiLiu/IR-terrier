	<brief_title>The GRAFT Study : Evaluation Graft Function , Rejection Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy First Heart Transplant Recipients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective 1 . To assess relationship myocardial perfusion , coronary anatomy longitudinal myocardial function heart transplant ( HTX ) patient without coronary allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) . 2 . Evaluation systolic diastolic capacity exercise HTX patient without CAV . 3 . Evaluation non-invasive method CAV diagnosis . 4 . To assess left ventricular ( LV ) right ventricular ( RV ) function acute phase follow-up ( 5 time ) first year transplantation furthermore compare advanced echocardiographic evaluation graft function cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI ) , right heart catheterization , positron emission tomography ( PET ) . 5 . Finally , evaluate impact acute repetitive rejection myocardial graft function measure standard 2D echocardiography advance echocardiography analysis longitudinal myocardial function . Hypothesis 1 . Timing development degree CAV measure non-invasively combine myocardial longitudinal deformation measurement advance echocardiography coronary flow velocity reserve ( CFVR ) echocardiography PET . This combination method detect CAV angiographic visual give supplementary information impact myocardial graft function . This setup might appropriate evaluation myocardial graft function CAV standard echocardiography coronary angiography ( CAG ) . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) detect CAV early phase give supplementary characterization plaque . 2 . Modern non-invasive method ( longitudinal deformation , 3D echocardiography , CMRI PET ) use RV LV myocardial function assessment represent valid marker function standard echocardiography HTX patient . 3 . During exercise patient CAV show impaired longitudinal myocardial deformation restrictive filling significant increase LV RV filling pressure . 4 . Myocardial longitudinal deformation well marker acute rejection conventional ejection fraction ( EF ) . After episode severe acute rejection graft function improve , instance repetitive rejection lead impaired longitudinal systolic function preserve LV EF . Background Mean survival HTX center 15.6 year . Complications remain frequent serious . In first postoperative year main cause death graft failure , rejection infection . At long term follow main cause death CAV malignancy . CAV characterize diffuse concentric intima thicken involve epicardial vessel coronary microvascular system . After 10 year 50 % patient show angiographic sign CAV . In clinical approach HTX-patients follow annual CAG standard echocardiography estimation LV systolic function EF . EF often within normal range even though CAV lesion evident CAG , suggest LV EF inappropriate parameter detecting impaired myocardial function CAV . Symptoms graft dysfunction first present themself severe CAV . Studies show CAG often miss CAV early phase . OCT novel intravascular image modality excellent spatial resolution . It use small cross sectional study HTX patient seem like promise tool detect CAV give supplementary characterization plaque . In various cardiac disease well know ischemia fibrosis often affect endocardial longitudinal orient layer lead abnormal systolic function LV RV . Longitudinal deformation tissue Doppler strain analysis show well marker systolic function HTX patient compare standard measurement LV EF . Longitudinal LV systolic function dependent endocardial perfusion . CFVR represent capacity coronary circulation dilate , due increase myocardial metabolic demand express difference hyperaemic rest flow . CFVR show correlate degree decrease longitudinal deformation myocardial infarction . CFVR measurement HTX patient color Doppler echocardiography PET scan show significant correlation CAV . RV failure early , potentially fatal , complication HTX . Standard echocardiographic measurement seem reflect overall RV systolic performance clinical status patient . Prior study find impaired RV function HTX , study RV function perform simultaneous right heart catheterization assessment RV EF CMRI ( golden standard ) . Overall function change time RV fully study use modern echocardiographic technique assessment CMRI . Acute rejection inflammatory response frequently first 6 month HTX . Two third experience rejection episode within first year . Rejections often asymptomatic associate poor outcome , include development CAV . Patients follow routine biopsy ( gold standard ) , expensive , time consume inconvenient patient . The role conventional echocardiography yet find significant role diagnostics acute rejection furthermore repeat rejection influence graft function well describe .

MD , PhD student Tor Skibsted Clemmensen draft manuscript 1st author hereof . Ethical consideration Adenosine , use CFVR measurement PET , often cause mild facial flushing , chest discomfort dyspnoea . After suspended infusion symptom last less one minute since half time 10 second . Right heart catheterisation part standard protocol HTX . Only patient study 1 might subject catheterisation normally . Complications rare experienced operator . The radiation dose H215O-PET 2-2,5 mSv , approximately one year background radiation . Patients study 1 subject one examination , patient study 2 two examination . No additional CAG make study . OCT examination consider safe risk complication &lt; 0,5 % .
