	<brief_summary>This phase 0/II trial study effect carbon C 14 oxaliplatin tumor tissue blood side effect well oxaliplatin work treat patient metastatic breast cancer . DNA analysis tumor tissue blood sample patient receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin may help doctor predict well patient respond treatment oxaliplatin . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To detect level oxaliplatin-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) adduct induced oxaliplatin microdosing tumor tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , correlate result patient response oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate efficacy single agent oxaliplatin treatment ( 130mg/m^2 , 2 hr intravenously [ IV ] day 1 ; every 3 week ) pre-treated , metastatic breast cancer patient . II . Evaluate toxicity oxaliplatin microdose chemotherapy treatment patient population . III . Determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter oxaliplatin microdosing correlate PK parameter therapeutic oxaliplatin . IV . Determine whether pharmacokinetics oxaliplatin microdosing affect oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage , therefore , patient response chemotherapy . V. Detect repair DNA adduct PBMC correlate patient response oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy . VI . Correlate adduct patient response data DNA repair gene , excision repair cross-complementing ( ERCC ) 1 level measure reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . OUTLINE : PHASE 0 : Patients receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin IV 2 minute day 1 . PHASE II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
