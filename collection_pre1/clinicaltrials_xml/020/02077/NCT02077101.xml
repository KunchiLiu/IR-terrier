	<detailed_description>Since 2000 , study acceptability HIV vaccine candidate one four major area recommend WHO . Presently , several study HIV field theme `` Cure `` . However , study yet address question acceptability therapeutic vaccine candidate HIV currently already clinical trial phase 2 3 In addition , many aspect disease , treatment living condition PLWHA could affect acceptability vaccine Description study population : The study population characteristic HIV population live France [ 26 , 27 ] .The French population report database French Hospital 2011 FHDH comparable population study ( three center combine ) : - 36 % MSM- 9.1 % injection drug user ( IDUs ) 45 % heterosexual : Europe include France 23.7 % immigrant sub-Saharan Africa . 88 % receive antiretroviral therapy 95 % undetectable .- 40 % 40-49 year Description research methodology Quantitative study : Patients complete questionnaire validate publish literature : Brief IPQ R HIV PROQOL [ 28 , 29 ] .The questionnaire RAVVIH therapeutic vaccine design literature review , opinion ofScientific Council particular Dr. Pierre Verger social scientist vaccination expert perception patient . It test sample 15 PHAs.The questionnaire take account several important dimension could affect therapeutic vaccine acceptability : 1. individual history , ARV treatment ( tolerance ) perception related adverse symptom treatment 2. compliance respect ARV treatment 3. quality relationship person physician ( referent , general ) level ofit give confidence ; 4 ) level social support person ( unlike isolation ) may explain desire participate trial ( attention context trial , example ... ) 5 ) managing secret illness ( avoid take daily treatment vaccine therapy , way reduce opportunity reveal illness ... ) 6 ) perception seriousness illness.T Qualitative study : A group 20 patient offer qualitative interview psychologist . The interview guide develop literature expert community . Volunteers recruit accord different category people representative HIV population France . Study participation approximately 30 minute , include presentation protocol charge time questionnaire . After give consent study , patient may time withdraw end participation . Paper questionnaires complete patient consider source document study patient 's medical record follow data collect ( date birth , viral load , therapy ; vaccination status , mode infection , nadir CD4 , CD4 count , year diagnosis , year start HAART , HBV HCV co-infection status ) . Quality assurance plan / Study Monitoring Auditing : This study follow monitoring audit guideline design sponsor order ensure agreement good clinical practice recommendation . Study monitor source data verification : Monitoring achieve representative sponsor ( Clinical Research Delegate ) perform on-site visit s/he compare data observation booklet source data order ass completeness . The clinical research delegate ensure , via frequent communication ( either mail , phone , fax , email ) , research agreement protocol complies regulation . The site closing visit perform Clinical Research Delegate . Site Monitoring : The national regulatory board and/or representative sponsor 's Clinical Quality Board able request access source data , observation booklet , study documentation site audit inspection . The investigator guarantee unhindered direct access above-mentioned documentation collaborate fully site audit inspection . Medical file study documentation available photocopy site audit inspection , long subject ' name hide copy order maintain confidentiality . Statistical Analysis Analysis Main Variable : Acceptability Score summarize use mean median well usual indicator variability ( standard deviation , inter-quartile range , range ) . The investigator pay particular attention symmetry distribution : strong asymmetry suggest scale optimal tool measure acceptability sample . The analysis stratify follow sub-groups : investigation site , sex , age , duration disease . Validation RAVIVIH Acceptability Questionnaire : Distribution answer , Likert scale , questionnaire item assess relative frequency table order determine ceiling/flooring effect present ( i.e . 80 % respondent either extreme Likert scale ) . Since questionnaire build block ( knowledge , perception , acceptability ) , principal component analysis ( PCA ) perform verify correlation structure questionnaire item ' answer allow identification specific dimension . In case strong asymmetry questionnaire , analysis could complete non-linear PCA . This analysis also allow ass relation questionnaire 's item acceptability thus justify use composite score base answer acceptability item . To make interpretation acceptability score easier , score linearly translate 100-point scale . In addition assessment RAVIVIH questionnaire 's construction validity , multitrait scaling perform . It aim verify correlation item dimension appropriate ( &gt; 0.5 ) correlation item belong unrelated dimension remain low ( &lt; 0.2 ) . The statistical significance linear correlation test Pearson correlation test , correlation multiple test Bonferroni method . Acceptability Score Validation The investigator validate RAVIVIH composite score ( 100-point scale form ) compare EVA questionnaire use linear correlation coefficient ( Pearson ) Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . The latter ass degree relationship two variable describe monotonic function . Influence knowledge perception therapeutic vaccine biomedical data Acceptability To determine variation degree acceptability explain difference knowledge perception , canonical multivariate analysis perform order identify item share great contribution explain variation acceptability score . Multiple correlation analysis perform order verify association acceptability score biomedical characteristic well quality life measure PROQOL-HIV questionnaire . Scores translate `` social relationship '' , `` sexual relationship '' , `` stigma '' , `` impact treatment '' dimension part interest . This analysis provide , indirectly , indication RAVIVIH questionnaire 's convergent validity . The RAVIVIH acceptability score also correlate IPQ-R score . Sample size assessment ( total site ) Since study essentially prospective one since base representative sample French HIV-positive patient , number participant necessary determine base require precision main indicator therapeutic vaccine acceptability . A sample size 200 ( N=200 ) allow estimate average acceptability score EVA questionnaire margin error inferior 0.5 ( 95 % confidence interval ) , assume theoretical 1-point standard deviation . Regarding composite acceptability score , refer score system use Newman ( 2011 ) assume standard deviation 20 point , translates average 100-point scale 3-point accuracy . Furthermore , sample size would allow calculation PCA extraction 3 4 component . Expected statistical significance : For calculation statistical test , 95 % confidence interval apply . Plan miss data : Missing data include variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported '' , uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result . The Clinical Trial Technician physician inspect questionnaire consult ensure item leave unanswered . If , despite procedure , item leave unanswered , system implant able retrieve data necessary statistical analysis . Management Modifications bring Initial Statistical Analysis Plan : Modifications bring initial statistical analysis plan report write document attach initial plan . If additional statistical analysis become necessary , would detail analysis report .</detailed_description>
