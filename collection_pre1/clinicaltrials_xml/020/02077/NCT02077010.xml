	<brief_summary>Patients end stage heart failure significant symptom ( include fatigue shortness breath ) prevent able perform activity daily live . Milrinone one inotropic medication study use treatment end stage heart failure . End stage heart failure patient await heart transplantation often maintain IV milrinone 24 hour day chronic IV line . Two problem arise therapy . First , IV line create opportunity infection blood clot , addition interfere patient 's quality life . Second , patient may expose high level milrinone give IV necessary maintain heart 's function . The investigator goal show inhale milrinone equivalent `` standard care '' IV milrinone improve heart lung pressure end stage heart failure patient ( respond milrinone therapy ) prospective , randomize , control clinical trial . Patients send right heart catheterization procedure cardiologist determine require milrinone randomly choose continuous IV milrinone group inhale milrinone group agree participate study . Patients inhale milrinone group receive 60mg 4ml fluid inhale jet nebulizer every 8 hour . Patients IV arm receive constant IV infusion rate . Both group standard-of-care repeat right heart catheterization procedure average 48- 96 hour milrinone initiation evaluate response milrinone . Afterward , patient respond place standard care IV milrinone duration therapy , direct cardiologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nebulized Inhaled Milrinone Hospitalized Advanced Heart Failure Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 5.7 million Americans heart failure , lead cause morbidity mortality United States . Heart failure list contribute cause 280,000 death 2008 U.S. ( 1 9 ) half patient diagnosed heart failure die within 5 year . Patients end stage heart failure significant symptom ( include fatigue dyspnea ) prevent able perform activity daily live . These patient often require repeat prolonged hospitalization disease management contributes significantly cost heart failure United States ( 34.4 billion year ) . Milrinone , phosphodiesterase III inhibitor , one inotropic medication study used treatment acutely decompensated heart failure . Several study evaluate chronic intravenous ( IV ) inotrope use end stage heart failure palliation symptom well evaluated effect cost decrease hospital readmission . Hauptman et al Harjai et al demonstrate significant decrease hospital cost due reduction day hospitalize readmission initiation inotropes include milrinone . However , concern IV milrinone use possibility increase mortality associate therapy despite improved hemodynamics ( increased cardiac output , decrease filling pressure ) symptom observe chronic use oral inotropes . The OPTIME-CHF study confirm concern regard use IV milrinone reporting increase mortality patient New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III-IV ischemic heart failure without hemodynamic compromise well statistically significant increase atrial ventricular arrhythmia use intravenous milrinone . For reason , American Heart Association/American College Cardiology practice guideline , recommend use IV milrinone patient present clinical evidence hypotension associate hypo-perfusion elevate cardiac filling pressure order maintain systemic perfusion preserve end-organ performance . Administration chronic IV inotropes heart failure patient refractory symptom categorize class IIb indication ( `` usefulness/efficacy le well establish expert opinion '' ) . This prospective , dual center , drug-interventional , non-blinded , open-label , randomize control clinical trial . Anticipated number patient enrol study n = 40 ( 20 patient randomize nebulized inhale milrinone intravenous milrinone group ) . Patients end stage HF , discretion treat cardiologist order initial right heart catheterization ( RHC ) evaluation HF therapy , send right heart catheterization ( RHC ) determine inotropic therapy would beneficial . If treating cardiologist decides initiate inotropic therapy base current guideline-recommended therapy RHC perform , patient undergo randomization either intervention arm ( inhaled milrinone ) control arm ( intravenous milrinone ) prior RHC . Randomization perform randomized block design use randomization tool embed within REDCAP secure database 2 block . Because significant accumulation milrinone renal dysfunction , patient creatinine clearance less equal 40ml/min , calculate Cockcroft-Gault equation use serum creatinine prior randomization , place separate block creatinine clearance great 40ml/min . The investigator goal show inhale milrinone equivalent `` standard care '' IV milrinone improve hemodynamics end stage heart failure patient ( respond milrinone therapy ) prospective , randomize , control clinical trial . Change patient hemodynamic measurement treatment assess right heart catheterization hemodynamic variable ( include right ventricle ( RV ) stroke work index , Cardiac output ( CO ) , mixed venous oxygen saturation , pulmonary venous resistence ( PVR ) , systemic vascular resistence ( SVR ) . Recognizing invasive hemodynamic study discretion treat physician decision may also challenge complete deem unnecessary patient , primary endpoint include 1 ) invasive hemodynamic criterion consist PA catheter measurement &gt; 20 % decrease PCWP &gt; 20 % increase Thermodilution Fick Cardiac Index ( CI ) time second RHC compare baseline measurement ; 2 ) centrally ( ie : PICC access ) measure SVO2 use determine Fick calculation CI ( &gt; 20 % increase CI require meet primary end point compare Fick CI baseline ) without need PA catheter placement ; 3 ) absence PA catheter placement central access SVO2 determination , &gt; 30 % decline laboratory base BNP measurement compare baseline BNP improvement 15 percentage point baseline dyspnea visual analog scale ( range 0-100 ) also consider meet primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
