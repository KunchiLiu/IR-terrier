	<brief_title>The Effect Protein Resistance Training Muscle Mass Acutely Ill Old Medical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : The intervention hospitalization discharge undertaken standardized manner describe detail Standardized Operational Procedures . They summarize follow . The Nutritional Intervention hospitalization aim reduce loss muscle mass supply sufficient protein meet accelerate demand consequence stress-induced catabolism . The aim intervention achieve protein intake 1.7 g per kg body weight per day . If body mass index exceed 30 body weight correspond BMI 30 use calculate aim protein intake . On day inclusion individual diet plan make authorized clinical dietitian . Besides cover high protein requirement diet plan calculate meet individual requirement energy , liquids micronutrient . Energy requirement estimate individually accord Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 ( Kondrup et al . 2003 ) . This method take increase demand stress metabolism account . The estimated energy requirement aim weight maintenance , weight gain loss . The weight monitor daily hospitalization , take account loss gain edema , evaluate energy intake balance output . The fluid requirement calculate individually , considers reduce ability kidney concentrate urine stress high protein diet generate large amount ammonium urea . Furthermore , patient receive daily vitamin mineral tablet . The patient and/ nurse responsible registration dietary intake . A scheme contain food drink available hospital use daily documentation . The diet plan continually adjust patient preference eat ability . If goal protein cover least 80 % oral intake , supplemental tube feeding initiate . If coverage 80 % goal cover use feed tube supplemental total parental nutrition initiate . The regional guideline follow initiate enteral nutrition feed tube parental nutrition . To reach goal protein intake , regional guideline enteral nutrition feed tube deviate concern dose infusion rate first 4 day . Dose infusion rate increase faster described regional guideline , well tolerate . Patients monitor Refeeding Syndrome total enteral parenteral nutrition initiate adapted weight loss suspect . If goal protein reach , main reason register . Daily intake energy , protein fluid register . The participant control group receive standard treatment dietary intake first 24 Hours inclusion register . The aim intervention discharge stimulate anabolic response muscle . The intervention consist daily protein energy supplement ( Resource Protein , Nestlé Nutrition ) resistance train 12 week home participant . The training initiated preferably day discharge fast circumstance allow . The daily protein energy supplement initiate day discharge . Furthermore patient provide asked take daily multi vitamin mineral tablet ( APO VIT ) . Screens virtual training demonstrate resistance training ( Welfare Denmark ) . The screen demonstrate exercise count repetition . A research assistant supervise train session three time week . The resistance training consist three set 8-12 repetition chair-stand exercise without support arm knee extension exercise depend capability patient . A physiotherapist supervise first second visit individually best fit exercise chosen . Each exercise increase difficulty add weight . To ensure high level neural activation recruit large amount motor unit possible , intensity exercise aim achive 8 possible repetition set . If less eight repetition possible exercise regress difficulty 8 repetition achievable . In case 8 repetition possible , exercise progress difficulty . Additionally difficulty exercise adjust week 2 , 4 8 , exercise progress three complete set 12 repetition possible . To evaluate training intensity last set exercise adjustment repeat fatigue . The aim supervise visit moreover document motivate training , register compliance protein energy supplement ensure consume directly train . The participant ask keep empty bottle protein energy supplement , measure compliance . Patient recruitment : Patients recruit Amager og Hvidovre Hospitaler , Copenhagen . On day inclusion , list newly admit patient 65 year older generate . The list generate 7.30 a.m. include patient admit within last 24 hour . Medical journal patient check inclusion exclusion criterion 's . Eligible patient randomly order invited/asked participate study . Patients receive write verbal information study allow time consider participation sign formula inform consent . The formula also sign research assistant archive patient 's medical journal . Data diagnosis , day admission , readmission , age gender register eligible patient . Further , patient wish participate study interview appetite , functional ability ( 'New Mobility Score ' ) nutritional status assess use Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 apply Danish Hospitals ( Kondrup et al . 2003 ) . Eligible patient sign informed consent formula include study give study identification number . Patient recruitment undertaken standardized manner describe detail Standardized Operational Procedure . Randomization : Randomization block 4 ratio 2:2 , stratify Diabetes Mellitus nutritionally at-risk ( determined secondary score ≥ 3 Nutritional Risk Screening procedure ( Kondrup et al . 2003 ) . An impartial person evaluate allocation patient , regard gender age , half expect patient recruit ( n=16 ) . In case skew distribution group , third stratification variable could introduce . The randomized allocation sequence generate Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) accessible research assistant responsible intervention . The research assistant responsible assessment outcome blind allocation patient . The allocation patient describe protocol Regional Committee , Capital Region Denmark , Health Research Ethics ( protocol . H-2-2013-013 ) approve 19th February 2013 . Data collection : Data collection follow Standardized Operational Procedures . To limit inter-individual variability research assistant perform data collection . Assessment primary endpoint secondary endpoint perform four time study ; admission , discharge , one month discharge three month discharge . Data collection admission , possible , perform immediately project patient give consent participate . If possible due examination , fatigue data collection perform soon circumstance allow . The date time admission date time data collection register . The treatment include patient observe carefully health personal consult order predict time discharge . Data collection perform close time discharge possible . If patient discharge earlier expect research assistant contact patient make arrangement assessment endpoint soon possible . The date discharge date data collection register . One month discharge data secondary endpoint assess home visit . Project patient contact one week visit research assistant ring day visit confirm appointment . If patient wish home visit data collection may perform hospital stead . The aim assessment perform ratio 5 day one month discharge . The date discharge date data collection register . Three month discharge data primary secondary endpoint assess . The assessment secondary endpoint may perform home visit hospital . Assessment primary endpoint perform hospital . Project patient contact one week visit research assistant ring day visit confirm appointment . The research assistant arrange transportation hospital . The aim assessment perform ratio 5 day date three month discharge . The date discharge date data collection register . If patient wish participate certain examination test register . This exclude patient test . The research assistant register deviation Standard Operational Procedures . Sample size assessment : The assessment sample size base average change total muscle mass ( primary endpoint ) intervention control group . Based exist literature average change muscle mass entire study period expect average loss 1.5 kg muscle mass control group average loss 0 kg muscle mass intervention group ( Tidermark et al . 2004 ; Ferrando et al . 2010 ; Candow et al . 2008 ; Whiteford et al . 2010 ) . Standard deviation 's adopt study Whiteford et al . 2010 1.35 kg 1.24 kg intervention control group , respectively . Sample size calculate power 80 % significance level 5 % . A minimum 12 person arm need find significant difference two group . Further , drop-out rate 30 % take account . Based calculation total sample size 32 patient require . Statistical analysis plan : The statistical analysis include intention treat analysis per protocol analysis compliant participant . Analysis primary outcome , muscle mass , perform total muscle mass , low extremity upper extremity . The distribution data test depend weather normally distribute screwed student t-test non-parametric test apply . The difference change outcome two group test . When relevant chi-squared test Spearman-rank test use . Linear regression analysis use adjust possible confounders . To perform statistical calculation statistical software program STATA release 12 Statistical Analysis Software , SAS , use .</detailed_description>
