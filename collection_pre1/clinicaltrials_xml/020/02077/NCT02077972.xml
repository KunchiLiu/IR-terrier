	<brief_summary>Combat-related post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) become increasingly press public health problem United States follow overseas war last decade . Rates PTSD skyrocket military among veteran , lead increase rate suicide , impairment job , behavioral change negatively affect veteran , also family . Although effective medication psychotherapy treatment exist combat-related PTSD , many individual suffer PTSD adequately respond currently available treatment option , highlight need develop test new intervention disorder . To address press clinical issue , investigator conduct pilot study determine Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) reduce symptoms adult suffer combat-related PTSD . The investigator plan recruit sample 10 medically healthy individual combat-related PTSD receive single session WBH determine single session improve PTSD symptom , , whether improvement last least 2 week . To , study include basic clinical psychiatric assessment immediately one four week WBH . Because sleep often impaired PTSD , investigator measure at-home sleep pattern week prior week follow WBH session use sleep diary wristwatch actigraphy device . Given scientific evidence research group WBH may improve depression , investigator anticipate may also benefit adult suffer combat-related PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator direct clinical trial Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) treatment PTSD relate combat exposure . Although investigator yet study WBH PTSD , investigator data indicate WBH effective acute treatment major depression ( MDD ) . Given high overlap symptom PTSD Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , well fact people PTSD also meet criterion MDD , investigator reason expect WBH may also benefit PTSD . The primary objective propose study determine WBH produce improvement core PTSD symptom , appear MDD . Indeed , preliminary study , single exposure WBH result downward shift body temperature decrease depressive symptom measure use Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( know ADS Germany study conduct ) 5 day later . In addition , follow exclusion one patient bronchopulmonary inflammation show decrease body temperature follow treatment , correlation shift body temperature Î”ADS approach statistical significance . These preliminary data consistent previous study show 1 ) patient seasonal affective disorder winter depression blunt thermoregulatory cool thermoregulatory cool similar efficiency control subject successful antidepressant response phototherapy ( retina direct projection DRVL serotonergic neuron ) , 2 ) ECT increase circadian amplitude core body temperature , decrease mean core body temperature , particularly nighttime thermoregulatory cool period , 3 ) thermoregulatory cooling , evidence number active sweat gland depressed patient , increase upon clinical recovery , early , follow ECT . investigator hypothesize relationship preliminary data previous study due dysfunction afferent signal arm thermoregulatory system MDD , specifically warm afferent system project LPB , secondarily , DRVL/VLPAG DRI subsets serotonergic neuron implicate anxiolytic antidepressant action , respectively , normalization warm afferent signal follow treatment . Again , give high degree overlap PTSD MDD , investigator expect WBH may confer therapeutic benefit PTSD appear MDD . This clinical trial include individual PTSD ( i.e . normal control ) order determine whether significant effect single treatment WBH administer open manner PTSD symptom . Based data patient MDD , investigator expect WBH effect PTSD symptom , apparent immediately treatment persist least week . Therefore , investigator assess PTSD symptom prior week follow single treatment WBH . Useful preliminary result obtain pilot study compare mildly severely depressed patient receive hyperthermic treatment ( N=11 ) depress patient receive psychotherapy usual ( N=3 ) . Baseline score German language ADS depression scale similar two group ( mean=30.64 , sd=9.18 , N=11 , vs. mean =32.33 , sd=17.04 , N=3 ) . Raw change ADS significantly great hyperthermia group ( mean=-11.91 , sd=6.55 , N=11 , vs. mean=-1.33 , sd=4.51 , N=3 ; t=2.60 , df=12 , P=0.023 ) , result large standardize treatment difference ( Cohen ) 1.69 ( 95 % CI=1.00 - 2.48 ) . Percent change also significant ( mean=-39.4 , sd=18.9 , N=11 , vs. mean=-8.6 , sd=17.0 , N=3 ; t=2.54 ; df=12 , P=0.026 ) , Cohen 1.66 ( 95 % CI=0.93 - 2.39 ) . The percentage hyperthermia vs. psychotherapy group achieve clinical response ( &gt; 50 % reduction baseline ) 27.3 % vs. 0 % , percentage achieve least partial response ( &gt; 25 % improvement ) 81.8 % vs. 33.3 % . These data suggest propose sample size 10 individual combat-related PTSD sufficient identify potential therapeutic effect , assume effect would similar magnitude effect see MDD .</detailed_description>
