	<detailed_description>The aim Focused Registry complete data collection enable sound analysis Tomofix Small size study . The incidence knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) high Japan population . Respective prevalence 47.0 70.2 % men woman Kellgren-Lawrence Grades 2-4 knee OA report Japanese patient age 60 year . First treatment option pharmacological ( i.e .

If therapy successful , surgical treatment option unicompartmental knee replacement , total knee arthroplasty high tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) recognize . The discussion best therapy still controversial . HTO may decrease number complication compare total knee replacement unicompartmental knee arthroplasty leave option later replacement surgery . In project , patient include would surgically treat HTO Tomofix small base investigator 's assessment refuse surgical treatment .
