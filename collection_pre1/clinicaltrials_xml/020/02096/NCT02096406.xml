	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease lead cause death , hospitalization , health care cost develop nation . Coronary revascularization coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery improve long term survival patient diabetes multi-vessel disease . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) reduce mortality subsequent cardiac event patient coronary artery disease undergo CABG surgery initiate least 4 week pre-operatively . Observational data suggest pre-operative ACE administration associate increased risk post-operative vasoplegic shock , acute kidney injury , mortality ; however , study fail confirm finding suggest ACE associate reduce risk peri-operative myocardial infarction . A single trial 40 CABG patient randomize pre-operative ACE withdrawal continuation report withdrawal group require significantly few vasopressor cardiopulmonary bypass intravenous vasodilator post-operatively control hypertension . Hence , remain unclear whether ACEs hold continue immediately prior CABG surgery survey cardiac surgeon suggest current clinical practice divide . This pilot study aim establish feasibility study design determine frequency clinical endpoint among patient continue discontinue ACE prior cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
