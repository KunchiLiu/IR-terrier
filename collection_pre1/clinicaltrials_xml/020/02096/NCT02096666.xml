	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating AMG 337 Asian Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 , multicenter , single arm , open-label study ass safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics AMG 337 solid tumor . In Phase 1 , approximately 3 45 subject enrol 3+3+3 dose escalation scheme evaluate two dose level . In Phase 2 , approximately 140 subject enrol either Cohort 1 ( subject MET amplify /gastroesophageal junction/esophageal ( G/GEJ/E ) adenocarcinoma measurable tumor ) Cohort 2 ( subject MET amplify solid tumor measurable tumor subject MET amplify G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma non-measurable tumor ) . All subject self-administer AMG 337 daily disease progression protocol specify end treatment criterion meet . Tumor assessment RECIST 1.1 follow study treatment . Tumor tissue , biomarkers , pharmacokinetics Patient Reported Outcomes assess .</detailed_description>
