	<detailed_description>This randomise control trial ass benefit use patient specific instrumentation total knee replacement surgery . Patient specific instrumentation individualise system total knee replacement surgery . The system market already use centre . The process similar traditional knee replacement surgery approximately 6 week prior operation patient undergo MRI scan knee , hip ankle . From data dimension rotation knee accurately measure , custom make jig make specific patient anatomy . The jig use intra-operatively make accurate bone cut accord pre-operative plan , type implant use remain size component , alignment implant expect improve . This study assess improvement implant alignment use patient specific instrumentation , improve intra-operative outcome long term clinical outcome improvement patient .</detailed_description>
