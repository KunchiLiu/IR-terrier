	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare different treatment schedule use drug SGI-110 alone combination drug . Researchers want learn different treatment schedule may help control AML . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>4-Arm Phase II Study SGI-110 Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 4 study group . You equal chance assign group . Neither study staff choose group assign : - If Group A , receive SGI-110 alone 5 day . - If Group B , receive SGI-110 alone 10 day . - If Group C , receive SGI-110 5 day idarubicin 2 day . - If Group D , receive SGI-110 5 day cladribine 5 day . SGI-110 give 1 time day needle skin . Idarubicin cladribine give 1 time day vein hour . If respond study drug ( ) continue schedule every 4 8 week , depend react study drug ( ) . These 4-8 week period call study cycle . The first ( 3 ) cycle call Induction Cycles . All cycle call Maintenance Cycles . The dos drug , number time receive , may reduce Maintenance Cycles . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle ( +/- 7 day ) , physical exam . Every week , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test point disease appear go away . After , blood draw every 2-8 week . The study staff let know need blood draw . On Day 15 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check status disease . On Day 28 ( +/-7 day ) Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . After , bone marrow aspirate every 2 week ( +/- 7 day ) point disease appear respond . If routine blood test show still leukemia , may need bone marrow sample collect . If disease appear go away Cycle 2 , time next bone marrow aspirate depend result blood test . Every 3-4 cycle ( whenever doctor think need ) , either ECHO MUGA check heart function . You need stay Houston receive study drug ( ) . When study visit receive study drug ( ) , test perform local doctor . Length Study : You receive study drug ( ) 24 month . You take study doctor think best interest , disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-up Visits : After last dose study drug , follow-up visit . You visit disease respond study drug ( ) . - Every month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . These test perform local doctor . - Every 6 month , return Houston physical exam blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . This investigational study . Cladribine idarubicin FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer affect blood , include different type leukemia . SGI-110 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 120 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
