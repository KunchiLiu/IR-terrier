	<brief_summary>This phase II open label study evaluate adolescent ( ≥ 16 year age ) adult neurofibromatosis type-1 ( NF1 ) plexiform neurofibromas treat MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 . The primary aim study assess quantitative radiographic response target lesion . Subjects receive PD-0325901 mouth bid dose schedule 2 mg/m2/dose maximum dose 4 mg bid . Each course 4 week duration , subject receive drug 3 week on/1 week schedule . Subjects may receive additional course beyond course 8 least 15 % reduction volume target tumor . Subjects 20 % great reduction target tumor volume end 12 course continue therapy additional year ( maximum 24 total course ) . However , subject achieve least 15 % reduction volume target tumor 8 course ( ~8 month ) consider treatment failure take study .

	<detailed_description>This phase II open label study evaluate adolescent ( ≥ 16 year age ) adult neurofibromatosis type-1 ( NF1 ) plexiform neurofibromas treat MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 . The primary aim study assess quantitative radiographic response target lesion . Subjects receive PD-0325901 mouth bid dose schedule 2 mg/m2/dose maximum dose 4 mg bid . Each course 4 week duration , subject receive drug 3 week on/1 week schedule . Subjects may receive additional course beyond course 8 least 15 % reduction volume target tumor . Subjects 20 % great reduction target tumor volume end 12 course continue therapy additional year ( maximum 24 total course ) . However , subject achieve least 15 % reduction volume target tumor 8 course ( ~8 month ) consider treatment failure take study . Subjects retinal screening perform start PD-0325901 regularly study drug . Patients glaucoma , intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg , significant abnormality ( exclude chronic , stable ophthalmological finding secondary Optic Pathway Glioma ) ophthalmic examination ( performed ophthalmologist ) eligible . Patients receive radiation cytotoxic therapy within 4 week study entry patient receive radiation orbit time previously , eligible study . Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease also exclude . In addition , pregnant woman eligible enrollment subject reproductive age require practice birth control treatment . Subjects enter trial carefully monitor development PD-0325901 associated toxicity . In consent subject enter trial , complete pharmacokinetic profile PD-0325901 administration evaluate course 1 . Involvement part study require . Consenting subject dermal neurofibromas punch biopsy dermal neurofibromas two time point determine PD-0325901 affect biologic target . Involvement part study optional . Since plexiform neurofibroma may significantly impact live patient NF1 , study evaluate effect disease treatment PD-0325901 quality life ( QOL ) adolescents adult . Involvement part study require . The Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL ) Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module use assess QOL subject . The PedsQL NF1 Module self-reported disease-specific QOL scale develop adolescent adult NF1 . It assess 16 domain function include physical functioning , emotional functioning , social functioning , cognitive functioning , physical appearance , worry , pain hurt , fatigue , daily activity . Preliminary data collect scale indicates good reliability validity adult . The preliminary data small sample adolescent also look promise . Data collect trial may use toward validate instrument since disease specific QOL measure NF1 currently exist , tool critically need . Pain assess use Numeric Rating Scale-11 ( NRS-11 ) , 11-point self-report scale pain intensity . In addition , Brief Pain Inventory Pain Interference Scale 7-item self-report questionnaire measure extent pain interferes daily function . Both brief measure recommend assess different aspect pain clinical trial . For subject respond PD-0325901 ( ≥20 % tumor volume reduction target lesion 12 course ) , MRI scan target lesion request ( require ) 4 12 month stop drug ( long subject still protocol ) order determine whether response maintain post-therapy . These study request subject experience disease progression study drug . Before subject enrol , responsible institutional investigator must sign date complete eligibility checklist . The complete eligibility checklist fax NF Operations Center confirm eligibility prior subject enrollment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All study determine eligibility must perform within 2 week prior enrollment unless otherwise indicate . All clinical laboratory data require eligibility subject must available subject 's medical research record . All subject must EITHER clinical diagnosis NF1 use NIH Consensus Conference criterion OR constitutional NF1 mutation document CLIA/CAP certify lab . Subjects must plexiform neurofibroma ( ) progressive OR cause significant morbidity , ( limit ) head neck lesion compromise airway great vessel , brachial lumbar plexus lesion cause nerve compression loss function , lesion cause major deformity ( e.g. , orbital lesion ) significantly disfigure lesion extremity cause limb hypertrophy loss function , painful lesion . Subjects paraspinal plexiform neurofibroma eligible trial . Histologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical radiographic finding For subject enrol tumor progression , progression define : Presence new plexiform neurofibroma MRI CT ( document comparison prior MRI CT ) , OR A measurable increase plexiform neurofibroma size ( ≥ 20 % increase volume , ≥ 13 % increase product two long perpendicular diameter , ≥ 6 % increase long diameter ) document comparison two scan ( MRI CT ) approximately one year less prior evaluation study .
