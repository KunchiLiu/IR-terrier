	<brief_title>TMT Fusion Plate vs. Two Crossed Screws</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tarsometatarsal joint arthrodesis common procedure perform use various device screw , plate . The Tarsometatarsal Fusion Plate `` DePuySynthes '' new device design encourage bony fusion 1st TMT joint , expect lead earlier fusion compare current standard care use 2 crossed screw . This expect , turn , result early reduction pain earlier return full activity . At time insufficient data directly compare outcome follow surgery patient treat screws plate , study protocol produce high level evidence therefore necessary . The main aim study compare patient-reported outcome follow surgery patient undergo joint arthrodesis use TMT Fusion plate versus screw . It expect surgery improve patient-reported outcome similarly treatment group long-term , improvement occur earlier plate group . For study patient-reported outcome assess walking/standing pain domain score Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire ( MOXFQ ) . An early improvement two domain would consider valuable . The primary analysis therefore compare time minimal clinically relevant improvement two MOXFQ domain patient treat TMT fusion plate versus patient treat screw first 12 month follow surgery . An economic evaluation societal perspective determine incremental cost-effectiveness TMT fusion plate versus 2 crossed screw technique 1st TMT joint fusion . Therefore randomize controlled trial conduct , patient-reported outcome well clinical outcome parameter assess .</detailed_description>
