	<brief_summary>In project , investigator aim compare safety , efficacy , predictability outcome conventional CEIOL surgery Femtosecond-laser-assisted CEIOL ( FLACS ) effort improve cataract surgery outcomes . The investigator hypothesis FLACS may lead preservation endothelial cell compare conventional CE IOL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Femtosecond Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery Conventional Phacoemulsification Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include patient eligible undergo cataract surgery . All patient receive treatment FDA approve cataract surgery . Because study participant schedule elective cataract extraction regardless participation study , little additional surgical risk associate participation . A total 720 patient expect enrolled study period 2 year . The investigator recruit patient bilateral operable cataract . One eye undergo cataract surgery use conventional cataract extraction technique include phacoemulsification whereas second eye undergo FLACS . No significant increase risk patient expect either arm study compare routine cataract surgery . The patient examine per previous post-operative cataract surgery guideline POD1 , POW1 , POM1 , POM3 , POM6 , POY1 POY2 . The treatment difference take place time cataract surgery . Post-operatively , endothelial cell count obtain no-touch technology specular microscopy baseline well three month surgery . If study end prematurely , investigator anticipate significant change care patient .</detailed_description>
