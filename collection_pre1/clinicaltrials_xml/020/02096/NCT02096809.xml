	<brief_title>Stability Cochlear Baha BI300/BA400 Implant System Loaded From 1 Week Post-surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Implant stability Until recently , implant use Baha surgery exclusively standard Brånemark type titanium implant as-machined surface finish . The recommended procedure Baha implantation machine titanium implant use 12-week heal period load implant sound processor , order allow sufficient time implant become integrated bone . The Cochlear Baha BI300 Series implant design improve implant stability placement time , thus make possible reduce time sound processor fitting . The implant feature wider diameter compare previous generation Baha implant , small-sized thread cylindrical portion implant underneath flange , roughen implant surface due formation titanium oxide blast . Six-month data multi-centre clinical investigation compare new implant previous generation Baha implant use 6-week loading protocol , show significantly high Implant Stability Quotient ( ISQ ) value ( measure resonance frequency analysis ) new implant time point , reduction stability loading ( Dun et al. , 2011 ) . The data study suggest implant stability achieve 6 week implantation sufficient support sound processor . The data also suggest reduction time sound processor fitting may possible , provide favourable bone condition implant site provide satisfactory soft tissue status time load . Hence , clinical investigation implant load 21 day post-surgery initiated team Nijmegen , 6-month data investigation confirm safe attach sound processor 3 week ( Faber et al. , 2012 ) . Early result two study use load time 4 week ( McLarnon et al. , 2012 ) 2 week ( Green et al. , 2011 ) , respectively , also present show good outcome . All study perform patient good bone quality . Data prospective study 49 patient load 2 week post-surgery show initial dip stability show decrease stability period processor loading ( ongoing study , await publication ) . The stability implant study one week sufficient processor loading time . No study exist investigates effect stability processor load 1 week postoperatively . Implant stability measurement The method choice implant stability measurement use resonance frequency analysis ( RFA ) small magnetic rod attach abutment time measuring ( Osstell A/B , Gothenburg , Sweden ) . However , method return number ( Implant Stability Quotient , ISQ ) stability dependent length abutment attach implant . To knowledge exists clinical data correlate stability measurement make different abutment length . Soft tissue management For three decade , recommend procedure Baha implantation advocate hair free transplant measure 25 x 25 mm place direct periosteum . The purpose obtain immobile skin , hence reduce risk adverse skin reaction area . Since weak adherence abutment surround soft tissue anticipate , skin reduction perform , epidermal growth pocket formation may occur time , increase risk infection implant area . This surgical procedure , skin transplant , proven safe ; however , skin complication still occur account majority report complication Baha implant . The newly introduce Cochlear BA400 abutment cover hydroxyapatite area abutment touch skin subcutaneous tissue . The abutment approve surgery use less invasive surgical technique ( linear incision without subcutaneous tissue reduction ) ( www.cochlear.com ) . It show animal study hydroxyapatite coat favour soft tissue heal without pocket formation ( Larsson et al , 2012 ) . To knowledge exists study compare result BA400 insert use linear incision without subcutaneous tissue reduction abutment use technique . Objectives - To evaluate safety processor load Cochlear BI300/BA400 implant system 1 week implantation - To evaluate short term soft tissue heal long term skin reaction , new Cochlear BI300/BA400 implant system use linear incision without subcutaneous tissue reduction . - To produce reference data regard stability BI300/BA400 implant system . IMPLANT DEVICE The following Conformité Européenne ( CE ) mark implant pre-mounted abutment use ( MDD Class IIb medical device , manufacturer : Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions , Mölnlycke , Sweden ) : • Cochlear Baha BI300 4 mm Cochlear BA400 Abutment ( DermalockTM ) . Length abutment decide measure thickness skin specific tool . TREATMENT Surgery The implant place accord procedure one-stage surgery . The surgical procedure linear incision without removal subcutaneous tissue . The implant place outside linear incision . Only case longest available abutment ( 12mm ) deem short perform minimal soft tissue reduction subcutaneous fatty tissue . A 5 mm punch use punch hole abutment skin flap . All patient receive treatment , thus placebo control group use . The surgical technique one recommend manufacturer type implant hence study introduce new surgical technique modification hereof . The risk treatment : bleeding per- postoperatively , wound infection damage surround tissue include sensory nerve scalp loss implant . These risk well know risk know treatment study introduces new risk . Sound processor load Sound processor fit load perform 1 week implant surgery , discretion investigator . The decision load implant base assessment implant stability status soft tissue . Patients evaluate ready load 1 week surgery load soon heal sufficient . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS There know extra risk adverse effect new abutment compare previous abutment supply manufacturer implant . Preliminary result ( 7 ) show promising positive effect soft tissue heal implant stability . In conclusion , new abutment design potential adverse effect . All patient offer new abutment system . The surgical technique : linear incision without soft tissue reduction , recommend manufacturer use implant system . Stability measurement radio frequency analysis know side effect . The stability implant plan loading time ( 1 week ) show previous study well early generation implant load 6 week ( Dun et al. , 2011,8 ) . However , load implant 1 week post-surgery potential risk influence osseous integration implant cranial bone could lead loosen implant eventually loss implant . The patient control stability measurement 1 week load implant possible loosening implant take care . Loading implant 1 week post-surgery potential benefit patient form faster audiological rehabilitation few visit hospital . No specific recruitment patient make study . Patients refer hospital Baha-surgery evaluate accord inclusion criterion patient ( within inclusion period ) include offer part study group . Patients invited letter clinical examination prior operation . In letter patient request bring assessor deem necessary . If patient meet inclusion criterion , speak write information study give one investigator out-patient clinic . The examination information take place state-of-the-art examination room interruption give time discus relevant detail study question answer . The informed consent sign day surgery . There approximately three week write information expect informed consent question answer period contact investigator e-mail phone . If patient decides participate study still offer operation procedure , load time follow standard recommendation extra stability measurement perform . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION To detect difference ISQ baseline measurement point follow 4 ISQ point , study need 21 patient group , account drop-out ( comparison two mean , st.d.=4 group ( 5 ) , α=0,05 two-sided , power=90 % ) . To allow drop-out rate around 10 % , include 25 patient . The time estimate include number patient 3 month . With 25 patient able detect risk difference 0,41 Holgers ' index 0 1-4 two group ( comparison two proportion , α=0,05 two-sided , power=90 % ) . STATISTICS Results analyse basis descriptive inferential statistic . The following result report - Baseline characteristic - Implant stability visit , represent Line plot Mean ISQ ( 95 % confidence interval ) . - Difference mean ISQ intervention control group measurement point ( student t-test ) . - Average implant stability , assess mean area curve ISQ-measurements ( mean , confidence interval ) . - Effect implant loading implant stability , assess change Mean ISQ time load subsequent visit ( ) ( pair t-tests , confidence interval ) . - Soft tissue reaction ( Holgers ' Index ) measurement point ( Mantel-Haenszel statistic ) - Soft tissue overgrowth measurement point ( Mantel-Haenszel statistic ) - Presence pain measurement point ( Mantel-Haenszel statistic ) . - Presence numbness measurement point ( Mantel-Haenszel statistic ) . - Dichotomization Holgers ' scale perform categorize Holgers ' grade 0 1 `` No clinically significant tissue reaction '' Holgers ' grade 2-5 `` Clinically significant tissue reaction '' comparison make group Fischer exact test . - Implant loss , assess survival analysis ( ) .</detailed_description>
