	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose breast cancer surgery remove tumour . Where local excision mastectomy , tissue remove sent x-ray imaging ass abnormality remove give estimation distance lesion specimen edge . This allow surgeon decide whether remove tissue time . This study design compare whether accurate information lesion margin measurement obtain use 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging compare 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging type image currently use . This potential prevent patient require second operation remove tissue margin specimen still involve tumour . The study involve x-raying specimen condition arrives theatre . Only 2D image review time current practice . The 3D image review later measurement lesion specimen margin compare . The lesion margin measurement record pathologist take 'gold standard ' imaging measurement also compare . In theory , use 3D tomosynthesis allow accurate lesion margin measurement 3D provide good visualisation lesion edge remove effect superimpose tissue . The hypothesis state use 3 dimensional tomosynthesis image provide good lesion visualisation compare 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging thus allow accurate lesion margin measurement .</brief_summary>
