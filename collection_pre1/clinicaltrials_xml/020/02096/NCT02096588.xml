	<brief_summary>Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) , one drug commonly use treatment breast cancer , class medication call anthracyclines . Anthracyclines may cause heart damage lead weaken heart muscle . This heart damage may happen right away may occur many year anthracycline give . Simvastatin oral medication approve FDA low cholesterol . Simvastatin class medication call statin . Some research show statin may prevent heart damage cause anthracyclines like Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) . The purpose study determine take simvastatin receive chemotherapy Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) minimize damage heart . This study woman receive anthracycline doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) part breast cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
