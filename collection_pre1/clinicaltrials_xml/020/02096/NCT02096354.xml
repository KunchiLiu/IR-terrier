	<detailed_description>Purpose This two-stage study design compare safety activity RRx-001 regorafenib follow irinotecan-based therapy parallel comparative study . Patients suffer advanced metastatic ( mean disease spread ) colorectal cancer invite participate study . There two group patient ( Randomized , open label study ) , one receive RRx-001 one receive regorafenib . Qualifying patient randomly assign ( like flip coin ) 'interventional arm ' receive experimental drug , RRx-001 , 'control arm ' receive current standard-of-care , Regorafenib . Patients 66 % chance ( 2 3 ) receive RRx-001 33 % chance ( 1 3 ) receive regorafenib . On progression first part study , provide ECOG performance status adequate , clinically appropriate i.e . absolute relative contraindication opinion Investigator , subject enter second part study receive irinotecan plus bevacizumab . Whether patient give RRx-001 regorafenib , also receive best supportive care , include treatment help manage side effect symptoms cancer . This open label study , mean patient know treatment , RRx-001 regorafenib , assign . Background Oxygen vital life , need breathe , example , time give rise byproduct toxic call free radical . Free radical define `` oxidant '' . Similarly , substance interact neutralize free radical , thus prevent cause damage , call `` antioxidant '' . Examples recognizable antioxidant Vitamin E , Vitamin C beta-carotene . Antioxidants also know `` free radical scavenger . '' When free radical present excess antioxidant damage may occur . A free radical unstable molecule unpaired electron , electrically charge particle , seek another electron return state balance . An example free radical hydrogen peroxide , recognizable household product `` bubble '' 's poured wound . These bubble come oxygen free radical , toxic bacteria live cell , include cancer . The fact free radical toxic reactive are—imagine free radical high-speed ball bearing smash molecule order `` steal '' back electron end radical state , set chain reaction transform stable compound string reactive radical . As new free radical create chain reaction , randomly slam whatever molecule closest steal electron , corrode , like biological form rust . This process repeat , pick speed , antioxidant `` neutralize '' free radical put stop snowball effect . In way free radical bombardment damage bacteria also healthy tissue body , also capable destroy cancer cell . The current consensus compare normal tissue tumor cell may accumulate elevated level free radical , contribute development cancer . This potentially fatal weakness , form biological `` Kryptonite '' , use advantage since addition even small amount free radical may push tumor edge , past tipping point , tolerable threshold , break camel 's back . Similar expression `` live sword , die sword '' , free radical may lead development cancer also capable harm present excess . RRx-001 completely new type drug come U.S. aerospace rocket science industry . It activate deliver free radical tissue low level oxygen . Compared normal tissue , high level oxygen , , , tumor exist low-oxygen environment , perhaps prevent oxidation . In way free radical deliver RRx-001 cancer cell low oxygen condition able , theory , cause target destruction without harm normal cell . In general , colorectal tumor low level antioxidant , without antioxidant protection , tumor likely harm free radical , treatment like RRx-001 , able increase free radical tumor , may benefit patient colorectal cancer ; reason study RRx-001 colorectal cancer . So far , Phase 1 study , 25 men woman advance , incurable cancer receive RRx-001 different length time dose range 10 mg/m2 83 mg/m2 week . Regorafenib drug approve FDA treat colon cancer previous chemotherapy longer effective . It belong class target drug know tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Tyrosine kinases , play key role many cell function include cell growth division , commonly mutate changed cancer cell , become super-active produce cell uncontrolled growth , , therefore , block drug like regorafenib may keep cancer cell grow .</detailed_description>
