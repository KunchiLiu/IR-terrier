	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate mechanistic process involve protein-induced satiety/satiation weight loss human . Thsi study investigate : - How high-protein weight loss ( HPWL ) diet rich meat soya base protein source impact profile 'motivation eat ' within day day ? - Do biomarkers satiety alter differentially meat soya HPWL diet , measure monitoring alteration plasma amino acid gut-related hormone ? - How vegetarian meat-based weight loss diet impact nitrosamine excretion faecal sample , indicator faecal toxicity ? Previous work indicate high-protein ( 30 % protein ) weight loss diet satiate ( produce less hunger ) normal protein WL diet ( 15 % protein ) diet supplement amino acid . In previous work , mixed source protein use , mainly meat ( beef , chicken , fish ) . These type diet criticise potential negative side effect , include work gut health . It might alternative vegetable source protein could fulfil diet remit , satiate yet still allow weight loss , maintain healthy gut . Design -within subject , randomise cross-over design day 3 . Each subject act control receive treatment . 18-20 subject participate . Length time - Conduct two nutritional intervention period 14 day , order reduce effect due acute change nutritional intake . PROTOCOL Days 1- 3 - Normal Protein Maintenance diet ( NP- MTD , 3 day ) 1. st ARM Days 4-17 - randomise High Protein-Weight loss-Meat ( HP-Soya,14 day ) , 2. nd ARM Days 18-31 - randomise High Protein-Weight loss-Soya ( HP-meat,14 day ) ,</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From literature know : - Within-day experiment feed myco-protein ( quorn ) versus chicken lunch result 18 % reduction even meal ad libitum intake follow quorn meal ( Burley , P. Blundell , 1993 , Eur J Clin Nutr , 409-18 ) . - Feeding casein , soy , pea , wheat gluten , egg albumin , gelatin part mixed meal influence post-lunch satiety ( Lang et al.,1998 , Am J Clin Nutr. , 1197-204 ) . - Varying protein source ( soy , caseine , gelatin ) breakfast meal 1.8 3.6MJ/meal impact 24 hour energy macronutrient intake ( Lang et al. , 1999 , Eur J Clin Nutr , 959-65 ) . - Comparison mycoprotein tofu chicken preload lunch indicate vegetarian source associate low food intake lunch ( Williamson et al. , 2006 , Appetite , 41-8 ) . - Addition 25g protein liquid format ( whey soy ) lead suppression food intake ( pizza meal ) 1 hour later , comparison water whey preload . It note study , ( ) conduct short time period ( within day ) , ( ii ) none high-protein weight loss diet ( low calorie , high protein ) , ( iii ) none compare mixed meat versus vegetable source . It interest scientific public health point view whether meat vegetarian source protein similarly impact motivation eat . The diet study : - The maintenance diet ( MTD ) ( day 1 - 3 ) consist 15 % protein , 30 % fat 55 % carbohydrate feed 1.5 x RMR ( rest metabolic rate ) - The high protein ( HP ) weight loss diet feed 100 % rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) 5 day rotation menu , feed three meal day , 30 % protein , 30 % fat 40 % carbohydrate ; meat version base chicken beef meat ; soya version base soya protein soya-tvp ( textured vegetable protein ) . Soya protein widely available milk ( ALPRO ) , margarine ( PURE ) , enhance bread ( BURGEN ) , sausage ( GRANOSE ) , bacon ( GRANOSE ) , burger ( GRANOSE ) , mince ( GRANOSE ) , powered isolate , cheese , cream ( SOYA DREAM ) , yoghurt ( ALPRO ) , chicken-style fillet ( GRASSINGTONS ) .</detailed_description>
