	<brief_summary>Purpose : To evaluate pharmacokinetics , bioavailability hemodynamic efficacy ambrisentan Fontan surgical palliation single ventricle heart defect . Study activity population group : Children undergo Fontan surgical palliation single ventricle defect eligible study . Up 20 subject enrol ( 16 ambrisentan , 4 placebo ) receive 3 day ( 3 dos ) ambrisentan start post-operative day # 1 upon return operating room . Ambrisentan plasma level obtain specify time point treatment . Post-operative monitoring line use measure effect ambrisentan hemodynamics pulmonary / systemic endothelial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Purpose Study The purpose study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) ambrisentan child single ventricle heart defect undergoing Fontan ( stage III ) surgical palliation . This double blind , placebo control study . The primary objective Phase I/II study ass plasma PK , safety PD oral ambrisentan child surgically palliate single ventricle heart defect . A secondary objective ass whether ambrisentan improves post-operative outcome include amount duration chest tube drainage hospital length stay . B . Background Significance Complex congenital heart defect associate underdevelopment ventricle account ~8 % congenital heart disease birth incidence 4-8/10000 live birth . These single ventricle lesion associate high morbidity 5 year mortality rate approach 50 % . Staged surgical palliation directs return venous blood flow directly lungs pulmonary blood flow occur without aid pump chamber . The final stage surgery ( stage III - Fontan procedure ) incorporate inferior caval blood flow directly pulmonary artery . Consequently pulmonary blood flow cardiac output directly relate pulmonary vascular resistance ventricular function . The limitation single ventricle surgical palliation often result prolonged post-operative course pleural effusion particular concern . There also continue long term attrition . Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance impair systemic ventricular function important risk factor early late failure single ventricle palliation . Ambrisentan endothelin receptor antagonist improve pulmonary possibly systemic endothelial function . Ambrisentan approve treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension adult use off-label treatment pulmonary hypertension childen . Children single ventricle heart defect demonstrate pulmonary systemic endothelial dysfunction may benefit treatment drug . However pharmacokinetics hemodynamic efficacy ambrisentan study single ventricle patient . The widely use alternative agent , sildenafil , recently associate increased mortality child . There Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) safety warn use sildenafil child . The investigator previously demonstrate hemodynamic benefit use sildenafil patient ambrisentan potentially safer agent . Therefore study would fill unmet need guide dose evaluate efficacy ambrisentan vulnerable population . C. Design Procedures This single-center , randomize , blind PK study ambrisentan child age ≥ 24 month ≤120 month single ventricle anatomy . There 20 subject enrol ; 16 receive ambrisentan 4 receive placebo . A small placebo control group warrant ensure treatment effect result post-operative improvement . Patients enrol time routinely schedule Fontan surgery . Initial Dose : Oral ambrisentan 2.5 - 5 mg , single dose , daily ( nasogastric gastrostomy tube administration consider nasogastric gastrostomy tube already place part routine post-operative care ) .Subjects randomized Investigational Drug Services ( IDS ) placebo ( n=4 ) oral ambrisentan ( n=16 ) use permute block . Subjects receive either oral suspension ( 2.5 5mg ) 5mg tablet depend ability swallow tablet . To begin ensure safety , initial 5 subject enrol study ( least 4 active drug ) receive dose 2.5mg liquid suspension prepare IDS . After enrollment subject investigator perform preliminary PK/safety analysis evaluate ambrisentan exposure . If drug well tolerate ( grade III great adverse event ) exposure less target exposure 500-800ng/mL , investigator may increase dose 5mg/dL provided via tablet able take tablet suspension others . If drug exposure le 100ng/mL investigator enroll additional study subject ensure least 16 study subject achieve adequate drug exposure . If drug exposure target range investigator continue enroll study subject receive 2.5mg suspension . The total study duration expect approximately 24 month enrollment 20 subject . Study participant remain study 1 month discharge follow stage III surgery intervention 6 month - whichever short . The subject receive routine care , immediately surgery hospital discharge . The investigator record in-hospital adverse event tabulate organ system . One month last study drug administration ( dose # 3 ) , investigator contact patient phone evaluate person remain hospitalized . Plasma PK evaluate use limited sample scheme . A preliminary safety PK analysis perform 5 subject enrol . Ambrisentan PK evaluate dose may adjust achieve level consistent report adult pediatric literature . D. Study Interventions : Baseline/Pre-Dose Assessment After parent legally authorize representative sign Internal Review Board ( IRB ) - approve informed consent form , determine patient satisfies inclusion exclusion criterion , follow evaluation perform recorded case report form ( CRF ) : 1 . Baseline demographic , medical history medical baseline condition . 2 . Physical examination . 3 . Preoperative laboratory assessment ( obtain part usual clinical care pre-operative assessment : 1 . Hematology : hematocrit , hemoglobin , white blood cell count differential , platelet count . 2 . Serum chemistry : creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , sodium , potassium , calcium . 3 . Liver function test : aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , conjugate bilirubin , serum albumin . Study Procedures 1 . Record start stop time ambrisentan administration concomitant drug . 2 . Hemodynamic evaluation perform prior initiation study drug 0-1,1-6,18-30 40-60hrs administration first ambrisentan dose ( blood sample collect central monitoring line remain timed routine lab collection ) 1 . Record Fontan , common atrial , systemic arterial pressure exist central line place part routine post-operative care . 2 . Collect study lab ( coincident schedule PK level - see ) : i. plasma sample biomarkers ( endothelin 1 [ ET1 ] , brain natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] ) . c. Record oxygen saturation routinely collect arterial venous blood gas . d. Perform study echocardiogram baseline one time point follow 72hours least 2 hour ambrisentan administration . 3 . PK blood sample ( 500 µL , 7 per patient ) pressure measurement obtain baseline 1-2 , 3-4 , 5-6 , 8-12 , 12-16 , 24 , 48-84 hour post-initial drug administration . 4 . Adverse event collect 1 month last study drug administration . Results tabulate organ system . 5 . Physical examination perform within 24 hour administration study drug daily study enrollment . 6 . Record AEs SAEs . 7 . Record concomitant medication administer 24 hour administration study drug . 8 . Up 4 scavenge sample obtain clinical laboratory sample collect 24 hour follow ambrisentan administration . Scavenged sample leave heparinized plasma sample child collect clinical laboratory prior discard . PK Sampling A limited PK sample scheme employed 3500 μl ( 7 sample , 500 μl per sample ) blood obtain . Hospitalization Procedures 1 . Any following clinical laboratory perform standard care study record . The investigator use laboratory value closest study dose multiple test . 1 . Hematology : hematocrit , hemoglobin , white blood cell count differential , platelet count 2 . Serum chemistry : creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , sodium , potassium , calcium 3 . Liver function test : aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , conjugate bilirubin 2 . Physical examination perform daily post-operative hospitalization . 3 . Record Adverse Events ( AEs ) 24 hour last dose study drug 4 . Record Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) 1 month last dose study drug 5 . Record duration mechanical ventilation 6 . Record hospital length stay 7 . Record intensive care unit length stay 8 . Record duration volume chest tube drainage</detailed_description>
