	<brief_title>A Study Regorafenib Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , single stage Phase II study design evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic pancreatic cancer fail least one prior line therapy treatment gemcitabine . This study open Levine Cancer Institute ( LCI ) . A total 32 patient enrol two year . Following informed consent eligibility check , patient start oral regorafenib therapy ( 120 mg daily 3 week / 1 week ; 28 day cycle ) built-in dose escalation 160mg first cycle tolerate , continue therapy progression patient withdrawal . Patients undergo radiological stag first two cycle regorafenib therapy . Patients progressive disease remove study . Patients least stable disease continue regorafenib therapy , Investigator 's discretion , radiologically restaged bimonthly .</detailed_description>
