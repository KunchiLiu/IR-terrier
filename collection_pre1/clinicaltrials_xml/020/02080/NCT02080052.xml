	<brief_summary>Prostate biopsy commonly perform freehanded transrectal ultrasound guidance ( TRUS ) . Due manual approach limitation ultrasound imager , procedure high false-negative rate . This represent daily problem urologists manage disease , create uncertainty emotional stress patient , initiate cascade repeat test biopsy also burden investigator healthcare system . The investigator believe prostate biopsy improve use new biopsy paradigm . The investigator plan perform MRI-guided prostate biopsy robot-assistance orient needle-guide biopsy take . The combination MRI robotic precision expect improve prostate biopsy sensitivity compare regular TRUS biopsy . The study Pilot clinical trial 5 patient primarily assess feasibility safety . The needle-guide robot investigational device develop Urology Robotics Laboratory .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While prostate cancer common non-dermatologic malignancy among men US , frequently indolent may require radical therapy , i.e . radical prostatectomy external beam radiotherapy . There increased interest conservative approach low risk disease , include active surveillance focal therapy . Both approach require accurate mapping prostate allow reproducible access diseased portion gland , biopsy treatment purpose . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) increasingly utilized prostate cancer stag consider accurate technique available image prostate cancer . Furthermore increase concern use freehand transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) needle biopsying term reproducibility accuracy map disease . With systematic TRUS-guided biopsy sensitivity test low ( 33 % -44 % ) yield high false-negative rate ( 23 % ) [ 1 , 2 ] . The investigator hypothesize integration novel robotic device assist MRI-guided prostate biopsy feasible , safe , accurate . This represent first clinical trial robotic assistance MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy . The device consist robotic needle-guide instrument develop investigator Urology Robotics Laboratory . The robot orient needle-guide target base MRI . The physician verifies alignment manually take biopsy , usual . Pre-clinical test show robot operate precisely safely MRI scanner deteriorate imaging quality .</detailed_description>
