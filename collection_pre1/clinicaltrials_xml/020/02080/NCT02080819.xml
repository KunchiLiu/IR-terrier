	<brief_title>Striatal Effective Connectivity Predict Treatment Response Cocaine Misuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project use stochastic DCM , recent DCM extension take account hidden fluctuation neuronal vascular response , thus especially suit investigating effect disease drug . In addition , project use nonlinear DCM , DCM extension measure gate effect striatum cortico-cortical pathway . The overall aim project : ( 1 ) To conduct functional magnetic resonance imaging-based DCM study work memory impulsivity order determine effective ( directional ) connectivity PFC striatum treatment-seeking Cocaine Dependent ( CD ) subject compare non-drug use control . We hypothesize DLPFC causally affect ventral striatum CDs , strength connection low CDs compare control . ( 2 ) To determine whether pretreatment gate effect dorsal striatum , reflection pretreatment hypodopaminergic state associate chronic compulsive drug use , predict treatment response dopaminergic pharmacotherapy CDs . We hypothesize low pretreatment gate dorsal striatum prefrontal-parietal effective connectivity predict great 8-week improvement treatment CDs DA enhance medication ( combine cognitive behavioral therapy [ CBT ] ) , treatment placebo ( combine CBT ) .</detailed_description>
