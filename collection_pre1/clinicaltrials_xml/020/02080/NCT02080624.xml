	<brief_summary>Sturge-Weber syndrome ( SWS ) rare congenital neuro-cutaneous disorder consider rare orphan disease . SWS characterize capillary vascular malformation ( CM ) localize skin face , eyes central nervous system . Given localization extent CM , child SWS particularly prone develop severe psychological problem . The standard treatment CM pulse dye laser ( PDL ) although case whiten lesion rarely achieve . Combining topical rapamycin , specific inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin , PDL hypothesise good therapeutic option patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Topical Rapamycin Associated With Pulsed Dye Laser Patients With Sturge-Weber Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients SWS treat 2 session PDL lateral part CM separate interval 6 week 1 % topical rapamycin placebo superior inferior half , apply day 12 week . The clinical response analyze use morphologic chromatographic computerise system spectrometry . Histological response evaluate also . For purpose , make 4 biopsy , one quadrant ( quadrant treat PDL placebo , quadrant treat PDL rapamycin , quadrant treat rapamycin quadrant treat placebo )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : All patient must diagnostic criterion SturgeWeber syndrome . Age : patient must great 16 year less equal 21 year age time study entry . Capillary malformation : patient must CM face . Investigational drug : Patients must receive investigational drug within 3 month . Females reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method time receive study drug 3 month thereafter . Abstinence acceptable method birth control . Women childbearing potential give pregnancy test prior administration rapamycin must negative pregnancy test . Intellectual capacity understand information give able comply protocol safety monitoring requirement study opinion investigator . Signed informed consent/assent . Patients diagnosis SturgeWeber syndrome without facial CM . Patients another cutaneous disease CM area . Patients apply another topical cream CM area . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent . Patients endocrine deficiency allow receive physiologic stress dose steroid necessary . Patients : major surgery significant traumatic injury within 2 week start study drug ; recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia exclude procedure insertion central venous access ) , may require major surgery course study . Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV . unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease . severely impaired lung function . uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose great 1.5 upper limit normal . active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection . liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , severe infection , severe malnutrition , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) . A known history HIV seropositivity know immunodeficiency . Women pregnant breast feeding . Patients receive prior treatment inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin . History noncompliance medical regimen . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol , opinion investigator , may able comply safety monitoring requirement study .</criteria>
