	<detailed_description>Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) gammaherpesviruses associated variety human cancer , include subset lymphoma , carcinoma , sarcoma . In tumor virus typically exist latent state . In latently infect cell , vast majority viral gene express little production infectious virion . The virus replicate tandem cell division use cellular machinery . This highly restricted pattern gene expression allow virus evade immune recognition clearance . Currently , treatment approach virally-associated malignancy different treatment approach tumor viral association . Yet , presence virus within tumor offer opportunity develop virus-specific , targeted therapy disease . Such therapy might effective also less toxic . EBV- KSHV-associated cancer common patient HIV , congenital immunodeficiency , immunosuppression , transplant recipient . These patient particular would benefit targeted treatment approach malignancy , potentially spar toxicity cytotoxic chemotherapy already immunocompromised patient population . Activation lytic gene expression virally-infected tumor may enhance tumor-specific cell kill multiple mechanism . Importantly , cytotoxic effect antiviral nucleoside analogue , acyclovir cogeners , depend activity viral kinase express lytic replication . Because EBV ( + ) KSHV ( + ) tumor characterize latent viral infection , antiviral drug single agent active tumor . However , lytic gene expression could activate virally-associated tumor , could render EBV ( + ) KSHV ( + ) tumor cell susceptible kill antiviral nucleoside analogue . Nelfinavir ( NFV ) , FDA-approved protease inhibitor treatment HIV , show potent activator lytic gene expression EBV ( + ) KSHV ( + ) cancer cell line . Furthermore , NFV able activate lytic gene expression EBV KSHV drug level achievable human . There also grow evidence NFV antitumor activity . The goal study determine NFV activate lytic gene expression tumor cause tumor regression patient EBV ( + ) KSHV ( + ) cancer .</detailed_description>
