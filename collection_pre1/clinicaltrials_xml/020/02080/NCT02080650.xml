	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim determine whether circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) capture use novel cMET base ferrofluid . The primary objective pilot study describe number c-MET express cell detect c-MET CTC capture technique . These data separate disease site . The investigator also describe detection rate c-MET CTC capture EpCAM CTC capture technique patient , also separate disease site .</brief_summary>
