	<detailed_description>Ischemia/reperfusion injury occur graft harvesting , cold storage , surgical procedure liver transplantation . Ischemia/reperfusion injury liver graft result major organ damage include kidney , lung heart well graft dysfunction . Graft dysfunction renal injury liver transplantation major clinical issue associate prognosis low survival rate . The incidence acute kidney injury liver transplantation report 17 95 percent , definite treatment report yet . Therefore , important identify prevent reversible risk factor acute kidney injury liver transplantation . Previous study report several preoperative clinical risk factor , perioperative medication , metabolic variable ( albumin , glucose , uric acid ) , intraoperative colloid administration hemodynamic parameter evaluate . In addition , neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , report related systemic inflammation associate prognosis cardiac cancer patient , might relate development AKI LDLT . Therefore , attempt evaluate perioperative risk factor develop simplified clinical risk score model .</detailed_description>
