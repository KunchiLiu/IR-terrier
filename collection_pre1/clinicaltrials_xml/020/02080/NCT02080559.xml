	<brief_summary>This randomise , open-label , single-centre , descriptive study aim investigate gene expression ( i.e gene 'switched ' 'off ' ) follow vaccination 4CMenB relate vaccine reaction immune response . 160 healthy Caucasian infant age 8-12 week ( time first visit ) yet receive routine infant immunisation recruit . Participation study limit Caucasian infant ( define two Caucasian parent ) . This baseline variability gene expression data degree affect ethnicity reduce . Participants randomise either 'test ' group 'control ' group depend 4CMenB schedule receive , 80 infant . All participant receive usual paediatric immunisation accord UK national immunisation schedule . In addition , participant test group receive 4CMenB 2 , 4 12 month control group receive vaccine 5 , 7 13 month . Blood sample take infant specified time point vaccination address objective study . In addition , oro-pharyneal swab obtain around different vaccination timepoints investigate effect 4CMenB vaccination oro-pharyngeal Neisseria microbiome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Immune Response 4CMenB Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence meningococcal disease 0.2-14 per 100,000 industrialized country . In England Wales , period 2005-2010 , 900-1300 case annually . Disease common infant , young child adolescent case fatality high 8-10 % . Until recently license vaccine serogroup B meningococcal disease , although vaccine epidemic strain MenB use several country . Unfortunately , 4CMenB associate significant reactogenicity . This presumably relate presence various bacterial surface component present outer membrane vessicles ( OMVs ) , include lipopolysacchride ( LPS ) , capable activate innate immune response . The host pathways responsible reactogenicity OMV vaccine , indeed vaccine , yet establish , relationship reactogenicity immunogenicity clear . This study provide information pathway mechanisms immunity may identify gene expression signal use future vaccine design evaluation .</detailed_description>
