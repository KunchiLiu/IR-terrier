	<brief_summary>The present study aim compare relative therapeutic efficacy prism adaptation therapy combine real versus sham tDCS . The investigator test hypothesis magnitude duration neglect improvement increase prism therapy combine real tDCS compare sham tDCS . A second objective test whether individual difference baseline clinical brain imaging measure predict : 1 ) neglect severity 2 ) inter-individual difference patient ' therapeutic response . A third goal use brain image characterize pattern neural change induce intervention identify brain structure mediate therapeutic response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>'Neglect ' common neurological syndrome affect approximately 50 % right-hemisphere stroke patient . It complex multi-faceted syndrome , core defining feature patient lose capacity voluntarily control attention leave half space . Neglect significant debilitate effect patient ' functional independence everyday life indicate poor prognosis long-term functional recovery . To date , effective rehabilitation intervention available routine clinical use . One promising experimental strategy neglect rehabilitation prism adaptation , form motor training induces short-lived improvement variety cognitive domain . However , major limitation benefit transient . The investigator aim test hypothesis combine prism therapy transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , boost learning/memory process , result large longer-lasting therapeutic effect . The investigator conduct randomize controlled clinical trial test efficacy multi-session prism therapy combine real versus sham tDCS rehabilitation chronic post-stroke neglect . Baseline neuroimaging data use predictor variable explain inter-individual variation therapeutic response . Contrasts pre- post-intervention imaging data perform identify neural structure mediate therapeutic effect .</detailed_description>
