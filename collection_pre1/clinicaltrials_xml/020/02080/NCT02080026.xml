	<brief_title>Target Antigens Induced Plasmodium Falciparum Sporozoite Immunization Under Chemoprophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Malaria , disease cause parasite Plasmodium , one world 's major infectious disease . With approximately 627.000 death year , chief cause morbidity mortality well significant contribution ongoing poverty endemic country . Ultimately , key malaria control hopefully eradication , would effective vaccine . Though number vaccine-candidates enter pipeline pre-clinical clinical development , yet achieve level efficacy necessary effective malaria prevention . It show previously healthy human volunteer fully protect malaria infection homologous parasite immunization Plasmodium parasites take chloroquine chemoprophylaxis ( ChemoProphylaxis Sporozoites , CPS-immunization ) . The unprecedented efficacy CPS-immunization make unique model identify pre-erythrocytic target antigen development subunit vaccine . Identification antigens play significant role development sterile protection malaria provide basis development evaluation effective sub-unit candidate vaccine . Primary objective : • To delineate antibody repertoire direct pre-erythrocytic stage Plasmodium falciparum induce CPS-immunization . Secondary objective : - To assess functionality CPS-immunization induced antibody . - To determine T-cell antigen specificity CPS-immunized , protect volunteer . Exploratory objective : - To assess functionality CPS-immunization induce T-cells . - To explore adaptive innate immune response CPS-immunization early malaria infection . Study design : This single-centre , randomize open-label study . A total 15 volunteer divide two group , one schedule receive CPS immunization ( Group 1 , n=10 ) one receive chloroquine prior malaria challenge ( Group 2 , n=5 ) . Study population : The study population comprise male female healthy subject . A total 15 subject enrol participate study randomize . Intervention : In immunization group total four CPS immunization perform , 15 bite Plasmodium infect mosquito per immunization , period four month , volunteer take chloroquine prophylaxis . The control group take chloroquine prophylaxis period . All volunteer undergo Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( CHMI ) exposure 5 bite Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infect mosquito .</detailed_description>
