	<brief_summary>This study determine use theophylline patient NSCLC advance solid malignancy whether treatment theophylline help lower diminish side effect diarrhea patient take erlotinib . Patients enrol one two part study verify low dose theophylline effective high dose erlotinib tolerate theophylline . If study show theophylline able inhibit erlotinib induce diarrhea , help demonstrate patient use tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) , erlotinib , use effectively high dos without experience severe diarrhea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Dose Escalation Study Erlotinib Combination With Theophylline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , new , effective treatment cancer patient . TKIs class anticancer drug predominately use single agent . TKIs hop lack side effect cause severe enough diarrhea patient frequently stop treatment , even TKIs control cancer . TKIs inhibit nucleoside transporter ( NTs ) , perturb regulation adenosine level intestine . It possible reason inability use TKIs combination therapy additive effect NTs cause unacceptable diarrhea . It show TKIs potent NT inhibitor , therefore theoretically inhibit NTs intestinal epithelial cell cause accumulation extracellular adenosine result chloride secretory diarrhea . If hypothesis correct , profound implication oncology , since diarrhea one dose-limiting toxicity TKIs . It show co-incubating cell 8-phenyltheophylline ( 8PT ) , A2B adenosine receptor antagonist , block chloride secretion cause nitrobenzyl-mercaptopurine ribonucleoside ( NBMPR ) . Theophylline also methylxanthine commercially available licensed example 8PT . As already know erlotinib effective , use control factor first arm study increase second arm see maximally tolerate dose combination control dose theophylline .</detailed_description>
