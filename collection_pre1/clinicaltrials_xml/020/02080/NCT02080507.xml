	<brief_title>rTMS Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>rTMS alternative ECT Background Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) highly effective treatment severe depression ( UK ECT Review Group , 2003 ) . During past decade , transcranial magnetic stimulation emerge new anti-depressant treatment ( e.g . Berman et al , 2000 ) . Some randomized trial suggest repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) might effective ECT treatment non-psychotic depression ( Grunhaus et al , 2000 , 2003 ; Janicak et al , 2002 ; Rosa et , 2003 ; Pridmore et al , 2000 ; Pridmore , 2000 ) . Even 3 6 month follow , patient treat rTMS continue well treat ECT ( Dannon et al , 2002 ) . A recent review also support efficacy rTMS treatment resistant depression ( Lee et al , 2012 ) . However , review meta-analyses show moderate enthusiasm transcranial magnetic stimulation alternative ECT ( e.g . Martin et al , 2003 ; Schlaepfer et al , 2003 ) emphasize need study . Given small number side effect comparable efficacy ECT , would like continue investigate rTMS alternative ECT . The study aim compare efficacy sham vs. active rTMS patient meet standard criterion ECT . In addition , study also determine safety efficacy trial provide data power analysis support large clinical trial evidence clinically relevant treatment effect . Our sample population include 40 adult patient Emory University Outpatient Psychiatry Department Atlanta community . Potential subject may identify treat physician potential subject study obtain permission patient , physician refer patient research coordinator . Subjects enter 4-week fixed-treatment phase variable 2-week extension clinical improver ( define ) . Subject receive rTMS treatment accord FDA approve protocol treatment give five time week daily Monday Friday 10 pulses/sec , 120 % motor threshold , 3000 pulses/session 4 week . Patients meet remission criterion ( MADRS &lt; 7 one week , Riedel et al 2010 ) taper rTMS . Patients show sufficient improvement end fix 4-week period ( define &lt; 30 % drop baseline MADRS score ) discontinue . If patient improve sufficiently ( i.e. , &gt; 30 % reduction MADRS score ) meet remission criterion , treatment continue 2 additional week ( variable 2-week extension ) . In variable phase , MADRS assessment perform twice weekly improver , nonremitters , continue receive treatment variable 2-week period show progressive improvement , define least 2-point MADRS score reduction every rating . The acute trial terminate patient meet stable remission criterion . The rTMS taper 3-week period . Data Analysis Dichotomous outcome ( remission , response ( defined 50 % decrease baseline MADRS ) ) assess use logistic regression model ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina ) independent variable treatment ( active vs. sham ) , medication resistance use Antidepressant Treatment History Form ( ATHF ) ( low vs. high ) , current depressive episode duration ( log transform ) age ( continuous ) . The primary analysis conduct use intention-to-treat ( ITT ) population , define randomized patient start least 1 treatment session . All statistical test perform .05 significance level . Interactions consider significant .15 significance level . A primary purpose present study determine safety efficacy trial provide data power analysis support large clinical trial evidence clinically relevant treatment effect .</detailed_description>
