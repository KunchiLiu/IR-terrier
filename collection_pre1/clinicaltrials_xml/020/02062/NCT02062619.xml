	<brief_summary>Central alexia common reading disorder cause stroke . Patients central alexia ( CA ) slow read make frequent error , additional problem spoken language . This study 3 aim : 1 . Investigating neural network support reading patient CA Despite relatively common syndrome , functional brain imaging study CA . This project use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) understand brain region damage whether preserve part read network encourage therapy support read recovery . 2 . Testing new treatment CA The research team develop train software call 'iReadMore ' , use crossmodal approach ( write word pair spoken word ) train read . This therapy show effective patient similar form reading disorder call pure alexia . The iReadMore software adapt address reading deficit CA , research test whether significantly improve read ability . 3 . Using brain stimulation enhance behavioural training Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) brain stimulation technique show improve language performance healthy control stroke patient . This study test whether tDCS ( deliver simultaneously 'iReadMore ' therapy ) significantly enhance reading rehabilitation . Patients split two group : one receive 4 week block training plus real tDCS first , follow 4 week block training plus sham tDCSÍ¾ group receive two therapy block opposite order . Both group ultimately receive amount behavioural therapy tDCS stimulation . Comparing read improvement real sham tDCS block demonstrate whether tDCS enhances behavioural improvement read ability . Hypothesis : iReadMore reading therapy significantly improve single word read speed patient central alexia . tDCS brain stimulation significantly enhance effect iReadMore therapy , compare sham stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central alexia common acquire reading disorder usually cause stroke ( Leff &amp; Behrmann , 2008 ) . Patients also generalize language impairment ( aphasia ) , distinguish acquire read disorder pure alexia , read deficit occur isolation . Aphasia second common severe impairment cause stroke ( limb weakness first ) reading problem ( central alexia ) often associate . An analysis local database ( recruit patient ) show 212 patient aphasia 14 ( 66.5 % ) central alexia . The severity central alexia varies across patient even mild central alexia strong detrimental impact quality life , prevent patient return work , communicate via email , text post , simply read pleasure . Currently , standard treatment central alexia . Despite prevalence , patient receive sufficient reading therapy NHS . Only computer-based therapy test group level ( Katz &amp; Wertz , 1997 ; Cherney , 2010 ) one , beta version Oral Reading Language Aphasia ( Cherney ) , currently available commercially patient use . We aim test efficacy 'iReadMore ' , software design improve word reading speed use patient group . iReadMore cross-modal reading training method develop word reading therapy patient pure alexia previous study ( Woodhead et al , 2013 ) . iReadMore consist audio-visual pairing word . It design strengthen orthographic processing write word boot-strapping auditory percept associate higher-order representation ( lexical/semantic ) . Use 'iReadMore ' software lead significant improvement word read speed train word significantly decrease word length effect characteristic pure alexia ( Woodhead et al , 2013 ) . The mechanisms underlying behavioural improvement follow iReadMore train investigate use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , image modality optimize test connectivity-based hypothesis hundred millisecond temporal range . Dynamic Causal Modelling ( DCM ) analyse used test training-related change connectivity within read network comprise . Training strengthen connectivity left hemisphere , notably feedback leave inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) visual cortex , connection show involve early ( within 200ms ) healthy control read ( Woodhead et al , 2012 ) . This lead hypothesis feedback leave IFG drive read recovery , tDCS stimulation region , connection ventral dorsal temporal cortex , enhance behavioural training improvement patient central alexia . Although previous research focus pure alexia , recent pilot study provide promising evidence iReadMore may also beneficial patient central alexia . The result demonstrate iReadMore train tDCS produce large , statistically significant improvement around 600ms per word , 28 % reduction baseline level . This effect observe trained untrained item . Training continue two week sham tDCS significant improvement . A planned fourth tDCS time-point lose due patient illness . Although statistically significant , observed trend performance untrained item appear deteriorate time . This accord evidence tDCS may well role consolidation practice rather simple effect performance alone ( Reis et al , 2009 ) . Summary : Pilot data demonstrate cross-modal iReadMore training effective patient pure alexia ; effect support feedback leave IFG . This work lead prediction iReadMore may also effective treat prevalent understudied condition central alexia , target stimulation leave IFG tDCS may enhance train efficacy . This prediction already support preliminary case study , present study expand group study look effect mechanisms rehabilitation central alexia .</detailed_description>
