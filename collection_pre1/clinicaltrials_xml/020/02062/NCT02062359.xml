	<brief_summary>Background : The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient melanoma involves take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify , give cell back patient . In previous study , NCI Surgery Branch use anti-ESO-1 gene type virus ( retrovirus ) make tumor-fighting cell ( anti-ESO-1 cell ) . About half patient receive treatment experience shrink tumor . In study , use slightly different method produce anti-ESO-1 cell select specific cell type , hope , good make tumor shrink . Objectives : The purpose study see tumor fight cell ( genetically modify cell ) express receptor ESO-1 molecule surface cause melanoma tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : -Adults 18 old cancer ESO-1 molecule tumor surface Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient National Institutes Health ( NIH ) clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti ESO-1 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-ESO 1 cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting NY-ESO-1 Patients With NY-ESO-1 Expressing Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - A T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize NY-ESO-1 ( ESO ) tumor/testes antigen clone retrovirus use genetically modify human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) recognize human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2+ , ESO+ tumor - PBL express anti-ESO TCR administer aldesleukin without ALVAC vaccine 21 patient melanoma follow lymphodepleting chemotherapy Surgery Branch , result objective tumor regression ( complete partial regression ) ten patient ( 47 % ) . - In animal model use murine cell experiment human T cell vitro , T cell subset express lymphoid home differentiation marker cluster differentiation 62L ( CD62L ) , include na ( SqrRoot ) T cell ( TNaive ) , stem cell memory T cell ( TSCM ) , central memory T cell ( TCM ) , show superior attribute compare whole PBL CD62L- PBL adoptive cell therapy , include superior persistence follow transfer vivo . Objectives : Primary objective : - To determine whether administration anti-ESO TCR engineer CD62L+-derived lymphocyte plus high-dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen result objective regression rate ( partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) ) melanoma tumor . Secondary objective : - Determine persistence genetically engineer , adoptively transfer CD62L+ derive lymphocyte . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients : - Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A*0201 positive - 18 year age old - Have metastatic melanoma express ESO antigen Patients may : - Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis undergo positive selection CD62L use CliniMACS magnetic cell separation apparatus enrich less differentiated TNaive , TSCM , TCM subset . - The enriched CD62L+ lymphocytes culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth , transduce anti-ESO TCR . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - On day 0 patient receive anti-ESO TCR gene-transduced CD62L+ -derived lymphocytes begin high dose aldesleukin . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 6 week ( +/- 2 week ) follow administration cell product . - The primary objective efficacy . The study conduct use phase II optimal design ( Simon R , Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10 , 1989 ) order rule unacceptably low 40 % overall response rate ( p0=0.40 ) favor improve response rate 65 % ( p1=0.65 ) . This study initially enroll 11 evaluable patient , 0 5 11 response , patient accrue . If 6 first 11 patient response , accrual would continue total 20 patient enrol . If 11 response 20 patient ( 55 % ) , would sufficiently interest warrant study late trial . To allow small number inevaluable patient , accrual ceiling set 22 patient .</detailed_description>
