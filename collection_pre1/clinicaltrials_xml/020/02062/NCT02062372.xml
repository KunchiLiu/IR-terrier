	<brief_summary>Currently , patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) treat combination different therapeutic modality include resection , concurrent chemo- radiotherapy adjuvant temozolomide . However , survival still poor tumour recur within one two year within previously irradiate target volume . The radiation target volume encompass contrast-enhanced lesion T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , plus 1.5 - 2 cm isotropic margin order include microscopic speculated growth . These margin result high dose surround healthy appear brain tissue . Moreover , short progression-free survival indicate possible geographical miss . There clear need novel image technique order well determine degree tumour extent time treatment minimize dose healthy brain tissue . The development Ultra-High Field ( UHF ) MRI magnetic field strength 7 Tesla ( T ) provide increased ability detect , quantify monitor tumour activity determine post-treatment effect normal brain tissue result high resolution , great coverage short scan time compare 1.5 T 3 T image . Up , investigator examine use UHF MRI patient malignant brain tumour . These study show potential ass tumour microvasculature post-radiation effect microhaemorrhages . This study analyze accuracy 7T MRI identify gross tumour volume ( GTV ) patient untreated GBM compare biopsy result 7T image . These biopsy take suspected region GBM base 7T MRI appear 3T MRI . We hypothesize 7T MRI GTV accurately extensively identify compare 3T MRI .</brief_summary>
