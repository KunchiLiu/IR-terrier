	<brief_title>Doxepin Hydrochloride Treating Esophageal Pain Patients With Thoracic Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy Thorax With Without Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To provide baseline data regard effectiveness doxepin ( doxepin hydrochloride ) reduce esophagitis-related pain patient undergoing radiation therapy ( RT ) thorax , measure patient-reported questionnaire 5 minute , 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour 2 4 hour day 1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess adverse event profile doxepin swish swallow use patient-reported questionnaire 5 minute , 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour 2 4 hour use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) acute toxicity criterion , also domains unpleasant taste , burning/stinging discomfort , drowsiness . II . To evaluate effectiveness doxepin reduce esophagitis-related pain patient undergo RT thorax , measure patient-reported questionnaire 5 minute , 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour 2 4 hour day 1 3 ( include cross-over phase ) . III . To compare provide baseline data regard alternative analgesic use doxepin placebo arm . IV . To provide baseline data regard patient ' preference continue therapy doxepin placebo initial test dose cross-over phase , measure item 9 10 patient-reported questionnaire 4 hour administration study medication actual participation rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pain reduction adverse event profile optional continuation phase doxepin oral rinse therapy . ( Only apply patient optional continuation doxepin oral rinse first two phase ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution ( swish , gargle 30 second , slowly swallow ) day 1 . Patients crossover Arm II day 3 . GROUP II : Patients receive placebo oral solution ( swish , gargle 30 second , slowly swallow ) day 1 . Patients crossover Arm I day 3 . In arm , patient may continue receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution every 4 hour need radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
