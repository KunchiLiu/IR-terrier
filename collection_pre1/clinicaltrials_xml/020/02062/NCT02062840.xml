	<detailed_description>The Investigators observe open trial single session whole body hyperthermia ( WBH ) induce rapid antidepressant effect persist least week patient major depression ( MDD ) severe enough warrant inpatient hospitalization . In addition reduce depression , single session WBH induce prolonged reduction mean core body temperature , consistent basic science data group suggest hyperthermia activate skin-to-brain pathway target specific serotonergic nuclei raphe . In animal model , nuclei show important mood body temperature regultion . Consistent know anatomy preliminary study depress patient , reduction core body temperature highly correlated reduction depressive symptoms time period ( one week post WBH ) . Moreover , patient higher mean core body temperature prior treatment enhance antidepressant effect . Because increase body temperature outcome poor function skin-to-brain pathway activate WBH data suggest WBH may actually sensitize pathway way promote change brain functioning known promote emotional well-being . The result first open trial encourage u conduct large , rigorous placebo-controlled , double blind study WBH MDD , currently underway University Arizona Medical School . In addition assess effect depressive symptom comparison sham condition , study examines effect WBH body temperature , autonomic nervous system function , thermoregulatory cooling , immune , neuroendocrine monoamine function real-world daily social behavior . Missing assessment ongoing double-blind study measure impact WBH brain function . The current proposal address th gap investigative portfolio propose conduct second , randomized trial active vs. sham WBH examine impact WBH measure brain function know prior study important depression treatment . These measure include functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) analyse rest state brain connectivity well assessments concordance subgenual anterior cingulate cortex autonomic nervous system function assess electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Prior fMRI assessment structural MRI obtain . The investigator propose conduct fMRI/EKGtudy 30 student ( 15 males/15 female ) recruit PSYC150A1 Mass survey , allow University Arizona student opportunity serve research subject course credit . These potential participant age 18 30 self-reported depressive symptomatology least moderate severity , reflect Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) II score ≥ 14 . Participants medically healthy history bipolar I disorder , schizophrenia active substance dependence . Participants complete questionnaire one week prior , day , one week follow single administration either WBH sham WBH ( deliver 1-to-1 ratio ) . On morning prior receiving WBH sham WBH 24 hour later subject undergo fMRI/EKG assessment . This design allow u evaluate acute brain effect WBH evaluate relationship change acute short term ( i.e . one week post treatment ) improvement mood .</detailed_description>
