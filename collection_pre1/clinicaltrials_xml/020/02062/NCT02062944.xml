	<brief_summary>The significance clinical trial lie potential increase success immunosuppression ( IS ) therapy withdrawal liver transplant ( LT ) recipient , thus decrease negative impact IS long-term outcome . Lifetime immunosuppression ( IS ) standard agent , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) cyclosporine tacrolimus ( TAC ) , currently require clinically recommended dos trough level prevent allograft rejection . However , occur significant expense long-term CNI toxicity , i.e . chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , infection malignancy . With improvement early graft patient survival , long term adverse IS effect become increasingly important rapidly expand patient population . The strategy reduce long term CNI toxicity include dose minimization still leave patient CNI therapy , conversion non-CNI therapy , even complete IS withdrawal . The second approach , conversion non-CNI IS therapy , attractive potential stabilize improve renal function CNI toxicity . One non-nephrotoxic IS agent , mammalian target rapamycin inhibitor ( mTOR-I ) SRL , different mechanism IS action study show CNI SRL conversion stabilize renal dysfunction low risk rejection . Yet even possible benefit , patient SRL still subject lifetime IS therapy side effect cost , highlight need investigate strategy promote full IS withdrawal without rejection ( 3rd approach ) , also know 'operational tolerance ' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview The study propose prospective trial control SRL monotherapy minimization withdrawal 25 stable non-immune non-viremic LT recipient . Given sample size calculation ( see Statistical section ) , plan enroll 25 SRL monotherapy patient study ( Figure 1 ) . All patient consent undergo laboratory evaluation well enrollment liver biopsy blood test . If patient meet inclusion/exclusion ( I/E ) criterion ( see ) , SRL minimize 6 month week dose achieve . Repeat clinical immunological blood test perform , biochemical sign rejection , SRL discontinue blood test liver biopsy 12 month later similar biochemical , histological immunological measure . At concern rejection , liver biopsy assay equivalent biochemical , histological immunological measure perform rejection diagnose biopsy , second attempt withdrawal perform . Patients monitor standard care clinic visit every 6 month laboratory test every 2 week . The total study length 18 month : 6 month minimization phase 1 year follow-up withdrawal success/failure . The primary outcome proportion tolerant patient SRL therapy normal liver biochemistry graft histology 18 month . Secondary outcome include incidence , severity reversibility rejection , patient/graft survival , resolution SRL non-specific IS effect , assessment clinical/immunological biomarkers tolerance . All continuous/categorical clinical variable compare appropriate statistical analyses.The goal primary secondary aim provide valuable preliminary data elucidate mechanisms mTOR-I immunoregulation determine initial clinical success/feasibility mTOR-I approach ( vs. historical 20 % CNI withdrawal success see study Immune Tolerance Network [ ITN ] group ) . This guide submission Immune Tolerance Network large , adequately power prospective trial compare SRL vs. CNI withdrawal accompany biomarker predictor tolerance . If pilot study fail show correlation biomarkers success/failure SRL withdrawal , associate unacceptable low ( e.g . &lt; 20 % ) rate operational tolerance , would avoid necessity large , expensive trial support continue development alternative approach tolerance . Consent Initial Phase Enrollment ( see Study Protocol Figure- Appendix A ) These liver transplant candidate ( 25 SRL ) approach consideration inform consent study . The consent form include discussion risks/benefits current therapy ( SRL ) plan minimization/withdrawal . Specifically , risk minimization/withdrawal ( i.e . develop acute chronic rejection , alloimmune hepatitis portion study ) , although unlikely , major emphasis consent process . The consent form also include strict requirement patient follow instruction PI regard close laboratory follow-up occur throughout trial , diagnose episode rejection concern early possible able respond appropriately . All study procedure discuss patient clinic visit . They inform neither participation refusal influence clinical care . All laboratory test cost related care study , exception non-standard care item ( i.e . liver biopsy , blood assay ) , responsibility patient and/or his/her insurance company . They ask question afterwards verify comprehension sign consent form document agreement participate . A signed copy consent form give . Participation completely voluntary may discontinue participation study time without affect care participation study . No financial compensation give . Screening Evaluation Enrollment ( see Study Protocol Figure ) After long term ( &gt; 3 year post-LT , &gt; 3 month SRL monotherapy ) SRL monotherapy , inclusion/exclusion criterion review appropriate , consent obtain . If patient agree sign consent , baseline standard care screen laboratory complete blood count , comprehensive metabolic panel , sirolimus ( CBC , CMP , SRL trough level , fast lipid profile , hemoglobin A1C [ HbA1C ] , urine protein/creatinine ratio ) non-standard care biomarker assay ( blood immunophenotyping , proteogenomics ) liver biopsy ( histology graft immunohistochemistry ) perform dictate protocol . In addition , liver biopsy use determine stability graft function ( i.e . evidence rejection immune-mediated hepatitis ) consider minimization/withdrawal . SRL minimization/withdrawal perform clinically , biochemically histologically [ biopsy ; liver transplant pathology read ( Yang , Rao ) ] stable . Throughout entire study , liver function test monitor every 2 week ( monthly standard care , interim non-standard care 2 week blood test cover study fund ) . Patients enter minimization/withdrawal phase reduce total dose 50 % baseline dose every month patient 0.5 mg SRL daily . At point , every day dose begin x 1 month . If LFT abnormality , twice weekly dose x 1 month , week dose x 1 month . Prior complete discontinuation , repeat clinical ( screen lab ) blood biomarker assay ( blood immunophenotyping , proteogenomics ) perform . Liver biopsy perform juncture unless biochemical sign liver injury . If complete withdrawal deem safe ( evidence biochemical abnormality ) patient withdraw completely ( i.e . once/week SRL dose discontinue ) follow IS therapy one year . In time period , liver function test monitor every 2 week , usual , repeat clinical ( screen lab ) , liver biopsy blood ( blood immunophenotyping , proteogenomics ) assay perform end year concern rejection . Blood Tissue Samples Standard care laboratory ( CBC , CMP ) perform every month patient , LFTs perform interim 2 week month ( non-standard care ; cover study fund ) complete withdrawal . 3 green top 5 mL 3 red top 5 mL tube blood biomarker assay take patient prior study enrollment , prior complete withdrawal , one year withdrawal time suspect rejection . Liver biopsy ( one 3 cm biopsy- 2 cm histology 1 cm genomic assay ) perform baseline ( pre-minimization ) 1 year post withdrawal . A separate clinical inform consent obtain time liver biopsy perform . If patient develop elevation liver transaminases require liver biopsy stage study protocol , blood ( immune monitoring ( IM ) assay ) request patient time biopsy . If rejection occur , patient follow study completion withdrawn SRL liver biopsy end study Follow-up Laboratory follow-up describe above- every 2 week throughout trial complete withdrawal . Any biochemical ( clinical ) sign significant liver function test abnormality act immediately either liver biopsy pause IS withdrawal per investigator discretion . All patient see clinic every 3 month assess new sign symptom resolution drug side effect minimization withdrawal arm . Quality life questionnaire ; Post Liver Transplant Quality Life Instrument ( pLTQ ) Promis-29 profile v1.0 administer study onset successful vs. unsuccessful withdrawal ( end study ) Outcome Measures The primary outcome proportion patient SRL therapy normal liver biochemistry graft histology 12 month ( i.e . tolerant ) . Thus , incidence graft dysfunction ( acute rejection , immune mediate autoimmune hepatitis , chronic rejection ) non-tolerance assess SRL withdrawal group compare historical CNI group ( 20 % tolerant ; 80 % failure ) primary endpoint . This rate composite cumulative number biopsy-proven graft dysfunction require conversion back SRL additional IS therapy discontinuation minimization/withdrawal occur course study . Major secondary measure compare predictive capacity blood graft biomarker assay ( immunophenotyping , genomic/proteomics ) minimization/withdrawal success vs. failure group . Clinical secondary outcome compare : number infectious complication , liver biopsy complication , cardiovascular outcome ( i.e . blood pressure , diabetes control , lipid level ) , renal function , hematopoietic parameter , gastrointestinal effect , side effect SRL may may improve develop minimization/withdrawal . These document study database patient visit , electronic chart and/or phone communication . Finally , quality life ( Post Liver Transplant Quality Life Instrument ( pLTQ ) Promis-29 profile v1.0 ) analyze end study determine effect IS minimization/withdrawal health benefit .</detailed_description>
