Evidence suggest presence certain autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis systematic lupus erythematosus increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . However , evidence inconsistent autoimmune disorder systematic approach previously use study relationship range common autoimmune disorder specific form cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction , intracerebral subarachnoid haemorrhage , venous thrombosis .

	<detailed_description>The linkage Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) national registry acute coronary syndrome ( Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project , MINAP ) , Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) Office National Statistics ( ONS ) available CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) , offer opportunity investigate association autoimmune disorder initial presentation non-fatal fatal specific cardiovascular phenotype . The use systematic approach investigate whether range commonly diagnose autoimmune disorder independent risk factor several specific well defined arterial venous disease help improve investigator understand role autoimmune disorder development specific type CVD men woman different age group . It also provide useful information improve exist cardiovascular risk prediction method use clinical practice patient management .</detailed_description>
