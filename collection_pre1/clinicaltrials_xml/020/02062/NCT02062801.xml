	<brief_summary>The combined spinal epidural ( CSE ) technique become increasingly popular labor pain rapid onset superior first stage analgesia . However , increase risk early profound fetal bradycardia ( EPFB ) follow CSE continue concern . Various factor implicate etiology EPFB cause unknown . Ephedrine administration prior CSE analgesia may help reduce risk EPFB , date , nobody study impact single dose intravenous ( IV ) ephedrine give time CSE administration labor . The purpose study measure incidence EPFB combine spinal epidural analgesia use standard definition .

	<detailed_description>Background explanation rational : Epidural analgesia ( EA ) use provide labor pain relief 30 year . The technique refine past 20 year provide labor woman high quality pain relief , less leg weakness control administration pain relief . Since early 1990s combined spinal-epidural ( CSE ) technique become popular provide rapid onset pain relief ( 1 ) . The Principal Investigator perform large randomize blind study Sharp Mary Birch Hospital Women Newborns compare effectiveness CSE standard epidural technique describe incidence common side effect associate . These include itching , transient hypotension , motor block transient fetal heart rate ( FHR ) abnormalities . It find incidence profound FHR deceleration increase CSE group : 8.5 % vs 4.5 % standard epidural group , although poor neonatal outcome see either group . The question raise whether prophylactic ephedrine give concomitantly CSE insertion would reduce incidence FHR deceleration , thus reduce significant side effect associate otherwise superior pain relief modality labor patient . It uncertain cause fetal bradycardia CSE observe frequently high dose intraspinal opioids use ( 2 ) . Other potential cause include maternal hypotension associate rapid onset sympathectomy , uterine tetanic contraction associate sudden decrease circulate maternal catecholamine , rapid decent present part associate pelvic floor relaxation . This study design determine specific causal mechanism . Ephedrine remain one extensively studied vasopressor use treat hypotension obstetric population ( 3-5 ) . It direct indirect mechanism action , stimulate alpha- beta-receptors increase cardiac output , heart rate systolic diastolic blood pressure . In past animal laboratory data demonstrate ephedrine preserve uterine artery blood flow fetal pH much good degree pressor . However , today controversial whether neosynephrine good option treat hypotension associate spinal anesthesia cesarean delivery ( 6 ) . Nevertheless , ephedrine use decade treatment maternal hypotension fetal bradycardia associate use epidural analgesia labor woman . Many anesthesiologist use prophylactic ephedrine 10mg intravenously prevent anticipated fall maternal BP . As consequence risk nausea vomit associate hypotension reduce . It safe absence maternal heart disease hypertension . Ephedrine 10 mg intravenously use routinely labor unit stand order RN use maximum 30mg maternal systolic BP &lt; 90mm Hg . Occasionally , ephedrine 10mg intravenously use treat fetal bradycardia absence maternal hypotension . Kreiser et al . study 145 delivery epidural analgesia administer ( 7 ) . The patient randomly allocate administration epidural analgesia receive intravenous infusion 10 mg ephedrine , epidural induction , follow continuous infusion 60 minute 20 mg ephedrine ( study group ) receive ephedrine ( control group ) . The FHR tracing evaluate 20 minute 40 minute initiate epidural analgesia . Demographic data clinical delivery outcome assess compare 2 group . They find Injection ephedrine significantly reduce rate major FHR change appear 15-25 minute induction epidural analgesia study group compare control group ( 2/72 compare 11/73 , respectively ; P = .009 ) . To avoid 1 case adverse FHR change , 6.8 woman treat ephedrine . Maternal fetal characteristic outcome mode delivery similar 2 group . Mean arterial pressure significantly high study group time analgesia induction subsequent 25 minute . Maternal heart rate transiently reduce study group . Cleary-Goldman et al . evaluate 25mg prophylactic intramuscular ( IM ) ephedrine vs placebo similar setting ( 8 ) . It find IM ephedrine decrease incidence maternal hypotension late fetal heart rate deceleration one hour administration , increase incidence fetal tachycardia . However , FHR reactivity improve . Clinically , center investigator observe prophylactic ephedrine 10mg intravenously impact significantly fetal heart rate . Although investigator use drug prophylactically many year , feel useful prevent fetal bradycardia , placebo-controlled trial need prove advantage regard . Specific objective : The investigator propose study impact prophylactic intravenous ephedrine incidence early profound fetal bradycardia follow CSE analgesia healthy parturients . The investigator plan conduct randomized placebo-controlled blind study compare efficacy 10mg intravenous ephedrine versus equal volume normal saline administer immediately CSE placement . It show earlier study hospital incidence fetal bradycardia within 30 minute CSE 8.5 % . Profound early fetal bradycardia define drop fetal heart rate , within 30 minute induce CSE , &lt; 90 bpm &gt; 60 second . The investigator predict ephedrine reduce incidence fetal bradycardia within 30 minute CSE 8.5 % 4 % less . Methods : Trial design This prospective RCT use placebo control . The number subject study determined perform pre-study power analysis . All patient term parturients labor health problem obstetric complication Participants Inclusion criterion : Ability speak understand English ; term ( 37-42 week ' gestation ) ; cephalic presentation ; singleton pregnancy ; ASA 3 less ; pregnancy-induced hypertension ; chronic hypertension ; BMI &lt; 40 ; evidence pre-epidural fetal heart rate abnormality ; IUGR low AFI . ASA 1-3 woman request epidural analgesia Informed consent sign upon admission L &amp; D Exclusion criterion : ASA 4 woman , BMI &gt; 39 , Contraindication epidural analgesia , Twin pregnancy , Preterm labor , Severe preeclampsia , Decision perform CS prior epidural insertion , Unable read speak English , Unable unwilling sign IFC Interventions This study occur Sharp Mary Birch hospital . This triple-blind , prospective , randomize study healthy woman request labor epidural analgesia . Women approach nurse investigator triage upon admission labor delivery description study . They sign informed consent form prior randomization one two study group . An explanation give neither arm study experimental technique use routinely Sharp Mary Birch Hospital discretion attend anesthesiologist . The element study experimental random allocation one two group collection data statistical analysis . None drug use experimental test use normal clinical practice require study . Once woman sign IFC randomly assign receive either 10mg intravenous ephedrine versus equal volume normal saline administer immediately combine spinal epidural ( CSE ) placement . CSE induce sit position L3-4 L2-3 interspace strict asepsis . All patient receive 500ml intravenous preload lactate Ringers solution . CSE : epidural space locate , CSF obtain via 26g GM needle 3.125mg bupivacaine plus 5mcg fentanyl inject ( 2.5ml total volume ) . In group , patient-controlled infusion epidural bupivacaine 0.125 % 2mcg/ml fentanyl start immediately per usual hospital practice . Routine hemodynamic monitoring FHR monitoring institute per standard hospital protocol . The FHR strip analyze blinded nurse train interpretation strip . They compare FHR baseline 10 minute CSE 30 minute CSE . They also document instance EPFB FHR abnormalities 30 minute CSE . They use national standard definition FHR abnormality . Outcomes Data collect include incidence profound early fetal bradycardia previously define ; low high BP first 30 minute ; maximum FHR first 30 minute ; incidence tetanic uterine contraction ; total dose ephedrine use labor ; use nitroglycerin terbutaline treat tetanic uterine contraction . Demographic data collect research purpose include : patient age , height , weight , gravidity , parity , gestational age , cervical dilatation time epidural request ; induce spontaneous labor , use oxytocin augmentation , type delivery ( spontaneous vaginal , vacuum , forceps , cesarean ) incidence emergency cesarean delivery , neonatal weight Apgar score 1 5 minute . The primary outcome study effect prophylactic intravenous ephedrine incidence fetal bradycardia within 30 min CSE . The secondary outcome study include : Need urgent cesarean delivery within 30 min CSE , incidence tetanic uterine contraction ( tachysystole ) , impact parity induction incidence fetal bradycardia CSE .
