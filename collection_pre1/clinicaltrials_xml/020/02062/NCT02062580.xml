	<brief_summary>In sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , 300,000 baby HIV die year . HIV-infected child develop AIDS die faster SSA develop country . Bacille Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) vaccine give infant birth SSA protect severe form TB . BCG know cause immune cell active replicate faster . The immune system neonate also respond differently BCG vaccine infection . We hypothesize routine immunization neonate BCG contribute generalize immune activation HIV-exposed infant result skew immune response vaccine infection increase rate disease progression infants become HIV-infected . However , delay BCG HIV test complete would result operational difficulty , may induce appropriate immune response . Delayed BCG would also render many HIV-exposed uninfected infant high risk disseminate TB . We plan assess immune cell infant determine impact time BCG vaccination immune response tuberculosis ( TB ) vaccine . We also compare immune activation disease progression infants become HIV-infected BCG control arm . Our result provide key insight effect BCG vaccination immune response HIV well inform optimal timing BCG vaccination HIV-exposed infant .</brief_summary>
