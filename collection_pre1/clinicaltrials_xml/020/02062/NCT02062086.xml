	<brief_summary>Current method quantification muscle mass indirect , lack precision , often rely expensive equipment provide limited ( indirect ) data whole body muscle mass . Dual energy X ray absorptiometry emerge potential precise measure lean mass , easy use clinical practice research . However , ass indirect measurement total-body skeletal muscle mass clinical use determination change muscle mass may limit due instrumentation availability , particularly field study , cost . Moreover , method provide estimate fat free mass skeletal muscle specific , influenced change regional total body water content . GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) develop novel technique use deuterium label creatine dilution estimation muscle mass begin clinical evaluation muscle-measure healthy young old adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estimation Muscle Mass Older Adults Using Deuterated Creatine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mobility disability acute chronic setting like Frailty day Hospital rehabilitation unit make difficult assess muscle mass availability image technique . Often impossible assess muscle mass due accessibility cost actual technique . Deuterium label creatine ( contain capsule swallow ) easy procedure assess muscle mass could avoid exist difficulty use image technique . Capsules contain deuterium label creatine administer participant autonomously take . The subsequent assessment urinary deuterium dilution provide estimate skeletal muscle mass individual . Primary outcome : Assess muscle mass quantity old adult use method deuterium label creatine versus DXA ( Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ) total lean mass assessment .</detailed_description>
