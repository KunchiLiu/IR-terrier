	<brief_title>Ultrasonographic Guided Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture . Evaluation Two Novel Ultrasonographic Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objectives To validate Amlang 's ultrasound classification investigate whether treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture ( ATR ) guide : 1 . Amlang 's ultrasound classification ATR 2 . Barfod 's ultrasound measurement determine elongation Achilles tendon follow rupture Backgrund A large group patient end poor outcome treatment ATR . ATR frequent potentially debilitate injury typically affect young active adult ( 11 37 per 100,000 ) 1 2 3 . Consequently , great socioeconomic benefit optimize treatment shorten time recovery . There currently consensus regard best treatment ATR . Traditionally operative treatment consider superior , however recent study show non-operative treatment safe treatment lead good result 4 5 6 . For reason transition towards great use non-operative treatment see many orthopedic department 7 . Patients end poor result treatment ATR typically suffer rerupture tendon elongation tendon . There 5-10 percent risk rerupture 4 5 6 . It unknown many patient heal elongation Achilles tendon . Correct length Achilles tendon essential subsequent function tendon . In order shorten time recovery optimize treatment-outcome , desirable identify patient risk re-rupture elongation early possible early surgery might help patient . Amlang et al . developed ultrasonographic classification system use acute phase rupture 8 . The aim predict whether patient benefit operative non-operative treatment . The classification system appear well consider ; however , classification need validation correlate outcome . Barfod et al . develop method measure prolongation Achilles tendon acute phase follow rupture . The length measurement validate use healthy subject . Data analyze publication expect autumn 2013 . It test whether measurement work tear Achilles tendon whether correlation measurement outcome . With project investigator wish : 1 . Teste reproducibility Amlang 's ultrasound classification examine intra- inter-rater reliability . 2 . Investigate whether Amlang 's ultrasound classification able predict patient likely develop complication treat non-operatively . 3 . Investigate whether Barfod 's length measurement able predict patient likely develop complication treat non-operatively . Study Design Type study The study carry prospective cohort study . Time schedule The recruitment patient begin 1 November 2013 . It expect study complete 4-5 year ; recruitment expect span 2 year , provide average 6 patient include per month . Discontinuation Each patient choose withdraw trial time . A patient may also withdraw trial time base investigator ' discretion . Method Amlang 's ultrasound classification Barfod 's length measurement determine describe . For initial 30 patient Amlang 's ultrasound classification determine use two independent ultrasound-operators order test inter-observer consistency . Ultrasound - Set The patient prone position knee slightly flex ( 10 -20 degree ) . A triangular foam pad place ( anterior ) ankle joint , foot rest limply . By move pad ( cranial ) ( caudal ) angle relax ankle joint adjust 20 degree plantar flexion . The angle measure use goniometer ( longitudinal axis fibula 110 degree posterior part lateral border foot ) . The calf muscle relax . Amlang 's ultrasound classification Amlang 's ultrasound classification conduct determine cross-sectional area wide point tendon ( distal ) rupture ( area-widest ) narrow point rupture site ( area-smallest ) . The ratio `` area-smallest '' `` area-widest '' interpret measure magnitude overlap tendon end . A ratio 70 percent consider total adaption tendon end . A ratio 30 70 percent consider partial adaption tendon end . And ratio less 30 percent consider lack adaption tendon end . Barfod 's length measurement Barfod 's length measurement conduct use simple method require expensive equipment advance instrument . A needle place skin ultrasonographic probe . The shadow needle project internal structure skin surface distance calcaneus medial head gastrocnemius muscle measure . Study Design Type study The study carry prospective cohort study .

Statistics The group describe descriptively regard demographic parameter well primary secondary endpoint . The correlation Amlang 's ultrasound classification primary secondary endpoint examine use regression analysis . The correlation Barfod 's length measurement primary secondary endpoint examine way .
