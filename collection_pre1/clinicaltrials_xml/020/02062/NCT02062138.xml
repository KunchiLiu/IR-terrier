	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness new interventional approach early postoperative phase follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . It assume active training program effective improve physical function passive standard-of-care therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Passive Active ROM Exercises Following TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major objective rehabilitation TKA early regain range motion ( ROM ) mobilization patient . Continuous passive motion ( CPM ) frequently use part postoperative care regime follow TKA aim increase knee joint mobility improve postoperative recovery despite little conclusive scientific evidence . Conflicting research finding generate ongoing debate usage . As great loss function occurs first month follow TKA , surprise ROM therapy hospital stay still carry passively . A passive mobilization knee joint CPM encourage patient actively participate rehabilitation . Research effectiveness active ROM exercise added standard physiotherapy short in-hospital period lack far.The objective study compare passive clinical standard therapy ( CPM ) different active training program ( control active motion , CAM ) . It hypothesise CAM therapy effective improve physical function CPM therapy .</detailed_description>
