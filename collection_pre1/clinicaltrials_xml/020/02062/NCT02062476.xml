	<brief_summary>Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) able exert long lasting effect child atopic disorder . We show Nutramigen LGG accelerate tolerance acquisition infant cow 's milk allergy ( CMA ) . The mechanism effect still largely undefined . The effect LGG could relate least part immunoregulatory role play LGG . This probiotic balance generation cytokine possibly involve IgE- non-IgE-mediated CMA ( i.e. , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-10 , IFN-γ , TGF-beta , TNF-alfa ) , contribute modulation inﬂammatory process . We demonstrate child IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly high level IL-4 IL-13 response cow 's milk protein , tolerance associate marked reduction IL-13 production concomitant increase frequency IFN-γ releasing cell . Epigenetics study heritable ( potentially reversible ) change genome inherited one cell generation next alter gene expression involve change primary DNA sequence , highlight complexity inter-relationship genetics nutrition . There three distinct , closely interact , epigenetic mechanism ( histone acetylation , DNA methylation , non-coding microRNAs ) responsible modify expression critical gene associate physiologic pathologic process . The profile epigenetic modification associate Th lineage commitment , couple sensitivity early developmental period , lead speculation factor disrupt pathway may increase risk allergic disease . Specifically , effect DNA methylation endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitor act specific pathway ( Th1 T regulatory cell differentiation ) may favour Th2-associated allergic differentiation . MicroRNAs another structural component epigenetic mechanism post-transcriptional regulation messenger RNA translation . It recently identify specific Th2-associated miRNA ( miR-21 ) critical regulation Th cell polarization .</brief_summary>
