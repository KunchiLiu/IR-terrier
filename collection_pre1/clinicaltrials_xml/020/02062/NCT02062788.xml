	<brief_summary>Elective colectomy procedure typically require bowel preparation start 2 day prior surgery . Osmotic laxative Colyte® administer 2 day prior , Nothing mouth ( NPO ) require 1 day prior ensure fecal residue leave bowel . Though may ensure clean safer surgery , long period starvation increase insulin resistance may increase post-op complication . However , evidence administration oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) prior surgery reduces insulin resistance . Our purpose evaluate difference insulin resistance receive ORS 1 day prior surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) introduce early 2000s Kehlet et.al. , apply primarily patient receive colectomy . As knowledge understand concept continue grow , able change way treat pre- post- operative patient . In Europe , proven apply concept patient result decreased length post-operative hospital stay , post-op complication overall hospital cost . 2 . The change HOMA-IR shorter preoperative Nothing mouth ( NPO ) period ERAS patient 1 . HOMA-IR Index equation ( evaluation Insulin resistance ) = Insulin ( μU/ml ) X blood glucose ( mg/dl ) / 405 2 . HOMA-IR statistically proven lower patient receive ORS 2hr prior surgery . 3 . Reference - Increased insulin resistance induces hyperglycemia - Toxicity post-op hyperglycemia relation post-op complication - Insulin resistance increase procedures herniorrhaphy laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Administration preoperative carbohydrate decrease post-op nausea vomit - Conventional pre-op 8hr fasting increase insulin resistance influence increase glucose level 3 . Additional benefit shorter preoperative fast 1 . Relieve stress fast 2 . Help stabilize post-op triglyceride , cortisol , glucose level 3 . Reduce infectious complication</detailed_description>
