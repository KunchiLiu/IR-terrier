A major obstacle meaningful study epidemiology male infertility difficulty accurate diagnosis presence absence problem . Traditionally , diagnosis male infertility facilitate conventional assessment semen profile - construct accord recognize guideline ( i.e . WHO ) include pH , cell count motility - specific biomarkers available . We seek determine oxysterol fatty acid lipidome ai find lipid biomarker useful diagnosis male infertility .</brief_summary>
