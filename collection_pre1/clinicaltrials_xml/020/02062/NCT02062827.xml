	<brief_title>Genetically Engineered HSV-1 Phase 1 Study Treatment Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>M032 second-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus ( oHSV ) conditionally replication competent ; , similar G207 , first generation oHSV , replicate tumor cell , normal cell , thus kill tumor cell directly process . Replication M032 tumor kill infected tumor cell , cause tumor cell act factory produce new virus . These virus particle release tumor cell dy , proceed infect tumor cell vicinity , continue process tumor kill . In addition direct oncolytic activity , virus carry therapeutic payload -- act gene therapy vector , -- cause tumor cell synthesize secrete immunity-stimulating protein call Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) kill . This IL-12 release promotes immune response survive tumor cell , increase antitumor effect therapy . The IL-12 express also produce anti-angiogenic effect , interfere production new tumor blood vessel necessary allow tumor growth . Anti-angiogenic therapy potentially starve tumor necessary oxygen nutrient . Thus , M032 oHSV produce three different potential mechanism antitumor effect . The virus also genetically-engineered minimize production toxic effect patient receive therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic astrocytoma , gliosarcoma . Prior therapy : Patients must fail external beam radiotherapy &gt; 5,000 cGy ( centrigray ) brain , eligible tolerate , undergone appropriate treatment temozolomide chemotherapy . All radiation additional chemotherapy must complete least 4 week prior enrollment . Prior therapy nitrosoureas must complete least 6 week prior enrollment . Age ≥19 year ( age majority clinical trial Alabama ) . Because dose adverse event data currently available use M032 patient &lt; 19 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 1 singleagent trial . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70 % Life expectancy great 4 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes : &gt; 3,000/μl absolute neutrophil count : &gt; 1,500/μl platelet : &gt; 100,000/μl total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) ( aspartate aminotransferase ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ( alanine aminotransferase ) : &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance : &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Residual lesion must ≥1.0 cm diameter determine MRI . The effect M032 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry first six month receive M032 . Because currently unknown M032 transmit sexual contact , barrier method birth control must employ six ( 6 ) month follow administration study drug . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . For two week receive M032 , subject avoid intimate contact pregnant woman , infant young child individual decrease immunity ( ability fight infection ) . Subjects also refrain donate blood trial Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Females childbearing potential must pregnant ; confirm negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior start study treatment . Exclusion Criteria Patients chemotherapy , cytotoxic therapy , immunotherapy within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) , surgical resection within 4 week prior enter study , receive experimental viral therapy gene therapy time ( e.g. , adenovirus , retrovirus herpes virus protocol ) . However , preclude retreatment M032 later date . Patients recover adverse event due therapeutic intervention administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar biologic composition M032 IL12 . Tumor involvement would require ventricular , brainstem , basal ganglion , posterior fossa inoculation would require access ventricle order deliver treatment . Prior history encephalitis , multiple sclerosis , CNS infection . Required steroid increase within 2 week schedule M032 administration . Active oral herpes lesion . Concurrent therapy drug active HSV ( acyclovir , valacyclovir , penciclovir , famciclovir , gancyclovir , foscarnet , cidofovir ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , medical condition precludes surgery . Also , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Excluded patient group Pregnant woman exclude study M032 viral oncolytic therapy unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother M032 , breastfeed woman include study . Because patient immune deficiency unable mount anticipate immune response underlie therapeutic rationale , HIVseropositive patient exclude study . Other treatment study disease less dependent patient ' immune response appropriate HIVseropositive patient . Patients known history allergic reaction IV contrast material amenable pretreatment University Alabama Birmingham protocol . Patients pacemaker , ferromagnetic aneurysm clip , metal infusion pump , metal shrapnel fragment certain type stent . Receipt Gliadel Therapy . ( Receipt Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) therapy within 4 week schedule M032 administration . ( Receipt Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) great 4 week schedule M032 administration exclude patient . )</criteria>
