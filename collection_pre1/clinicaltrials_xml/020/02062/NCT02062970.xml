	<brief_summary>Septic shock clinical syndrome occur 10 20 % patient admit ICV . Mortality associate septic shock varies 30 50 % . It follow systemic response organism severe infection , associate circulatory failure marker arterial hypotension vascular hyperactivity vasoconstrictor agent . The mechanism involve one hand activation white blood cell inflammatory system vascular inflammatory system ; hand imbalance hemostatis characterize activation coagulation inappropriate fibrinolysis lead disruption microcirculation context disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIVC ) . This inflammatory thrombotic cellular activation strongly associate phenomenon vesiculation ; lead production cellular microparticles ( MP ) blood cell vascular cell . MP membranous vesicle , result reassortment membrane phospholides response activation cellular apoptosis . They initially describe new actor hemostatis . Indeed , expression phospholipid serine tissular factor ( TF ) confer procoagulating activity , increase patient undergo septic shock . The finding fibriniolytic activity cellular MP suggest existence compensate mechanism procoagulating activity . This confers MP key-role control coagulolytic balance . Our recent research suggest endothelial white blood cell MP produce vivo plasmin . They carry main circulation fibrinolytic activity partially beyond physiological inhibitor activity ( PAI-1 , x 2 antiplasmin ) . Preliminary finding show ability plasmin generation important patient affect septic shock . Our hypothesis increase plasmin generation MP compensate risk occurrence microthrombosis , modulate therefore vital prognosis patient septic shock . The coagulolytic balance MP , result procoagulating fibrinolytic activity could claim status new pronostic marker relevant patient septic shock .</brief_summary>
