State-of-the-art diagnostic test EOC include transvaginal ultrasonography serum cancer antigen ( CA-125 ) measurement ; specificity diagnostic tool however low , test effective enough detect EOC early enough improve clinical outcome . Definitive diagnosis EOC still rely histological cytological confirmation . These finding underline importance effective test early detection EOC . In current project obtain lavage uterine cavity .

	<detailed_description>Epithelial Ovarian cancer lead cause death among gynaecologic malignancy western civilized country , estimate prevalence Europe US 752,600 2007 59,828 death annually . Treatment survival patient depend primarily stage disease . Of EOC patient 25 % diagnose early stage tumour confine pelvis . In case five-year survival rate 80 % 90 % disease often cure combination surgery chemotherapy . Unfortunately , almost 75 % woman affect advanced stage disease metastatic spread throughout abdominal cavity retroperitoneal lymph node time diagnosis ; five-year survival rate drop 10 % -30 % advanced disease , despite maximum surgical effort combination chemotherapy . State-of-the-art diagnostic test EOC include transvaginal ultrasonography serum cancer antigen ( CA-125 ) measurement ; specificity diagnostic tool however low , test effective enough detect EOC early enough improve clinical outcome . Definitive diagnosis EOC still rely histological cytological confirmation . These finding underline importance effective test early detection EOC . In current project obtain lavage uterine cavity . It investigate whether cell EOCs genetic material cell detect lavage fluid . Aim study : There clear clinical need diagnosis test detect EOC earlier stage .</detailed_description>
