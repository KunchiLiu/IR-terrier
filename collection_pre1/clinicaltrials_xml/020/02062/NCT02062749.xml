	<detailed_description>Surgery Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , abdominal surgery perform try remove many tumor possible . The abdominal surgery perform specifically research study would perform even take part study . You give separate consent form sign explain detail risk surgery detail . During surgery , abdomen temporarily close . Then abdominal wash begin . During `` abdominal wash , '' heat oxaliplatin deliver plastic tubing connect pump abdomen . The pump push heat oxaliplatin abdomen pull recirculates oxaliplatin . The skin abdomen temporarily close abdominal wash . The surgeon also `` wash '' close area surgical site . A pump use pump heat oxaliplatin abdomen 90 minute surgeon gently press abdominal wall oxaliplatin reach area abdomen . After 90 minute , oxaliplatin remove abdomen `` wash '' saline fluid remove surgeon permanently close abdomen 3 layer stitch . Two ( 2 ) pea-sized tissue sample ( tumor normal abdominal tissue ) , 2 tablespoon blood send laboratory Dr. Scott Kopetz tissue evaluation extraction RNA ( genetic material ) . One ( 1 ) tumor sample remove procedure sample remove end procedure . The sample examine microscope DNA ( genetic material cell ) remove look change DNA . The result test share , use decision regard treatment . There chance surgeon may decide surgery abdominal wash perform , example disease spread attach certain organ . If occurs , doctor discus treatment option . Study Visits : On Day 1 surgery : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam . On Days 2-5 , 11 , 14 , 30 surgery : - Blood ( 1-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam . - On Day 30 , hear test . If doctor think need , also follow visit 3 6 month surgery . If visit occur MD Anderson , hear test , MRI , CT , PET-CT scan check status disease . The 3 6 month visit follow surgery may perform local doctor 's office and/or laboratory . Length Study : You remain study 6 month . You take study disease get bad . If study doctor learn disease come back gotten bad 6 month follow-up visit , may eligible re-perfusion , repeat surgery study drug administration . If eligible re-perfusion , participation study end give new consent form sign order re-enrolled back onto study . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment advance bladder cancer , metastatic testicular cancer , metastatic ovarian cancer , hepatoblastoma , neuroblastoma , metastatic appendiceal cancer , abdominal mesothelioma . The use heat oxaliplatin give intra-abdominally pediatric patient colon cancer investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
