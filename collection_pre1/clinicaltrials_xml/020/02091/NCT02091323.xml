	<brief_summary>The effect roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35kg/m2 clear . There large-scale patient T2DM Chinese population currently two-thirds lack adequate blood glucose control . Asian Chinese different type obesity , different style diet , relatively low BMI level well . We assess feasibility efficacy laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( LRYGB ) patient non-severely obese T2DM.Taking account difference body size diet United States &amp; Europe Asian country , diabetic situation special feature different region , especially Asia China . Asian Chinese high incidence T2DM relatively low BMI level . Evaluating benefit LRYGB T2DM Asian Chinese diabetes subject body mass index le 35kg/m2 look sufficient evidence operation become necessary.The patient follow one year surgery comparison would make two group . Clinical indicator reflect effect LRYGB monitor surgery 1 , 3,6,12 month surgery . Complete remission diabetes define hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) &lt; 6.0 % Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) &lt; 5.6mmol/L .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Non-severe Obesity With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) well know chronic metabolic disease . As main manifestation T2DM , disorder glucose metabolism due gradual dysfunction pancreatic islet significant insulin resistance result many problem complication associate T2DM hypertension , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lipid disorder complication . Currently , 346 million people suffer T2DM worldwide , among T2DM account 90 % . A report publish Chinese diabetes metabolic syndrome research group 2010 show overall prevalence diabetes 9.7 % age 20 total number diabetes mellitus reach 92.4 million Chinese population 's bad , 15.5 percent adult pre-diabetic state . Through traditional diet therapy , exercise , change lifestyle , standardize medical treatment certain effect diabetes complication , T2DM ca n't cure far . How cure diabetes mellitus improve quality life diabetic patient common problem face doctor country . In 1984 , Pories et al find glucose metabolism indicator significantly improve analyzed report three-year progress result obesity patient T2DM laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( LRYGB ) , thus open door surgical treatment diabetes . Now LRYGB often perform Europe United State , write diabetes treatment guideline American Diabetes Association 2009 . The surgical treatment diabetes extension surgical treatment morbid obesity . So diabetes treatment guideline 2014 show bariatric surgery may consider T2DM body mass index （BMI） &gt; 35 kg/m2 , especially diabetes associated comorbidities difficult control lifestyle pharmacological therapy . However , also mention small trial show benefit patient type 2 diabetes mellitus BMI 30-35 kg/m2 bariatric surgery . But still lack sufficient evidence patient BMI 30kg/m2 . A survey conduct Shanghai , China , show prevalence type 2 diabetes 9.8 % , prevalence obesity 4.3 % .But United States , incidence type 2 diabetes 10.9 % obesity population define BMI ≥30 kg/m2 may account one third total population 2009-2010 . In addition , patient Asian country mostly abdominal obesity compare patient United States Europe different type obesity . Taking account difference body size diet United States &amp; Europe Asian country , diabetic situation special feature different region , especially Asia China . Asian Chinese high incidence T2DM relatively low BMI level . Evaluating benefit LRYGB T2DM Asian Chinese diabetes subject body mass index le 35kg/m2 look sufficient evidence operation become necessary .</detailed_description>
