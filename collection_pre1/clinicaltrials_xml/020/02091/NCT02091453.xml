	<detailed_description>STUDY METHODS The primary objective study : 1 . In acute stage , evaluate effectiveness APT measure change performance attention measure , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test , ( PASAT ) evaluate Statistical Process Control 2 . In postacute stage , evaluate compare effect Attention process training ( APT ) vs. standard rehabilitation daily activity return work three month one year participate rehabilitation programme regard resource utilisation health economics . STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING The study conduct specialised rehabilitation clinic . Several in- outpatient unit two site involve . It randomise , control ( www.consort-statement.org/ ? o=1011 ) study open extension follow three six month one year . Due nature rehabilitation procedure , neither patient rehabilitation professional blind nature intervention , different professional conduct assessment train . The study design reflect normal clinical practice allow comparison two rehabilitation approach . Patients acute phase ( &lt; 4 month ) recruit in- outpatient unit . For , ready discharge inpatient ward , train continued outpatient setting . Subacute patient ( 4-12 month ) participate study part outpatient rehabilitation . The study approve regional ethic committee , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden . The participant comprise consecutive series patient mild moderate stroke traumatic brain injury . Inclusion criteria deficit attention define APT test , score low average reason skill abstract thinking , age range ; 18-60 year good understanding Swedish language . Exclusion criterion moderate severe aphasia , ongoing psychiatric illness , history severe somatic disorder cause anoxic period , ongoing substance abuse severe pain . Patients Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale score = &gt; 10 offer antidepressant treatment include study three week pharmacological treatment initiate . Further , exclusion also base severe memory disorder , neglect , visual field defect motor disability interfere participation . All patient participate comprehensive interdisciplinary brain injury rehabilitation programme . After baseline assessment , participant receive 20 hour attention training , least three day week , period 5-6 week . They randomly assign one two intervention programme : intensive area-specific cognitive training APT activity-based attention training provide occupational therapist . Evaluation treatment effect monitor pre post assessment repeat assessment primary outcome measure baseline , every third hour intervention post intervention patient acute stage . Subacute patient assess pre post measurement . The open-label extension study comprise client-centred standard interdisciplinary rehabilitation . Discharge base clinical decision participant return clinic follow-up assessment . The APT programme provide theoretically base , individualise , highly structure intervention organise assignment four attention level : sustain , selective , divide alternate attention . Progress base intensity training , continuous feedback promote motivation metacognitive training . The APT also include education acquire attention deficit train generalisation , enable transfer treatment task techniques self-selected cognitive problem everyday situation . Each session take 45-90 minute perform , work material APTs I II . Attention training activity include standard occupational training within interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme . The programme consist ) training use compensatory strategy attention-demanding activity daily live b ) perform independent work attention-demanding task individual level c ) training use computerised task , specifically design attention remediation ) group activity . Types training time devote specific training procedure individually register . Inclusion measure APT-test Matrix reasoning.Cut-off score 70 % less least two five subtests APT-test standard score seven Matrix Reasoning . Exclusion measure Barthel Activity Daily Living , ( ADL ) -index 50 less ; Alberts test/Line cross cut score ( &lt; =2 ) ; profile score seven less The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test . Primary outcome measure : For acute phase : The Paced Auditory Serial Addition test , ( PASAT ) presume measure work memory speed information processing sustain divided attention . Versions A C administer . For subacute phase primary outcome measurement Work Ability Index ( WAI ) . Secondary outcome measure functional , activity participation measure . Further measure attention Digit Span task , Block Span , Ruff 2 &amp; 7 Selective Attention Test , Letter-Number Sequencing task . For executive measure Trail Making Test , Color-Word Interference Test Tower Test use . The latter administer due learning effect , thus allow group comparison . The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) use evaluate different aspect memory function . Depression anxiety assess Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . Activity measure Cognitive Failure Questionnaire , Rating Scale Attentional Behavior Dysexecutive symptom questionnaire . Occupational Performance measure Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) . Participation work-return measure Work Ability Index , use assess self-rated work ability . The Assessment Work Performance use assess skill client various work-related problem work performance Work Ability Screening Questionnaire construct author include question education , current profession , work situation , current work ability , approach future work ability return work question . Adverse effect register field note standard hospital journal . Examples adverse effect : fatigue prevent participation APT training , negative effect APT treatment , consequence fatigue follow treatment , sudden emergence exclusion criterion , etc . To assess resource utilisation economic evaluation data work capacity/sick leave , 12 month ABI obtain Registry Swedish Social Insurance Agency . For data regard utilisation health service relate ABI medical physical intervention , participant contact phone 12 month injury . Resource utilisation define use health care social service associate ABI . Costs resource calculate societal perspective , i.e . cost within health-care system , transport , caregiver 's time sick leave . Patients ' caregiver ' lose productivity calculate base productivity data ABI . The sample size calculation primary endpoint base upon estimate 1 standard deviation ( SD ) improvement 20 hour attention train APT activity-based attention training . Setting alpha 0.05 , power 85 % , sample size 19 complete data set need detect statistically significant difference treatment arm . Assuming dropout rate 25 % require inclusion 25 patient . Sample size calculation secondary endpoint goal functional level base upon assumption clinically relevant change 1 SD Ruff 2 &amp; 7 test . For effect size , sample size 30 complete data set treatment arm , alpha 0,0050 , 2-tailed , yield power 0.888 . Sample size calculation activity level base upon assumption clinically relevant ( 2-point ) change COPM performance measure . For effect size , sample size 30 complete data set treatment arm , alpha 0,0050 , 2-tailed , yield power 0.988 . Thus maximum number patient enrol 120 . The primary outcome measure analyse use statistical process control ( SPC ) . Sigma Zone SPC , use explore statistical control limit variability improvement assume data plot appear within control limit indicate process stable statistical control variation due chance variation , day-to-day variability behaviour etc . Data present control chart , include three additional line ; centre line ( usually base mean ) upper ( UCL ) low control limit ( LCL ) set Â±3 standard deviation mean respectively ) . Data point outside control limit consider related special cause variation , effect treatment . The Minimal Clinically Important Difference ( MCID ) primary outcome variable , PASAT estimate expressed minimum change PASAT-diff score could consider clinically relevant . Parametric method , Student 's t-test Pearson correlation use normally distributed variable interval level . When compare two treatment group , t-tests independent sample use comparison pre- post follow measure t-tests dependent sample analysis variance use . Skewed ordinal data analyse non-parametric method : Mann-Whitney U-test comparison treatment group ; Wilcoxon match pairs test , Kruskal-Wallis analysis variance comparison pre- post follow measure Spearman 's rank correlation test . For post-hoc comparison use Mann-Whitney U-test . Fisher 's exact test use comparison dichotomized variable . Bonferroni correction apply correct false positive due number analysis . The possible effect randomisation bias investigate use linear mixed-model analysis include one within-group factor treatment one between-group factor . Cluster analysis use primary outcome measure explore identify pattern cognitive recovery acute phase . Two-tailed p-values use critical significance level 0.05 . Health economics resource utilisation calculate treatment arm participant acute subacute phase .</detailed_description>
