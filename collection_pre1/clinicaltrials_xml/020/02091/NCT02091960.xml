	<criteria>The subject histologically cytologically proven adenocarcinoma breast HER2+ The subject AR+ breast cancer The subject metastatic disease locally advanced disease amendable curative treatment The subject measurable disease nonmeasurable , evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 . ( NOTE : pleural effusion , ascites third fluid space evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 ) . The subject receive least 1 line therapy metastatic locally advanced disease set . The subject document progressed determination investigator regimen contain antiHER2 agent recent regimen recent antiHER2 regimen discontinue toxicity , exception cardiotoxicity . The subject adequately recovered toxicity due prior therapy . The subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance ( ECOG ) status ≤ 1 Screening Day 1 The subject available site representative , formalinfixed , paraffinembedded , tumor specimen enable definitive diagnosis breast cancer adequate viable tumor cell tissue block ( prefer ) ≥ 10 ( 20 prefer ) freshly cut , unstained , serial slide associated pathology report The subject severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity would make subject inappropriate enrollment . The subject current previously treat brain metastasis active leptomeningeal disease . Brain imaging require screening subject exclude presence unequivocal central nervous system disease . The subject history nonbreast cancer malignancy follow exception : The subject previous history noninvasive carcinoma eligible he/she successful curative treatment time prior Screening . For malignancy , subject eligible undergone potentially curative therapy consider disease free least 5 year prior Screening . The subject history seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke , significant brain trauma ) . The subject history loss consciousness , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack within 12 month Day 1 visit . The subject hypoglycemic episode require medical intervention insulin ( antidiabetic ) treatment within 12 month Day 1 . The subject major surgical procedure , substantial open biopsy , significant traumatic experience within 28 day Day 1 visit , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . The subject palliative radiation therapy bone metastasis within 14 day prior Day 1 visit ( side effect radiation must resolve ) . The subject receive chemotherapy , immunotherapy , systemic anticancer therapy , exception antiHER2 therapy ( e.g. , trastuzumab ) , within 14 day prior Day 1 visit .</criteria>
