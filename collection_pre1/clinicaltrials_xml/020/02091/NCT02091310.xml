	<brief_summary>In accordance International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) E14 guideline , Phase I thorough QT ( TQT ) study assess arrhythmogenic potential GFT505 , evaluate effect QT/QTc prolongation healthy male female subject . According guideline , study typically perform expect therapeutic dose supra-therapeutic dose 3-4-fold high therapeutic dose . GFT505 previously test 240 mg/d 14-day multiple administration healthy overweight subject ( study GFT505-111-7 ) , safety tolerability good . However , dose corresponds 2-fold expect therapeutic dose 120 mg/d . Therefore , current TQT study precede multiple ascend dose study safety tolerability 2 dose level GFT505 ( 300 360 mg ) correspond 2.5 3 time expect therapeutic dose evaluate . The high dose level safety tolerability consider satisfactory supra-therapeutic dose use TQT study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Evaluate Effect GFT505 QT/QTc Interval Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present trial split two successive part : - Study Part I double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study design obtain safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data 14-day multiple oral administration once-daily increase dos GFT505 ( 300 360 mg ) healthy male subject . The start dose 300 mg/day select basis result previous clinical trial correspond high dose give healthy subject accord single dose regimen ( study GFT505-111-7 ) . A total 24 male subject include , 12 cohort ( cohort correspond dose level ) . In cohort , 9 subject receive GFT505 3 receive placebo . A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) formal meeting full completion least 10 12 subject dose level review blind condition safety data conclude safety tolerability give dose level . Between first second dose level , SRC give agreement dose escalation , completion second level SRC define supra-therapeutic dose administer Study Part II . - Study Part II parallel group , randomize , placebo-controlled study , stratification gender . The study design investigate potential impact 14-day multiple oral administration once-daily GFT505 QT/QTc prolongation condition maximal GFT505 exposure , i.e . administer expect therapeutic dose 120 mg/d supra-therapeutic dose ( define accord result Study Part I ) , healthy male female subject . A single oral dose 400 mg moxifloxacin use positive control order document sensitivity experimental condition . The study treatment administration double-blind placebo GFT505 open moxifloxacin . The ECG reading perform blinded condition . A preliminary sample size 128 subject least 124 evaluable subject fix formal justification theoretical basis . ECG data collect Study Part I support formal determination use observe data thus lead final sample size . In case , anticipated sample size could less 124 evaluable subject . Each gender represent least 40 % study population . Both sub-groups balance 4 treatment group .</detailed_description>
