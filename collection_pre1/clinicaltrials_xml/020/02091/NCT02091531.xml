	<brief_summary>This phase II study test study drug MLN0128 patient castration resistant prostate cancer receive chemotherapy past . Phase II clinical trial test well investigational drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . MLN0128 approve FDA . The purpose study see effect ( good bad ) study drug MLN0128 patient cancer . MLN0128 drug belongs class drug call `` mTOR kinase inhibitor '' . A protein , call `` mTOR '' inside cell body , play role control cell grow . In cancer cell , mTOR may over-active . This over-activity may cause cancer cell grow control . Research show mTOR inhibitor block overactivity may help stop slow growth type cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To include study , patient histologically confirm castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer evidence disease progression . Patients must castrate state either orchiectomy GnRH analogue . In detail , meet follow criterion Histologically confirm prostate cancer progressive metastatic disease base follow : ) rise PSA , ii ) transaxial imaging , iii ) radionuclide bone scan . 1 . PSA minimum 3 consecutive rising level , interval ≥ 1 week determination . The last determination must minimal value ≥ 2 ng/mL determine within two week prior enrollment . 2 . Measurable Disease patient show new progressive soft tissue mass CT MRI scan define PCWG2 criteria21 3 . Radionuclide bone scan least two new metastatic lesion . Detectable metastasis bone scan , CTscan MRI . Ongoing androgen depletion therapy Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) analogue inhibitor , orchiectomy ( i.e. , surgical medical castration ) . For patient orchiectomy , must plan maintain effective GnRHanalogue therapy duration trial . Castrate level serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL determine within 4 week prior start treatment . Patients receive antiandrogen part firstline hormonal therapy must show progression disease antiandrogen prior enrollment . At least 4 week must elapse use androgen receptor antagonist ( i.e. , flutamide , nilutamide , bicalutamide , enzalutamide ) ; 5α reductase inhibitor ( i.e. , finasteride , aminoglutethimide ) ; abiraterone acetate ; estrogens ; nitrosoureas , mitomycin C , isotype therapy , ketoconazole , chemotherapy anticancer pharmacologic therapy prior begin protocol therapy . At least 8 week must elapse use Strontium89 , Radium223 , Samarium153 , immunotherapy ( e.g. , Provenge ) prior begin protocol therapy . At least 4 week must elapse use investigational agent prior begin protocol therapy . . Note : Prior treatment PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor prohibit . At least 4 week must elapse major surgery . Toxicities related prior therapy must either return ≤ Grade 1 , baseline deem irreversible . Patients treat , nonprogressive epidural disease eligible . KPS performance status 70100 % ( 5060 % allow due bone pain ) At least 18 year age , life expectancy least 3 month . Patient must willing comply study procedure . Physical laboratory test finding 1 . Adequate hepatic function serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper institutional limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Patients history Gilbert 's syndrome may enrol total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL predominance indirect bilirubin 2 . Adequate renal function serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . 3 . Adequate hematologic function absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cell/mm3 platelet ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL ( Note : patient whose anemia correct hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL blood transfusion allow ) . 4 . Electrolytes ( include potassium , sodium , serum calcium correct albumin ionized calcium ) must within normal limit . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 5 absolute percentage point institutional standard normal measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) within 4 week prior first study drug administration ( ie , institutional normal 50 % , subject 's LVEF may low 45 % eligible study ) Patients meet criterion list eligible study entry : History , current know metastasis brain untreated spinal cord compression ; History another malignancy within previous 2 year except follow : 1 . Adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , 2 . Adequately treated Stage I II cancer currently complete remission , cancer complete remission least 2 year ; Prior treatment PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor ; Diabetes mellitus active treatment , subject either follow : 1 . Fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) ≥ 126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L ) , 2 . HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % ; Use herbal product may decrease PSA level ( i.e. , saw palmetto ) systemic corticosteroid great equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day 4 week prior screen plan initiate treatment entire duration study ; Any history unstable angina , myocardial infarction , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , and/or pulmonary hypertension ; Significant active cardiovascular disease include : a. Uncontrolled high blood pressure ( ie , systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg ) b. Grade 3 high valvular disease c. Grade 3 high atrial fibrillation d. Grade 3 high bradycardia e. Endocarditis f. Pulmonary embolism g. Recent cerebrovascular accident within 6 month prior enrollment A requirement positive inotropic support ( exclude digoxin ) serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ( include atrial flutter/fibrillation ) within 1 year prior screen A pacemaker implantable cardiac defibrillator Known history infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , base medical history ( screen lab rule HIV infection require ) ; Any condition , opinion Investigator , would impair patient 's ability comply study procedure .</criteria>
