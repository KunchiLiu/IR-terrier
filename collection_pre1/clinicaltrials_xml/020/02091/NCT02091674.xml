	<brief_title>Management Acute Ankle Sprain With Sodium Hyaluronate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle sprain among common sport injury , approximately two million people per year seek medical treatment ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . An epidemiological study professional , competitive , recreational athlete find prevalence ankle sprain high 73 % ( 4 ) . Data National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey : 2000 Emergency Department ( ED ) Summary list 1.375 million ED visit US due ankle sprain represent 1.3 % ED visit ( 5 ) . Ankle sprain commonly affect lateral ligament complex . The lateral ligament complex ankle consist three separate ligament : anterior talofibular , posterior talofibular calcaneofibular . The anterior talofibular ligament usually ligament affect although severe injury calcaneofibular ligament may also involve . Varus inversion sprain include spectrum severity . Symptoms may include pain , swell , tenderness functional loss . Ankle sprain classified first- , second- third-degree ankle sprain . A first-degree sprain represent partial tear ligament mild tenderness swell , second-degree sprain represent incomplete tear ligament moderate functional impairment , pain swelling , third-degree sprain represent complete tear loss integrity ligament present severe swell , ecchymosis , loss function mechanical instability ( 6 , 7 ) . The assessment treatment ankle injury may perform emergency primary health care physicians well orthopaedic trauma surgeon ( 8 ) . The emphasis therapy ankle sprain center reduce inflammation pain rapidly follow injury ( 7 , 9 ) . Guidelines treatment acute ankle sprain American Academy Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend initial rehabilitation program ( three week ) NSAIDs ( non steroidal anti inflammatory drug ) , RICE ( rest , ice , compression elevation ) well protect weight bearing , early mobilization isometric ( 10 ) . Conservative treatment may limit disability average 8 day grade 1 15 day grade 2 ( 3 ) . Failure provide adequate therapy limit patient 's effort rehabilitation prolong recovery period . In study ankle sprain , pain dysfunction find persist 6 18 month ( average 12.8 month ) initial ankle sprain 73 % patient , 40 % reporting inability walk one mile , 11 % continue use medication ankle symptom ( 11 ) . In long-term follow-up study , nearly 40 % patient report residual long-term symptom dysfunction 6.5 year initial ankle sprain ( 12 ) . Also , long-term symptom ankle sprain noted 40 % athletes 6 month acute injury ( 6 ) . NSAIDs effectively reduce inflammation , pain , disability associate acute ankle sprain ( 13 , 14 ) . The rationale use include 1 ) pain control , 2 ) anti-inflammatory effect allow early activity 3 ) decrease inflammation speed heal directly . However , NSAIDs nonselective may cause significant adverse event include UGI intolerance serious event ulcer bleed . Hyaluronic Acid naturally occur biological substance show positive effect viscosupplementation therapy . As relief pain stiffness relate osteoarthritis , may similar effect ligament affect acute ankle sprain regard anti-inflammatory effect . This would promote mobility decrease pain associate acute ankle sprain . Hyaluronic Acid effect UGI platelet function compare traditional NSAIDs work locally within site injection . 2.0 RATIONALE Previous study conduct joint affect osteoarthritis show hyaluronic acid significantly reduce swell , increased mobility decrease pain . Based result , investigator believe patent hyaluronic may show efficacy increase mobility reduce pain acute ankle sprain . 3.0 OBJECTIVE The aim non-controlled study evaluate efficacy hyaluronic acid ( Adant ) treatment acute ankle sprain . It expect decrease pain swelling , promote healing , improve time return pain disability-free sport increase adverse event compare standard care placebo . 4.0 STUDY DESIGN This single-site , open-label , non-controlled trial efficacy safety Adant patient acute ankle sprain . The study include screen phase patient assess base select inclusion exclusion criterion . Prior enrollment , patient undergo screen assessment include physical exam . A diagnosis first second-degree ankle sprain make . Pain severity assess use Pain Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . After enrollment , patient administer Adant ( within 48 hour injury ) . The Assessments do baseline , day 8 , 30 90 . Efficacy measure include patient 's VAS pain weight bearing ( 0-100mm ) walk 20m ( 0-100mm ) , patient ' global assessment ankle injury ( 5 point categorical scale ) , patient ' assessment normal function/activity ( 5 point categorical scale ) , physician 's global assessment ankle injury ( 5 point categorical scale ) , patients/physician satisfaction assessment ( 10 point categorical scale ) , time return pain-free disability-free sport adverse event per WHO definition . 5.0 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Before start screen assessment , patient must give complete explanation purpose evaluation study .
