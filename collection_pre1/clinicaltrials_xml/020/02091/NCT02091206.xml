	<brief_title>A Dose-ranging Pharmacokinetics Safety Study GWP42003-P Children With Dravet Syndrome ( GWPCARE1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center study consist two part : Part A Part B . Part A described record . Part A randomized , double blind 21-day treatment study period . Subjects randomize one three dos active placebo 4:1 ratio . Subjects satisfy inclusion none exclusion criterion assign unique participant number begin 28-day baseline observation period . Eligible subject randomly assign receive one three dose level GWP42003-P : 5 mg/kg , 10 mg/kg 20 mg/kg per day , match placebo . There three group 10 subject . In group , subject randomly assign eight subject receive active treatment two subject receive placebo . Subjects receive GWP42003-P placebo 21-day exposure period , consist titration period , follow stable dose period . A pharmacokinetic assessment take place first single dose GWP42003-P . There second pharmacokinetic assessment 21 day consecutive dose GWP42003-P . Subjects take clobazam adjunctive treatment ask take usual dose two hour prior attend clinic . The recommendation make concomitant antiepileptic drug , applicable . This pre-treatment ( GWP42003-P ) plasma concentration clobazam , major metabolite N-desmethylclobazam , concomitant antiepileptic drug measure , impact GWP42003-P treatment level evaluate . Interim clinic visit ( primarily ) evaluate safety adherence titration regimen take place seven 14 day treatment . After 21 day treatment , subject commence 10-day down-titration taper period . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee review unblinded safety pharmacokinetic data recommend target dose ( 20 mg/kg/day ) Part B study open label extension study . Once safety review Part A data take place , subject option enter open label extension study . A follow-up telephone call make 28 day end dose subject enter open label extension study within time-frame . Throughout 21-day treatment period 10-day taper period , regular safety telephone call ( i.e. , approximately every two day ) check subject status . Weekly safety telephone call make 28-day follow-up period .</detailed_description>
