	<brief_summary>The aim research validate develop therapeutic strategy patient colorectal lesion real time pCLE ( probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ) . Endomicroscopy technique obtain histology-like image inside human body real-time . Total objection 311 patient . Specific research topic . 1 . Diagnosis classification colon polyp pCLE 2 . Evaluation depth invasion colorectal cancer lateral growth type tumor pCLE 3 . Differential diagnosis colorectal submucosal tumor pCLE 4 . Differential diagnosis ileocecal ulcer pCLE The study conduct measure sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , amphoteric predict pCLE diagnosis , calculate agreement prediction compare pathological finding lesion Check diagnostic agreement technical phrase derive , match degree observer , develope new classification method base .</brief_summary>
