	<brief_title>RCT Internet-based CBT Program Sexuality Intimacy Problems Women Treated Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Breast cancer common cancer among woman Netherlands , incidence 71 per 100.000 person-years , lifetime risk 10 % . Currently , 85 % woman breast cancer live longer 5 year , 75 % 10 year longer ( 1,2 ) . As result , interest research focus health-related quality life ( HRQL ) breast cancer survivor , include issue sexuality intimacy . Compelling evidence establish sexual dysfunction prevalent , long term complication breast cancer treatment ( 3,4-11 ) . Overall , approximately 50 % breast cancer survivor report form sexual dysfunction result treatment ( 6,10,13-15 ) . Frequently report problem regard intimacy sexuality include decrease sexual desire ( 23-64 % ) , decrease arousal lubrication ( 20-48 % ) , anorgasmia ( 16-36 % ) dyspareunia ( 35-38 % ) ( 10 ) . Hill et al . report 40 % breast cancer gynaecological cancer survivor study express interest receive professional sexual health care ( 15 ) . However , significant discrepancy self-reported need professional sexual health care actual uptake care ( 16 ) . Hill et al . ( 15 ) report , although 40 % sample express interest receive professional care , 7 % ever actually seek care . Although sexual functioning important issue , may difficult woman initiate discussion general practitioner medical specialist . Health care professional may also reluctant query sexual problem , due time constraint , embarrassment , and/or lack experience communication skill area ( 16,17 ) . Many woman consider face-to-face sexual counselling confronting , see internet-based intervention less threaten acceptable approach ( 18,19 ) . There grow evidence internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) effectively treat range psychosocial problem , include anxiety , depression PTSD ( 20,21 ) . More recently , internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy program sexual dysfunction develop , typically parallel content face-to-face therapy , study show efficacy internet-based program improve sexual functioning ( 22-25 ) . Design . This pragmatic clinical trial employ prospective , randomize design one intervention group control group . Potentially eligible patient identify hospital registry . These patient send letter sign treating/former surgeon , together informational brochure study possible cancer-related intimacy sexuality problem . Women potentially interested participate study ask indicate enclose response card . Women interested participation request return response card indicate motive ( ) able participate . Women interested participation respond invitation participate study contact . If interested , woman ask write contact information . Those woman return questionnaire contact telephone one member study staff inform thoroughly study purpose procedure . At time , additional question pose regard current treatment sexuality/intimacy problem , current participation research trial focus alleviate sexuality/intimacy problem , access internet , date breast cancer diagnosis , completion/continuation different part treatment breast cancer ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , endocrine treatment ) . Those woman remain interested study appear eligible undergo intake evaluation telephone sexologist carry extensive diagnostic interview order determine final eligibility woman internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program . Questions ask problem sexuality intimacy relationship/marriage . If woman meet final eligibility criterion , receive baseline questionnaire , together informed consent form . The questionnaire ass sociodemographic medical background variable , primary ( sexuality intimacy problem ) secondary study outcome ( body image , menopausal symptom , marital functioning , psychological distress health-related quality life ) . In total , 160 consent woman randomize either intervention group ( n = 80 ) , control group ( n = 80 ) use minimization technique , primary surgery ( breast conserve treatment ; mastectomy without reconstructive surgery ; mastectomy reconstructive surgery ) , menopausal status ( premenopausal ; postmenopausal ) , current endocrine treatment breast cancer ( yes ; ) , time since breast cancer diagnosis ( &lt; 1 year ; 1-3 yr ; 3-5 yr ) stratification variable . Women allocate intervention group ask complete battery questionnaire assess primary secondary outcomes four point time : ten week start CBT program ( T1 ) , post-treatment ( T2 ; achieve equivalent average assessment time study group , woman intervention group complete T2 post-treatment , always 20 24 week start therapy . Women finish CBT prior 20 week complete T2 20 week start therapy ) . The last two questionnaire complete 3-months completion therapy ( T3 ) 6 month T3 ( T4 ) . The control group ask complete T3 T4 , rather give opportunity undergo intervention follow completion T2 . This do deem ethically acceptable withhold intervention woman control group prolonged period time would require first asked complete follow-up session ( i.e. , approximately one year study enrollment ) . To minimize respondent burden , T4 questionnaire include questionnaire assess primary outcome measure . Control group . Women assign control group contact telephone member study staff inform allocation . These woman receive booklet per mail address 80 question sexuality cancer . Six week later , woman control group receive empathetic phone call one sexologists , also time available discuss question participant may concern sexuality cancer . The purpose keep contact control group , opposed pure wait list control group , create opportunity provide control possible attention placebo-effect . Ten week post study entry , woman control group ask complete first follow-up questionnaire . After completion questionnaire , woman control group telephone member study staff another empathetic conversation . Women control group complete final questionnaire twenty week post study entry , give opportunity undergo internet-based cognitive behavioral program . Intervention group . For woman allocate intervention group , sexologist develop tailor treatment plan , consist maximum 10 treatment module ( see detail description intervention ) . The therapist receive specialized training nature breast cancer treatment , general , specifically sexuality intimacy issue associate breast cancer treatment . Each woman assign personal sexologist ( therapist ) guide internet-based CBT program provide feedback homework assignment . Contact therapist fully web-based , via secure website . The CBT program comprises maximum ten treatment module use vary order . The choice module use give woman base information obtain via screen telephone intake evaluation therapist . Each module contain three intervention personal evaluation form report intervention . Each intervention comprise follow element : 1 ) introduction , 2 ) psycho-education symptom , 3 ) `` homework '' assignment ( e.g . relaxation technique ( pelvis ) ; discuss intimacy partner ; sensate focus ) 4 ) reporting back therapist receiving feedback `` homework '' assignment . Each week two `` practice '' session 30 minute one hour per week report on/evaluate intervention . The therapy mean duration 20 weeks.The module include : ( 1 ) `` Put problem word '' client describe problem , ask distinguish feeling , thought , behavior , learn intimacy interplay sexuality , sexual response curve common ( psycho ) sexual problem ; ( 2 ) `` How relationship ? '' client explore intimate relationship actually , becomes aware amount quality time spent partner , receive psycho-education sex intimacy , importance open communication partner , advice improve open communication ; ( 3 ) `` Sex body '' client first experience sensate focus therapy ( target become comfortable one 's body achieving ( non ) sexual intimacy one 's partner physically emotionally ) ; ( 4 ) `` Focus attention '' client receive task concentration training learn focus attention sexual experience ; ( 5 ) `` Explore body '' sensate focus therapy use , client writes experience homework exercise within cognitive behavioral framework ( particular focus inhibit thought ) ; ( 6 &amp; 7 ) `` Discovering sexual arousal feeling ( version woman partner ) psycho-education provide genital stimulation , sexual technique , etc. , discus sexual feeling partner ; ( 8 ) `` Change thought '' involve cognitive restructuring promote adaptive thought ; ( 9 ) `` My sexual preference '' client talk sexual preference partner , make action plan behavior change ; ( 10 ) `` Relapse prevention '' client write former automatic behavior risk factor relapse , plan action make case relapse . Study measure . The primary outcome ( sexuality intimacy problem ) measure use Sexual Activity Questionnaire , Female Sexual Functioning Scale , Female Sexual Distress Scale Personal Assessment Intimacy Relationships . Secondary outcome measure include QLQ-BR23 ( body image ) , FACT-ES ( menopausal symptom ) , Maudsley Marital Questionnaire ( marital functioning ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( psychological distress ) MOS SF-36 ( health-related quality life ) . Program adherence . Women complete tailor internet-based therapy program ask indicate reason ( ) discontinuation ( e.g. , illness , lack motivation , burden , etc. ) . Every effort make obtain final , post-intervention assessment woman , regardless whether complete therapy . This facilitate maximum sample size primary , 'intention-to-treat ' analysis between-group difference time . Additionally , woman , include control group , ask , period study , pursue ( ) activity relate sexual intimacy issue . Patients ' evaluation intervention program . At end treatment , woman intervention group ask experience module , homework assignment , feedback received therapist . Additionally , immediate post-treatment , woman ask whether would suggest change program , would recommend woman experience similar problem . Semi-structured interview . A subset woman ( approximately 15 intervention group ) ask participate telephone interview . This semi-structured interview cover topic area address self-report questionnaire , allow woman provide feedback narrative form sexual wellbeing experience CBT program . Women also ask partner would willing share his/her experience program ( applicable ) . The interview protocol develop pilot-tested preparatory phase study . Sample size statistical power calculation . The prospective study design allow test main effect internet-based intervention program . The SAQ , FSFI , FSFS PAIR Inventory primary outcome measure sample size calculation base . Specifically , difference SAQ , FSFI FSDS score baseline , mid-treatment ( e.g . 10 week ) , post-treatment ( e.g . 20 week ) , 3 month follow-up ( T3 ) 9 month follow-up ( T4 ) calculate patient , change primary endpoint study . The mean difference score compare minimal intervention control group . With total sample 130 woman ( 65 per group ) , assumption interaction , study 80 % power detect effect size 0.5 main effect web base intervention program , p value set 0.05 . 160 woman recruit study , allow attrition rate approximately 20 % ( i.e. , woman discontinue participation study entirely , include failure complete follow-up questionnaire ) . Those woman discontinue participation one group complete follow-up assessment include intention-to-treat analysis . Statistical analysis . Analysis first perform evaluate comparability intervention control group baseline term sociodemographic clinical characteristic . Student 's t-test appropriate non-parametric statistic use , depend level measurement . If , despite stratify randomization procedure , group find comparable one background variable , variable employ routinely covariates subsequent analysis . Questionnaire score calculate accord publish score algorithm . Between-group difference time mean score test use multilevel analysis . Effect size calculate use standard statistical procedure . Effect size 0.2 consider small , 0.5 moderate , 0.8 large . Effect size approximately 0.4 consider clinically relevant . All analysis , great extent possible , conduct intention-to-treat basis . The variable use minimization procedure employ covariates . Per protocol analysis also carry ( secondary analysis ) , compare woman meet minimal compliance level ( define ) program control group . We also use correlation analysis examine relationship degree program adherence , partner involvement , program effect . As indicated previously , SAQ , FSFI , FSDS PAIR inventory use primary study endpoint , remain measure consider secondary endpoint . For analysis latter variable , appropriate statistical ( p value ) adjustment make multiple testing . Since sample size provide sufficient power conduct subgroup analyse , interaction term ( group x time since diagnosis ) add analysis . The semi-structured interview data transcribe content analyze extract narrative , qualitative information woman 's sexual intimacy problem , relevant , experience intervention .</detailed_description>
