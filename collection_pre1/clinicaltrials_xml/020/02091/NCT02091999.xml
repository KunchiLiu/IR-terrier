	<brief_title>A Study Escalating Doses ASG-22CE Given Monotherapy Subjects With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Other Malignant Solid Tumors That Express Nectin-4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject receive single 30 minute IV infusion ASG-22CE weekly 3 week every 4 week ( i.e. , Days 1 , 8 , 15 ) . A cycle 4 week . This 3 part study . Part A evaluate ASG-22CE subject histologically confirm malignant solid tumor ( exclude sarcoma ) resistant recur . Subjects continue treatment disease progression , intolerability ASG-22CE , investigator decision consent withdrawal . Part A follow modify Continual Reassessment Method ( mCRM ) . Part B , evaluate ASG-22CE 3 different expansion cohort : 1 ) Urothelial cancer subject receive prior line therapy unfit Cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( Cisineligible ) define Creatinine Clearance ≥ 15 ml/min &lt; 60 ml/min , 2 ) subject Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) 3 ) subject Metastatic Ovarian Cancer . Enrollment Part B occur maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) assess Part A , preliminary recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) establish . Subjects continue treatment disease progression , intolerability ASG-22CE consent withdrawal . Part C evaluate ASG-22CE preliminary RP2D ( determine Part A ) subject previously treat immune checkpoint inhibitor ( CPI ) metastatic setting . Subjects continue treatment disease progression , intolerability ASG-22CE , investigator decision consent withdrawal . All subject follow post-treatment every 2 month via disease assessment telephone contact obtain information disease progression death . For Part A ( Dose Escalation ) Part B ( Cis-ineligible ) , data review team ( DRT ) review cumulative unaudited data interim basis explore additional dos and/or schedule , expansion exist cohort . Doses intermediate predefined protocol may explore DRT endorsement .</detailed_description>
