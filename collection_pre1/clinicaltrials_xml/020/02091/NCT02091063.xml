	<brief_summary>This open-label , single agent , multi-institutional phase Ib/II study ACY-1215 treatment patient relapse refractory lymphoid malignancy . The target population include patient histologically confirm relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma Hodgkin 's lymphoma , expansion cohort patient mantle cell lymphoma . The phase Ib conduct determine safety tolerability two dose schedule ACY-1215 monotherapy patient lymphoid malignancy . Patients accrue simultaneously two dose cohort ( Arm A Arm B ) ACY-1215 . Selection cohort occur alternation . All patient take prescribe dose ACY-1215 orally 28 consecutive day . Patients enrol Arm A take ACY-1215 160 mg daily ( QD ) , whereas patient enrol Arm B take ACY-1215 160 mg twice daily ( BID ) . ACY-1215 supplied liquid oral administration ( PO ) . Each dose administer least 1 hour ingestion food follow least 4 ounce water . Patients instructed ingest food oral medication least 2 hour ACY-1215 dose . Frequency phase II determine base Phase Ib result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The emergence epigenetic therapy identify pan-class deacetylase ( DAC ) inhibitor effective therapeutic agent treatment lymphoma . While pan-class DAC inhibitor lead FDA indication , clinical activity limit T-cell derived malignancy . The mechanism action remain largely unknown off-target effect lead side effect include fatigue , gastrointestinal disturbance , cytopenia . Recently , development isoform selective DAC inhibitor open opportunity investigate mechanism . It recognize DAC inhibitor epigenetic property , direct effect transcription factor ( p53 ) , oncogene ( Bcl6 ) , protein degradation pathway ( aggresome ) . Proteolysis occur primarily ubiquitin-proteosome pathway . In state pathway physiologically overwhelm therapeutically inhibit , aggresome sequesters proteins degradation . DAC6 class IIb deacetylase facilitates misfolded protein transport aggresome proteosome-independent proteolysis . Inhibition aggresome activates unfold protein response ( UPR ) pathway , cellular quality control mechanism two primary function : ( 1 ) promote survival cellular endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress chaperon protein back re-folding halt transcription homeostasis restore ( 2 ) signal CCAAT/enhancer bind protein ( C/EBP ) -homologous protein ( CHOP ) mediate apoptosis homeostasis reestablish [ 9 ] . While cell depend branch UPR coordinate protein folding , lymphocytes physiologically down-regulate UPR-apoptosis pathway , specifically CHOP , allow generation high affinity antibody . In addition initiate genetic abnormality ( translocation point mutation ) lymphomas inherit biology , thus gain survival advantage . It show ACY-1215 , Histone Deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) -selective , orally active small-molecule enzyme inhibitor single agent activity panel lymphoma cell line mouse model , mark synergistic activity several agent bortezomib , carfilzomib , ibrutinib , unpublished data . ACY-1215 study vivo model multiple myeloma lymphoma mark activity single agent combination bortezomib . Therefore ACY-1215 investigate treatment lymphoma single agent lead future study evaluate effect combination target agent know active lymphoma synergistic ACY-1215 .</detailed_description>
