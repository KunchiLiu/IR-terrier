	<brief_summary>This research study patient go receive kidney transplant live donor . After kidney transplantation , necessary transplant recipient take `` immunosuppressive drug '' . These drug work prevent body 's immune cell attack `` reject '' new kidney . Taking drug long-term may also cause harm transplant kidney . Therefore , transplant community interested finding way decrease immunosuppressive drug treatment reduce risk kidney rejection . One method know `` induction tolerance '' , person receives transplant treatment make immune cell tolerant donor cell . In study , try induce tolerance mix recipient cell donor 's cell together belatacept , immunosuppressive drug . Belatacept protein attach immune system cell , interfere immune response result tolerance induction . After mix recipient cell donor 's cell , sort one particular kind immune cell , call regulatory T cell , inject back recipient . Regulatory T cell cell affected induction reduce rejection donate organ . This method induce tolerance use bone marrow transplantation , first time do kidney transplantation . This study conduct part unique collaboration US EU center call The ONE Study . The ONE Study center agree work together use common protocol procedure test regulatory population safety ability promote kidney survival . Sharing data among participate site permit deeper understand treatment might succeed others work less well .</brief_summary>
