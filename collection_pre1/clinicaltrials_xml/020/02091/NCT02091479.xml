	<brief_summary>In patient high thromboembolic risk , withdraw anticoagulant treatment recommend situation , include major hæmorrhage occur . But withdraw treatment risky . In patient curative dose anticoagulant medicine , treatment withdrawal heighten risk thromboembolic event occur , potentially major consequence . For instance , mechanical valve thrombosis fatal 15 % patient . Resumption anticoagulation therefore critical patient high risk thromboembolic event . However , patient present major hæmorrhage , resumption anticoagulation heighten risk hæmorrhage recurrence . This risk even higher original hæmorrhage accessible via surgical , endoscopic endoluminal hemostasis . As far investigator know , data literature rely major hæmorrhage accessible via hemostatic intervention risk thrombosis high . When confronted patient need anticoagulation high risk hæmorrhage recurrence , question treatment resume resolve . This investigator propose conduct randomise comparative study evaluate two treatment strategy - early resumption ( H48 H72 ) versus late resumption ( H120 H144 ) anticoagulation . MAIN OBJECTIVE : The main objective present study evaluate term bleed risk , thrombosis risk mortality one month , effect early vs. late resumption anticoagulation patient present serious hæmorrhage curative-dose anticoagulant face high thromboembolic risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Resumption Anticoagulation Patients With Both High Thrombosis Risk Major HEmoRrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This comparative , randomise , open study assess 1 month 3 month effect early ( H48 72 ) versus late ( H120 144 ) resumption anticoagulation patient present serious bleed anticoagulant ( exclude intracerebral bleeding ) thromboembolic risk evaluate high ( except mitral prosthesis ) . The accumulated frequency major hæmorrhage , thromboembolic event deaths 26 % case early resumption 15 % case late resumption , i.e . relative risk reduction 43 % . Based hypothesis , obtain 80 % power two-sided α 5 % , group include 208 patient , total 416 patient . EVALUATION CRITERIA : The main criterion study accumulate one-month incidence hæmorrhage recurrence , thromboembolic complication death . It combine criterion associating : - Fatal hæmorrhage proven autopsy sudden death clinical context strongly suggestive hæmorrhage - Fatal thromboembolic event proven autopsy imagery sudden death clinical context strongly suggestive thrombosis - Any clinically significant hæmorrhage lead temporary ( &gt; 24 hour ) permanent withdrawal anticoagulant treatment - Any symptomatic thromboembolic event territory , proven imagery surgery These event validate committee validation critical event blind date anticoagulant treatment resumption . The secondary evaluation criterion symptomatic hæmorrhages , fatal , symptomatic thromboembolic incident , fatal , mortality 1 month 3 mont</detailed_description>
