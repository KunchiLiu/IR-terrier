Specific Aim 4 : To disseminate preliminary result develop comprehensive Dissemination Plan share research finding community peer review outlet assure translation result multilevel CBPR intervention programmatic policy effort improve heart health eastside , northwest southwest Detroit . Research Questions Hypotheses In Aim 1 , intend assess short term ( 8 week ) long term ( 10 month ) effectiveness multilevel CBPR intervention ( i.e. , individual , family , organizational level ) design improve heart health enhance opportunity active living , specifically walk group , three community Detroit . Hypotheses test : Participation 8-week intensive walk group intervention reduce risk factor increase protective factor associate CVD among African American , Latino white resident low moderate income neighborhood Detroit . H1.1 : Physical activity increase ( physical inactivity reduce ) . H1.2 : Psychosocial factor positively associated physical activity ( e.g. , confidence ability physically active day week ) increase . H1.3 : Anthropometric indicator CVD risk ( e.g. , BMI , waist circumference ) change significantly . H1.4 : Biological indicator CVD risk ( e.g. , lipid level ) change significantly . Participation less intensive , maintenance walk group intervention 10 month period follow initial intensive walk group sustain change physical activity , improvement psychosocial factor associate reduced risk , reduction biological anthropomorphic risk factor improvement protective factor among participant . H2.1 : Increases physical activity baseline sustain maintenance period ( physical inactivity reduce baseline ) . H2.2 : Increases psychosocial factor positively associated physical activity ( e.g. , confidence ability physically active day week ) enhance ( improved 12 month baseline immediate post-intervention follow ) . H2.3 : Anthropometric indicator CVD risk ( e.g. , BMI , waist circumference ) reduce 12 month compare baseline . H2.4 : Biological indicator CVD risk ( e.g. , LDL level ) reduce protective indicator ( e.g. , HDL ) increase 12 month compare baseline . In Aim 2 , assess feasibility promote heart health provide support leadership development , organizational change , community action policy change enhance neighborhood environment support sustain active living . Research question examine : extent provision technical assistance facilitator train community organization support development maintenance walk group extent mini-grant program contributes modification build social environment support active living . These exploratory research question , essential dissemination sustainability community-based intervention address disparity CVD , test formal hypothesis . Rather , focus document change , identify challenge , facilitate factor , lesson learn inform subsequent formal hypotheses-testing .</detailed_description>
