	<brief_summary>Mortality related cardiac arrest anesthetize child diminish several decade 2.9 per 10000 anesthesia 1961 0.21 per 10000 anesthesia 2007 . ( 1 ) Even though mortality rate relate pediatric anesthesia much low , respiratory complication relate peri-operative cardiac arrest high 27 % accord Pediatric Peri-operative Cardiac Arrest ( POCA ) Registry . ( 2 ) .Therefore , peri-operative respiratory event ( PRE ) pediatric anesthesia laryngospasm , stridor , bronchospasm , desaturation reintubation crucial . Stridor reintubation occur child extubated , mostly PACU period . Laryngospasm , stridor , bronchospasm wheeze lead desaturation need reintubation . Those PRE , especially peri-operative desaturation , prolong PACU stay especially PRE develop PACU . ( 8,9 ) PRE occur intraoperative period also prolong PACU stay child observe PACU transfer directly intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Some child require oxygen therapy PACU continue ward . Some need endotracheal tube intubation spontaneous breathing place mechanical ventilator . Thai AIMS ( 10 ) report desaturation PACU associate re-intubation , prolonged mechanical ventilation unplanned ICU admission . Oxygen supplement need , prolong mechanical ventilation unplanned ICU admission produce extra day hospitalization increase cost hospitalization extra-cost payment eg ; oxygen therapy , mechanical ventilator , cost ICU stay . Furthermore , short-term sequela regard cost hospitalization child develop PRE never evaluate compare cost child develop PRE . Higher cost hospitalization occurrence PRE anesthetize child impact hospital policy maker . Minimizing PRE save cost hospital care public hospital health sector . Therefore , would like compare day hospitalization cost difference hospitalization child develop PRE child develop PRE tertiary care hospital southern Thailand</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study design A prospective observational study 2 . Study set Children age &lt; 15 year receive general anesthesia Songklanagarind Hospital November 2012 December 2013 3 . Study sample Inclusion criterion Children age &lt; 15 year receive general anesthesia develop PRE PRE Songklanagarind Hospital November 2012 December 2013 . Exclusion criteria 1 . ASA classification 4 5 2 . Preoperative SpO2 &lt; 95 % room air 3 . Required preoperative endotracheal tube intubation ( ETT ) mechanical ventilation 4 . Had congenital cyanotic heart disease 4 . Study size Sample size calculation The sample size calculation base comparison group outcomes day cost hospitalization PRE non-PRE group 5 . Sampling technique Purposive identification child age &lt; 15 year old receive general anesthesia develop Peri-operative respiratory event ( PRE ) November 2012 December 2013.was select PRE expose group . Peri-operative respiratory event ( PRE ) define respiratory event eg ; laryngospasm , stridor , wheeze , bronchospasm , reintubation , without desaturation , occur intraoperative PACU period . For non-PRE non-exposed group , match expose group demographic data perform . - Matching year anesthesia - Matching type surgery - Matching type anesthesia After match type surgery anesthesia expose group , non-exposed group randomly select simple random sample technique 4 suitable non-exposed subject available . The ratio expose group non-exposed group 1 4 . 6 Outcome variable The outcome variable divide day hospitalization cost hospitalization . Days hospitalization Days hospitalization day child stay hospital discharge home Days hospitalization compare PRE group non-PRE group Cost hospitalization Cost hospitalization total cost hospitalization include direct indirect cost ( 25,26 ) - Direct cost hospital charge multiply cost-to-charge ratio ( CCR ) - Hospital charge medical cost include medication , procedure relate anesthesia surgery , material cost related procedure , extra-cost complication postoperatively : ICU stay , cost ventilator oxygen therapy , accommodation meal charge - Indirect cost cost include transportation ( T ) , productivity loss eg ; cost work leave ( L ) /day Therefore , cost hospitalization - ( hospital charge* CCR ) + T + ( L* day hospitalization ) According payer perspective , CCR equal 1 Cost hospitalization compare PRE group non-PRE group . The total cost hospitalization group transfer payment real payment 80 % hospital charge subsidize insurance coverage government eg ; universal coverage ( UC ) , social security , government corporation Comptroller General Department , reflect societal cost . Moreover , consider cost hospitalization follow disease relate group ( DRG ) payment project . 7 . Independent variable Patient relate factor 1 . Age 2 . Sex 3 . Weight 4 . Height 5 . ASA classification 6 . History upper respiratory tract infection 7 . History parental smoking 8 . History snoring : yes v 9 . Postoperative complication - Related surgery - Related anesthesia - Related anesthesia surgery Anesthetic relate factor 1 . Type surgery 2 . Choice general anesthesia 3 . Technique general anesthesia 4 . Induction agent 5 . Intubation agent 6 . Inhalation agent use 7 . Gas mixed oxygen use 8 . Type narcotic 9 . Duration anesthesia 10 . Period PACU stay 11 . Developed respiratory event : Yes vs 12 . Peri-operative respiratory event 13 . The period respiratory event develop : intraoperative v PACU 14 . The low oxygen saturation respiratory event develop 15 . Postoperative oxygen therapy 16 . Postoperative mechanical ventilation 8 . Data process analysis Descriptive component Analysis perform R program version 2.14.1 . Descriptive statistic compute variable include frequency , proportion , mean + SD median ( range ) . Predictor variables categorical data either originally continuous , categorize select suitable cut point . Analytic component The day hospitalization compare PRE non-PRE group use simple linear regression model . The explanatory variable may relate prolonged hospitalization analyze use multiple linear regression model show evidence differ across outcome category univariate analysis ( p ≤ 0.2 ) . The magnitude precision association indicate adjusted coefficient 95 % confidence interval . Total cost hospitalization compare PRE non-PRE group use simple linear regression model . Cost hospitalization calculate use CCR 0.4 ( hospital perspective ) 1 ( payer perspective ) . The explanatory variable may relate high cost hospitalization analyze use multiple linear regression model show evidence differ across outcome category univariate analysis ( p ≤ 0.2 ) . The magnitude precision association indicate adjusted coefficient 95 % confidence interval . For day cost hospitalization , distribution suitable linear regression assumption linear regression meet , alternative analysis method may prefer eg ; logarithmic transform , quantile regression Cox regression . In multivariate modeling technique , association outcome consider significant likelihood ratio p-values ≤ 0.05 .</detailed_description>
