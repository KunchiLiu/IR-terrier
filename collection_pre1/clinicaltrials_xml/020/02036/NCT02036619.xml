The risk develop type 2 diabetes postpartum probably low woman diagnose two-step screening strategy . In prospective multicentric cohort study , woman universally screen pregestational diabetes GDM first prenatal visit first trimester measure fast plasma glucose . In second trimester , woman without diagnosis diabetes GDM first trimester , universally screen GDM use 50g glucose challenge test ( GCT ) 75g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) IADPSG criterion GDM . Diagnosis GDM base 75g OGTT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accurate data prevalence gestational diabetes ( GDM ) lack Belgium current practice screen GDM varies across different center . The discrepancy recommendation due lack data base research population concern best screen strategy pregestational diabetes early pregnancy lack data best screen strategy GDM . A substantial number center Belgium already use IADPSG screen strategy although always universal screen strategy always one-step screening strategy . The General hypothesis IADPSG screen strategy lead important increase work load prevalence GDM Belgium might cost effective concern prevention adverse pregnancy outcome . The risk develop type 2 diabetes postpartum probably low woman diagnose two-step screening strategy . In prospective cohort study , woman universally screen pregestational diabetes GDM first prenatal visit first trimester measure fast plasma glucose . GDM define fast plasma glucose ≥100-125mg/dl . This allow identify important risk factor development GDM . In second trimester , woman universally screen GDM use 50g glucose challenge test ( GCT ) 75g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) IADPSG criterion GDM . Compared IADPSG screen strategy use normal routine , 50g GCT extra test specific study . Diagnosis GDM base 75g OGTT . Participants researcher therefore blind result GCT . The result GCT test use end study research purpose . The use GCT universal screen tool two-step approach use 75g 2-hour OGTT IADPSG criterion GCT abnormal , yet validate evaluate study , since could practical solution . Differences GDM prevalence pregnancy outcomes analyzed use different diagnostic criterion base 75g OGTT : Carpenter &amp; Coustan criterion , IADPSG criterion , threshold value diagnostic criterion would base odds ratio 2.0 . The evaluation different screen strategy different diagnostic criterion allow explore cost effective method identify woman risk adverse pregnancy outcomes high risk development type 2 diabetes pregnancy . By use multivariable risk estimation model base relevant clinical risk factor biochemical measure GDM population , aim develop simple cost effective screen algorithm . This study also allow evaluate best short-term follow strategy postpartum woman previous history GDM . Different screen test use three month postpartum : fasting plasma glucose , Hba1c 75g OGTT .</detailed_description>
