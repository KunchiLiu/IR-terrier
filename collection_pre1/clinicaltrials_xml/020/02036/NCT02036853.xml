Glucose brain 's primary source energy . Glut 1 DS prevents protein effectively produce cause starvation brain . This study do assess safety long-term efficacy triheptanoin pediatric patient Glut1 DS 4-year treatment period . Glut 1 protein help transport glucose brain . Glucose brain 's primary source energy . Glut 1 DS prevents protein effectively produce , cause deprivation energy neuron brain . Glut1 DS severely debilitate disease characterize seizure , developmental delay movement disorder . There currently approve treatment specific Glut1 DS . Treatment generally include medication control seizures . The use ketogenic diet effective controlling seizure medication ineffective provide insufficient control . However , ketogenic diet may difficult patient maintain long period time , may negative secondary long-term effect ketogenic diet.. Triheptanoin metabolize molecule provide alternative energy source brain , appear help control seizure without many difficulty ketogenic diet . Eligible patient may diagnose GLUT1 DS , discontinue currently ketogenic diet , able tolerate triheptanoin treat currently treat triheptanoin qualify clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial Triheptanoin Patients With Glucose Transporter Type-1 Deficiency Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triheptanoin propose treatment seizure glucose transporter type-1 deficiency syndrome ( Glut1 DS ) . Glut1 DS rare disease estimate US prevalence ~3,300 . The propose study open-label study assess safety long-term efficacy triheptanoin patient Glut1 DS 4-year treatment period . Eligible patient may able tolerate triheptanoin treat currently treat triheptanoin qualify clinical trial . Subjects previously treat triheptanoin continue dose approximately 35 % total daily calorie ( ~1-4g/kg/day , depend age ) . Subjects na√Øve triheptanoin begin 2-week fixed titration schedule reach 35 % total daily calorie . The primary objective study evaluate safety triheptanoin via adverse event rate laboratory value . The secondary objective evaluate long-term efficacy triheptanoin measure change seizure frequency historical baseline .</detailed_description>
