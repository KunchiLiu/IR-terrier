	<brief_summary>This study pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) combination lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone participant refractory relapse refractory Multiple Myeloma ( rrMM ) , combination carfilzomib low-dose dexamethasone participant relapse refractory Multiple Myeloma ( rMM ) . This study do find maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /maximum administer dose ( MAD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , evaluate safety tolerability pembrolizumab give combination standard care ( SOC ) treatments participant rrMM rMM . Preliminary efficacy data also assess . The primary study hypothesis combination sufficiently well tolerated permit clinical investigation .</brief_summary>
