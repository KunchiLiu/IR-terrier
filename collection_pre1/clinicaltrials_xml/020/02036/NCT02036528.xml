	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether AppliGel-G ( Gentamicin topical gel ) plus oral Ciprofloxacin / Doxycycline safe effective treatment mild moderately infected foot ulcer diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Gentamicin Topical Gel ( AppliGel-G ) Treatment Mild Moderately Infected Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) serious common complication diabetes among common diabetes-related cause hospitalization lead cause diabetes-associated low limb amputation . The effectiveness various systemic antibiotic , particularly fluoroquinolones , treat infect DFUs demonstrate . An alternative adjunct systemic antibiotic treatment infect DFU 's topical antibiotic treatment . Topical treatment would advantage avoid systemic adverse effect , provide increase target site concentration , allow use antibiotic approve systemic treatment . AppliGel-G topically apply hydrogel formulation gentamicin sulfate ( GMS ) . Once place product remain contact wound bed release Gentamicin wound bed .</detailed_description>
