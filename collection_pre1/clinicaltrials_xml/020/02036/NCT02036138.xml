	<brief_summary>The grow incidence obesity type2 DM globally widely recognize one challenge contemporary threat public health . Uncontrolled diabetes lead macrovascular microvascular complication , include myocardial infarction , stroke , blindness , neuropathy , renal failure many patient . The current goal medical treatment halt disease progression reduce hyperglycemia , hypertension , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular risk factor . Despite improvement pharmacotherapy , few 50 % patient moderate-to-severe type 2 diabetes actually achieve maintain therapeutic threshold , particularly glycemic control . Observational study suggest bariatric metabolic surgery rapidly improve glycemic control cardiovascular risk factor severely obese patient type 2 diabetes Few randomized , control trial compare bariatric surgery intensive medical therapy , particularly moderately obese patient ( define BMI 30 34.9 ) type2 DM . Accordingly , many unanswered question remain regard relative efficacy bariatric surgery patient uncontrolled diabetes . This randomize , control , prospective multicenter study design compare intensive medical therapy surgical treatment ( LRYGB LSG ) mean improve glycemic control moderately obese patient ( BMI 30-34.9 ) type- 2 DM .</brief_summary>
