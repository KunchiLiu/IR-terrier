	<brief_title>Cervical Upper Thoracic Mobilization Manipulation Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All potential subject assess eligibility prior sign inform consent fill demographic questionnaire subjective interview include health history examination perform physical therapist receive additional training orthopedic manual therapy . A physical therapist ( PT ) highly educate license health care professional graduate accredited university pass national licensure exam . Physical therapist specialize movement disorder well trained examination treatment primary secondary medical condition pertain cardiovascular , neuromuscular , musculoskeletal , integumentary body system . Manual therapy intervention neck thoracic spine include manipulation teach entry-level physical therapy program . Continuing education course available physical therapist get advanced training manual therapy . This training involve improve skill set therapist also focus enhance knowledge therapist concern safety patient . Each treat therapist certification manual therapy . Screening inclusion exclusion criterion do treat PT mean assess subjective outcome , patient demographic , subjective history examine . Subjects give informed consent read sign agree participate . Subjects permit ask question relative study procedure understand . Two physical therapist facility use order keep outcome measure blind . The treat therapist clinic PT perform examination/evaluation perform manual therapy treatment first 2 visit care . Pending schedule conflict ; treat therapist continue provide treatment . If scheduling conflict , another physical therapist provide patient 's care next available open treat therapist . The record therapist , research therapist , record dependent variable remain blinded group allocation . This assignment give research therapist . The treat therapist blind result outcome data except case data need clinical decision make order optimize patient outcome . After informed consent attain , outcome data collect record physical therapist aware group allocation . The data collect include neck disability index ( NDI ) , patient specific functional score ( PSFS ) , numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) , deep cervical flexion test ( DCF ) , cervical range motion ( CROM ) use CROM , therapist equipoise , patient preference . Following initial data collection , subject randomize via concealed allocation receive either mobilization manipulation direct cervical upper thoracic spine first two treatment visit . The patient treat day 1 randomize treatment technique . The manual technique choose treatment clinician determine result physical examination . Other intervention include group include standardized exercise program advice , encouragement , assurance . Immediately follow treatment procedure , data collect include NPRS , global rating change ( GROC ) , cervical range motion , DCF . The therapist determine next appropriate follow-up visit . Data collect begin 2nd visit follow-up include NPRS , GROC , cervical range motion , DCF , PSFS , NDI blind physical therapist . Treatments cervical thoracic mobilization manipulation occur base group allocation establish prior . The technique use treat clinician base assessment patient follow group allocation . After 2nd visit ( day 3 ) , treat physical therapist able add remove treatment , deem necessary improve patient 's condition . Orthopedic manual therapy ( mobilization manipulation ) may adjust base patient need well . Subsequent visit plan care continue direction physical therapist base patient 's need . Final data collection perform discharge include NDI , PSFS , GROC , total number visit , patient satisfaction , therapist equipoise , total day care . Analysis : Baseline characteristic subject compare use either t-test chi square appropriate . A two way multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) use compare outcome NDI , PSFS , NPRS baseline , day 3 , day 30 .</detailed_description>
