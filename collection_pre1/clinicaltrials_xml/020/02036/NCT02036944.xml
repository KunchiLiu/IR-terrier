	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine patient unexplained iron deficiency underlie disease process celiac disease . It hypothesize selectively screen patient unexplained iron deficiency reveal previously undiagnosed etiology , include celiac disease cause iron malabsorption along various source occult GI blood loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celiac Disease Unexplained Iron Deficiency Primary Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study document unexplained iron deficiency relationship celiac disease , iron malabsorption occult intestinal blood loss . Test result give primary care physician may prompt test celiac disease ( duodenal biopsy ) potential cause occult iron deficiency . The specific endpoint evaluate include : - Prevalence specific serum marker celiac disease unexplained serum marker iron deficiency . - Prevalence iron malabsorption without celiac disease population - Frequency blood test malabsorption association celiac disease cause iron malabsorption . - Frequency specific historical marker associate celiac disease - Prevalence unrecognized GI blood loss - Quality life improvement base new diagnosis appropriate therapy - After one year follow-up , review patient record additional diagnosis explain iron deficiency . Primary Objective : Discover several etiology unexplained iron deficiency primary care clinic population include celiac disease , iron malabsorption occult intestinal blood loss . Secondary Objectives : - Define percent total clinic patient population one marker iron deficiency last testing subset without apparent etiology problem list ( `` study group '' ) . - Define percent patient study group currently iron deficient time study onset , many actually anemic . - Define percent study group patient iron malabsorption , without celiac disease . - Document improve quality life outcomes new diagnosis appropriate therapy , include celiac disease give gluten-free diet iron therapy . - For patient identify celiac disease , statistical analysis historical lab parameter highly link celiac disease improve screen parameter . - Document percent various diagnosis explain occult iron deficiency find primary care provider course one year follow-up initial diagnosis . ( Providers give test result related patient initial screen one year . ) - Specific cost-effectiveness screening procedure may do future study preliminary result suggestive improved outcome .</detailed_description>
