	<brief_summary>Radical prostatectomy common effective treatment localize prostate cancer . Unfortunately , radical prostatectomy associate significant adverse effect , urinary incontinence , sexual dysfunction , reduce physical function collectively diminish health-related quality life may persist two year postoperatively . The primary objective trial ass feasibility conduct multi-site randomize controlled trial test effect comprehensive prehabilitation program versus standard care men prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy . We hypothesize men prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy comprehensive prehabilitation program ( full-body exercise pelvic floor muscle exercise ) report good health-related quality life , urological symptom , physical fitness , physical activity , pain , well shorter postoperative length stay participant receive standard preoperative care ( pelvic floor muscle exercise alone ) . Our secondary objective report estimate efficacy several clinically important outcome population use sample size calculation adequately power trial .</brief_summary>
