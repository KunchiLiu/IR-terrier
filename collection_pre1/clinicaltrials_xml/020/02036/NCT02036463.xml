	<brief_summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) progressive neuromuscular disease curative treatment yet identify , make important slow progression improve quality life among affected boy young men . Treatment corticosteroids standard care patient DMD five year old old , due robust observation intervention lengthen interval prior loss ambulation associate many side effect . This clinical trial conduct young age group able receive corticosteroid orally study outcome measurable , age 3 7 year . This randomized , double blind , double mask , placebo-controlled clinical trial explore whether good synchronization corticosteroid administration circadian rhythm provide improve tolerability least comparable efficacy current standard corticosteroid always give morning . Furthermore , trial provide unique opportunity rigorously evaluate corticosteroid effect young DMD patient , efficacy compare placebo study impact corticosteroid chronotherapy , delayed release , increase tolerability standard therapy . The main hypothesis synchronization time corticosteroid dose improve medication tolerability child , maintain ( non-inferiority ) efficacy corticosteroid . The study also offer unique opportunity measure several biomarkers well novel genetic modifier may impact response corticosteroid DMD .</brief_summary>
