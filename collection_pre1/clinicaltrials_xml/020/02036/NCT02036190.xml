	<detailed_description>One major medical challenge face u susceptibility smoking-induced lung disease varies greatly essentially preclude ability predict smoker develop emphysema . Because SPIROMICS study design phenotype large heterogeneous group smoker , choose cohort identify subpopulation auto-reactive T cell , may represent contribute mechanism development emphysema , may need alternative therapy , may represent group patient progressive disease despite smoke cessation . In Aim 1 , prospectively determine presence auto-reactive T cell response determine increase cytokine release 180 ever-smokers without emphysema ; Aim 2 focus longitudinal aspect factor could predispose development auto-reactive T cell population risk . These study form prerequisite basis develop additional novel immune-based diagnostic therapeutic strategy human emphysema . The short-term objective outline base preliminary data , provide necessary platform use answer follow urgent question : ) distinct prospective cohort ever smoker , auto-reactive T cell predict presence radiographic emphysema ? ii ) Can identify unique persistent transcriptional signature ( ) associate autoimmune emphysema ? The observational longitudinal design SPIROMICS allow detailed assessment association emphysema primary clinical endpoint could validate novel T cell specific immunodiagnostic potential develop laboratory . We propose explore role autoimmunity contribute mechanism development emphysema additional aim bring current technology bear clinical future diagnostic test . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : We discover specific autoreactive T cell ever-smokers emphysema grow evidence link particular effector cell pathophysiology smoke relate lung disease . Our propose study important provide new diagnostic prognostic assay ( e.g . gamma-6-Spot , base Th1 Th17 cytokine ) ever-smokers , risk develop emphysema .</detailed_description>
