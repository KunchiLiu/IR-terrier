	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer frequently diagnose non-skin cancer , second lead cause men cancer death United States . Hormonal therapy remain first-line treatment metastatic prostate cancer . Initial response hormonal therapy chemical surgical castration quite favorable , however , patient progress castration-resistant phase disease . Docetaxel primary chemotherapeutic option patient mCRPC . Abiraterone novel , selective , irreversible , potent inhibitor 17- [ alpha ] -hydroxylase/17,20-lyase ( CYP17 ) enzymatic activity recently demonstrate reduce testosterone level blood undetectable range ( &lt; 1 ng/dL ) suggest reduce de novo intratumor androgen synthesis . Abiraterone demonstrate activity castration resistant prostate cancer patient previously treat docetaxel chemotherapy . Recently , result phase III trial compare abiraterone plus prednisone v placebo plus prednisone asymptomatic without visceral metastasis , castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patient , demonstrate well radiological progression free survival abiraterone treat patient trend towards well survival clear abiraterone treat patient . No clinical evidence exist efficacy chemotherapy antiandrogen therapy combination . All trial perform patient LHRH agonist treatment continue although clear evidence efficacy hormonal treatment . Some retrospective study suggest androgen deprivation treatment maintain chemotherapy treat patient . Abiraterone prove suppress androgen level negative value , add efficacy castration hormonal therapy . Combination abiraterone docetaxel chemotherapy seem promise add efficacy docetaxel chemotherapy . A randomized phase II study compare docetaxel + prednisone + abiraterone docetaxel + prednisone mCRPC patient treat previously abiraterone , seem promise explore addition efficacy taxotere abiraterone hormonal treatment .</brief_summary>
