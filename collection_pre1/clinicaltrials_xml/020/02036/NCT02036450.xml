	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke major health problem , affect approximately 16,000 people annually Denmark , cause severe burdensome consequence victim , suffer significant loss quality life ( QOL ) , family . Stroke often cause atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , common type cardiac arrhythmia . Effective management AF anticoagulation therapy available may considerable benefit patient well society . Difficult detect , however , asymptomatic AF usually diagnose chance . Recently develop technology ( implantable loop recorder ; ILR ) allow continuous long-term electrocardiography ( ECG ) monitoring may constitute substantial improvement AF diagnosis . Primary objective : The primary objective study determine , whether patient increase risk stroke high occurrence AF without symptom study continuous ECG monitoring use ILR whether risk stroke peripheral embolus reduce initiating anticoagulation therapy accord pre-specified local study guideline ; Secondary objective : ) Whether analysis ECG interval obtain single ECG lead ( ILR ) conventional ECG predict future development AF ; b ) Whether use expensive monitor technology - ILR - diagnosis AF cost effective health economics analysis due reduction number stroke . Study design : Randomised , un-blinded , control parallel two group trial . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : Time stroke systemic embolism . Secondary : - Composite endpoint time stroke systemic embolic episode death - Death due reason - Death due cardiovascular reason - Acute hospitalization due heart failure , myocardial infarction , unstable angina - Major bleeding complication ( accord International Society Thrombosis Haemostasis criterion ) - Cerebral haemorrhage - Transitory ischemic attack - Time one ; atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , ventricular supraventricular tachycardia ( ≥16 beat ≥158 beat per minute ) , asystole ( ≥3 ) , bradycardia ( ≥4 beat ≤30 beat per minute ) , pacemaker implantation , percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass graft , transcatheter aortic valve replacement , transcatheter mitral valve repair , cardiac valve thoracic surgery - Changes use healthcare resource cost , i.e . hospital treatment , general practitioner service , medical specialist , pharmaceutical , rehabilitation , nursing home QALYs - QoL measurement use validated instrument ( SF-36 Euro-Qual survey form , EQ-5D ) - Cognitive decline evaluate Montreal cognitive assessment ( MoCA ) test - Chronological development ECG marker measure ILR 12-lead ECG - Presence brain infarct white matter hyperintensity magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) association AF future stroke - Cardiac chamber dimension function fibrosis chamber wall assess MRI gadolinium contrast association AF future stroke - Echocardiographic prediction AF stroke - Cardiac hormones serologic risk marker prediction AF stroke - Genetic prediction AF stroke - Inflammation marker association AF stroke - Safety aspect device implant Sample size : In total 6,000 subject participate randomise 1:3 ratio : 1,500 randomise receive implantable loop recorder ( ILR group ) 4,500 randomise receive standard care ( control group ) . Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : Subjects 70 year age old least one follow disease : hypertension , diabetes , heart failure previous stroke ( biologically candidate OAC ) . ILR group : Patients randomise ILR group receive monitoring device AF detect anticoagulation therapy give accord study guideline . Control group : Patients treat accord standard care . Study Duration : The study comprise screen period 12-36 month follow treatment phase minimum 36 month . The total study duration therefore approximately 6 year . Screening Randomisation : Treatment : After randomisation patient allocate ILR group receive implantation fast possible , preferably within 4 week . Statistical Considerations : Regarding AF prevalence study population , expect 30 % participant document AF episode qualify OAC ILR monitoring least three year . This comparable ASSERT , 35 % least one episode last ≥6 minute median follow-up 2.5 year . The study population expect stroke rate 0.7 % /year non-AF patient , 2 % /year AF patient treat OAC . While expect number AF-related stroke reduce OAC ( odds ratio 0.29 ) , presuppose stroke unrelated AF influence . We also include calculation assumption 3 % participant control group become diagnose AF start OAC . The annual rate primary end point control group thus expect 1 % . Finally , expect 5 % ILR group monitor due refusal ILR implantation ILR explantation due discomfort . These patient participate risk patient control group include analysis primary endpoint accord intention-to-treat principle . We thus expect overall hazard ratio 0.65 . To analyse reduction primary endpoint 2-sided α-level 0.05 power 80 % , need 279 primary event . Follow-up duration adjust accommodate number primary event . Primary Endpoint Analysis : The principal analysis primary endpoint ( time one event combine endpoint ) employ intent-to-threat principle use survival analysis . For randomised group , Kaplan-Meier curve estimate , graphically display compare use logrank test . A co-variate adjusted analysis combine primary endpoint use Cox proportional regression model perform supportive analysis . The hazard ratio correspond 95 % confidence interval estimate . Subjects complete study reach composite endpoint censor . Secondary Endpoint Analysis : All time-to-event secondary endpoint analyse similarly primary endpoint . Event Committee : An event adjudication committee classify endpoint event throughout study . Funding : Research grant obtain Danish National Foundation Strategic Research ( DKK 15.6 mio ) , Research Foundation Capital Region Denmark ( DKK 2.0 mio ) Danish Heart Foundation ( DKK 150.000 ) . Medtronic ( manufacturer ILRs donate unrestricted research grant study cover cost related 900 ILRs ( value DKK 5.4 mio ( reduced price ) DKK 22.5 mio ( ordinary list price ) ) grant cover salary research nurse hospital ( DKK 1.9 mio ) . Additional research grant applied private public research foundation well industry .</detailed_description>
