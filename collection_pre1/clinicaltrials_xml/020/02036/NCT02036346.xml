	<brief_summary>One main reason hospital readmission ileostomy patient fluid electrolyte abnormality . Prospective observational study suggest occurrence rate around 20 % . Due colonic exclusion ileostomy patient lose large amount sodium fluid stoma effluent . In addition study show ileostomy construction risk factor renal impairment , occur secondary dehydration . Encouraging patient increase total fluid intake seem common mistake clinical practice dilute sodium level even , cause great sodium depletion . In term address problem small study use isotonic drink various composition show increased electrolyte absorption . Other dietary complication sometimes include hypomagnesaemia decreased absorption B-12 folic acid , however due integrity small intestine nutrient malabsorption unlikely occur . As far body composition concern obesity show risk factor peri- postoperative complication colorectal surgery ( e.g . peristomal dermatitis , stoma stenosis prolapse ) . A prospective trial examine measure prevent readmission dehydration nutritional consideration relate group patient definitely require . Hypothesis : The administration oral rehydration solution allow significant decrease dehydration electrolyte abnormality rate patient temporary ileostomy .</brief_summary>
