	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ferriprox® Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Other Anemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deferiprone ( brand name Ferriprox® ) iron chelator approve United States 60 country treatment iron overload patient thalassemia , treatment inadequate . This study design evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability deferiprone vs. deferoxamine patient SCD anemia , require chelation extra iron take blood transfusion . About 300 people North America , South America , Europe , Middle East take part study . Participants randomize 2:1 ratio receive therapy 52 week either deferiprone deferoxamine , another type iron chelator . Patients randomize deferiprone group choose get drug either tablet liquid , must take three time daily . Patients randomized deferoxamine group receive subcutaneous infusion last 8 12 hour give 5 7 day per week . For drug , start dosage base much extra iron take transfusion last 3 month severity iron load , measure serum ferritin level blood amount iron liver heart . For deferiprone , start dosage increase week first 3 week ; drug , dosage may adjust study base level iron overload safety consideration . Patients need blood count check every week ; give blood sample detail safety test every month ; give blood sample measurement serum ferritin every 3 month . Every six month , undergo ECG MRI scan , ask complete quality life survey . At end 52 week , participant invite enter 2-year study patient receive deferiprone , include randomize receive deferoxamine first year .</detailed_description>
