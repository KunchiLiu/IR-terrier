	<brief_summary>The aim study assess safety efficacy SJM MRI conditional pacing system subject undergoing Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.The study hypothesis cardiac MRI scan affect performance SJM MRI conditional pacing system special condition meet . Comparing control group , freedom MRI scan-related complication electronic performance pace threshold , sense amplitude similar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accent Cardiac MRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy SJM MRI conditional pacing system Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Scan . The SJM MRI conditional pacing system consist SJM MRI conditional pacemaker lead . It conditionally safe use MRI environment.The study conduct Asian regions/countries . Accent Cardiac MRI study prospective , randomize , multi center study .After sign consent form , patient enrol study . Total subject number 252 .These patient randomize 2 group : 126 patient randomize MRI scan group 126 patient randomize control group . The study last 2.5 year .Individual patient participation study last approximately 4 5 month . All patient decide participate study implanted Accent MRI ™ dual chamber pacemaker Tendril MRI™ lead commercially available new SJM MRI conditional pacing system . After implant , MRI visit , patient randomize either MRI Scan Group Control Group 1:1 ratio . Patients MRI Scan Group undergo MRI scan MRI visit ( 9~12 week implant ) patient Control Group receive MRI scan visit . After MRI scan , patient 's pacing system examine programmer ass whether change electronic parameter pace capture threshold , sense amplitude well lead impedence . 1 month MRI visit , patient come back hospital another study follow include physical examination device interrogation .</detailed_description>
