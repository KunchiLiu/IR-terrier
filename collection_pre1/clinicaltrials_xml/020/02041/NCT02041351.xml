	<brief_title>Biweekly Docetaxel Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology : Prospective non-randomized phase IIa . The selected patient metastatic breast cancer heavily pretreated include previously treat taxanes , receive docetaxel administer dose 45mg/m2 body surface every 2 week assess activity drug . Variables : Age . Menopausal status . Hormone receptor status . Overexpression HER2 neu . Location metastatic site . Performance status ( PS ) 0-3. comorbidities . Case management variable ( patient subgroup ) The patient HER 2 neu overexpression anti -HER2 therapy chemotherapy docetaxel . The patient present brain metastasis may receive radiation therapy brain end radiotherapy , start docetaxel . Patients whose tumor express estrogen receptor progesterone positive receive treatment docetaxel : Where visceral crisis show already progress 2 line previously administer hormone treatment . In event cytotoxic chemotherapy concurrent docetaxel administer anti-estrogen drug . And continue hormone therapy achieve complete response measurable lesion docetaxel opt non-cytotoxic anti-estrogen therapy come present unacceptable toxicity docetaxel . Evaluations : clinical assessment include physical examination review laboratory study carry every 2 week authorize housing management next cycle . The objective assessment tumor response carry imaging study ( CT ) RECIST criterion administration 4 criterion cycle , cycle administer every 2 week docetaxel dose 45mg/m2 . Response Criteria 1 . Response tumor shrinkage royalty 30 % . 2 . Greater 1 cm size tumor lesion decrease . 3 . Disease-free survival 4 . Progression-free survival . 5 . Stable disease 6 . Improved quality life decrease bone pain , improvement dyspnea .</detailed_description>
