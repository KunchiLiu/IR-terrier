	<brief_summary>The investigator ' purpose study exercise training modality : aerobic physical activity conjunction either resistance training balance training , beneficial patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD 4-5 : GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73mUP [ 2 ] ) . Furthermore , purpose evaluate long-term effect exercise train functional status , cardiovascular morbidity , blood pressure control , heart rate variability , cardiac function , inflammation , body composition , nutritional status , progression uraemia health relate quality life . This interventional study prospective , randomize control comprise 150 prevalent incident patient outpatient clinic . Patients invited participate study consecutively , irrespective basic functional status . At start patient randomise either resistance balance training programme adapt individualised patient 's actual physical status ability . The exercise prescription exercise 30 minutes/day , 5 days/week , keep intensity constant level `` somewhat strenuous '' `` strenuous '' Borg scale rate perceive exertion . The total observation period 12 month check every four month . Although exercise training recommend therapy CKD , lack medical scientific evidence optimal prescription . We hope study provide evidence-based knowledge exercise prescription effect various risk factor CKD patient . Finally , patient achieve high degree physical functional capacity able maintain autonomous lifestyle , result considerable reduction societal cost care transportation .</brief_summary>
