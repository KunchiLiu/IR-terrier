	<detailed_description>This study conduct Department Surgical Disciplines Department Gastroenterology , All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi . Patients pancreatic pseudocyst randomize two groups- Group I- Laparoscopic management pseudocyst Group II- Endoscopic management pseudocyst Patients randomize use computer generate randomized number seal envelope ensure conceal allocation block randomization . The detail patient meet inclusion criterion refuse consent reason refusal consent also note . Refusal consent inclusion study hamper treatment patient anyway . The patient evaluate prospectively . CONSORT guideline follow . Preoperative Data The detail regard demographic profile patient i.e . age/ sex/ body mass index ( BMI ) clinical feature note . The duration present complaint pseudocyst history regard acuteness underlying pancreatic disease note . The etiology pancreatitis note . Patients examine thoroughly characteristic feature pseudocysts , size site ( head , body tail pancreas ) note . The American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade patient also do . Pre-operative Investigations Preoperative investigation include hemogram , liver function test , serum electrolyte , serum amylase , serum lipase , kidney function test , chest X-ray electrocardiogram . Ultrasound abdomen , contrast enhance computer tomography ( CECT ) do proper localization , size , wall characteristic , presence absence pseudoaneurysm relationship cyst surround structure . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) do asses relative amount necrotic debris within cyst , require . An Endoscopic ultrasound do discretion gastroenterologist plan endoscopic drainage pseudocyst . A clinical case record ( CRF ) form fill relevant detail . INTERVENTION TECHNIQUE Laparoscopic Cystogastrostomy Pre-operative Preparation One dose injection cefoperazone 1000 mg + sulbactam 1000 mg skin test , one dose metronidazole 500 mg Amikacin 1000 mg give intravenously prophylaxis pre-operatively time induction anesthesia . The antibiotic continue 3 day surgery . A 14 Fr Foley 's catheter place pre-operatively induction anesthesia . Operative Procedure Patient place Lloyd-Davis position upper limbs side patient . General anesthesia without supplementation spinal anesthesia give patient . A 12 mm camera port umbilicus , one 5 mm port leave pararectal region , one 12 mm port right pararectal area level umbilicus fourth port epigastric region puncture aspirate pseudocyst . 2-3 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine infiltrate port site local anesthesia port placement . Pneumoperitoneum create use veress needle . The first port insert close manner direct towards upper abdomen . The bulge pseudocyst posterior wall stomach identify access posterior gastric wall establish anterior gastrotomy ( 2 -2.5 cm ) create help harmonic shears/monopolar hook knife . A long needle introduce confirm location pseudocyst sample fluid . A bariatric port introduce posterior wall stomach cyst content aspirate . The cyst irrigate port debris clear . The cystogastrostomy stoma make endostapler ( Ethicon Endo-surgery , Cincinnati ) . Gastrotomy close two layer intracorporeal suture . Cholecystectomy do necessary use standard four port technique . A 16 F drain place subhepatic space . Details associate procedure like cholecystectomy , laparoscopic CBD exploration procedure record detail note thereof . Endoscopic Cystogastrostomy Preprocedural preparation One dose injection cefoperazone 1000 mg + sulbactam 1000 mg skin test give intravenously prophylaxis procedure continue 3 day procedure require . Procedure The ideal site puncture determine site maximum bulge posterior gastric wall . A needle knife use puncture gastric cyst wall help electrocoagulation . A gush cyst fluid encounter cyst enter . A guide wire pass needle knife . A balloon use dilate open 15 mm without cut . One 10 Fr plastic double pigtail stent place pseudocyst . The stent remove three month later . If bulge endoscopic view , cystogastrostomy do endoscopic ultrasonography guidance . In presence necrotic debris patient develop fever , repeat procedure do within three day . An 8.8 mm diameter , size forward view endoscope use enter cavity . The cavity lavaged saline loose necrotic tissue remove snare basket . Operative data record preformed proforma port placement , mode gastrotomy , location pseudocyst , operation time , associate procedure perform , conversion open , intraoperative complication intra-operative detail . Reasons conversion open procedure perform conversion also record . Data regard endoscopic procedure also record prestructured proforma technique , mode gastrotomy , procedure time , complication encounter procedure intraprocedural detail . The number procedures hospital stay record . Details associate procedure like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography ( ERCP ) Common bile duct ( CBD ) stone removal record . An ERCP do routinely prior drainage find communication cyst main pancreatic duct ( MPD ) . In patient recurrence within four week ERCP do rule ductal communication pancreatic stent place fistula find surgical endoscopic group . Post intervention Evaluation Data regard post operative/post endoscopic recovery complication bleeding , wound infection , haematemesis , fever , intra abdominal collection drainage perform collect . Post operative/post procedural amylase level ultrasound finding also record . Hospital Stay Post procedure hospital stay would record day . Follow All patient follow post operative period least 3 month . The first follow seven day , 4 week 3 month surgery . An ultrasound do follow look cyst recurrence intra-abdominal problem . A note additional procedure admission index intervention make . Cost procedure This include direct indirect cost incur patient hospital procedure . Statistical analysis The data enter Microsoft excel software analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) software version 15 . The statistical method apply student t-test/ Mann Whitney U test , whichever applicable compare continuous data two group categorical variable compare use Chi - Square test/ Fisher exact test . A P-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
