	<brief_summary>This research study determine study drug lenalidomide increase body 's immune response , body 's response infection tumor , hepatitis B vaccine patient plasma cell disease include multiple myeloma , monoclonal gammopathy unknown significance ( MGUS ) Waldenstr√∂m 's Macroglobulinemia . It study see lenalidomide effective treatment plasma cell disease . Participants study multiple myeloma plasma cell disease never vaccinate hepatitis B vaccine . One effect drug lenalidomide alter immune system thereby increase immune response . It also effect cancer cell ; therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . In study , one-half subject choose random receive study drug half take placebo pill ( sugar pill look real medication ) . This double blind study neither subject investigator know whether patient receives study drug placebo pill . The effect active drug lenalidomide compare effect placebo . The result study also compare similar separate study do individual without know disease . This study expect enroll 64 subject carry Boston VA Healthcare System Dana Farber Cancer Institute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary object study evaluate effect CC-5013 response hepatitis B vaccine myeloma . Secondary objective include evaluation immunologic functional genomic change follow CC-55013 . This study two-center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial . A single dose Hepatitis B vaccine administer subject . CC-5013 placebo administer 7 day prior 7 day vaccine . Collection sample immune analysis perform prior initiation CC-5013 administration , time vaccination , 7 , 14 , 28 day vaccination . Safety assessment perform visit . Primary Endpoint - Titer antibody hepatitis B virus Secondary Endpoints - Immune analysis - Hepatitis B relate T cell response - Safety profile All patient prior response hepatitis B surface antigen . The study comprise 64 multiple myeloma patient take therapeutic agent 30 day prior enrollment study . Subjects randomly assign receive receive CC-5013 , vaccinate . The study design detect biological difference 50 % alpha 0.05 beta 0.8 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Age &gt; = 18 year time signing informed consent form . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Must confirm diagnosis plasma cell disorder . Patients prior thalidomide CC5013 ( lenalidomide ) use eligible agent must discontinue least 4 week prior treatment study . All previous cancer therapy , include chemotherapy , dexamethsone must discontinue least 4 week prior treatment study . Patients recent radiation , hormonal therapy surgery eligible . Patients must receive prior Hepatitis B vaccination . Patient negative antibody HbSAg . ANC &gt; = 1000 , Platelets &gt; = 75,000 . Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) must negative urine pregnancy test screening ( Visit 1 ) . In addition , sexually active WCBP must agree use two follow adequate form contraception throughout entire study ( tubal ligation ; intrauterine device ; barrier contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner ) . A WCBP must agree pregnancy test 4 week last dose lenalidomide . Due short duration drug therapy , abstinence would also reasonable option . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant lactating female . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study .
