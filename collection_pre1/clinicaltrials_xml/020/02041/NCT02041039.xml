	<brief_summary>Food aroma part food ' flavor , promote overeating . Alcohol consumption also stimulate appetite , contribute overeat alcohol 's acute effect . Knowing brain region respond food aroma alcohol , modify amount body fat alcohol exposure , provide critical information neural system underlie loss control eat . Therefore , main hypothesis study : A ) Lean obese subject different brain response food aroma enhance desire eat , B ) Acute alcohol intoxication ) enhance brain 's response food odor , ii ) affect brain system inhibit terminate eating . To test hypothesis , modify functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) paradigm successfully use study alcoholic drink aromas subject risk alcoholism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food aroma powerful appetitive cue intrinsic food ' flavor hedonic quality , cue facilitate overeat . Alcohol consumption similarly `` prime '' appetite , contribute overeat alcohol 's acute effect . Knowing brain loci respond naturalistic appetitive stimulus , modify body fat alcohol exposure , provide critical insight neural system underlie loss control eat . Therefore , main hypothesis study : A ) Lean obese subject different limbic response olfactory cue enhance motivation eat , B ) Acute alcohol intoxication ) potentiate brain 's reward system response food odor , ii ) affect brain system involve behavioral inhibition eat restraint . To test hypothesis , modify functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) paradigm successfully use study alcoholic drink aromas subject risk alcoholism .</detailed_description>
