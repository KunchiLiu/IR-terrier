	<detailed_description>Premature infant high risk suboptimal health development . This randomized clinical trial evaluate impact developmentally base intervention , H-HOPE ( Hospital-home transition : optimizing prematures ' environment ) , infant bear 29-34 week gestational age ( GA ) least two social-environmental risk factor . H-HOPE innovative integrates two component use successfully prior research never combine . Infant remediation use developmentally appropriate multisensory intervention address specific behavioral organization need premature infant . Maternal redefinition re-education nurse-community advocate team use participatory guidance address need mother premature infant . The synergistic effect simultaneous improvement infant mother lead : 1 ) mature infant behavioral organization hospital progression ; 2 ) improve maternal recognition infant behavioral cue , great confidence infant care , positive perception infant , low anxiety ; 3 ) positive mother-infant interaction great mother-infant contingency ; 4 ) improve infant development growth ; 5 ) low infant health care utilization cost . H-HOPE provide intervention 32 week GA one month correct age , time transition oral feeding , hospital home , hospital outpatient provider , mother premature infant express need support . We randomly assign 252 infant H-HOPE Attention Control group . Power analysis show 80 % retention rate , adequate power identify expect intervention effect . Variables measure hospital stay , intake , immediately prior discharge , six week correct age . Analyses employ Hierarchical Linear Modeling cluster within clinical site , infant sex , biologic social-environmental risk factor covariates . If successful , H-HOPE provide national model improve early infant health development reduce health cost . For example , reduce hospital stay three day almost 500,000 infant bear prematurely could save two billion dollar annually .</detailed_description>
