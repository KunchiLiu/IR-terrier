	<detailed_description>Although incidence decline , gastric cancer remain one common cause cancer morbidity mortality worldwide.Since stage gastric cancer time detection correlate prognosis , secondary prevention important . Screening asymptomatic individual gastric cancer show increase detection early gastric cancer ( EGC ) , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) rate exceed 90 % . Gastric carcinogenesis multi-factorial process include environmental , socioeconomic , lifestyle factor . Many risk factor , include dietary factor , chronic atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , H. pylorus infection , alcohol consumption , aspirin investigate . Although specific correlation serum cholesterol gastric cancer fully understood , inverse relationship observe serum total cholesterol ( TC ) level cancer , recent analysis randomize control trial show significant inverse association high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) risk incident cancer . Lower lipoprotein cholesterol cancer patient may due enhanced activity lipoprotein cholesterol receptor pathway increase demand cholesterol tumor development lymphatic spread . Some suggest preexisting tumor might result low serum cholesterol , call `` preclinical cancer effect '' `` unsuspected sickness '' . In another study , LDL-C report affect host immune system cell . In previous study , investigator find serum HDL-C LDL-C level associate risk , resectability , prognosis gastric cancer . There several cohort study report low serum cholesterol level associate incident cancer , include gastric cancer . However , study regard serum cholesterol gastric cancer investigate gastrectomized patient , show association low serum cholesterol level lymph node metastasis submucosal invasion . Furthermore , study evaluate association LDL-C apolipoproteins gastric cancer . Therefore investigator conduct nested case-control study investigate association serum cholesterol level include TC , HDL-C , LDL-C , triglyceride ( TG ) , apolipoproteins gastric neoplasm . In addition , analyse perform evaluate possible role serum cholesterol predictor differentiation prognosis gastric neoplasm .</detailed_description>
