	<detailed_description>In develop develop world , human continuously expose plethora environmental toxin , nature result anthropomorphic activity . Aflatoxin B1 , one example , one toxic substance know man , around u find food , especially cereal form 70 % Kenya staple food . Limiting cereal intake always easy , one plentiful nutritious food source Kenya primary source dietary energy many society Kenya . We recently discover novel property lactic acid bacteria aflatoxin B1 , sequester and/or detoxify microbe cause reduction toxin level environment . We hypothesize sequestration toxin gastrointestinal tract ingest probiotic bacteria cause reduction host toxin uptake carry body feces prevent passage gastrointestinal tract host . Our primary objective test hypothesis consumption probiotic yogurt result decrease level Aflatoxin B1 group school-aged child . The secondary objective determine baseline level aflatoxin B1 group school-aged child eastern Kenya . The tertiary objective establish baseline gastrointestinal microbiota child consumption probiotic yogurt affect microbiota . A class 60 pupil Identified primary school , approximately 7 year old , randomize two group match age , sex weight . They receive daily 100g serve probiotic yogurt portion local milk trial period . Before first administration yogurt/milk , blood , urine feces collect . After 30 day ; biological specimen collect observe potential reduction toxin level .</detailed_description>
