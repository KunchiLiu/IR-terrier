	<brief_summary>Alarm fatigue , lack response alarm due desensitization , national problem . The problem alarm desensitization multifaceted related high false alarm rate , poor positive predictive value , lack alarm standardization large number medical device build alarm use today . Cardiac monitor alarm intend notify healthcare practitioner clinical crisis imminent . However , hundred physiologic monitor alarm occur monitor unit day . As result , practitioner highly vulnerable alarm fatigue result serious harm patient death due staff inattention alarm signal desensitization . Research indicate 80-99.4 % monitor alarm false clinically insignificant . Alarm hazard number one medical device technology hazard 2012 list ECRI ( Emergency Care Research Institute ) among top 3 medical device hazard past three year ( ECRI , 2011 ) . Delivering actionable alarm information care provider challenge give significant number false alarm . Ideally , alarm activate event great need clinical attention without increase risk adverse patient outcomes . This case current monitoring technology design high sensitivity low specificity . Practitioners must use clinical intuition determine conservatively alarm set useful . There research evidence support best set alarm without affect patient outcome . Quality improvement study perform The Johns Hopkins Hospital demonstrate frequency alarm signal reduce 50 % altered set alarm parameter . This reduction alarm signal lead increase awareness alarm occur well create quieter , heal environment patient . Although change associate `` noticeable '' increase adverse patient event , important outcome rigorously study . The specific aim pilot study determine decrease number alarm use altered set alarm parameter effect patient outcomes intensive care unit . This project may significant impact patient safety . A decrease noise bedside may result less distraction caregiver may positive effect patient recovery . It expect altered set monitor default parameter result decrease audible alarm without increase clinically significant adverse patient event .</brief_summary>
