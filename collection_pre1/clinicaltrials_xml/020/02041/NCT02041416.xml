	<brief_title>Technology Assess Vulnerable Older Adults With Cancer Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty percent cancer diagnose 70 % cancer mortality occur patient age 65 old . Patients old age 65 year 11-fold increase cancer incidence 16-fold increase cancer mortality comparison young 65 year . The population risk grow rapidly : number adult age 65 year older expect double next 30 year . In order adequately care grow population old adult , oncologist need assessment tool provide information regard old individual 's `` functional age '' rather `` chronological age . '' The Geriatric Assessment Tool develop Hurria colleague find help identify old adult vulnerable complication cancer treatment . The Geriatric Assessment Tool take account well validated measure functional status , co-morbid medical condition , cognitive function , psychological state , nutritional status , social activity , social support . Pilot data demonstrate feasibility assessment complete less 30 minute ; however , assessment complete pencil paper , therefore require interviewer deliver , score , summarize assessment result . The development computer base Geriatric Assessment Tool would practical importance research clinical practice . It could potentially allow efficient data collection analysis research set . In turn would potentially influence clinical decision make medical oncologist give ability predict chemotherapy relate toxicity among geriatric oncology patient across tumor type . Two electronic platform develop Geriatric Assessment Tool : 1 . Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) secure website design Vanderbilt University use 48 country , 511 institution around world include research center comprise Cancer Aging Research Group . REDCap web-based application allow researcher build manage online survey database . It also provide central web-based forum data process uniformly efficiently . Administering Geriatric Assessment Tool REDCap would potentially improve data collection analysis elderly cancer patient across multiple research center . 2 . Support Screen program develop researcher information technology specialist City Hope utilize touchscreen technology deliver patient survey . The touchscreen platform use previous study mean assess need cancer patient . Support Screen attractive technology give user friendly patient unique capability transfer information touchscreen device directly City Hope medical record system secure , HIPPA-compliant manner , thereby provide clinician researcher real time access survey information . A pilot study look feasibility deliver Geriatric Assessment elderly cancer patient use Support Screen perform City Hope promise result , reliability validity modality yet study .</detailed_description>
