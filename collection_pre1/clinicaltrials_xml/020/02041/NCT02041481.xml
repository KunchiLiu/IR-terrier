	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose MEK inhibitor MEK162 give together leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . MEK inhibitor MEK162 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving MEK inhibitor MEK162 leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEK Inhibitor MEK162 Combination With Leucovorin Calcium , Fluorouracil , Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination MEK162 ( MEK inhibitor MEK162 ) plus leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe safety combination MEK162 across investigate dose level . II . Describe pharmacokinetics MEK162 FOLFOX 6 patient expand MTD cohort . III . Describe clinical activity combination use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . IV . Determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) may less MTD intermittent continuous dose MEK162 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study MEK inhibitor MEK162 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 , leucovorin calcium intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 PO BID day 1-5 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 6 7 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
