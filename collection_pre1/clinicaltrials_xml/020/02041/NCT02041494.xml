	<brief_summary>Hernias often treat use prosthetic mesh add support heal wound . Prosthetic mesh use decade repair ventral hernia , level 1 data regard type mesh use limit . The purpose study compare effect , good and/or bad , two type prosthetic mesh : one make pig skin ( call `` biologic prosthetic '' ) , one make laboratory ( call `` synthetic prosthetic '' ) . This study include patient infection in/near hernia , patient infection . We expect synthetic mesh associate high rate early post-operative surgical site infection fluid collection ( seromas ) , expect biologic mesh associate high rate recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complex Ventral Hernia Repair Using Biologic Synthetic Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-blind , randomize study compare clinical efficacy overall cost two prosthetic mesh repair complex ventral hernia . The two prosthetic mesh study Ventralight ( Bard , Murray Hill , NJ ) , synthetic mesh chiefly make polypropylene Strattice ( LifeCell , Branchburg , NJ ) , biologic mesh derive porcine dermis . The study population consist patient need repair complex ventral hernia . Patients enrol study 24 month follow operation experience recurrence hernia , whichever occur first . The primary outcome variable recurrence secondary outcome variable post-operative surgical site infection overall cost . There universally agree upon definition constitute `` complex '' ventral hernia . For purpose , `` complex '' ventral hernia one involve compromise surgical field , gastrointestinal , biliary , genitourinary procedure perform , one wound class consider clean-contaminated , contaminate , dirty due cause , infected mesh enterocutaneous fistula , surgical procedure conduct patient large ventral hernia defect ( &gt; 10 cm single dimension ) .</detailed_description>

Other case wound class IV include presence purulent inflammation , soft tissue/mesh infection , visceral perforation result contain fistula ( e.g . enterocutaneous fistula ) still consider eligible enrollment .</criteria>
