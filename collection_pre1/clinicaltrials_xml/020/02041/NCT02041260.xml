	<criteria>The subject histologic cytologic diagnosis DTC tumor ( include poorly differentiate thyroid cancer anaplastic thyroid cancer ) metastatic unresectable fulfills follow criterion : . Subjects must progressive disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion compare baseline scan obtain within prior 14 month AND b . Subject must RAIrefractory disease base least one following : . Prior dose RAI exceed 600mCi ii.Progression disease within 18 month follow dose 100mCi iii . Presence target lesion define modified RECIST criterion take RAI . The subject assessment know disease sit eg , computerized tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , bone scan appropriate , within 28 day first dose cabozantinib The subject 18 year old day consent . The subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The subject organ marrow function laboratory value follow within 4 day prior first dose cabozantinib : . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1500/mm3without colony stimulate factor support b. Platelets 100,000/mm3 c. Hemoglobin 9 g/dL d.Bilirubin 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For subject know Gilberts disease , bilirubin 3.0mg/dL e. Serum albumin 2.0 g/dl f. Serum creatinine 1.5 ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) 50 mL/Page 9 16 min . For creatinine clearance estimation , Cockcroft Gault equation use : Male : CrCl ( mL/min ) = ( 140 age ) × wt ( kg ) / ( serum creatinine × 72 ) Female : Multiply result 0.85 g.Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) 3.0 ULN h. Lipase 2.0 x upper limit normal radiologic clinical evidence pancreatitis i. Urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) 1 j. Serum phosphorus , calcium , magnesium potassium LLN The subject capable understanding comply protocol requirement sign informed consent document . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( eg , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define amenorrhea 12 consecutive month . Note : woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression reversible reason . An archived tumor specimen available collection . The subject receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( include investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy ) , biologic agent ( eg , cytokine antibody ) , anticancer systemic therapy ( include multikinase inhibitor ) . Prior treatment cabozantinib The subject receive radiation therapy : a. thoracic cavity , abdomen pelvis within 3 month first dose study treatment thathas ongoing complication without complete recovery healing ( CT change relate radiation treatment clinical significant allow ) . b. bone brain metastasis within 14 day first dose study treatment c. site ( ) within 28 day first dose study treatment The subject receive radionuclide treatment within 6 week first dose study treatment The subject receive type investigational agent within 28 day first dose study treatment . The subject recover baseline CTCAE Grade 1 toxicity due prior therapy except alopecia nonclinically significant AEs ( eg . albumin ) . The subject primary brain tumor . The subject active brain metastasis epidural disease treat radiation therapy ( Note : Subjects brain metastases previously treat whole brain radiation radiosurgery subject epidural disease previously treat radiation surgery asymptomatic require steroid treatment least 2 week start study treatment eligible . Neurosurgical resection brain metastasis brain biopsy permit complete least 2 month start study treatment . ( Baseline brain imaging contrastenhanced CT MRI scan subject know brain metastasis require confirm eligibility . ) The subject prothrombin time ( PT ) / International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) test 1.3 laboratory ULN within 7 day first dose study treatment . The subject require concomitant treatment , therapeutic dos , anticoagulant warfarin warfarinrelated agent , heparin , thrombin Factor Xa inhibitor , antiplatelet agent ( eg , clopidogrel ) . Low dose aspirin ( 81 mg/day ) , lowdose warfarin ( 1mg/day ) , prophylactic low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) permit . The subject require chronic concomitant treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer ( eg , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentin , phenobarbital , St. Johns Wort ) . The subject experience following : a. clinicallysignificant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 month first dose study treatment b. hemoptysis 0.5 teaspoon ( 2.5ml ) red blood within 3 month first dose study treatment c. sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 month first dose study treatment The subject radiographic evidence cavitating pulmonary lesion ( ) The subject tumor contact , invade encase major blood vessel The subject evidence tumor invade GI tract ( esophagus , stomach , small large bowel , rectum anus ) , evidence endotracheal endobronchial tumor within 28 day first dose cabozantinib . The subject uncontrolled , significant intercurrent recent illness include , limited , following condition : a. Cardiovascular disorder include i. Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III ( moderate ) Class IV ( severe ) time screen ii . Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension define sustain BP 140 mm Hg systolic , 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 day first dose study treatment iii . Any history congenital long QT syndrome iv . Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : unstable angina pectoris clinicallysignificant cardiac arrhythmia stroke ( include TIA , ischemic event ) myocardial infarction thromboembolic event require therapeutic anticoagulation ( Note : subject venous filter ( e.g . vena cava filter ) eligible study ) b. Gastrointestinal disorder particularly associate high risk perforation fistula formation include : . Any follow within 28 day first dose study treatment intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade GI mucosa active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohns disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis malabsorption syndrome ii . Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : abdominal fistula gastrointestinal perforation bowel obstruction gastric outlet obstruction intraabdominal abscess.Note : Complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even abscess occur 6 month first dose study treatment . c. Other disorder associate high risk fistula formation include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy d. Other clinically significant disorder : i. active infection require systemic treatment within 28 day first dose study treatment ii . serious nonhealing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 day first dose study treatment iii . history organ transplant iv . concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism thyroid dysfunction within 7 day first dose study treatment v. history major surgery follow : ( 1 ) Major surgery within 3 month first dose cabozantinib wound heal complication within 6 month first dose cabozantinib wound complication ( 2 ) Minor surgery within 1 month first dose cabozantinib wound heal complication within 3 month first dose cabozantinib wound complication In addition complete wound heal prior surgery must confirm least 28 day first dose cabozantinib irrespective time surgery The subject unable swallow tablet The subject correct QT interval calculate Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) 500 m within 28 day randomization . . Note : initial QTcF find 500 m , two additional EKGs separate least 3 minute perform . If average three consecutive result QTcF 500 m , subject meet eligibility regard The subject pregnant breastfeeding . The subject previously identify allergy hypersensitivity component study treatment formulation . 21 . The subject unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator designee .</criteria>
