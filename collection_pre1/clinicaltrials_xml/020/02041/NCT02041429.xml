	<brief_summary>This phase I/II research study evaluate combination drug call paclitaxel ruxolitinib possible treatment inflammatory breast cancer . Ruxolitinib newly discover drug show block pathway ( call IL6/JAK/Stat pathway ) may important cancer , include breast cancer . Blocking pathway may stop cancer cell grow . Ruxolitinib approve FDA patient bone marrow disease , first study use drug combination paclitaxel breast cancer . Paclitaxel ( also call Taxol ) FDA drug approve breast cancer patient . Paclitaxel work block small microtubule inside cancer cell prevent cell growth . Information laboratory experiment suggest ruxolitinib might also effect breast cancer.These study show ruxolitinib may make paclitaxel effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two phase . The objective Phase I find maximum dose ( MTD ) Ruxolitinib combine standard dose paclitaxel give weekly advanced metastatic breast cancer . Three participant enter dose ruxolitinib equal 10 mg orally twice daily weekly paclitaxel . If dose-limiting toxicity see 6 week treatment ( two cycle ) , dose ruxolitinib escalate use standard 3+3 design , 2 participant experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . The dose DLT designate MTD dose ruxolitinib use phase II preoperative study triple negative IBC . During Cycle 1 participant come clinic every week . At visit , participant physical exam ask question regard general health specific question problem participant might medication . About 2-3 additional tablespoon blood take participant 's begin ruxolitinib , Cycle 2 Day 1 , Cycle 3 Day 1 , end study research blood test . Because test perform research , clinical usefulness unknown , participant receive result test . The investigator ass participant 's tumor CT scan MRI every 2 cycle . In addition , participant tumor visible palpate ( felt ) , measure participant 's study doctor clinic . If participant history cancer bone suspect cancer bone , bone scan perform participant begin ruxolitinib . The bone scan may repeat every 2 cycle end study participant study doctor believe clinically need . Otherwise , need repeat . Photographs may take participant 's tumor ass tumor response treatment . The phase II period study treat triple negative inflammatory breast cancer participant ruxolitinib combine 12 week weekly paclitaxel follow standard care Doxorubicin Cyclophosphamide ( AC ) chemotherapy , eligible participant proceed surgical mastectomy follow radiation . The phase II study begin phase I study complete . During phase II study , participant research biopsy breast follow one week ruxolitinib give twice daily . A second research biopsy breast perform participant receive combination ruxolitinib ( MTD dose define phase I study ) standard dose paclitaxel 12 week . Participants see weekly treatment . One week complete combination therapy , participant receive standard dose doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) every 2 week 4 cycle . We evaluate effect JAK inhibition ruxolitinib tumor compare pSTAT3+ expression pre-treatment research biopsy pSTAT3+ expression second research biopsy perform one week ruxolitinib . Participants disease regression follow 12 week ruxolitinib paclitaxel follow AC chemotherapy undergo mastectomy , amount residual breast cancer assess . We correlate degree residual cancer mastectomy amount pSTAT3+ expression see research biopsy . We check standard blood test , IL-6 CRP level throughout treatment see level change response ruxolitinib treatment . This may easier method determine treatment efficacy . Standard radiation therapy give follow mastectomy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm breast cancer metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Patients may receive &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy advance disease . Either measurable evaluable disease allow . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ruxolitinib participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal Both men woman allow . The effect ruxolitinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Phase I Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants may receive study agent within 2 week initiate treatment . Participants untreated uncontrolled brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . Patients treat stable ( &gt; 4 week ) brain metastasis allow . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ruxolitinib . Participants receive medication substance strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ineligible . ( Please refer Appendix B list washout period ) . Chronic corticosteroid use excess equivalent prednisone 10 mg daily . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study ruxolitinib JAK inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ruxolitinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ruxolitinib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome . Prior chemotherapy radiation administer within 2 week initiate study treatment .</criteria>
