	<detailed_description>This phase IV multicenter trial evaluate mechanism resistance pharmacoeconomic ( PE ) impact crizotinib companion diagnostic test use real-life setting advance ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . NSCLC represent 80 % new case lung cancer . One molecular subtype NSCLC ALK-positive subtype . The anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase . Activation ALK occur formation gene fusion NSCLC , gene fusion partner ALK primarily EML4 . The result fusion protein capable activate ALK kinase domain , lead cell growth . The estimated prevalence ALK rearrangements NSCLC 3-5 % , commonly find amongst patient adenocarcinoma histology , never smoker know wild type EGFR KRAS . Crizotinib potent inhibitor ALK approve treatment advance ALK+ NSCLC patient . This example personalize medicine , patient select treatment base upon molecular assay , provide specific therapy ( crizotinib ) disease . The pharmacoeconomic impact use genetic information early treatment decision NSCLC determine . Despite benefit crizotinib , patient respond treatment patient eventually develop resistance . To date , unclear rare patient respond treatment resistance mechanism crizotinib fully elucidate . The study address two anticipated issue surround personalized medicine treatment crizotinib : - enable real-life Heath Economics Outcome Research ( HEOR ) - validate and/or identify new blood-based tissue-based biomarkers resistance crizotinib . At least 30 patient recruit Quebec Ontario PE study . Patients ask complete quality-of-life questionnaire regular interval real-life set treatment crizotinib . Approximately 25 patient recruited biomarker sub-study Quebec understand resistance mechanism crizotinib . In patient , biopsy accessible metastatic lesion obtain patient longer respond treatment , well blood sample regular treatment visit .</detailed_description>
