	<brief_title>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass BMI 27-32 Type 2 Diabetes Versus Best Medical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 subject DM2 recruit , randomise two arm . The surgical arm subject RYGB . The medical arm treat maximally utilising best mean available follow internationally available protocol/guidelines . The study population subject set test standard test similar group patient undergo standard care ( detail ) . Some test sample bio-banked . Treatment end point follow protocol treatment arm . The International Diabetic Federation ( IDF ) 2011 recommend bariatric surgery consider alternative treatment option Asian DM2 subject BMI 27 . Data effectiveness Bariatric Surgery DM subject low BMI well establish high BMI . There scant good quality data , especially Asian subject . As treatment totally fund research project , subject non surgical treatment arm benefit intense management disease restriction due cost . The surgical arm also fully fund research project . They expose standard risk associate type surgery . Subjects arm provide blood sample usual follow visit protocol close possible . RYGB major surgical procedure , significant potential complication ; process surgery afterwards , short long term . Procedure related mortality 0.3 % . Major complication may require surgical intervention include : anastomotic leakage 3-4 % , bleed 3 % , infection 3 % , venous thrombo-embolism 1 % . Some complication require prolong hospitalisation . After surgery , loose stool , dump syndrome , anastomotic ulcer occur less 3 % .Life long dietary supplement require . Longer term post surgical complication include intestinal obstruction due adhesion internal hernia , 2 % , surgery may need . This risk lifelong . Nutritional deficiency , especially compliant regular supplement intake , may occur . Drug allergies occur ; simple rash life threaten anaphylactic reaction . Blood take cause bruising , pain puncture site sometimes fainting .</detailed_description>
