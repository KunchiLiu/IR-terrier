	<brief_summary>The degree protection afford colonoscopy proximal colorectal cancer ( CRC ) appear related quality procedure , incomplete removal lesion show increase subsequent risk develop colon cancer . Some study suggest small polyp advanced histology common right leave colon ( right colon proximal splenic flexure , leave colon distal splenic flexure ) . The average size polyp right colon advance pathology contain adenocarcinoma â‰¤9 mm , whereas leave colon average size &gt; 9 mm , P &lt; 0.001 . Inadequate prevention right-sided CRC incidence mortality may due right-sided polyp advance histology harbor malignancy . These presumptive precursor cancer small possibly easily obscure residual feces , likely miss colonoscopy . Water-aided colonoscopy ( WAC ) subdivide broadly two major category : water immersion ( WI ) , characterize suction removal infused water predominantly withdrawal phase colonoscopy , water exchange ( WE ) , characterize suction removal infused water predominantly insertion phase colonoscopy . In report WE appear superior WI air insufflation colonoscopy ( AI ) term pain reduction adenoma detection , particularly &lt; 10 mm adenoma proximal colon . In multicenter , double-blinded randomize control trial ( RCT ) test hypothesis WE , compare AI WI , enhance overall Adenoma Detection Rate ( ADR ) CRC screen patient . Confirmation primary hypothesis provide evidence WE enhances quality screen colonoscopy . We also hypothesize WE may effective detect proximal colon adenoma WI AI , particularly &lt; 10 mm adenoma , thus increase proximal colon ADR proximal colon ADR &lt; 10 mm . Confirmation secondary hypothesis provide justification test WE may provide strategy improve prevention colorectal cancer increase detection adenoma screen colonoscopy . Unlike previous report single colonoscopist study , insertion withdrawal phase colonoscopy do different investigator . The second investigator blind method use insert instrument , thus eliminate possible bias procedure relate issue . Several secondary outcome also analyse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective double-blinded multicenter randomize control trial . Methods : Colonoscopy Air Insufflation , Water Immersion , Water Exchange aid insertion colonoscope ; split dose bowel preparation . Sedation available start procedure on-demand . Control method : Air insufflation colonoscopy . Study method : Water Immersion colonoscopy , Water Exchange colonoscopy . Population : Consecutive 50 70 year-old screening patient . After informed consent , assignment control study arm base computer generate randomization list block allocation stratification . Primary outcome : overall Adenoma Detection Rate . Secondary outcome : proximal colon ADR , Mean Adenomas resect per Procedure ( MAP ) , cecal intubation rate time , total procedure time ( include biopsy and/or polypectomy ) , maximum pain colonoscopy assess insertion discharge , need sedation/analgesia dosage . In addition loop reduction maneuver , position change , abdominal compression , amount infuse suctioned water insertion withdrawal , patient willingness repeat examination evaluate .</detailed_description>
