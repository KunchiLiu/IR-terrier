	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate short intermediate term outcome NanoKnife Irreversible Electroporation System use treat unresectable pancreatic cancer . In addition , study evaluate efficacy device treat symptom unresectable pancreatic cancer . The NanoKnife , System commercially available since 2009 , FDA-approved treat soft tissue tumor . The NanoKnife System receive FDA clearance surgical ablation soft tissue . It receive clearance therapy treatment specific disease condition . Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) potential dramatically widen treatment option patient pancreatic cancer . It provide minimally invasive procedure could potentially avoid radical surgery small lesion , could potentially offer palliation symptom pain , gastric outlet obstruction jaundice patient locally advance unresectable disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Ablation Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Using NanoKnife Irreversible Electroporation ( IRE ) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis pancreatic cancer dismal , five-year survival rate 4.9 % . Current treatment option include surgical resection , chemotherapy radiation . Only 15 % percent pancreatic cancer consider resectable time diagnosis . Current chemotherapeutic option limit , pancreatic adenocarcinoma poorly responsive chemotherapy . Radiofrequency ablation pancreas set locally advance unresectable disease describe case series1-6 , implementation technology limited concern thermal injury adjacent organ vessel . With 42,470 new case pancreatic cancer diagnose annually US give pancreatic cancer expect claim 35,240 life year US7 , fourth lead cause cancer death Unites States . This information support notion unquestionable need novel therapeutic strategy treatment disease . Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) potential dramatically widen treatment option patient pancreatic cancer . It provide minimally invasive procedure could potentially avoid radical surgery small lesion , could potentially offer palliation symptom pain , gastric outlet obstruction jaundice patient locally advance unresectable disease . Preliminary study IRE liver prostate demonstrate structure bile duct , ejaculatory duct , neurovascular bundle , blood vessel , urethra heal normally ablation , suggest vessel duct within around pancreas may also heal normally . Collagen matrix treatment IRE destroy thus allow structure heal normally . There evidence nerve ganglion damage . Heat base ablative therapy pancreas potential unique complication . Pancreatic necrosis believe play role create potentially life-threatening systemic inflammatory response patient severe acute pancreatitis8 , 9 presence free active pancreatic enzyme believe contribute inflammatory cascade acute pancreatitis . Irreversible electroporation could potentially cause pancreatic necrosis release active pancreatic enzyme . Additionally , pancreas surround abut several vital structure , include common bile duct , pancreatic duct , superior mesenteric artery vein ( SMA SMV ) , portal vein , stomach , duodenum . IRE non-thermic ablative modality potential achieve pancreatic ablation respect surround vascular ductal structure . Electroporation technique increase cell membrane permeability momentarily change transmembrane potential subsequently disrupt lipid bi-layer integrity allow transportation molecule across cell membrane via nano-size pore . This process - use reversible fashion - use research drug gene delivery cell . Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) method induce irreversible disruption cell membrane integrity ( loss cell homeostasis ) result cell death without need additional pharmacological injury . Because IRE non-thermal technique , change associate perfusion-mediated tissue cooling ( heat ) relevant . While cell ablation region destroy , underlie extracellular matrix damage thus allow tissue ablation zone heal normally . IRE administer general anesthesia administration atracurium , cis-atracurium , pancuronium equivalent neuromuscular blocking agent . This mandatory prevent undesirable muscle contraction .</detailed_description>
