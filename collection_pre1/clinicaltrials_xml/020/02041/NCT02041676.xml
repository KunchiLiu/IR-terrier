	<brief_title>Chest Physiotherapy Technique Increasing Inspiratory Flow Weaning From Non Invasive Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment evaluate contribution chest physiotherapy technique increase inspiratory flow ( IIF ) administer 3 time per day duration 3 10 minute accord tolerance infant interrupt require period rest . This technique utilise exclusive nasal respiration increase thoracic compliance premature infant . The physiotherapy practice engenders progressive increase inspiratory flow physiological limit infant ( expired volume clinical tolerance ) . After assured system well place , follow inspiration close infant 's mouth manner add follow two simultaneous parameter ventilation : force inspiration PEP deliver ventilator . Regarding Bi-phasic Positive Airway Pressure system non invasive ventilation trigger movement captor place skin low thoracic cage , physiotherapist generate first force inspiration follow respiratory rhythm infant . The infant thus trigger inspiratory aid machine simultaneously PEP deliver force provoked inspiration.The respiratory rate infant however underestimated machine may detect ineffective respiratory effort . The physiotherapy session shall carry physiotherapist service train technique assist nurse treatment shall start 24 hour follow extubation/ wean form mechanical ventilation . The evaluation clinical improvement do daily basis mode non invasive respiratory support adapt accordingly . The objective project show chest physiotherapy permit decrease duration non invasive ventilation treatment group compare control group without treatment ( group receive usual care without chest physiotherapy extubation ) . Along expect diminution duration non invasive respiratory support , also evaluate efficiency IIF technique duration oxygen dependence , duration hospitalisation premature infant special care unit , proportion infant diagnose bronchopulmonary dysplasia 36 week post menstrual age establish WALSH test well presence atelectasis chest X ray do within 7 day follow extubation . Eventual nociceptive effect evaluate pain score realise session . This randomise controled therapeutic trial compare two open parallel group : - A treatment group benefit chest physiotherapy technique increase inspiratory flow ( IIF ) 3 time per day along usual surveillance carry non invasive ventilation . - A control group usual surveillance carry non invasive ventilation without chest physiotherapy . The research shall carry one center . A draw assign treatment group carry physiotherapist present receive eligibility infant . The randomisation do physiotherapist aid electronic database CLEANWEB accord list pre establish balanced randomisation ( size block divulge investigator physiotherapist ) verification criterion inclusion information explanation protocol parent . Duration inclusion : 24 month Duration participation infant : 4 month maximum treatment follow till discharge . Duration research : 28 month Randomisation shall do 24 hour follow extubation . At time investigator interrupt study prematurely medical administrative reason . In case early termination do mutual discussion appropriate documentation motif ( example letter abandon investigator ) investigator inform CPP . If want , parental authority holder time opt participation child study . In case unless specifically desire otherwise , data obtain inclusion child analyse This withdrawal study change quality clinical management infant . A termination study consider case insufficient recruitment , unresolved technical problem , express desire investigator repeat unjustified violation protocol . In set pathology might put stake vital prognostic patient Surveillance Committee establish able : - Follow distribution event two arm study make sure imbalance two . - Make appropriate recommendation need ( Eg : modification protocol ; continuation , suspension early termination study etc . ) ''</detailed_description>
