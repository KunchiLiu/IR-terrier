	<brief_summary>The objective work development validation ( reliability validity ) Automatic image analyzer assess retinal vessel caliber ( ALTAIR ) platform analyze validate utility different clinical setting . Methods / Design Design : In first phase , cross- sectional study second phase prospective observational study annual follow-up 4 year . The study conduct primary care include 386 subject . Main measurement : blood pressure , carotid intima-media thickness use carotid ultrasound , central blood pressure wave velocity pulse SphygmoCor system , Cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) VASERAÂ® VS1500 , evaluation hypertrophy ventricular use digital ECG renal injury . Retinal vascular evaluation do non-mydriatic TOPCON TRCNW200 get focused papilla , nasal temporal develop software image automatically calculate thickness retinal vessel , arteriovenous index , vascularize area branch pattern . For validation software retina intra inter - observer variability , correlation tool measurement AVindex , concurrent validity parameter vascular structure function target organ damage association analysis analyze different parameter estimate retina evolution appearance new lesion target organ . Discussion The validation tool contribute analysis retinal vessel improve reliability reduce intervention observer validate use information previously use , especially surface vascularization vessel branch pattern .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design set In first phase , observational descriptive study , primary objective validating instrument develop . Later , second phase prospective observational study , annual follow-up 4 year . The study conduct field primary care . The study population subject 30 75 year cardiovascular risk factor define European Hypertension Guide 2013 meet define exclusion criterion : patient comply requirement protocol due mental / cognitive impairment , partner , educational understanding limitation severe comorbidity would endanger life next 12 month . By consecutive sampling patient refer research unit assessment cardiovascular risk , participation request meet inclusion criterion reason exclusion size estimate sample . Sample size estimate detect correlation coefficient velocity pulse wave parameter retinal 0.15 , alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.20 , estimate loss difficulty technical abandonment monitor 10 % , 386 subject , include study require . Software Validation retina For validation retina software Follow step previous train evaluator make evaluation image . 1 - intra- observer variability . Assessing repeatability measurement , operator must measure picture individual , least twice . To , operator evaluate 100 image random subsample 50 patient gap one week two embodiment . In case , operator image analyze day information previous assessment . 2 - inter-observer variability . To assess reproducibility measurement system , new operator , different phase 1 , evaluate 100 image previously analyze . This operator ignore result obtain previous phase . The two operator experience field use software , addition , receive previous training . 3.- And retina develop software program provide result evaluation arterial / venous , thickness vein artery index . To assess degree agreement two methodology ( AVindex ) valuation 100 image make two tool . In way , show new method provide result improves daily practice objective faster processing result . 4.- The validity measurement analyze total sample , 386 772 subject fundus , analyze relationship result carotid intima-media thickness measure vascular structure , speed pulse wave measure vascular function arterial stiffness gold standard ( arterial stiffness ) Cardio Ankle vascular Index , renal function , electrocardiographic parameter estimate Framingham cardiovascular risk . 5.- also association different parameter estimate retina evolution appearance new lesion target organ cardiovascular monitoring patient four year second phase project analyze event</detailed_description>
