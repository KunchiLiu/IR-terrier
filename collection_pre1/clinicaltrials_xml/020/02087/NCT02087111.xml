	<brief_summary>Patients genotype 3 hepatitis C advance liver disease ( cirrhosis ) high chance develop fatal complication disease unless receive effective treatment . Unfortunately best drug currently available treat genotype 3 hepatitis C ( pegylated interferon ribavirin ) work 50 % patient advance liver disease therefore large number patient fail treatment wait new , good drug . Currently treatments available patient . Telaprevir new drug license treat genotype 1 hepatitis C work well patient . In patient genotype 3 hepatitis C small scale trial laboratory study show patient respond quite well others respond little bit give telaprevir . In patient exhausted treatment option investigator speculate telaprevir treatment may help patient clear infection . The purpose study see telaprevir help patient determine investigator predict advance people help .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label , 'proof concept ' study examine hypothesis telaprevir effective patient genotype 3 HCV cirrhosis fail respond pegylated interferon ribavirin . The study examine hypothesis pretreatment viral test identify patient respond antiviral therapy telaprevir . Patients eligible study ask willing participate wish join study ask sign inform consent form . After sign consent form patient attend hospital screen trial . This involve physical examination blood sample take . Patients provide injection pegylated interferon self administer every week along ribavirin tablet ( 4 tablet day ) telaprevir tablet ( 6 tablet day ) . Patients teach self administer pegylated interferon medication . Patients reattend every week next 4 week . At visit ask question medication taking , question feel side effect 30 ml blood take . At fourth visit ( week 4 ) amount circulate HCV assess use standard laboratory assay patient telephone within 1 week visit . If viral load 1000 IU/ml therapy stop chance patient respond therapy low ( clinical study genotype 1 HCV patient respond viral load &gt; 1000 IU/ml week 4 ) . If patient respond therapy ask continue medication see 4 week later ( 8 week initiate therapy ) . At week 8 therapy patient ask question medication taking , question feel side effect blood take . Again viral load test viral load 1000 IU/ml therapy viral load decrease 3 log baseline therapy stop chance patient respond therapy low . If patient respond therapy ask continue medication see 4 week later ( 12 week initiate therapy ) . At week 12 therapy patient ask question medication taking , question feel side effect blood take . At visit tell stop take telaprevir tablet recommend duration telaprevir therapy 12 week . Patients continue take pegylated interferon ribavirin . Patients see every 4 week another 8 week continue take pegylated interferon injection every week 4 ribavirin tablet every day . At clinic visit ask question medication taking , question feel side effect blood take . After 24 week therapy ( i.e . 4 week last visit ) patient see asked question medication taking , question feel side effect blood take . At visit tell stop take medication . They ask return 12 week . 12 week stop therapy patient return clinic ask question feel side effect blood take . They ask return 12 week . 24 week stop therapy patient return clinic ask question feel side effect blood take . The study end return routine clinical follow see clinical team .</detailed_description>
