	<brief_summary>Clinical Investigation Design A prospective , open-label , non-randomized , interventional clinical study , sponsor Endospan Ltd . Patients followed-up five year . Investigational Device The Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Stent Graft System designate Delivery System . Purpose The purpose study evaluate safety performance Horizon™ AAA Stent Graft System treatment infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac aneurysm . The result study used supportive data CE Marking submission European Union ( EU ) . Objectives The primary objective study evaluate safety performance Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System . Primary End Points Safety endpoint include proportion patient free device relate Major Adverse Events ( MAEs ) within 1 month endovascular procedure . Performance endpoint include successful delivery deployment device ; absence follow 1 month follow-up : aneurysm growth ≥5mm , type I III endoleaks , stent graft occlusion , conversion open surgery , rupture stent graft migration . Subject population Thirty ( 30 ) patient infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac aneurysm , Iliac/femoral access vessel morphology compatible vascular access technique device . Treatment All patient treat implantation Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Stent graft System .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Possible benefit : It believe Horizon™ AAA Stent Graft System implantation may offer number benefit conventional recently develop treatment option patient suffer AAA . These treatment modality include open surgery recently evolve EVAR . The Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System low profile 14Fr implant percutaneous approach . The modular bottom-up construction require single-sided femoral access need cannulation contralateral limb , requirement present majority commercially available device . These feature anticipate result simplify procedure less surgical trauma , short procedure time , low level radiation exposure short hospitalization period . Moreover , device flexible enough reach also tortuous anatomy fixation element reduce concern migration type I endoleaks . As , believe Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System may potential clinical advantage may exhibit benefit commercially available stent-grafts . Hypothesis : In clinical study safety performance primary endpoint compare HORIZON™ report Lifeline Registry Endovascular Aneurysm Repair ( Control ) .</detailed_description>
