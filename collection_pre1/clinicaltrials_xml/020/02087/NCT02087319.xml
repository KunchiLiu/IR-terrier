	<brief_title>Effect PRP Therapy Hair Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hair loss disorder hair undergoes aberration growth cycle fall scalp . A number factor like hormone , genetic factor , diet , endocrine abnormality , systemic illness , drug intake , hair shaft abnormality may cause hair loss . Androgen alopecia male pattern baldness common cause hair loss cause progressive shortening anagen increase number hair follicle telogen , significant influence psychological distress . Except medical treatment baldness surgery , new interest treat hair loss baldness stimulate use platelet plasma growth factor obtain patient 's platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) . PRP portion plasma fraction autologous blood high concentration thrombocyte , activate Thrombin release multiple growth factor , include platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) , transform growth factor beta ( TGF-Î² ) . PRP known capacity stimulate cell proliferation differentiation . The action platelet plasma growth factor development hair follicle already establish . PRP also show increase yield implant follicular unit male baldness surgery . Our study focus advantage PRP treatment hair loss male pattern baldness . PRP autologous blood mixed thrombin appropriate ratio inject region scalp interested . We track evaluate regularly effect efficiency PRP human hair growth .</detailed_description>
