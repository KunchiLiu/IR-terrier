	<brief_title>Prognosis Factors Cardiac Complications After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation ( LT ) standard treatment chronic acute hepatic insufficiency 87 % one-year survival . Cardiovascular complication common LT incidence 6 month range 25 50 % . These complication associate significant morbidity represent third cause post LT mortality . Myocardial perfusion image stress echocardiography , use preoperative cardiovascular evaluation , enough efficient predict risk post LT cardiovascular complication . However , improve prediction capacity cardiovascular disease fundamental order well select candidate LT develop preventive strategy . Such strategy could reduce morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease LT improve result LT. Cardiovascular biomarkers troponin natriuretic peptide know predictive factor postoperative cardiovascular complication non cardiac surgery . The use biomarkers combination conventional test could improve preoperative prediction post LT cardiovascular complication . Hypothesis : The preoperative biomarkers dosage could improve prediction cardiovascular complication occur year LT .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients older 18 year , list LT chronic hepatic disease . Noninclusion criterion : emergency LT , patient guardianship trusteeship . Secondary exclusion criterion : Patient list liver transplant death , improvement , existence contraindication Patient present laboratory test older 1 year liver transplantaion . Patient include 2 year time Liver transplantation .</criteria>
