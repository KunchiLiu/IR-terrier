	<brief_summary>Study Purpose : The purpose clinical trial determine extended-release quetiapine dose 300 mg daily tolerable people relapse remit progressive MS . The investigator also determine investigator increase dose 300 mg daily within 3 day people relapse remit MS within 2 week people progressive MS . The investigator determine least two third study participant tolerate drug well enough continue 4 week . Tolerance determine separately people relapse remit progressive MS. People progressive MS may less tolerant side effect great underlie brain injury MS. Alternatively , people progressive MS may gain benefit improved sleep usually occur use quetiapine may willing tolerate side effect . This clinical trial determine maximally tolerate dose future trial drug . The number participant study depend tolerability dose test . A maximum 18 people relapse remit MS 18 people primary secondary progressive MS include . Study Design : The cohort expansion design ( 3+3 ) use determine toxicity-based dosing . This design use oncology phase I trial guide patient safety minimizes number participant expose toxicity ( Ivy et al . 2010 ) . Maximum toxicity define 33 % less . In model , three patient comprise initial cohort . In absence DLT treatment may escalate next high dose next group three patient . However , one three patient reach DLT cohort expand six patient verify toxicity rate exceed reach 33 % . When toxicity rate exceeds reach 33 % cohort , dose deem maximum administer dose low dose use next group three patient . Patients RRMS progressive MS evaluate separate group use different dose schedule .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Multiple sclerosis cause episodes inflammation injure kill nerve cell cell coat myelin . These episode inflammation may cause relapse ( attack ) inflammation may detectable brain MRI . Inflammatory episodes main feature relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) . Most relapse prevent current treatment RRMS . This remain important dead nerve cell replace . Fortunately , also repair process rescue injure nerve myelin cell . An important aspect repair regeneration myelin form cell . If myelin protect even replaced nerve well chance survival . However injured myelin repair replace nerve cell protect likely later also die ; may underlie process cause progression . The investigator obviously need therapy MS reduce frequency relapse silent episode inflammation . The investigator need treatment help repair . Quetiapine medication show stimulate myelin form cell ( call oligodendrocyte ) improve myelin repair mouse . It therefore may also improve myelin repair people MS . However , test effect quetiapine myelin repair , investigator must first determine medication safe dose tolerate people MS short-term treatment trial . Quetiapine currently approve Canada treat several psychiatric condition include depression psychosis . It also show useful treat anxiety insomnia . Quetiapine available extend release pill take daily . Doses 800 mg per day may use treat condition investigator estimate dose 300 mg daily need stimulate myelin repair . It clear dose 300 mg well tolerated people MS may need medication treat condition . Visit schedule : Screen period , baseline , week 1 [ telephone ] , week 2 [ telephone ] , week 3 [ telephone ] , week 4 , week 8 . Treatment quetiapine XR last 4 week day 28 . On day 29 , dose quetiapine taper 50 mg every two day avoid development withdrawal syndrome insomnia . Treatment Dose schedule : Quetiapine XR dose schedule relapsing-remitting MS Group 1 Dose schedule Day 1-3 : 50 mg Day 4-6 : 100 mg Day 7-28 : 150 mg Day 29-30 : 100mg Day 31-32 : 50mg Group 2 Dose schedule Day 1-2 : 50 mg Day 3-4 : 150 mg Day 5-6 : 200 mg Day 7-28 : 300 mg Day 29-30 : 250mg Day 31-32 : 200mg Day 33-34 : 150mg Day 35-36 : 100mg Day 37-38 : 50mg Group 3 Dose Schedule Day 1 : 50 mg Day 2 : 100 mg Day 3 : 200 mg Day 4-28 : 300 mg Day 29-30 : 250mg Day 31-32 : 200mg Day 33-34 : 150mg Day 35-36 : 100mg Day 37-38 : 50mg Quetiapine XR dose schedule progressive MS Group 1 Dose schedule Day 1-14 : 50 mg Day 15-28 : 100 mg Day 29-30 : 50mg Group 2 Dose schedule Day 1-5 : 50 mg Day 6-10 : 100 mg Day 11-15 : 150 mg Day 16-28 : 200 mg Day 29-30 : 150mg Day 31-32 : 100mg Day 33-34 : 50mg Group 3 Dose Schedule Day 1-5 : 50 mg Day 6-10 : 100 mg Day 11-15 : 200 mg Day 16-28 : 300 mg Day 29-30 : 250mg Day 31-32 : 200mg Day 33-34 : 150mg Day 35-36 : 100mg Day 37-38 : 50mg Measures : 1 . Determination dose-limiting toxicity Dose-limiting toxicity patient study define early discontinuation quetiapine XR due AE possibly , probably definitely due use study drug . Patients discontinue medication due AE still keep trial safety assessment week 4 8 . Because small number treat participant anyone discontinues study drug reason adverse event unrelated use study drug exclude analysis replace . The dose-limiting toxicity determine group patient : RRMS progressive MS . The maximally tolerate dose dose escalation schedule future trial dose few 33 % participant reach dose-limiting toxicity . This differ group patient , RRMS progressive MS. 2 . Scales 1 .
