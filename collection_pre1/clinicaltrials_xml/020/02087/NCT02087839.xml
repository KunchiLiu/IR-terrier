	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To assess safety oral therapy ZD6474 evaluating frequency , severity , duration treatment-emergent adverse event patient poor prognosis lung cancer . - To record extent , frequency duration tumor response treatment regimen ass whether ZD6474 augments efficacy radiation therapy non-small cell lung cancer patient . - To determine recommended phase II dose ZD6474 future clinical study radiation therapy . Secondary Objectives : - To determine effect metabolism angiogenic factor positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan/computed tomography ( CT ) scan , Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , circulate endothelial cell level patient treat ZD6474 radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy ( XRT ) ZD6474 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) : Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD6474 new drug think block formation new blood vessel . The growth new blood vessel call angiogenesis . Angiogenesis think essential growth tumor beyond small size . Before treatment start , several test procedure perform . These test include complete medical history physical exam , include recent weight loss , vital sign , test check easily swallow . Laboratory test need require urine sample , blood sample ( 3-4 teaspoon ) . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test order participate study . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) , heart function test , scan brain , chest , bone . You also PET scan perform . You may take part study patient NSCLC able receive chemotherapy . If eligible participate , receive ZD6474 mouth day every day , along radiation therapy . You must take medication empty stomach , approximately time morning . ZD6474 swallow whole tablet ( chew , crush divide ) take 8 oz water . Missed dos may take end calendar day . However , subject miss take scheduled dose day , must take next schedule dose miss dose make . The missed dose must document patient medication diary ZD6474 give 5-7 day start radiation therapy continue entire course radiation therapy , unless proof cancer progress . ZD6474 may interact many commonly prescribed medication . A list provide . Radiation give every weekday ( Monday - Friday ) 3-7 week doctor think necessary useful . You weekly evaluation radiation treatment , include blood sample ( 3-4 teaspoon ) routine test , oxygen saturation ( test measure much oxygen blood ) , physical examination . If need anti-nausea medication ( Zofran ) study , ECG perform within 24 hour start medication least week remain medication . You continue study , unless evidence disease gotten worse intolerable side effect occur . You see follow-up visit one month complete radiation therapy , 3 month . You come follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , year . Scheduled test follow-up perform within 1 week ( ) schedule time period ( 14-day window ) . At visit , blood draw ( 3-4 teaspoon ) , urine test x-ray . You ECG , lung function test , PET/CT scan . Participants blood donor donate blood study 3 month follow last dose study treatment . This investigational study . ZD6474 FDA approve , authorize research . A total 48 patient take part study . All patient enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>
