	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , multi-centered study 365 day duration device implantation . A maximum 12 site enroll 160 patient . Each patient screen undergo baseline evaluation follow unilateral bilateral implantation Deep Brain Stimulation system . During implantation procedure , patient undergo trial stimulation operating room . The device may internalize successful intra-operative trial later surgery ( later 4 week initial lead placement ) . If device activate immediately post-surgery , patient may return clinic determine optimum stimulation programming . Device program optimize many visit necessary follow implantation . The day device fully implant classified `` Day 0 '' patient . After `` Day 0 '' patient return clinic evaluation , Day 90 ( + 14 day ) , Day 180 ( + 14 day ) Day 365 ( approximately 12 month + 30 day Day 0 ) . These evaluation consist Clinical Rating Scale Tremor ( CRST ) , Quality Life Essential Tremor ( QUEST ) , Short Form questionnaire ( SF36 ) , Patient caregiver Global Ratings Patient Satisfaction Rating . At Baseline Day 180 , CRST evaluation session video record analysis independent evaluator unaware functioning device . Additionally , Day 180 visit , physician option provide patient amplitude control . A comparison measure within person pre-treatment post-treatment performed . Also , pre-treatment post-treatment group mean standard deviation determine . After 1 year study patient may enrol another protocol ( C-06-03 ) additional 4 year . This observational , long term follow study continue monitor safety efficacy Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System . If necessary , C-06-03 protocol patient continue access investigational device compassionate use protocol ( C-13-02 ) .</detailed_description>
