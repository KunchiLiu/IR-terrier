	<brief_title>e-Pharmacovigilance II - Surveillance Safety Effectiveness - Calling Earlier Detection Adverse Reactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study team wide experience survey primary care patient medication problem , establish important component detect understanding ADEs among ambulatory patient . In first study , 18 % primary care patient report problem due medication previous year , document 3 % medical record . A subsequent study find 27 % patient report medication-related symptom , 69 % patient discussed symptom physician . Upon notified via automated pharmacovigilance , physician change therapy response 76 % symptom , 21 % symptom previously discuss result preventable ADE 2 % result preventable ADE . During prior CERT , investigator develop interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) interoperates health system EHR , demonstrate IVRS use monitor ambulatory patient assess adherence , medication relate symptom , ADEs . This study build initial work . The safety prescription drug represent ongoing public health concern . A study US General Accounting Office ( GAO ) find 51 % approve drug least one serious ADE recognize approval process , reflect careful selection limit number patient participate pre-approval trial . While pre-market study detect commonly occur ADEs efficacy rigorously select participant , design assess safety effectiveness broad population eventual user . While FDA maintains passive adverse event reporting system , estimate 1 % ADEs 10 % serious ADEs report , case report lack accurate denominator estimate incidence . While effort underway substantially expand capacity active surveillance use electronic health record claim data , data may fully capture patient experience , clinician often fully document patient ' symptom . Accurate ascertainment ADEs effectiveness clinical practice require real-time system integrate patient-reported information clinician decision-making . Telephonic IVRS low-cost , sustainable way reach primary care population , independent visit . In addition monitoring ADEs , technology could use systematically assess treatment outcome commonly document medical chart functional status , sleep , mood . This 5 year project three phase : ( 1 ) development pilot test integrate pharmacovigilance system ; ( 2 ) implementation ; ( 3 ) assessment translation dissemination system , include data collection patient provider . The RE-AIM ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) conceptual model provide framework examine success translation dissemination system , use third phase project .</detailed_description>
