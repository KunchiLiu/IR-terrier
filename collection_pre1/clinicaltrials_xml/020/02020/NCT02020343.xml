	<brief_summary>America 's preferential consumption high-fat/high-sugar food drive force current epidemic obesity insulin resistance . Recent scientific observation suggest taste food may play role body process food eaten meal . The intestine may play central role aspect dietary fat metabolism , initial encounter taste bud mouth eventual triglyceride ( TG ) storage body . The investigator hypothesize elevate blood fat insulin resistance result elevate intestinal-TG secretion poor communication organ rest body meal . In study , meal feed sensory study perform determine whether mechanism taste-associated intestinal signal lead high level blood fat meals 24 healthy , insulin resistant type 2 diabetic subject . Individuals consume special meal night test participate sensory test morning analyze effect taste . The goal work understand insulin resistance may cause impaired signal taste bud intestine result elevation blood lipid , increase risk chronic disease . This study generate data future study understand diabetes treatment affect process .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy subject ( age 1850y ) categorize : lean/insulin sensitive ( IS ) ( n=8 , BMI &lt; /= 24 kg/m2 SI â‰¥ 2.5 min1 104 * per uU/mL ) overweight/obese IS ( n=8 , BMI 2635 SI &gt; 2.5 min1 104 * per uU/mL ) overweight/obese insulin resistant ( n=8 , BMI 2635 SI &lt; 2.5 min1 104 * per uU/mL ) . Overweight/obese insulin resistant subject family history diabetes define least one parent grandparent type 2 diabetes , least one family member type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetic patient ( BMI 2635 , OGTT 2h glucose &gt; /= 140 mg/dL . BMI 35 kg/m2 : We felt prudent limit additional variability could cause morbid obesity ( diabetes ) , give early stage research area . Unusual eating habit ( dietary fat &lt; 30 % &gt; 40 % energy , skip breakfast , daylong fasting , allergy milk ) . Habitual food intake influence taste acuity milk use formula dissolve isotope . Uncontrolled hypertension , occasional regular smoker , use supplement medication interfere lipid , protein , carbohydrate metabolism impact taste . For example , hypertensive drug thiazide supplement chondroitin sulfate niacin , associate impair glucose tolerance . ACE inhibitor betablockers smoke affect taste . Use insulin case type 2 diabetic . Pregnancy ( urine test ) , breastfeed , anemia ( CBC diff ) : Limitations blood drawn . Postmenopausal woman frequently increase blood lipid since lack estrogen influence lipid metabolism . Alcohol intake : Males &gt; 140 g/week , females &gt; 70 g/week . Excess EtOH increase lipid synthesis secretion liver whether also impact intestinal TG metabolism unknown . Fasting plasma TG &gt; 300 mg/dL . Extreme hypertriglyceridemia could due either elevation VLDL chylomicron , either would impair ability resolve dietary metabolic process . Exclude need consume acetaminophencontaining medication regular basis . Acetaminophen administer meal assess gastric emptying . Postmenopausal woman .</criteria>
