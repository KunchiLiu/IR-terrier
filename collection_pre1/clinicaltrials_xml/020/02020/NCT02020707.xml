	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation bevacizumab treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery cancer cervix , endometrium , ovary , fallopian tube peritoneal cavity . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD-malignant melanoma [ MM ] ) Abraxane ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) /bevacizumab-complex ( AB-complex ) among patient metastatic malignant melanoma . II . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD-gynecologic [ GYN ] ) AB-complex among patient gynecologic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To gather preliminary data tumor response rate progression free survival time AB-complex among patient metastatic malignant melanoma . II . To gather preliminary data tumor response rate progression free survival time AB-complex among patient gynecologic cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Pharmacokinetics paclitaxel administer context AB-complex . II . Tumor concentration paclitaxel 24 hour ( h ) follow AB-complex infusion correlation plasma level . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation/bevacizumab-complex intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
