	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma First Relapse Refractory First-Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate carfilzomib 8 cycle treatment patient first-relapsed myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate single agent carfilzomib 4 cycle treatment . II . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To assess time progression ( TTP ) . IV . To assess duration response ( DOR ) . V. To assess toxicity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect carfilzomib alone combination dexamethasone follow biologic end point correlation response : measurement bone remodel ( sodium fluoride F 18 positron emission tomography [ PET ] , serum marker bone remodel bone marrow osteoblastic osteoclastic differentiation function ) measurement disease response proteasome activity bone marrow microenvironment . II . To describe recapture response progression maintenance phase . OUTLINE : TREATMENT PHASE ( COURSES 1-8 ) : Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve less partial response ( PR ) also receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) IV weekly course 4-8 . MAINTENANCE PHASE ( COURSES 9-14 ) : Patients receive carfilzomib IV 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 . Patients receive dexamethasone Treatment Phase continue receive dexamethasone PO IV weekly . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
