	<brief_summary>The Wnt proteins belong family protein demonstrate play role formation dissemination tumour . The present project focus critical role Wnt-5a protein pathobiological process lead metastatic cancer disease . WntResearch identify formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment , name Foxy-5 , mimick effect Wnt-5a impair migration epithelial cancer cell thereby act anti-metastatic . The aim present clinical phase 1 trial establish recommend dose clinical phase 2 study thereby develop Foxy-5 first class anti-metastatic cancer drug . Foxy-5 design inhibit development metastasis reduce motility cancer cell thereby increase survival rate patient solid malignant tumour .</brief_summary>
