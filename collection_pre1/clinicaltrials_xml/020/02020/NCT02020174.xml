Participant medical information store electronically within Registry . The name Registry participant delete stored medical information replace linkage code , make record de-identified . Access participant medical information contain within Registry restrict Principal Investigator designees . Participants ask provide permission share de-identified ( cod ) information registry databases . This information may use retrospective research plan clinical trial . Participants ask allow Foundation investigator review information determine participant may eligible participation future research study conduct secondary investigator ( affiliated Foundation ) . Interested Registry participant contact possible participation future research study conduct secondary investigator undergo separate informed consent process research study . The Registry 's Steering Committee conduct formal review proposal investigator-driven research project provide recommendation PI . The PI , Registry 's current protocol , must grant final approval study conduct use medical information contain within Registry . Such approval shall obtain prior provide investigator information Registry ; shall base upon consideration scientific quality validity ; shall grant research study relate PE related hypertensive disorder pregnancy ; shall document . Prior provision data investigator , information shall de-identified . The Registry shall require investigator obtain IRB approval prior provision de-identified information investigator . Approved scientist , researcher , clinician , give de-identified information may search de-identified data patient study . If affect individual look like good match specific study , researcher contact Registry . A Registry staff member contact participant participant 's family . Researchers directly contact participant family see de-identified data . It choice Registry participant family decide initiate direct contact interested researcher . Data Management Statistical Analysis The information collect registry maintain MedSciNet , company base Sweden specialize development online database system registry , clinical trial , medical bio bank . The data safety monitoring plan registry involve routine monitoring Principal Investigator designees 1 ) removal direct identifier information contain within registry ; 2 ) documentation provision de-identified registry information investigator ; 3 ) security database link registry linkage code participant identifier documentation access database purpose gather data investigator ; 4 ) condition may negatively impact confidentiality information contain within registry . High data quality achieve use standard data entry field ( numeric , date , time , dropdown , radio , checkbox field , open text , etc . ) well apply standard validation rule ( mandatory , range dates/numeric field , data type , etc . ) Predefined code list use ensure standardized value choose . Clinical data enter via form comprise mainly checkboxes , drop menu specify value field . A open text box field capture natural history individual participant experience . Built-in data check prevent error data entry , contribute ease use non-technical user . All history change individual data value keep database . The information keep change data value include user perform change , date time change , old new value . Reviewing audit trail available individual data point level form level . For collection outcome data , standard , well-validated outcome instrument use data harmonization criterion establish Co-Lab , reVITALize data definition validate American Congress Obstetricians Gynecologists , common data point suggest Women 's Health Registries Alliance . Using instrument help ensure basic data capture Registry compatible interoperable across registry biobanks may share research data . Beyond instrument , remain question formulate base input Registry 's volunteer Scientific Advisory Council input patient review Foundation 's Community Forum social medium networks patient ' research question typically express . These validation effort , already voluntarily undertaken , demonstrate Foundation 's intention maximize use Registry willingness commitment participate network amplify Registry 's research potential .
