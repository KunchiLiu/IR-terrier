	<detailed_description>Core Safety Follow-up Component • For subject : To evaluate post-treatment safety follow-up child adolescent subject dilutional ( euvolemic hypervolemic ) hyponatremia previously participate tolvaptan hyponatremia trial . Optional Tolvaptan Treatment Component • For subject receive optional tolvaptan treatment : To demonstrate tolvaptan safely effectively achieve maintains increase serum sodium concentration child adolescent subject dilutional ( euvolemic hypervolemic ) hyponatremia use multiple short-term treatment , and/or longer chronic treatment .</detailed_description>
