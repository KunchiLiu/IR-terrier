	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate feasibility closed-loop ( automate ) fluid administration system deliver fluid use feedback standard operating room hemodynamic monitor . In standard anesthesia care rate IV fluid administration patient determine anesthesiologist care patient . In study protocol , rate fluid administration determine instead closed-loop ( automate ) control system supervision anesthesiologist . The system independently decide give fluid rate ; supervise anesthesiologist monitor system ensure appropriate volume deliver intervene necessary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed-Loop Fluid Administration System Using Hemodynamic Monitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In protocol test hypothesis closed-loop fluid administration maintain high cardiac stroke volume ( show improve patient outcomes surgery ) anesthesiologist management . We show case multiple simulation study in-vivo animal study , yet experimentally clinical setting . Investigators recruit patient surgical record require cardiac output monitor undergoing surgery require mechanical ventilation consent participate study include study . They receive standard patient care way anesthetic surgical procedure alter part study , exception fluid administration . Fluids usually give patient base physician 's discretion . As part study patient receive fluid management via closed loop ( automate ) system use infusion pump ( Q-Core ) controller ( computer run index algorithm develop Sironis ) make frequent , regular accurate adjustment amount fluid patient receives use feedback standard operating room monitor UCI ) . Data study retrospectively compare subject case match evaluate difference cardiac output , total fluid give , patient outcome .</detailed_description>
