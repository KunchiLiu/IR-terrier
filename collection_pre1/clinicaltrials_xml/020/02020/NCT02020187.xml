	<brief_summary>Congenital myopathy clinical genetic heterogeneous disorder characterize skeletal muscle weakness . Most patient experience muscle weakness fatigue throughout life . However , progression symptom rare . There specific treatment congenital myopathy . Training show benefit several muscle disease weakness , defect congenital myopathy involve contractile protein sarcomere , effect training uncertain condition . The investigator therefore investigate effect cycle-ergometer training 30 minute , three time weakly , ten week 15 patient congenital myopathy . Another 5-10 congenital myopathy patient , train , serve control trained patient . The study start end test day , efficacy base VO2max , performance functional test questionnaire assess .</brief_summary>
