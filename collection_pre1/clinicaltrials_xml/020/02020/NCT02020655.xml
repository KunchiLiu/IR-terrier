	<brief_summary>Background : A pressure ulcer localize tissue injury superficial layer skin and/ underlie tissue . Pressure ulcer likely develop skin area expose pressure , shear friction . Shear- force important contribute factor wound dress possibly capable reduce shear force skin . At moment 's good marker detect effect shear- force skin . A potential marker could cytokines ( IL-1α ) release mechanical loading skin . A previous study show significant increase level IL-1α application pressure . We want investigate cytokine significant increased application shear- force skin . Objective : The objective study gather knowledge cytokine concentration ( IL-1 α ) skin healthy volunteer application shear- force . We want use knowledge future investigate different prophylactic wound dressing capable reduce shear force skin . This could interest prevention pressure ulcer . Study design : With use special develop shear- force model go administer 20 Newton ( 2 kg ) shear palmar side arm 10 healthy volunteer 30 minute . As control ware go put shear- force model arm without application shear- force . Before use shear- force model perform cytokine measurement use Sebutape . Sebutape capable absorb cytokine skin . After use shear force- model perform cytokine measurement . Then extract cytokine Sebutape use ELISA . Study population : 10 Healthy volunteer Age 18- 30 year Primary outcome : IL-1 α concentration ( pg/ml )</brief_summary>
