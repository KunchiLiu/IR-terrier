	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , take ipilimumab degarelix surgery remove prostate , follow degarelix ipilimumab surgery , prostate cancer . The goal trial ass safety efficacy multimodality approach combine hormone immunotherapy prostate cancer population consider incurable standardly treated hormone alone , represent clinical state prior development castration-resistant disease . There 2 cohort . The first use ipilimumab degarelix prior follow radical prostatectomy men newly diagnose , oligometastatic , castration-sensitive disease . The second cohort include men already receive definitive local therapy radical prostatectomy since experienced biochemical and/or metastatic recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Target Population : Cohort A Patients castrationsensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer receive primary local therapy ( radiation surgery ) , 5 month prior androgen deprivation therapy . The subject must age 18 old , willing able provide inform consent . The subject must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate tissue confirmation select study site . The subject must newly diagnose prostate cancer metastatic site ( ) . The subject must history presence ≤ 10 bony metastatic lesion Note : bone mets clearly identify bone imaging , biopsy proven allow History presence distant metastatic lymph node ( ) ( e.g. , retroperitoneal nonregional pelvic lymph node ) allow History presence regional pelvic lymph node ( per AJCC Cancer Staging [ 7th edition ] ) consider metastatic site great 1.5cm short dimension . The subject must Karnofsky performance status 80100 . Normal organ function acceptable initial laboratory value : WBC ≥ 2000/μL ANC ≥ 1000/ μL Platelets ≥ 75 x 103/μL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C ( negative screening test require ) . The subject must deem medically fit radical prostatectomy attend urologic surgeon select study site . Men father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 26 week last dose ipilimumab ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . Patients meet criterion list eligible Cohort A entry : Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 5 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer superficial bladder cancer Major surgery within 4 week enrollment ( Week 1 Visit ) . Current prior radiation therapy prostate Prior radiation metastatic site ( e.g. , palliative radiation ) allowed.. More 5 month prior hormonal therapy ( e.g. , gonadotropin hormone release analog , megestrol acetate , casodex ) . There washout period require GnRH analog . A two week washout require megestrol antiandrogen . Prior use 5 alpha reductase inhibitor allow ( limit duration use ) , however two week washout require . Prior ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate , enzalutamide treatment prostate cancer . Current prior investigational therapy prostate cancer , chemotherapy administer intent treat prostate cancer . Concomitant therapy experimental drug . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Disease , exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre syndrome myasthenia gravis ) . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator make administration ipilimumab hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . Patients underlying heart condition deem ineligible surgery . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 1 month dose ipilimumab ) . Note : Inactivated vaccine allow time study . A history prior treatment ipilimumab prior CD137 agonist CTLA4 inhibitor agonist . Concomitant prior therapy following : IL2 , interferon , nonstudy immunotherapy regimen ; immunosuppressive agent ; ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid within 6 week study entry . Persons reproductive potential unwilling use adequate method contraception throughout treatment least 26 week ipilimumab stop . Patients history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , GI obstruction abdominal carcinomatosis know risk factor bowel perforation . Target Population : Cohort B The subject must age 18 old , willing able provide inform consent . Histologically confirm prostate cancer progressive disease , define : Rising PSA ( 50 % increase level 1 ng/mL , base least 3 PSA determination obtain least 1 week apart ) . The 50 % rise PSA across 3 determination , determination need sequential . PSA double time ≤ 12 month calculate accord Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center nomogram ( http : //www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/10088.cfm ) The subject must Karnofsky performance status 80100 . Normal organ function acceptable initial laboratory value : WBC ≥ 2000/μL ANC ≥ 1000/ μL Platelets ≥ 75 x 103/μL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C ( negative screening test require ) . Prior radiotherapy prostate ( adjuvant salvage radiotherapy ) allow Men father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 26 week last dose ipilimumab ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . Target Population : Cohort B Patients meet criterion list eligible Cohort B entry : Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 5 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer superficial bladder cancer Major surgery within 4 week enrollment ( Week 1 Visit ) . Visceral metastatic disease More 3 cycle intermittent hormone ( treatment biochemical recurrence castration sensitive metastatic disease ) , cycle define period consistent androgen deprivation therapy ( generally 312 month ) follow intentional cessation ADT without reinitiation ADT PSA rise . Prior use 5 alpha reductase inhibitor allow ( limit duration use ) , however two week washout require . Current prior investigational therapy prostate cancer , chemotherapy administer intent treat prostate cancer . Concomitant therapy experimental drug . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Disease , exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre syndrome myasthenia gravis ) .
