	<brief_summary>Invasive Aspergillus infection ( IAI ) occasionally occur immunocompromised people . Except administrate empirical anti-fungal agent , use objective parameter support tentative diagnosis IAI order make anti-fungal treatment specifically also important . At present , serum galactomannan ( GM ) test less-invasive , non-cultural , time-saving examination augment diagnosis Aspergillosis . It suggest Infectious Disease Society America ( IDSA ) 2008 screen monitor tool Aspergillosis , cut-off value adjust 0.5 USA FDA . However , clinical practice , GM seem good predict value even sensitivity specificity declaim 80 % . Other controversial issue include reproducibility GM5 effect piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotic accuracy GM baseline In study , serum GMs examine two condition , one collect establish baseline collect piperacillin-tazobactam administration . We hope confirm validity GM baseline effect piperacillin-tazobactam GM value Taiwan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posaconazole Salvage Therapy Aspergillus Pulmonary Infection .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We try enroll patient follow hematology department TCVGH diagnose probable pulmonary Aspergillus infection proven pulmonary Aspergillus infection . If poor response current think effective agent pulmonary Aspergillus ( eg , amphotericin B , Voriconazole , itraconazole ) 2 week , choose receive Posaconazole salvage therapy study . However , study want quantification therapeutic response , enrol patient agree let u check serum galactomannan level begin per 2 week . They also receive chest CT begin end posaconazole treatment . The rule timing evaluate clinical doctor ( hematology department ) per 2 week , posaconazole poor effect disease , clinical doctor decide terminate posaconazole administration . Another effective agent give posaconazole fails .</detailed_description>
