	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Direct Dorsal Column Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Please note : This phase I feasibility study meet expect enrollment goal 75 . The study enrol 6 subject therefore participant complete phase II trial described . The primary objective study test hypothesis direct dorsal column stimulation safe treatment medically refractory , chronic neuropathic pain . The study examine feasibility Direct Dorsal Column Stimulation use exist Stimulation Leads ( Ad-Tech ) . Secondary endpoint include pain relief , somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEPs ) , stimulator setting require , improvement quality life use pain medication . Design &amp; procedure This study design prospective , control exploratory study acute duration SCS trial system implantation . We quantify perception pain stimulation-evoked paresthesia response epidural subdural direct dorsal column SCS . Additionally , measure effect SCS modality somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEPs ) , patient quality life , satisfaction treatment . The normal clinical course SCS chronic pain include trial period 3-30 day test stimulation deliver via temporarily implant epidural electrode external percutaneous stimulation device . These electrode remove end trial period , follow successful trial , permanent set electrode stimulation device implant later date . Subjects study recruited patient plan undergo percutaneous trial paddle lead SCS implantation care Dr. Nandan Lad Duke University Medical Center . Those subject ) post-laminectomy pain syndrome consider good candidate SCS trial , b ) previously successful SCS become refractory c ) adequate coverage prior SCS trial , ) deem refractory treatment would otherwise receive intrathecal catheter/pump chronic narcotic administration consider participation . Subjects recruit study provide write informed consent prior undergoing research procedure ( see `` Selection Subjects '' ) . Following consent prior surgery , record subject demographic pain history , include age , sex , pain etiology , history prior pain-related surgery . Subjects complete baseline assessment pain use revise short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( SF-MPQ-2 ) long form Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . Baseline measure quality life global function measure EQ-5D-5L descriptive system revise Self Assessment Treatment ( SAT ) questionnaire , respectively . After baseline measure record , research study conduct two phase . Study Phase I occur SCS implant surgery . First , epidural trial SCS lead place accordance normal standard care procedure . Next , test stimulator ( Cadwell ES-5 ) connect test lead intraoperative test stimulation deliver 30 minute determine effect spinal level , amplitude , frequency , pulse width direct dorsal column stimulation . Sensation threshold paresthesia strength coverage area record response change stimulation parameter . SSEPs record throughout procedure ( Cadwell Cascade Elite IONM System ) . These record use needle electrode place tibial nerve scalp . Next , Ad-tech subdural trial lead insert standard fashion , similar standard lumbar drain catheter , connect test stimulator . Test stimulation quantification response repeat additional 30 minute . The test stimulator disconnect test stimulation complete , surgery continue per normal standard care secure two trial lead place post-operative percutaneous trial SCS . Successful SCS trial lead placement typically define least 50 % reduction pain adequate paresthesia coverage painful area threshold use determine efficacy phase study . Subjects meet either efficacy criterion eligible participate second phase study . The subdural trial electrode remove subject , continue normal clinical epidural SCS trial procedure . Subjects enter Phase II study instruct continue usage analgesic medication pain treatment necessary , record use provide diary . This diary also use query subject adverse event side effect daily basis . The second phase study occur postoperative multi-day percutaneous SCS trial period . A hand-held trial stimulator typically use deliver test stimulation trial period use deliver stimulation standard care research study . A representative St. Jude Medical ( SJM ) work patient throughout trial program system optimal setting , per normal standard care , involve collection research data . During first half study Phase II , trial SCS deliver subdural lead ( i.e . epidural lead ) . Methodological limitation prevent randomization order trial lead activate Phase II , study staff blind location active SCS lead . However , subject tell trial lead use study complete . The SJM representative initially program subdural trial lead day surgery standard stimulation setting . Subjects assess current pain intensity use numeric rating scale ( NRS ) take short-form BPI , item # 6 . Subjects discharge hospital receive pain questionnaire diary fill next three day . On follow two day , subject complete pain quality life rating use short BPI , EQ-5D-5L descriptive system , two NRS pain assessment ; paresthesia coverage map paresthesia quality rating also complete quantify sensory response SCS . On third day follow surgery , subject complete NRS pain assessment , instead complete SF-MPQ-2 SAT addition rating . This conclude first half study Phase II . The normal clinical course trial stimulation continue supervision Dr. Lad SJM representative 11 day evaluate efficacy trial SCS lead . Subjects return Duke Spine Clinic ( 1B ) end period evaluation , x-ray imaging confirm trial lead location , removal subdural trial lead . The epidural trial lead activate , mark begin second half study Phase II . All study procedure first half Phase II repeat , time use epidural trial lead . Subjects continue normal clinical evaluation epidural trial lead care team , follow removal epidural trial lead Duke Spine Clinic . The study team review study participation subject collect remain diary time . Description Procedures perform : The surgery perform Principal Investigator , Dr. Nandan Lad MD , PhD . Tuohy needle percutaneously place epidural space , use standard loss resistance technique subdural stimulation lead pass advanced fluoroscopic guidance . The needle remove , lead test stimulation degree pain relief . Figure eight suture use 2.0 Silk use anchor skin . Tuohy needle percutaneously place lumbar subdural space , similar standard lumbar drain catheter insertion . An Ad-Tech lead pass advanced fluoroscopic guidance . The lead test stimulation degree pain relief . The lead anchor place post-operative percutaneous SCS trial ( ≤14 day ) . Figure eight suture use 2.0 Silk use close skin . Trial lead remove gently pull discard lead use standard technique . All subject lay flat 30 minute minimize risk low pressure headache follow lead removal , consistent standard practice lumbar spinal catheter . Selection Subjects It anticipate total 75 individual study . Subjects recruit Spine Clinic Duke overseen Dr. Lad , respectively . Subjects participate volunteer basis inform consent approve Institutional Review Board Duke University Medical Center . Apart medically refractory chronic neuropathic pain , individual good health . . The age range 18 year old .</detailed_description>
