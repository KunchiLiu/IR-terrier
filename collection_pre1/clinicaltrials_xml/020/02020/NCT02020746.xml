	<brief_summary>The main objective study assess safety efficacy EscharEx prepare wound 's bed patient hard heal venous leg ulcer , diabetic low extremity ulcer traumatic/post operative wound . This study multi-center , assessor blind , randomize , control study intend demonstrate superiority EscharEx debriding treatment Gel Vehicle control treatment patient hard heal wound . 72 + 24 adult &gt; 50 % necrotic/slough/fibrin non-viable tissue hard heal wound ( venous leg ulcer , diabetic low extremity ulcer traumatic/ post operative wound ) 5 cm2 200 cm2 ( surface area stage 1 ) 3 cm2 - 150 cm2 ( stage 2 ) , enrol study . Patients undergo 1 week screen period ( 2 visit ) include : record demographic , medical history concomitant medication , vital sign , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , wound photography assessment questionnaire ( wound status quality life ) . During period wound treated standard treatment per decision physician . During screen period , subject whose study wind size ( surface area ) decrease 20 percent exclude . Following completion screen process , eligible patient randomize either EscharEx Gel vehicle debridement treatment . In stage 1 ( 72 patient ) : Treatment perform 10 application complete debridement achieve , whichever occur first . In stage 2 ( 24 patient ) : Treatment perform 8 application complete debridement achieve , whichever occur first . Following application wound wash , photograph assess wound size , removal nonviable tissue change granulation tissue ( digital planimetry software ) , wound status , safety parameter . Subsequent debridement treatment wound dress moist-to-moist saline gauze ( except successive 24h 48h treatment perform , second stage ) . Following completion debridement treatment period , patient treat accord standard procedure evaluate ( wound assessment ) week complete wound closure 12 week last application ( 12 visit ) . Only first stage study , patient achieve wound closure , additional 3 monthly ( 3 visit ) follow- visit wound closure recurrence conduct . Quality life ( QoL ) evaluate last follow-up visit - 3 month post wound closure follow-up period . For patient n't achieve wound closure 3 month FU visit conduct . For patient enrolled second stage , wound closure achieve 12 week follow-up , additional visit perform 2 week later confirm wound closure .</brief_summary>
