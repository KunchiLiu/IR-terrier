	<brief_summary>The Primary objective study : 1 . To determine cardiac safety TH-302 patient advance solid tumor The Secondary objective : 1 . To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) TH-302 2 . To evaluate whether association plasma exposure TH-302 active metabolite , Br-IPM , effect cardiac repolarization 3 . To assess safety antitumor activity TH-302 patient advance solid tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cardiac Safety Study TH-302 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study patient advance solid tumor treat TH-302 ass safety , pharmacokinetics , potential effect cardiac repolarization antitumor activity patient advance solid tumor . A dose 480 mg/m2 TH 302 administer IV infusion 30 minute Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle . Evaluations safety , PK , ECG parameter cardiac repolarization perform Study Day 1 Day 2 Cycle 1 . Cycles repeat every 28 day , toxicity , progressive disease , patient investigator decision discontinue treatment , maximum six treatment cycle . Patients clearly benefit treatment base anti-cancer disease control tolerability able continue receive drug past 6 cycle discussion Sponsor . Tumor assessment perform every 2 cycle treatment . The rationale conduct study base ( ) prior data demonstrate clinical benefit advance solid tumor define tumor response stable disease least 4 month , ( b ) tolerability TH-302 propose dose , ( c ) requirement perform dedicate ECG study address clinical evaluation potential QT/QTc interval prolongation TH-302 .</detailed_description>
