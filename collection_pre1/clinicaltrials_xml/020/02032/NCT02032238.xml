	<criteria>CSME Diagnosis diabetes mellitus Able willing provide inform consent prior studyrelated procedure Central foveal thickness &gt; 250 micron baseline Best correct visual acuity 20/400 20/40 Willing able comply clinic visit studyrelated procedure U.S. patient require Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization ; country , applicable accord national law Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , macular ischemia , vitreomacular traction , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc . ) Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . History treatment diabetic macular edema time past 4 month ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid , antiVEGF drug , treatment ) . History panretinal ( scatter ) photocoagulation ( PRP ) within 4 month prior enrollment . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 4 month anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization . 13 History YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization . Aphakia . Intraocular pressure &gt; = 25 mmHg . History openangle glaucoma ( either primary openangle glaucoma cause openangle glaucoma ; note : history angleclosure glaucoma exclusion criterion ) . History steroidinduced intraocular pressure ( IOP ) elevation require IOPlowering treatment . Exam evidence external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , significant blepharitis Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry Known allergy component study drug Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . Major surgery within 28 day prior randomization major surgery plan next 6 month . Myocardial infarction , cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antivascular growth factor ( antiVEGF ) proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization 14 For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month . Subject expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center first 12 month study .</criteria>
