	<brief_summary>Based limited publish epidemiological data , alarm 1 50 surgical inpatient die within 30 postoperative day . Based data B-Unaware ( NCT00281489 ) BAG-RECALL ( NCT00682825 ) clinical trial , 30-day postoperative mortality among high-risk surgical patient comparable Barnes-Jewish Hospital , 1-year mortality among high-risk surgical patient may high 10 % . Short- intermediate-term postoperative mortality therefore press public health concern . Similarly , postoperative major morbidity - include delirium , stroke , myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation , blood clot , renal dysfunction , wound infection , pneumonia , respiratory failure , loss functionality , chronic pain - occur commonly affect substantial proportion surgical patient , critically ill patient patient undergoing procedure chronic pain . Many factor associate strongly independently postoperative mortality major morbidity : patient age , functional status , comorbid medical condition , duration invasiveness surgery , among others .

	<brief_title>Systematic Assessment Targeted Improvement Services Following Yearlong Surgical Outcomes Surveys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarch purpose SATISFY-SOS implement rigorous process ass short-term intermediate-term outcome surgical procedural patient receive anesthesia service Barnes-Jewish Hospital facility , locate St. Louis , Missouri . Specifically , patient follow major morbidity event , mortality , quality life year follow procedure . Patients receive anesthesia service provide inform consent participate SATISFY-SOS . Each patient opportunity respond baseline quality life survey well two comprehensive post-procedure survey . These survey conduct either email , mail via telephone interview 30-90 day post-procedure one year . The survey question primarily comprise standardize , validate , non-proprietary survey tool cover follow topic : general health , mental health , emotional health , physical health , pain , fall , major morbidity , cognition . In addition collect patient-reported outcome , comprehensive medical record information patient begin preoperative assessment span throughout surgery procedure , hospitalization period , time spend intensive care follow-up clinic visit incorporate database . Additionally , mortality data include cause death patient ascertain via National Death Index information hospital record . This allow meaningful , comprehensive electronic data query capability . Under umbrella SATISFY-SOS initiative , intend implement specific evidence-based patient-centered quality improvement program , ensure effective implement routine clinical care . Additionally , future IRB-approved research project utilize de-identified SATISFY-SOS data . All electronic data collect exist clinical record . The primary SATISFY-SOS database host firewall-secured , HIPAA-compliant server within Department Anesthesiology Washington University School Medicine maintain manage departmental IT team . Access SATISFY-SOS data restrict web access limit project Informaticist , Data Manager , Director . Regular internal auditing data conduct validity completeness monthly basis . On annual basis , consent process audit . The data enter early registry compare data enter subsequently . Sensitivity analyse perform determine whether data miss random . It plan compare data obtain patient-reported outcome sample data medical record data obtain sample patient contact telephone . A data dictionary key data field currently compile . Standard operate procedure develop registry operation , patient recruitment , data collection , data management data analysis . No adverse event attributable activity envision . Multiple outcome track ; specific sample size calculate . Sensitivity analyse plan miss unavailable data . No imputation currently plan . The statistical analysis depend variable outcomes interest . This registry currently IRB-approved total enrollment 36,000 patient . This subject subsequent expansion , pending IRB approval .</detailed_description>
