	<brief_summary>The investigator propose preventive strategy may reduce risk placental vascular disease negative consequence fetus ( e.g. , poor fetal growth stillbirth ) mother ( e.g. , hypertensive disorder pregnancy ) , , turn , reduce need indicated preterm delivery . This strategy multicenter , randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) compare magnesium citrate supplementation placebo , start 12 20 week gestation continue delivery . Magnesium citrate safe inexpensive compound easily absorb intestinal tract . The result RCT may especially relevant low middle income country high rate prematurity , limited resource acute newborn maternal care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Trial Oral Magnesium Supplementation Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator complete multicenter double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial oral Mg++citrate supplementation . Setting : ( 1 ) Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira ( IMIP ) , Recife-Pernambuco : IMIP maintain large hospital Brazil exclusively dedicate Brazilian Health System , [ Sistema Único de Saúde ] ( SUS ) . IMIP 1,032 bed performs 2,000 clinical daily visit . IMIP enroll 6,000 delivery per year obstetric intensive care unit . IMIP teach hospital ( degree program medicine , nursing , nutrition , physical therapy , pharmacology psychology postgraduate - residency , master doctoral ) reference center woman assistance Northeast Brazil Ministry Health Federal Government . ( 2 ) Dom Malan Hospital ( HDM ) , Petrolina-Pernambuco : HDM assist population 1 million people 55 municipality Pernambuco , Bahia Piauí States . HDM assist 1,500 pregnant woman monthly emergency service performs average 528 prenatal visit include high-risk pregnancy ( ±35 % ) . HDM enroll 600 deliveries/month also obstetric intensive care unit . HDM teach program medical nursing student also develop residence program . Data collection conduct March 2014 August 2015 . Study population pregnant woman since start prenatal care visit IMIP and/or HDM 20th gestational week . At sample size 1000 woman assign placebo 2000 woman assign Mg++ citrate , power 80 % 2-sided P-value 0.05 , able detect least 22 % relative risk reduction primary perinatal composite outcome , assume primary perinatal composite outcome rate 18 % placebo group 14 % Mg++ group . In Recife 25,000 birth year . Of 25,000 , least 30 % ( 7,500 ) would attend one study prenatal clinic , &amp; 7,500 , 60 % ( 4,500 ) would meet ≥1 eligibility criterion . With participation rate 50 % , 2,250 woman recruit year , thus require 1.25 year recruit woman , 2 year ascertain primary outcome event . A systematic sample obtain low risk pregnant woman begin prenatal care visit 20th gestational week IMIP HDM , study period . Pregnant woman admit study continue normal attendance IMIP HDM . There interference researcher obstetric management patient involve study . All pregnant woman follow postpartum newborn hospital discharge.Hematologic urine test perform every month ( four time ) evaluate Mg++ concentration pregnant woman . After inclusion study , pregnant woman monitor monthly delivery . Pregnant woman attend clinic visit schedule , contact phone and/or visit . Losses randomization register respective reason . Randomization perform `` Random Allocation '' software , version 1.0 . After sign consent form participant allocate `` magnesium '' `` placebo '' group . Oral Mg++citrate , 150 mg twice daily . Each capsule contain 150 mg elemental magnesium citrate . The participant instruct take one capsule twice daily delivery . Compliance/adherence , adverse event , clinical intercurrence monitor research team routine prenatal visit completion treatment . Adherence define ingestion least 80 % prescribe dose . Quality Control Information : The form complete researcher store specific folder . All data collection check monitor . Analysis : Primary secondary endpoint compare group . Continuous data test use unpaired two-tailed t-test ( normally distribute ) Mann-Whitney U-test ( non-normally distribute ) . Fisher 's exact test use nominal data . A significance value &lt; 0.05 used test . Ethical aspect : This project submit IMIP 's Dom Malan Hospital Committee Ethical Research . Each participate woman study sign inform consent . They free withdraw trial time . The trial conduct accord WHO guideline good clinical trial practice . To ensure safety participant validity integrity data Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) create follow study . The DSMB consist 5 expert member represent follow institution involve trial : Bill Melinda Gates Foundation , Ministry Health Brazilian Government , IMIP , Dom Malan Hospital statistician . The DSMB periodically review accumulate study data pregnant woman fetus safety , study conduct , progress efficacy . DSMB also make recommendation continuation , modification termination trial . Conflict interest : Nothing declare . This project enter international registry clinical trial .</detailed_description>
