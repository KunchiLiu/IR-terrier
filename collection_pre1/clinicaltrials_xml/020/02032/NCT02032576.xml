	<brief_summary>Objective : Psychiatrists long seek quantifiable biomarker electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) response . Although ECT highly effective treatment patient major depressive episode , high rate relapse/recurrence major problem discontinuation ECT . The purpose study examine factor relate response ECT , predict ECT response early , investigate clinical predictor affect time relapse/recurrence ECT . Methods : Patients major depressive episode require ECT treatment enrol . ECT perform regularly . The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD-17 ) scale assess ECT , every 10 day , till expect average 50 day , monthly 6-month follow-up period . Other measure also perform first ECT , expect average 50 day , end follow-up period . Predictors response relapse/recurrence ECT early prediction ECT response obtain statistic method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) safe effective treatment patient major depressive episode , mechanism underlie therapeutic action treatment still unknown . Psychiatrists long seek quantifiable biomarker ECT treatment response . Till , biomarker ECT use clinical practice , potential biomarkers study include brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , DNA polymorphism , RNA , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , auditory evoke potential ( AEP ) , cognitive function test . Although ECT highly effective treatment major depressive episode , high rate relapse/recurrence major problem discontinuation ECT . The purpose study examine factor relate response ECT patient major depressive episode , predict ECT response , investigate clinical predictor affect time relapse/recurrence ECT . Methods : Subjects major depressive episode diagnose accord DSM-IV criterion require ECT treatment enrol study . ECT perform regularly use brief-pulse , constant-current device . ECT give two three time week . The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD-17 ) , Clinical Global Impression-severity ( CGI-S ) , global assessment scale ( GAF ) , UKU side effect rating scale scale assess ECT , every 10 day , till expect average 50 day , monthly 6-month follow-up period . Response define reduction 60 % HAMD-17 score treatment . Other measure collect ECT expect average 50 day include Zung 's Depression Scale ( SDS ) , Short-Form 36 ( SF-36 ) , Work Social Adjustment Scale ( WSAS ) , plasma BDNF level , auditory evoke potential ( AEP ) , electroencephalography ( EEG ) , neuropsychological test , RNA . After ECT , CGI-S , HAMD-17 , GAF WSAS reexamine monthly 6 month . The definition relapse/recurrence readmission , HAM-D-17 score least 18 , CGI-S score least 4 follow-up period . A logistic regression model use obtain predictor ECT response . To establish early prediction ECT response , receiver operate characteristic curve ( ROC ) use determine cutoff point . Possible predictor related relapse/recurrence analyze use Cox proportional hazard regression model .</detailed_description>
