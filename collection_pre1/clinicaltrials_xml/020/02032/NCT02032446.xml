	<brief_summary>MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS ( MSC ) show promising albeit always consistent therapeutic effect treatment severe steroid-resistant acute Graf versus Host Disease . Remarkably , report clinical study toxicity Mesenchymal stromal cell administration find consistently negligible . The investigator believe Umbilical Cord ( UC ) derive Mesenchymal stromal cell may represent strong immunosuppressive tool clinical emergency data suggest change safety profile cell . For reason , best interest patient , investigator plan test safety activity Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal stromal cell give sequentially another partially effective treatment steroid resistant acute graf versus host disease Pentostatin .</brief_summary>
