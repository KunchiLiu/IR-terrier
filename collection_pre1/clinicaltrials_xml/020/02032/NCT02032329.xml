	<brief_title>FastFES Gait Training Stroke Patients : Efficacy Pre-Commercial Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Difficulty walk one common effect stroke . Even rehabilitation , majority stroke survivor decrease speed , endurance , confidence , quality walking . Walking deficit cause risk fall , slow walk speed , increase effort walking , difficulty activity daily live . Restoration walk ability improve quality life , perceive major goal rehabilitation stroke survivor . There therefore renew interest research toward develop novel gait rehabilitation treatment improve exist treatment . FastFES one intervention , improve walk post-stroke use combination fast treadmill train functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) . Ongoing research University Delaware ( R01NR010786 ) show 12-week FastFES gait rehabilitation program improve walk function , activity , community participation stroke survivor . In order facilitate implementation FastFES gait rehabilitation program clinical setting , need transition currently use stimulation system portable stimulation system . The Study Device evaluation pre-commercial prototype ( developed customKYnetics , Inc. ) clinically viable portable electrical stimulation system deliver FES gait use similar timing parameter use FastFES gait rehabilitation train ongoing research . The main goal efficacy study demonstrate clinical efficacy customKYnetics FastFES prototype system improve gait individual paresis secondary stroke . Fifteen ( 15 ) post-stroke subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit participation prospective , non-randomized , non-blinded cohort interventional study . Training ( intervention session ) conduct 2-3 time per week approximately 12 week total 36 total session . Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) ankle plantarflexor dorsiflexor muscle group deliver gait cycle use variable frequency train ( VFT ) stimulation pattern . Stimulation coordinate gait cycle use data shoe-worn inertial sensor proprietary real-time signal processing algorithm . Stimulation turn 1-minute increment train bout promote motor learning . The treadmill set patient 's fast comfortable walk speed . Each intervention session conclude single overground walk session without FES . Outcome measure assessment perform follow milestone : pre-intervention , 18 training session , post-intervention , 12-week follow-up . This Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) fund efficacy study mimic study protocol use R01-funded randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Outcomes SBIR cohort compare non-concurrent ( e.g. , historical ) control group draw R01-funded RCT . The main outcome study : 1 ) validation customKYnetics ' prototype system improve gait deficit ; 2 ) comparison outcome measure patient train customKYnetics system 'fast treadmill walk FES ' arm intervention cohort RCT .</detailed_description>
