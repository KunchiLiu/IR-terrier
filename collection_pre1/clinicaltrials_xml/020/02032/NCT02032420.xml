	<brief_summary>Volunteers watch train video demonstrate place needle correct position keep visible . Later volunteer place front set identical video , ask demonstrate direct 80 mm echogenic Pajunk needle 3 target standardize homemade phantom total three time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects STAR Maneuver UGRA Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After watch train video , volunteer place front set identical video see . Adjacent set , single fellowship train regional anesthesiologist know assessor situate screen allow real time view ultrasound screen see volunteer . The assessor blind assignment volunteer . Also , assessor visualization volunteer . This prevent visualize hand body movement may cause bias . The assessor use whole study provide consistent assessment task . The task involve volunteer direct 80 mm echogenic Pajunk needle 3 target standardize homemade phantom . The target simulate nerve root commonly find interscalene block . Thus , arrange diagonally simulate nerve root position commonly see . Also , arrange tilt relative flat surface phantom simulate direction nerve travel . This important tilt target require volunteer tilt probe incidental ultrasound wave perpendicular target bright reflection occur . This phenomenon know anisotropy . This increase realism task imitate commercially available phantom . There 3 goal volunteer must fulfill perform task . Firstly , must direct needle 12 o'clock position 3 target . Secondly , must achieve maximal ultrasound image brightness 3 target time . Thirdly , entire needle must visualize time . If needle correct position , assessor verbally inform volunteer redirect correct position . If target image brightest , assessor verbally inform volunteer manipulate needle towards target target brightest . Clinically , function prevent needle insert inside nerve target clearly see . Thirdly , needle visualize entirely , volunteer tell stop manipulating needle towards target needle fully visualize manipulating probe . A timer record cumulative time needle full visualization . Clinically , function prevent needle insert nerve structure . After 3 target complete , volunteer repeat task total 3 time .</detailed_description>
