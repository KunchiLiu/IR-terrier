	<detailed_description>Specific aim 1 . Using fully cross 2 ( intensity ) X 2 ( duration ) design , investigator demonstrate dose-response relationship volume aerobic exercise change DNA methylation four month among previously sedentary woman . - Hypothesis 1 : The investigator predict interaction intensity duration characterize dose-dependent response total exercise volume , woman experience great improvement methylation high intensity/high duration ( 16.4 kcal/kg/week ) least improvement methylation low intensity/low duration ( 5.6 kcal/kg/week ) . - Hypothesis 2 : The investigator predict main effect exercise duration , woman exercise 40 minutes/session , 4 session per week show improvement DNA methylation compare woman exercise 20 minutes/session , 4 session per week . - Hypothesis 3 : The investigator predict main effect exercise intensity , woman exercise 75 % VO2max show improvement DNA methylation compare woman exercise 55 % VO2max . Specific aim 2 . There publish data extent positive effect exercise methylation might decay exercise continue . The investigator gather data natural history methylation decay training . â€¢ Hypothesis 4 : At six month follow end supervise exercise , investigator assess influence different level initial training passage time DNA methylation , covarying whether participant continue exercise . It predict high volume group show great persistence positive change DNA methylation . Alternatively , possible four group return baseline methylation level methylation , difference methylation 6 month follow end supervise exercise .</detailed_description>
