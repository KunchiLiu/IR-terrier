	<brief_summary>This study investigate innovative exciting way increase physical activity child age 9 12 year old . Families provide state-of-the-art exercise bike video game console home . The video game provide variety play include racing , puzzle solving , collaborative play , team play competitive play . We compare whether 'multi-player ' condition great adherence compare 'single-player ' condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Games Physical Activity : Can Home-based Exergame System Increase Physical Activity ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Aims study : In 2005 , number death attribute cancer surpass caused major cardiovascular disease number one cause mortality Canada , date , continue significantly impact life Canadians . As response societal individual affliction disease , imperative research initiatives become focused area primary prevention . Reports show least half new cancer case death worldwide prevent . The large impact cancer development lifestyle variable physical activity . Reviews meta-analysis show strong inverse linear relationship physical activity many prevalent form cancer include breast , lung , colon cancer ( i.e. , individual exercise less likely develop cancer ) . Unfortunately , 80 % Canadian populace fail meet recommendation . To compound problem low physical activity prevalence , large decline activity may occur early life . Obviously , regular life-long physical activity desire outcome lowering risk cancer ; thus , promotion effort target critical transition physical inactivity early life paramount . Two group parent child , make family-based physical activity initiatives arguably important target disease prevention . Unfortunately , physical activity intervention focus family home limit result negligible change physical activity child parent . Improvements require term innovation intervention . An area often overlook try increase physical participation affective expectation judgment ( expect pleasure enjoyment ) . Affective judgment central construct - form - many popular health behaviour model , yet intervention focus modification affective expectation , despite reliable robust association physical activity . One group activity potential interactive exercise videogaming ( exergames ) . Exergaming relatively unexplored topic early result commentary controversial ; topic generate many review experimental trial . Overall , emerge evidence suggest game significantly increase energy expenditure similar moderate intensity physical activity translate health-related fitness improvement . The research conduct group topic also show find . Our study employ exergames within context traditional exercise bike ( i.e. , exercise bike interact video game ) demonstrate physical activity moderate vigorous intensity range result mark fitness change . Despite positive effect , limit research available understand adherence exergames . Further , available literature exergames exercise adherence , review find exergame condition typically report high adherence various control condition long-term change negligible advantage diminish across time . Our research topic mirror overall conclusion . For example , family-based home pilot study Game-bike , show significantly high enjoyment use child exergame condition compare control bike across six week , yet prominent difference within first three week sharply decline later week . Thus , exergaming research attempt foster maintenance need demonstrate initial high participation rate sustain within context family home . This key recommendation recent systematic review exergames form rationale innovation proposal . Videogames , similar initial exergame result , show decline playing frequency game become familiar novelty wear . One successful form videogaming advent synchronous multi-player online gaming . Games Blizzard 's World Warcraft play online million people . Specifically , videogames play others online . Gamers may form online social club ( team , league `` guild '' ) allow play regularly group people . The social attachment form player strong hold `` physical '' world , contribute extremely long maintenance playtime comparison ordinary gaming . To knowledge , exergames property examine family home . Nevertheless , extensive body research effect social context support physical activity adherence behaviour suggest people likely sustain involvement physical activity set participate social , group-based , setting rather . In context trial , Canadian youth provide opportunity part virtual group ( online synchronous game play ) , likely support sense social connectedness relation youth condition , great degree enjoyment intervention ( affective judgement ) , thereafter sustain adherence behaviour . Thus , primary research question : Does interactive exergame bike augment synchronous online social play capability comparison 2 ) exergame bike condition within family home environment result great use among child ? Hypothesis : Adherence higher augmented exergame condition comparison standard exergame condition child receive opportunity play child online . The effect wane time initial measurement period across three month . Our secondary outcome parent , physical fitness , total volume physical activity perception bike also examine trial . Finally , also explore whether season ( winter/summer ) , gender ( males/females ) affect use bike . 2 . Study Design Methods Design : Two-arm parallel design single blind randomize control trial . Participants randomise one two group 1 ) exergame-augmented condition ; 2 ) exergame standard condition three month duration . Recruitment : Based prior study , participant recruit via advertisement place home flyer elementary/middle school , cub scouts/brownies , recreation centre , health care centre , child 's recreation class , shop mall online interest site . Inclusion criterion ( see ) Randomisation blinding : Families randomize 1:1 ratio either intervention control group , stratify sex use central computerised system . Participants aware group allocation , assessor blind treatment allocation . Justification sample size : Based previous research exergames , 80 family ( 40 per group ) recruit detect medium effect size ( f2 = .25 ; ( 38 ) ) adherence physical activity ( primary outcome ) type one error .05 , average correlation .75 across time DV interest , power .80 . Our sample size also consider main 2 ( group ) x 2 ( parent/child ) x 4 ( time ) repeat measure design use G-Power potential 15 % attrition rate . Procedures Protocol : After interested participant contact researcher determine eligible participate study , family visit site fitness test parent ask complete brief demographic , physical activity , quality life questionnaire child ask complete brief physical activity quality life questionnaire . We employ certified exercise physiologist ensure consistency test . The measurement team blind treatment condition participant . The family randomize one two condition . In standard group , participant play game computer-controlled opponent . In augmented exergames intervention group , participant play together , able talk via voice IP link . A Facebook page develop allow publication game news , allow player communicate game , arrange play session . For security , child parent enrol trail permit play game online . The game available play schedule time , separate time child adult . After initial six week intervention period , family give follow-up questionnaire complete via online survey tool . In addition brief questionnaire three month , however , family member ask participate brief end-of-trial qualitative interview evaluate impact intervention . Although quantitative measurement outcome provide insight potency exergames intervention , process evaluation ( whereby participant interview ) also essential examine content fidelity ( `` do '' ) process fidelity ( `` do '' ) program implementation . Measures : ( See ) Analysis : Missing data evaluate pattern missingness psychosocial variable behaviour time point use dummy coding procedure . Depending outcome test ( e.g. , miss random , miss completely random , etc . ) initiate appropriate miss data handle strategy . ITT analyse also perform addition sensitivity analysis procedure . A 2 ( condition ) x 3 ( time ) repeat measure factorial ANOVA primary outcome child adherence bike . A child household eligibility range serve analysis ( choose randomization procedure ) . Post hoc examination use Tukey follow-up procedure utilized necessary . Cluster analysis/HLM use parent/child collinearity need . The qualitative analysis incorporate accuracy , thematic analysis , cod . Timeline : We expect recruitment process ongoing across first two year study continue additional 12 month data analysis write-up . The study achievable start finish three year ( i.e. , two-funded year ) .</detailed_description>
