	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct research want determine dietary supplement , call Everycell™ , effect function study participant ' cell . The result research use help develop additional strategy try fight effect age . The primary purpose study determine effectiveness Everycell™ compare placebo ( pill nothing ) DNA damage , inflammation , stress , related factor . Taking Everycell™ medical prescription , treatment , cure know disease condition . Helping patient ' nutritional status important prevent continue worsen chronic disease also counteract effect age . Americans also difficulty compliance prescription medication due toxicity side effect . This study aim learn dietary supplement may improve nutritional status enable body normalize cellular functioning , may improve quality life . The result research use determine Everycell™ beneficial overall cellular health counteract effect age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study 6-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate effect everycell compare placebo DNA damage , inflammation , stress , related factor 30 healthy adult ( 18-55 year age ) . Participants assess baseline , 4 week ( end intervention ) , 6 week ( 2-week washout period ) , study consist two treatment arm , include : ( ) Everycell ( b ) placebo . Additionally , study examine subject health-related quality life ( QoL ) . Specific Aim . Test effect Everycell compare placebo DNA damage , inflammation , stress , related factor sample healthy adult . Hypothesis . The Everycell group demonstrate improvement DNA damage , inflammation , stress , related factor 4 6-week follow-up compare placebo . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report IRB . No substantial psychological , medical , social risk exist participant , minor discomfort associate venipuncture . The component everycell harmless without significant food allergy . No serious , untoward side effect report company consumer observe previous human study . If side effect occur , remedy discontinue asymptomatic , reintroduce 1/4 dosage , increase amount every 2 day , uneventful , full dosage achieve . A toxicology search component reveals unique toxicity characteristic material . As report CellHealth Institute , manufacturer product , many customer currently use Everycell , CellHealth Institute unaware significant toxicity . CellHealth Institute apply late scientific method ensure value safety raw material . CellHealth Institute product manufacture state-of-the-art facility , strict quality control environmental protection standard . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study , although may undergo psychological physical discomfort sometimes . The process interview assessment may cause discomfort . Discomfort fatigue may also experience complete assessment battery . Alternatives study improve DNA damage , inflammation , stress include prescription medication , exercise , dietary modification , nutritional supplement . The risk medication significant , include life-threatening , risk take nutritional supplement totally understood , since regulate US Food Drug Administration . Medications nutritional supplement , part change lifestyle behavior , may also prove beneficial DNA damage , inflammation , stress , long-term use unknown consequence . The information obtain study help determine efficacy use nutritional supplement improve DNA damage , inflammation , stress outcome . By participate study , subject may experience improve DNA damage , inflammation , stress . The risk participate study reasonable potential enhancement DNA damage , inflammation , stress improve nutritional status .</detailed_description>
