	<brief_summary>The revision data show since introduction institution ( Jules Bordet Institute ) 1998 ( 2010 , year last review case ) , 53 patient underwent neoadjuvant therapy selective sentinel lymph node dissection follow conventional axillary dissection . The analysis case show : - The lack demonstration sentinel lymph node observe 8 case ( 6 cN0 ) associate 75 % pN+ status - If scintigraphic image `` positive '' ( demonstration sentinel lymph node : 35 cN0 10 cN+ ) , result appear favorable single false negative SLN result ( False Negative Rate = 1/20 5 % ) . Therefore propose additional technique LN detection indocyanine green , hypothesize combination two different injection improve technique sentinel lymph node biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Two Techniques SLN Detection BC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective study evaluate detection rate , false negative rate overall accuracy lymphofluoroscopic research sentinel lymph node periareolar injection Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) combination comparison classical intramammary peritumoral injection 99mTc-HSA-Nanocolloids patient breast cancer . These patient currently inclusion criterion still undergo systematically complete axillary node dissection . In study ( would include least 200 patient period 2 year , least 100 patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) involve surgeon would continue perform complete axillary node dissection . The radioactive SLN would retrieve ex vivo axillary piece ( gamma probe , intramammary peritumoral injection radiocolloids day surgery , least 3 hour , scintigraphic preoperative image already perform routinely patient describe introduction 1 letter ) . These radioactive lymph node would thereafter control possible fluorescence ( fluorescence camera periareolar injection ICG operating room surgery ) . Finally , service Pathology , lymph node find pathologist axillary piece control possible fluorescence . With approach , surgeon search SLN operative duration extend . Secondary objective : The current literature result SLNB technique yet consider influence addition SPECT-CT imaging ( standard approach institute since 3 year ) planar image . In study , propose analyse prospective manner contribution SPECT-CT : contribution analysis signal intensity active lymph node SPECT slide define resection threshold correspond lymph node risk pN+ , accuracy anatomic localization , good accuracy number SLN SPECT-CT versus planar image , good definition number lymph node ( analysed CT ) cover radioactive spot ( already observe 3 adjacent lymph node one active spot ) . In last case , spot cover several lymph node would analyse possible fluorescence lymph node . The fluorescence detect lymph node analyse semi-quantitatively related pN+ characteristic ( pNi , pNÂµ , pN1 , pNmacro ) . This first analysis may major implication surgeon perform vivo research fluorescent SLN ( see also Bourgeois et al . 2003 ) . Finally , propose analyse kinetic vascular characteristic ( aspect vessel image ) ICG migration injection point axilla . We try define possible predictive parameter extend and/or macroscopic involvement axillary lymph node .</detailed_description>
