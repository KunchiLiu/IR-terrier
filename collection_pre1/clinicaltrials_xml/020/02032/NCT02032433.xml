	<brief_title>Extended-Release Naltrexone vs. Buprenorphine Opioid Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For opioid-dependent patient U.S. rest world , detoxification detoxification follow short term residential treatment , goal achieve long-term abstinence opioid misuse mainstay treatment . Nonetheless , majority patient treat way relapse opioid misuse , lead costly ineffectual cycle readmission repeat detoxification . The overarch goal CTN-0051 foster adoption new relapse-prevention pharmacotherapies community-based treatment program ( CTPs ) could substantial public health impact . To end CTN-0051 ass comparative effectiveness extend release injectable naltrexone ( XR-NTX , Vivitrol® ) , opioid antagonist recently approve indicated prevention relapse opioid dependence , versus buprenorphine-naloxone ( BUP-NX , Suboxone® ) , high affinity partial agonist indicate maintenance treatment opioid dependence , pharmacotherapeutic aid recovery . The study conduct 8 CTN-affiliated CTPs provide partner detoxification service ( inpatient/residential ) capacity maintain participant opioid-free approximately 3-7 day , capacity provide medication-assisted therapy , provide minimum one group individual counseling session per week 24-week treatment period . Up 600 eligible participant randomize treatment XR-NTX BUP-NX 24 week ( sufficient include 350 participant randomize 72 hour last opioid ) . To maximize generalizability , point randomization flexible , shortly program admission prior program discharge . A data analysis modification ( assessment whether early vs. late randomizers differential treatment effect , time relapse estimate early late randomizers separately ) occur differential treatment initiation problem case randomize prior complete detoxification ( i.e. , significantly few early randomizers able complete detoxification XR-NTX induction ) . The primary goal study estimate difference , one exist , XR-NTX BUP-NX distribution time relapse ( i.e.. , loss persistent abstinence ) 6-month trial . The primary outcome measure time event , event call relapse . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) compare outcome XR-NTX versus BUP-NX across range clinical safety secondary efficacy domain , ( 2 ) explore demographic , clinical , genetic predictor successful treatment moderator differential effectiveness ( i.e. , variable may help clinician choose treatment best give patient ) . ) , ( 3 ) collect limited dataset permit analyse economic cost benefit two treatment . Toward end 24-week treatment period , participant refer follow-up care community ( could include pharmacotherapy desire available ) , follow-up outcome assess week 28 week 36 randomization . For participant receive BUP-NX , wish continue , community resource available , study provide two-week BUP-NX taper . In ancillary genetics study plan study functional variant three gene ( OPRM1 , OPRK1 PDYN ) , know affect dynamic response opioid receptor ligands . These variant evaluate CTN-0051 contribution treatment retention , abstinence , depression . Blood collection DNA extraction occur time blood collect medical safety liver function evaluation , preclude need additional needle-stick . Coded blood sample genetics study send NIDA Center Genetics Repository .</detailed_description>
