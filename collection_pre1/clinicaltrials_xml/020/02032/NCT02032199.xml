	<brief_summary>A central goal health care maximize patient function well-being . This prompted measurement health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) encompass physical , psychological , social functioning .

The restriction involve tighten criterion patient without manifest obesity comorbidities , raise low body mass index ( BMI ) threshold 40 50 increase low age limit 18 25 year ( 11 ) . It know whether patient fulfil tight criterion benefit surgery patient meet previous criterion . This study assess HRQOL change associate Roux-en-Y gastric bypass follow-up average 22 month . The aim explore whether postoperative HRQOL variation associate identifiable socio-demographic clinical characteristic . In particular , whether HRQOL change differ patient fulfil current Danish criterion patient fulfil previous criterion .</brief_summary>
