	<brief_summary>Past research show item self-generated individual , word concept , remember good item simply read heard . The current study seek demonstrate effectiveness use principle generation effect treatment intervention improve memory functional performance individual Multiple Sclerosis learn memory difficulties.The main purpose study conduct experimental investigation effect self-generation strategy treatment , embed within practice various activity range laboratory task ( e.g . word concept ) functional task ( e.g . activity daily live ) . The treatment test gear toward help patient selfdiscover strengths ability use self-generation able utilize independently everyday life situation . Design : The propose pilot study randomize clinical trial . Participants : Participants include forty ( 40 ) person MS , age 18 65 , demonstrate memory impairment . Half participant receive self-generation training learn different type task ( experimental group ) half participant ( control group ) ask learn information receive conventional practice ( e.g . repetition ) . Expected result : We expect participant undergo self-generation-training intervention show well memory performance , functional performance , quality life , satisfaction treatment life compare participant control condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If self- generation successfully adapt applied treatment program individual MS , potential improve rehabilitation treatment facilitate new learn memory . In addition , treatment rehabilitation successful productive , expect application self-generation strategy improve learning/ relearn help improve ability individual MS maintain current lifestyle home , work , within community . We expect person MS complete propose treatment acquire trained strategy , recognize everyday situation train strategy could apply map adapt train strategy real-world situation . Fourty participant clinically definite MS objectively document impairment verbal new learn include study . Participants randomly assign either treatment group ( n=20 ) control group ( n=20 ) . Participants enrol follow informed consent procedure , expectation able participate full duration study ( 6 treatment session two assessment session ) . All participant enrol study undergo pre post treatment assessment ass level cognitive , emotional , functional performance . Treatment experimental control group consist 6 individualized treatment session , 2 x per week 3 week . Each session last approximately 45 minute , include various memory task range learn list word learn task relate everyday life . Participants control group ask perform memory task treatment group . The treatment experimental group couple self-generated learning awareness-training technique , gear toward help patient self-discover performance strength limitation integration direct personal experience . Personal experience gain practice various memory task use self-generation strategy . This propose self-generation program expect increase memory , task specific awareness functional performance ; ultimately improve quality life self-regulation .</detailed_description>
