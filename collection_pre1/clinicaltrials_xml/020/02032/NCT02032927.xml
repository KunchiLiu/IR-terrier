	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis common joint disorder elder population.The current treatment option include non-pharmacological approach ( physiokinesitherapy , diet ) fail , pharmacological approach relies first instance drug paracetamol , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( include inhibitor cyclo-oxygenase ) . However , use drug limit , roof effect concern analgesia , potential side effect . When pharmacological treatment non-opioid medication fail , moderate-to-severe pain reduces quality life patient , international guideline suggest use opioid drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The WHO analgesic ladder , even limitation , widely use guide begin opioid therapy chronic pain . According approach choice drug base intensity pain report patient ; belong first step acetaminophen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , drug fail plan introduce weak opioid ( tramadol , codeine ) alone combination . The association codeine-paracetamol , one widely use drug combination treatment moderate pain osteoarthritis , demonstrate analgesic efficacy superior paracetamol short term ; however , use less effective long term worsen multiple side effect , especially gastrointestinal result poor adherence therapy . Lately , international guideline treatment chronic pain cancer suggest possibility moving , case inadequate efficacy paracetamol / NSAIDs , directly third step , use low dose strong opioid . The side effect associate use opioids treatment chronic pain , itching , side effect gastrointestinal central nervous system effect ( drowsiness , giddiness ) , often necessitate dose reduction ( thus compromise analgesic effect ) , often result discontinuation treatment . A recent strategy face underlie cause opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) oral administration antagonist opioid receptor act specifically locally level gastrointestinal tract . This prevent minimize gastrointestinal side effect affect central analgesic effect opioid thank low bioavailability antagonist . A recent review effect chronic pain cognitive function patient describes series clinical evidence suggestive intellectual impairment predominantly associate significant psychomotor slow . An interesting corollary problematic pain-cognition represent possible neuropsychological side effect due teh use opioid drug treatment chronic pain . The objective research become determinate much analgesic relief , derive assumption opioid drug , lead improvement cognitive function without possible side effect drug .</detailed_description>
