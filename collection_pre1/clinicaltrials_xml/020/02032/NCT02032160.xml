	<detailed_description>The purpose study generate exploratory training set data identify predictive biomarkers ( measurable biological response predict something ) innate adaptive response immunisation two vaccine utilize different adjuvant technology give accord approved schedule healthy adult volunteer . The vaccine model agent select match antigen discordant adjuvant , know immunogenicity profile , assay freely available measure response , safe administer healthy adult dos schedule propose . This study strive correlate biomarker activity observe immunological response vaccination successful , biomarkers could use early stage clinical trial optimize selection vaccine candidate profile likely effective generalize use . In study , 15 subject per vaccine recruit receive immunization one two hepatitis B vaccine , Engerix B Fendrix , represent exactly match antigen ( hepatitis B surface antigen ) discordant adjuvant technology . Following screen visit , subject randomly allocate receive three dos vaccine 0 , 1 2 month . Innate immune response ( cytokine level whole blood gene expression ) dose # 1 # 3 adaptive immune response ( serum antibody antigen specific cellular response ) measure various timepoints immunisation outpatient basis . The study fund ADITEC , collaborative research programme aim accelerate development novel powerful immunisation technology next generation human vaccine .</detailed_description>

The subject previously receive vaccine Hepatitis B contract Hepatitis B infection . 6 . The subject seronegative Hepatitis B confirm screen assessment sAb , sAg , cAb . 7 . Seronegative HIV 1 &amp; 2 antibody hepatitis C antibody screen . 8 . Available followup duration study . 9 . Agree abstain donate blood three month end participation study , longer necessary . 10 . Visa long enough allow complete study ( applicable ) . 11 . The subject venous access sufficient allow blood sample per protocol . 1 . Known hypersensitivity component vaccine ( excipients : sodium chloride , disodium phosphate dehydrate , sodium dihydrogen phosphate ; adjuvant : aluminium phosphate , AS04C , aluminium hydroxide ; Hepatitis B antigen produce yeast cell ) subject exhibit hypersensitivity Hepatitis B vaccine , history allergy opinion investigator would contraindicate subject participation . 2 . Presence primary acquire immunodeficiency state total lymphocyte count le 1,200 per mm3 present evidence lack cellular immune competence e.g . leukaemia , lymphoma , blood dyscrasia , patient receive immunosuppressive therapy ( include regular use oral , inhaled , topical parenteral corticosteroid ) . 3 . Use immune suppress immunomodulating drug within 6 month Visit 1 ( screen ) . 4 . Regular use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( route administration include topical ) within 6 month Visit 1 ( screen ) consider study physician likely interfere immune response . 5 . Receipt vaccine within 30 day visit 2 . Other vaccine ( e.g . travel ) may administer visit 13 14 . 6 . Currently participate another clinical study investigational noninvestigational drug device , participate clinical study within 3 month precede Visit 1 . 7 . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , compromise subject 's ability meet protocol requirement complete study . 8 . Receipt blood product immunoglobin , blood donation , within 3 month screen . 9 . Unable read speak English fluency level adequate full comprehension procedure require participation consent .</criteria>
