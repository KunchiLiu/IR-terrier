	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study safety efficacy total marrow lymphoid irradiation ( TMLI ) combination two chemotherapy drug , etoposide cyclophosphamide , preparative regimen donor stem cell transplant treat patient high-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) fail previous therapy . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) use image provide three-dimensional view area irradiate . Doctors shape direct radiation beam area multiple direction avoid , much possible , nearby organ . TMLI method use IMRT direct radiation bone marrow . Radiation therapy give transplant suppress immune system , prevent rejection transplant cell , wipe remain cancer cell . TMLI may allow great radiation dose deliver bone marrow preparative regimen transplant cause few side effect standard radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Following patient safety lead-in , evaluate anti-tumor activity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( alloHCT ) preparative regimen - TMLI , cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) etoposide ( VP-16 ) , assess 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate overall survival ( OS ) , cumulative incidence ( CI ) relapse/progression , non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100 day , 1 year 2 year . II . Evaluate early late toxicities/complications organ severity , characterize organ dose/dose volume , include acute/chronic graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) , infection , longer-term complication ( via protocol # 07173 00029 ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo image guide TMLI day -9 -5 , receive etoposide intravenously ( IV ) day -4 cyclophosphamide IV day -2 , undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow transplant day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
