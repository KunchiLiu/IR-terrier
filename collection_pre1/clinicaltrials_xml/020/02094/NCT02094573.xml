	<brief_title>A Phase 2 , Multicenter , Randomized Study AP26113</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , phase 2 , open-label , multicenter , international study evaluate efficacy safety two different dose regimen AP26113 patient ALK-positive , locally advanced metastatic NSCLC previously treat crizotinib . The primary objective study determine efficacy AP26113 , evidence confirm objective response rate ( ORR ) , assess investigator , per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . Two dose regimen test . The secondary objective study ( dose regimen ) include confirm ORR , assess central independent review committee ( IRC ) , per RECIST v1.1 ; CNS response ( ORR progression free survival [ PFS ] ) , per RECIST v1.1 , patient active brain metastasis ) ; time to/duration response ; time treatment ; disease control rate , per RECIST v.1.1 ; PFS ; overall survival ( OS ) ; safety tolerability ; population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ; patient-reported symptom lung cancer health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . Exploratory objective ( dose regimen ) include correlation AP26113 exposure efficacy safety correlation tumor plasma biomarkers AP26113 efficacy safety . It estimate accrual complete within 18 month ; total estimate duration study 3 year .</detailed_description>
