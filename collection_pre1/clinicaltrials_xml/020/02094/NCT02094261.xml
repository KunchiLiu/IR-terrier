	<brief_title>Phase II AZD9291 Open Label Study NSCLC After Previous EGFR TKI Therapy EGFR T790M Mutation Positive Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open label , single arm study assess safety efficacy AZD9291 ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) patient confirm diagnosis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive T790M mutation positive NSCLC , progress follow prior therapy approve Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) agent . Patients must agree provide biopsy central confirmation T790M mutation status follow confirm disease progression recent treatment regimen . The primary objective study assess efficacy AZD9291 assessment Objective Response Rate accord RECIST 1.1 Independent Central Review .</detailed_description>
