	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria disease affect many child adult Uganda Africa . If treat , make people severely ill. TMP-SMX ( Trade names Bactrim , Septrin ) drug give child bear HIV-positive mother help prevent infection . Studies show TMP-SMX also may kill malaria infection early stage infection body , may positively impact way body fight malaria infection . Researchers want know give TMP-SMX 6 month longer usual help child fight malaria well way . Objective : - To find take TMP-SMX longer usual help fight malaria infant . Eligibility : - Infants 0-6 week age HIV negative . Design : - Infants screen medical history physical exam . A small amount blood take . The mother medical record review . Mothers ask breastfeed . - Participants take TMP-SMX accord doctor order . In Uganda , mother get mosquito net insecticide per standard care . - Participants come clinic month , every month , study end 2 3 year . Each visit repeat screen visit . - Participants also visit clinic every month medical history , physical exam , different blood test . - Six week breastfeed stop , child take TMP-SMX come clinic either take drug continue take drug 6 month . - If child becomes sick , important mother bring RHSP clinic Rakai .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria remain one significant cause morbidity mortality throughout world . Recent study indicate drug use HIV management antimalarial property . In animal model , prophylactic dos trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMPSMX ) , antibiotic commonly use prophylaxis opportunistic infection HIVexposed HIV-infected patient , show arrest liver stage development malaria parasite . Indeed , liver stage malaria parasites may important target since stage clinical symptom absent few parasite present . TMP-SMX , use HIV-exposed HIV-infected subject opportunistic infection prophylaxis , significantly reduce clinical malaria , even area moderate high transmission intensity high antifolate drug resistance . It possible reduction liver stage parasite burden contributes unexpected effect . Nonetheless , contribution liver-stage parasite kill reduction clinical malaria observe patient receive TMP-SMX remain undescribed . Our primary objective aim answer whether TMP-SMX reduces liver stage malaria infection . For exploratory objective , interested TMP-SMX effect development anti-infection malaria immunity effect transmission . In mouse , TMP-SMX prophylaxis repeat malaria exposure show induce protective , anti-infection immunity malaria ( Charlotte Hobbs , unpublished data ) , distinct naturally acquire immunity , multiple infection , patient less severe disease . TMP-SMX impact development malaria-specific immunity , however , require investigation . Also , TMP-SMX show sporonticidal ( mosquito-oocyst killing ) activity level achieve patient TMP-SMX prophylaxis susceptible strain P. falciparum , effect TMP-SMX transmission field remain undescribed . This randomize study plan enroll 164-220 HIV-uninfected , HIV-exposed ( HUE ) 60 HIV-uninfected , HIV-unexposed ( HUU ) child Kalisizo Hospital Health Center , Labor Delivery Unit , Kalisizo , locate within Rakai District , Uganda . HUE child randomize 1:1 2 arm . In first arm ( Standard Care [ SOC ] arm ) , 82-110 child receive TMP-SMX 6 week cessation breast-feeding ( age 12-18 month ) . In second arm ( Extended Prophylaxis [ EP ] arm ) , 82-110 child receive SOC remain TMP-SMX additional 6 month cessation breast-feeding . The 60 HUU child serve control establish baseline infection parameter community . Blood drawn subject monthly via heel/finger stick analyze malaria parasitemia . Additionally , venous blood drawn every 6 month analyze cellular humoral immunity . The duration study participation minimum 2 3 year . Assessment TMP-SMX impact liver stage malaria infection development protective anti-infection immunity child help guide decision regard TMP-SMX prophylaxis duration HIV-exposed child malaria endemic area .</detailed_description>
