	<brief_summary>Byler Disease result homozygous missense ( G308V ) mutation ATP8B1 gene . The disease typically manifest first year life basis complication cholestasis ; common presentation include jaundice , poor growth , bleed relate vitamin K deficiency , and/or weak bone relate vitamin D deficiency . Early management Byler Disease direct nutritional issue tend responsive medical intervention , unlike pruritus/scratching remains devastate problem . Progressive liver disease develop Byler Disease lead cirrhosis end-stage liver disease . This open label expand access protocol RAVICTI child Byler Disease . The primary hypothesis administration RAVICTI child feasible , well tolerate safe . It also hypothesize RAVICTI treatment lead improvement biochemical marker liver disease may ameliorate prevents development scratch behavior manifestation pruritus attribute liver disease .</brief_summary>
