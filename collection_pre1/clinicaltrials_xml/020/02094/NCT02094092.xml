This prospective , single center , Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled Study . The study conduct accord GCP guideline accordance declaration Helsinki . The protocol informed consent approve ethical committee study center prior initiation . Enrollment infant study take place procurement write informed consent parent . Minimum 60 patient recruit assessed 1 week treatment characterize pattern product related adverse event ( per ICH- E1Guidelines criterion require safety assessment drug intend short term treatment ) . Personal clinical data collect CRF give Investigator period 3 week treatment date randomization treatment initiation . Follow-up causality assessment medically significant event also undertaken.Study comprises 5 total visit include Visit 1 recruitment , screen treatment initiation visit . Clinical evaluation patient eligibility assess visit final enrolment . Patient ask come day7 ( visit 2 ) , day14 ( visit3 ) , day21 ( visit4 ) , visit one week visit 4 ( follow visit 5 ) monitor change treatment parameter also assess AaDR . Any lab require do discretion investigator . Patient instruct promptly report unexplained side effect . 1 . Study Analysis Upon completion study duration , data analyze find effect efficacy point set conclude study result . For statistical analysis , Data enter analyzed use SPSS version19 . Some esoteric statistical test apply like percentage calculate check efficacy comparison apply pair t-test , also graphical representation , make bar chart pie chart . 2 . Study Duration : Study plan complete 28 day first enrollment . The visit screening/enrollment ( V1 ) schedule day 7 ( V2 ) , 14 ( V3 ) , 21 ( V4 ) , 28 ( V5 ) . Follow-Up visit 5:21day 's treatment follow one follow visit one week . 2.The study physician examine infant visit . Parents encourage keep infant study follow-up visit even case discontinuation study product . 3 . For current study measure Parent 's perception colic severity 10-cm VAS score 0 indicate pain 10 indicate worst pain . For assessment Parental/family quality life , 0 indicate effect 10 indicate good effect . Parents instruct use VAS scale prior study . At Screening V1 , V4 Follow Up V5 Visits 0 -- -- -- -1 -- -- -- -- 2 -- -- -- -- 3 -- -- -- -- 4 -- -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- -- 6 -- -- -- -- -7 -- -- -- -- 8 -- -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 10 Poor fair good good excellent 3 . Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) : Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) valuable efficient way identify patient risk `` perinatal '' depression . The EPDS easy administer proven effective screen tool . Mothers score 13 likely suffer depressive illness vary severity . The EPDS score override clinical judgment . A careful clinical assessment carry confirm diagnosis . The scale indicate mother felt previous week . In doubtful case may useful repeat tool 2 week . The scale detect mother anxiety neurosis , phobias personality disorder . The mother ask check response come close feel previous 7 day feel today . 4 . It plan enrol at-least 60 patient study . 5 . All patient right withdraw point treatment without prejudice . The investigator discontinue patient time medically necessary . It document whether patient complete clinical study . If patient study treatment observation discontinue , reason record sponsor notify promptly . Reasons patient may discontinue participation clinical study consider constitute one following : - Adverse event ( ) , include event result death - Abnormal labs result ( ) - Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect - Protocol violation - Patient withdraw consent - lose follow-up - Administrative problem 6 . It imperative obtain complete follow-up data patient whether receive assign treatment discontinue study drug . Every attempt make collect follow-up information except patient specifically withdraw consent release information . 7 . Oil base L reuteri ProTectis DSM 17938 ( five drop per day=108CFU ) 21 day use study product intervention group . The placebo ( provide BioGaia AB Stockholm Sweden ) oil base malt dextrose formulation Appearance , Packaging taste intervention . Both placebo study product label - Randomization number - Batch number - Expiry date - And statement `` For clinical trial use '' . Arm A : ProTectis drop ( five drop per day ) 21 day . Arm B : Placebo drop ( five drop per day ) 21 day . Sponsor provide study medication whole study period . 8 . As per available clinical data Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 till date , drug / food interaction clinical significance report . However important keep sensitivity profile Probiotic bacterium antibiotic . 9 . The treatment , dosage period administration study drug administer must document . A monitor review patient source document drug accountability record assess treatment compliance on-going basis site visit . 10 . Investigational product store secure area . It responsibility investigator ensure investigational product dispense study patient . The investigational product must dispense official study site authorize personnel . It responsibility investigator ensure current record investigational product disposition maintain study site . Upon completion termination study , unused and/or partially use investigational product must return sponsor . 11 . This study conduct compliance ( ICH ) GCP guideline Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
