	<brief_summary>This pilot study examine feasibility turnaround time perform obtain data key molecular assay . These assay perform use different laboratory technology core biopsy take patient diagnose invasive recurrent metastatic breast cancer . All result upload , store assess use IT Molecular Screening Prototype Platform ( MSPP ) . The MSPP also evaluate ease use screen patient participation future molecularly define clinical trial breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study accept patient metastatic/recurrent breast cancer disease . The core biopsy must take metastatic lesion . To note , patient biopsied phase metastatic disease ( diagnosis , progression etc ) . - The patient sign specific Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . - The Investigator access MSPP , register patient enter basic patient clinical data necessary verification eligibility criterion . - The patient prospectively undergo invasive recurrent metastatic lesion ( 1 site easily accessible , skin , lymph node liver ) core biopsy include collection tumor sample consist 2 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded ( FFPE ) Tissues 1 ( 2 recommend ) fresh frozen sample embed Optimal Cutting Temperature ( OCT ) compound store RNAlater . One whole blood sample ( 1x10mL ) also collect . - The Investigator record biological sample via MSPP bio-tracking system - The Investigator responsible immediate dispatch sample designate central laboratory . - The assay perform central laboratory . It note : - Two FFPE sample send IEO , Milan , Italy . One FFPE sample store . The second FFPE use perform pathological test . The test include ER , HER2 , Ki67 PTEN status evaluation immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) FISH ( HER2 ) ; PIK3CA hot spot somatic mutation identification Sanger DNA sequence . Unstained section ( 10x5µm ) extract DNA , take FFPE tissue core use testing , send IPG Sanger , respectively , central laboratory . - The assay perform IPG Sanger consist target breast cancer gene mutation identification Ion Proton HiSeq 2000 DNA sequence respectively . To note , target gene screen also couple identification substitution , short indels copy number variant ( CNVs ) . - One fresh frozen sample embed OCT store RNAlater send IJBordet , Brussels , Belgium , together blood sample , Affymetrix gene expression profile chromosomal SNP-analysis use Cytoscan platform ( Affymetrix ) . The blood sample store . - The central laboratory upload process data generate result central test onto MSPP . - An alert , e-mail , send Investigator central result available . The Investigator log MSPP obtain result . - The residual biological sample derivative store BIG study Repository 15 year maximum allow local regulation whichever short . If need , remain material use future research high throughput genetic analysis . It note result obtain BIG Molecular Screening Feasibility Study NOT use treatment decision-making . Patients receive anti-cancer therapy per patient 's treating physician decision accordance local institutional guideline . There planned follow-up period . The trial end information 30 accrue patient enter MSPP , within maximum 2 month recruitment last patient .</detailed_description>
