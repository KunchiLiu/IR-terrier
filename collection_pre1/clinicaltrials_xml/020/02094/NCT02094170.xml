	<brief_summary>The prevalence overweight obesity increase worldwide . In U.S. , approximately 85,000 new cancer case per year relate obesity . Understanding lifestyle behavior , cause , relation cancer critical . Where people spend time day may relate risk get cancer . This project assess behavior different location across day relate exposure different environment biological outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Global Positioning System ( GPS ) Exposure Environments &amp; Relations With Biomarkers Cancer Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study advance method cancer risk exposure assessment measure neighborhood access total environment exposure healthy environment dynamically integrate Global Positioning System ( GPS ) data Geographical Information System ( GIS ) data . We hypothesize dynamic GPS base measure environmental exposure strongly relate behavior insulin inflammation biomarkers static address base GIS measure access . Primary Aim : To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measure physical activity ( PA ) supportivity association PA behavior , body mass index ( BMI ) , biological marker . Secondary Aim : To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measure access healthy food association dietary intake , BMI , biological marker . Exploratory aim : Social environment ( e.g . eat others ) identify important determinant health , assessment limit self-report survey text prompt . Images person worn camera ( SenseCam ) provide objective continuous assessment social environment e.g . number social interaction per day , eat alone others . In subsample participant ( N=30 ) , propose explore whether portable SenseCam measure social interaction &amp; social behavior person view image strongly relate breast colon cancer risk factor self-reported social environment measure . Behaviors build environment ( especially food location ) also cod validate accuracy GIS measure machine learn behavior category employ full sample .</detailed_description>
