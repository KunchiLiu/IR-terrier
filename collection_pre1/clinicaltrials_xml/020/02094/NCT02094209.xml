	<detailed_description>Maturation fracture callus lead unloading fracture fixation hardware due increase load-share repair tissue . A novel data logger device ( AO Fracture Monitor ) continuously measure decline fixation hardware deflection physiological loading indirect indicator heal progress . Parameters obtain data logger device carry potential significantly improve assessment fracture heal future . Meaningful interpretation measurement require set clinical reference data . 20 patient receive AO large external fixator tibia equip data logger device ( AO Fracture Monitor ) attach post-operation connection rod external fixator . The device continuously measure deformation fixator frame due weight bear 4 month mean strain gauge . Several parameter calculate recorded change strain signal store regular interval . Data collect AO Fracture Monitor follow-up visit patient wireless data transfer . Together additional variable treatment detail , fracture heal pain report patient , collect data use build database . Data AO Fracture Monitor correlate patient data investigate relevance reliability data derive AO Fracture Monitor . In phase , study imply change operational treatment , allow therapeutic consequence base derive data .</detailed_description>
