	<brief_summary>The primary aim study clarify position FF FF/Vilanterol ( VI ) 100/25 microgram ( mcg ) compare exist therapy assess FF dosage equivalent low middle-dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . The study divide Run-in period , Period 1 ( open-label treatment ) , Period 2 ( double blind treatment ) Follow-up . Subjects well control asthma complete run-in period 4 week switch middle-dose ICS/long act beta 2 agonist ( LABA ) equivalent dose once-daily FF/VI 100/25 mcg 8 week treatment period ( Period 1 ) . After , subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive either FP 250 mcg twice daily , FP 100 mcg twice daily FF 100 mcg daily 12 week double blind treatment period ( Period 2 ) . There 1 week Follow-up Period follow completion double-blind treatment period , early withdrawal study . Overall , total duration subject 's participation study 25 week .
