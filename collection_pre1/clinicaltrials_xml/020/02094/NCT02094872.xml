	<brief_title>Molecularly Targeted Therapy Treating Patients With BRAF Wild-type Melanoma That Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine difference best overall response rate ( BORR ) patient treat MEK162 follow personalize molecularly guide assignment vs. historical BORR 7 % patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety perform individualized drug therapy ( include novel agent commercially-available agent ) context personalize medicine clinical trial . II . To define difference progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat MEK162 follow personalize molecularly guide assignment vs. historical PFS rate 2 month patient population . III . To continually assess data real time iteratively refine standardize set statistical informatics methodology match treatment patient 's tumor , base molecular profile . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection tissue blood sample deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) analysis via sequence . Based result DNA RNA analysis , patient receive molecularly target therapy . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
