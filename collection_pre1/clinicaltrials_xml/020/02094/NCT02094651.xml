	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treatment epileptiform abnormalities child autism spectrum disorder improve behavior child . The investigator study number different behavioral outcome include behavior related attention , social communication , repetitive behavior , maladaptive behavior , language , motor sensory , sleep . The investigator use anticonvulsant medication call valproic acid ( form sodium divalproex ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders Epileptiform EEG With Divalproex Sodium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy epileptiform EEG abnormalities common co-morbidities Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) consider important biomarkers cortical dysfunction disorder . They may represent measure excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posit involved pathogenesis disorder . Treatment epilepsy always indicate , treatment isolate epileptiform EEG ( i.e . absence clinical seizure ) frankly controversial . Since data suggest epileptiform discharge associate deficit attention , language behavior , investigator believe may represent important novel treatment target population . The propose study bring together group investigator long interested problem order investigate efficacy use anticonvulsant medication spike suppression capability ( VPA form divalproex sodium ) treat child ASD isolate epileptiform EEGs . Recruiting 3 large autism center ( Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) Vanderbilt University ( VU ) University Louisville ( U L ) ) large pediatric epilepsy unit , investigator propose 26 week randomize placebo control cross study VPA 4-8 year old child ASD frequent epileptiform EEG discharge .</detailed_description>
