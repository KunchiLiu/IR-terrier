	<brief_title>rhTPO Critical Patients With Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombocytopenia prevalent among critical patient admit intensive care unit . Researches show thrombocytopenia associate mortality among patient . Currently , standard therapy exist critical patient Thrombocytopenia . In 2012 SSC guideline , platelet transfusion induce thrombocytopenia critical patient reduce risk bleeding . However , indication platelet transfusion relatively strict . No early intervention could do accord guideline . Previous study show recombinant human thrombopoietin reduce severe sepsis low platelet 28-day mortality patient hyperlipidemia , effectively improve peripheral platelet number , reduce probability platelet transfusion.The primary objective study assess impact rhTPO mortality among severe sepsis patient thrombocytopenia , well change platelet count platelet transfusion rate .</detailed_description>
