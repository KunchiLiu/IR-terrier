	<brief_title>Prophylactic Elective Clipping Colonic Diverticula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES The investigator aim prophylactically clip colonic diverticulum patient experience least 1 episode diverticular bleed require hospitalization , without definitive procedure ( i.e. , total colectomy localization embolization clip ) . The investigator ' objective prevent future episodes colonic bleed diverticulum , avoid morbidity possible mortality . The investigator hypothesize patient undergo secondary prophylaxis diverticular clip experience episode diverticular bleeding . 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Diverticular bleed common cause acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( LGIB ) Western population . Although self-limited 85 % case , patient may require hospitalization blood transfusion emergent intervention , significant associate morbidity mortality . Up 25 % patient initial bleed episode subsequent episode . Diverticula form weak point along colon wall , vas recta enter circular muscle layer colon . Diverticular bleeding attribute thin blood vessel cross dome diverticulum . Endoscopic clip actively bleed colonic diverticulum recognize safe effective treatment acute LGIB since mid-1990s . Patients select would previous colonoscopy exclude cause bleed ( e.g . angiodysplasia , colorectal cancer ) . The investigator propose prophylactic elective endoscopic diverticular clip patient least 1 episode acute LGIB require hospitalization . This would involve apply endoscopic clip base every diverticulum patient 's colon , bleed source would effectively exclude . The investigator would later re-evaluate patient colonoscopic appearance diverticulum , suggestion diverticulum may resolve management . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN The investigator propose prospective feasibility study outpatients previously hospitalize least one episode diverticular bleeding . Diverticular disease confirm previous colonoscopy ass extent diverticular disease . Consecutive patient follow-up outpatient appointment approach Patient Information Sheet . On follow-up appointment recruit enrolled endoscopic clip colonic diverticulum . The procedure similar screening colonoscopy . As outpatient , patient take bowel preparation . Colonoscopy occur sedation , include fentanyl midazolam per protocol . Individual colonic diverticulum clip exclude bleed source . Twenty-four ( 24 ) patient enrol diverticular clipping . These patient follow prospectively 2 year repeat bleed episode . Follow-up consist telephone call every 6 month study team . In addition , patient schedule repeat colonoscopy ass diverticular disease 6 month clip colonic diverticulum . 4.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS Currently , patient admit complication diverticular disease see Diverticular Disease clinic follow-up . Consecutive patient select patient population . Patients may withdrawal study time , include colonoscopy clip diverticulum . 5.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING Data collection take place specially create case report form ( See case report form version 1.2 ) . Case report form store locked office Department Colorectal Surgery accessible study team . Data enter excel spreadsheet . The spreadsheet keep password protect NHS desktop lock office Department Colorectal Surgery . 6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS As feasibility study , recruit patient study prospectively . Any analysis include patient enrol . There control group randomization time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients include hospitalize least diverticular bleeding . Patients definitive procedure stop diverticular bleeding , include colectomy angiography embolization . Patients consider high risk colonoscopy bowel preparation . There exclusion criterion base age . Rather , patient individually evaluate judged frailty . Patients anticoagulant agent may stop colonoscopy . Patients without colonic diverticulum</criteria>
