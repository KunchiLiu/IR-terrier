	<brief_summary>The electrocardiogram ( ECG ) important diagnostic procedure medicine mainly detect circulation disorder problem spread electrical heart impulse . It frequently first measure clinical practice angina pectoris , acute myocardial infarction arrhythmia suspect . The ECG easy perform , safe cheap . Posture change know cause alteration ECG [ 1 ] . Deviation electrical heart axis ( EHA ) [ 2 ] , temporary change QRS morphology ST-segment alteration particular importance view diagnostic accuracy [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . In ambulatory ECG recording ST-segment alteration instance might mistakenly interpreted cardiac ischemia [ 5 ] . Artifacts could minimize concurrent determination deviation electrical heart axis [ 6 ] [ 7 ] use posture detector [ 8 ] help correlate ECG change posture change . Due emergence new computer base opportunity ambulatory ECG sense home monitor emerge market . Together superiority compare scalar ECG detect certain pathology , like myocardial infarction right ventricular hypertrophy , VCG gain new interest recent year [ 9 ] . Four ECG lead sufficient synthesize standard 12-lead ECG VCG vice versa transformation matrix [ 10 ] [ 11 ] .The redirection spatial VCG posture change determine QRS loop Frank lead , reference method construct VCG [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . 4 lead ambulatory ECG sufficient construct VCG arrange approximately position three rectangular ax . Doctors best train interpret standard 12 lead ECGs . With optimization lead ambulatory ( Holter ) ECG towards three rectangular ax , might allow mathematical transformation standard 12 lead ECG . A precondition would transformation matrix independent posture . To date , transformation matrix Frank VCG standard 12 lead ECG calculate rest ECGs [ 5 ] . This first study investigate transformation matrix different posture . Additionally , investigator investigate first time prospectively know artefact stress test ambulatory ECGs . Aim : Simultaneous prospective record standard 12 lead ECG Frank-lead VCG different posture expect add information potential cause artifact ECG cause posture change . During continuous recording , investigator investigate accuracy linear affine transformation posture , occurrence ( dimension duration ) ECG/ VCG morphology change ST-segment alteration , VCG angle change dependence posture change healthy young men . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesis transformation matrix Frank-Lead VCG standard 12-lead ECG posture dependent . Artefacts ECG due posture change systematic . The knowledge systematics improve diagnostic accuracy ambulatory ECG stress testing .</brief_summary>
