	<brief_summary>Chronic thromboembolic Pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) characterize obstruction pulmonary vasculature , lead increase pulmonary vascular resistance , progressive pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) right ventricular failure- common cause death patient PH . Riociguat , ( ADEMPAS ) member new class drug recently approve Canada treatment CTEPH . This pilot study design ass least 24 week treatment riociguat show change glucose metabolism improve rest myocardial blood flow use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image measure myocardial function . The response treatment naive patient well patient maximally tolerate dose riociguat tratment duration least 3 month include .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Right Ventricular Function With Riociguat CTEPH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It remain unclear certain patient PH develop right heart failure . Several line evidence suggest alteration right ventricular ( RV ) function may precipitate RV ischemia . This ischemia result decrease right coronary artery perfusion pressure arteriolar- capillary rarefaction . It propose contributes insufficient oxygen delivery need support increase RV demand right heart failure ( RHF ) , stimulate glycolytic shift . However , glycolysis insufficient compensate suppression glucose oxidation severe right ventricular hypertrophy ( RVH ) , result state RV hibernation progressive RHF . This study design assess 24 week treatment riociguat associate change glucose metabolism improve RV blood flow use N-13-ammonia ( NH3 ) measure myocardial perfusion . We assess response treatment naive patient well patient titrate maximally tolerate dos riociguat total treatment duration least 3 month . The assessment quantitative myocardial blood flow combine advanced 3 dimensional echocardiographic assessment RV volume function cardiac magnetic resonance ( MR ) .</detailed_description>
