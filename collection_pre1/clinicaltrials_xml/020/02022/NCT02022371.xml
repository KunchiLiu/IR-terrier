	<brief_summary>The purpose study carry detail genetic test prostate cancer cell . The reason researcher fully understand - How prostate cancer develop - Why cancer cell spread others - Why cancer cell respond treatment others Researchers doctor know 1 3 male population age 50 cancer cell prostate . However , men never know affect quality life life expectancy . However , cancer aggressive . These likely spread outside prostate cause problem . Doctors accurate way tell difference aggressive cancer cause problem . Even within one prostate tumour aggressive others cause problem lifetime patient . In fact , even within one tumour , different cell may behave differently . In word , one part tumour may aggressive spread , whilst another part tumour . This project try find make different tumour different part tumour aggressive harmless . It important find make cancer cell spread others stay . For investigator need collect fresh sample cancer tissue prostate different area tumour within prostate . This biopsy use diagnose exclude cancer hospital laboratory good enough give investigator detail genetic information . These biopsy put chemical call formalin reduces quality genetic information . Investigators therefore ask patient undergo prostate biopsy part normal care allow take additional biopsy purpose study . This may first time patient biopsy . Or , patient may biopsies treatment give cancer doctor concern treatment work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancer genetic disease , cause mutation gene lead increase cell proliferation survival . Importantly , genetic change vary dramatically individual prostate cancer patient specific combination mutation within patient 's cancer think determine tumour aggressiveness clinical outcome . Personalized medicine approach aim decipher genetic code patient 's tumour order identify cancer behave aggressively need treatment . However , extensive intra-tumour heterogeneity ( ITH ) discover several solid tumour type , complicate identification relevant genetic change may present throughout entire tumour likely miss tumour biopsy . ITH thus major hurdle implementation personalize cancer treatment approach . Investigators develop genetic technology allow measure ITH solid tumour want apply patient prostate cancer define extent clinical importance ITH disease currently unknown . This involve look control gene cancer cell make tumour aggressive others . This may help predict tumour important need target could leave much tissue damage occur result therapy . Finding cancer cell spread others may also help identify novel molecular target could use prevent development metastasis . Patients suspected prostate cancer usually scan prostate biopsy . These biopsy need pathologist make proper diagnosis use full genetic analysis . So , investigator ask patient whether would willing give extra sample tissue undergo routine biopsy . Defining ITH prostate cancer provide important insight genetics prostate cancer development metastatic progression key prerequisite development reliable personalized cancer medicine approach . Thus study significantly advance researcher ' effort predict tumours dangerous need urgent treatment could safely leave untreated would spare patient unnecessary side effect . Investigators think research work major impact use next generation sequence management prostate cancer in-depth understanding common difference within individual cancer lesion . Investigators also want find whether difference , exist , important tumour development spread area . Investigators think characterization difference allow successfully use information group patient undergo treatment use molecular 'signatures ' treatment target rather applied 'sledge-hammer ' approach . Investigators believe without study like PROGENY , doctor instead rely data single tumour biopsy mislead since single biopsy may sample aggressive tumour area . Finally , investigator think PROGENY reveal prostate cancer evolve time change lead metastasis ultimately kill patient . These call phylogenetic study help work main ( 'trunk ' ) genomic change later event 'branches ' . This may allow researcher focus drug discovery effort common 'trunk ' genomic change .</detailed_description>
