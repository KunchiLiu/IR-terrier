	<brief_summary>In explorative study immunological change tumor therapy analyze patient malignant glioma . Immunophenotyping therapy use analysis method . Thereby immune cell quantitatively qualitatively detected patient 's blood continuous time point . Additionally relevant mediator like cytokine , danger signal chemokines analyze method . Obtained result may give information effect therapy immunological process immune cell may help find immunological base predictive prognostic tumor marker define time point include additional immune therapy future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunophenotyping From Blood Patients With Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients malignant glioma generally bad prognosis . To improve patient ' situation new therapy option well new possibility determine prognosis prediction precisely need . One approach target activation immune system recognize eliminate tumor cell . Due cerebral tumor brain immune privilege organ anymore , immune cell may pass haemato-encephalic barrier attack tumor cell . This study aim offer valuable clue immune system influenced standard therapy ( radiotherapy chemotherapy ) . Just background knowledge immune mechanism influence factor tumor therapy , effective anti-tumor response systematically induce modulate immune therapy . To analyze immunological change , immunophenotyping flow cytometry perform blood patient malignant gliomas therapy conclude chemoradiation chemotherapy alone . Count , class activation status immune cell detect flow cytometry . Together additional analysis method , information immunological mediator like cytokine , chemokines danger signal receive . For purpose serum plasma generate blood sample store prospective question . The explorative determined result may also help discover new , immunological base , prognostic predictive tumor marker .</detailed_description>
