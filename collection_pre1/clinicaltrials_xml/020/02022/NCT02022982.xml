	<brief_title>PALBOCICLIB + PD-0325901 NSCLC &amp; Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label Phase I/II dose escalation study evaluate combination CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib ( PD-0332991 ) MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , 3+3 dose escalation protocol undertaken . Once RP2D determine , study evaluate , randomize phase II study design , combination palbociclib PD-0325901 compare PD-0325901 alone palbociclib alone KRAS mutant NSCLC . - Phase 1 : The investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant cancer , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant receive depend number participant enrol study well dose tolerate . - Study Drug ( ) : The participant give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 4 week time take study drug 3 week time . The participant take Palbociclib mouth day , every day 3 week . The participant take PD-0325901 mouth twice day , every day 3 week . - Clinical Exams : During cycle participant physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . - Scans ( Imaging test ) : The investigator assess participant 's tumor either CT scan MRI - Blood Tests : These special test check amount drug amount tumor DNA participant 's blood specific point time . Phase II Outcomes : - Determine response rate , determine RECIST 1.1 , combination palbociclib PD-0325901 palbociclib PD-0325901 single agent patient advance KRAS mutant NSCLC - Further evaluate safety , tolerability side effect profile combination palbociclib PD-0325901 Phase II Secondary Outcomes - Determine rate progression free survival ≥ 4 month median PFS combination palbociclib PD-0325901 compare palbociclib PD-0325901 single agent KRAS mutant NSCLC</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Doseescalation/MTD cohort , participant must histologically confirm malignancy RAS mutation metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . For randomized phase 2 component study , participant must histologically confirm NSCLC confirm KRAS mutation ( via CLIAcertified method ) For doseescalation component , participant require evaluable disease . For MTD cohort phase 2 component study , participant must measurable disease . Participants enrol MTD cohort must agree pre ontreatment tumor biopsy assessable disease identify . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophils count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ≤ 5.0 X institutional upper limit normal permit hepatic metastasis present ) Creatinine within 1.5x ULN institutional limit . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . QTc ≤480 msec . The availability archival tissue evaluate retrospectively participant 's Rb status Patients must recover ≤ Grade 1 term toxicity prior treatment ( exclude neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 ) . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Participants may receive study agent concurrently study drug . Participants symptomatic brain metastasis require chronic steroid exclude . Patients history brain metastasis permit enroll long treat , steroid stable one month imaging . Concurrent use strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers prohibit due drugdrug interaction palbociclib . Due potential drug interaction warfarin PD0325901 , warfarin use exclude . Other anticoagulant permit . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study study agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother study agent , breastfeed discontinue . For Part II : Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction . Evidence visible retinal pathology screen ophthalmologic examination place participant unacceptable risk ocular toxicity , risk factor retinal vein occlusion , related PF0325901 .</criteria>
