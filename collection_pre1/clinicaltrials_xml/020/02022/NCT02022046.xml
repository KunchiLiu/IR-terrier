	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease highly prevalent Taiwan . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common cause death child CKD . Nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency link CKD CVD . Asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) , NO synthase inhibitor , level increase kidney disease cardiovascular disease serve methylation biomarker . In addition ADMA , uremic environment , hyperhomocysteinemia ( Hcy ) oxidative stress may affect DNA methylation . S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) important human methyl donor . S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) demethylated product . Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) , folate metabolism enzyme regulate methylation pathway . The investigator intend examine whether ADMA , SAM/SAH ratio , Hcy , MTHFR gene methylation serve biosignature predict CVD child CKD child .</brief_summary>
