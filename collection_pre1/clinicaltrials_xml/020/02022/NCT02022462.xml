	<detailed_description>The mortality rate among people Serious Mental Illness ( SMI ) 2 3 time general population ( DeHert et al. , 2011 ) , mean serious mental illness die , average , 25 year earlier without SMI ( Parks et al. , 2006 ) . There evidence death largely attribute preventable medical condition , many common SMI population .

The Bridge peer-staffed comprehensive healthcare engagement self management model , situate outpatient mental health clinic , client teach skill access manage healthcare condition . The investigator ' goal train client successfully engage navigate primary health care system well need health care service ( specialty care , lab , pharmacy ) .

Investigators conduct randomize controlled trial compare 2 group : ) treatment usual waitlist ( n =73 ) , b ) Bridge peer navigator intervention ( n=73 ) . Investigators compare group across 3 time point ( baseline , 6 month , 1 year ) examine Bridge 's effectiveness improve health care service use , satisfaction care , health knowledge , health status , health relate self-efficacy , quality life . Outcomes measured patient self-report accord objective measure health ( medical record insurance claim data ) . In addition , investigator conduct interview every three month select stakeholder assess degree intervention study succeed challenge occur . This allow correction study proceeds . Investigators focus factor contribute implementation sustainability health navigator intervention include : cost , training , supervision , bill issue , position fit organizational model clinic . To begin interview , investigator ask person interview idea critical factor implementation sustainability . Finally investigator plan conduct exit interview patient part final assessment . Exit interview focus patient ' perception study , affect , go well , challenge encounter . Each interview last 20-30 minute audio-recorded use encrypted tape recorder . Investigators use semi-structured interview guide interviewee ask question data comparable . Basic demographic gender , ethnicity , age record participant . This PCORI proposal rely significant stakeholder involvement intervention development , project development management , plan dissemination implementation . The ultimate goal provide field peer-delivered intervention significantly reduce disparity utilization outcome health service seriously mentally ill thereby reduce morbidity mortality highly vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
