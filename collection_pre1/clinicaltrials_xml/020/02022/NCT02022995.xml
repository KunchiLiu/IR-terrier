	<brief_summary>Protein arginine methylation important process , regulate diverse cellular function include cell proliferation , RNA stability , DNA repair gene transcription . Based literature search , protein arginine methyltransferase ( PRMT ) indeed play important role colon cancer pathophysiology . The PRMT expression level involve colon cancer patient 's survival suggest prognostic marker colon cancer patient . Recently , group find novel methylation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , affect EGFR downstream signal . investigator observe methylation event EGFR regulate tumor growth mouse xenograft model also influence cetuximab response colon cancer cell line . To study clinical correlation EGFR methylation cetuximab response , propose detect EGFR methylation level paraffin embed tissue sample colorectal cancer patient without cetuximab treatment IHC stain analyze correlation cetuximab response . This study provide insight strategy colorectal cancer therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Methylation EGFR Response Cetuximab Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third cause cancer world . The recommended treatment early stage ( stage I stage II ) colorectal cancer surgical removal , management late stage ( stage III stage IV ) colorectal cancer rely heavily chemotherapy . Optimization dose schedule chemotherapy agent develop improve response survival rate patient . Meanwhile , rational target molecular signaling pathway involve etiology malignancy currently one promising strategy novel anticancer drug development . Since first discovery EGFR 1962 , EGFR family downstream signal become one well characterized receptor tyrosine kinase system . In addition function normal development , aberrant expression EGFR involve abnormal cell proliferation , reduce apoptosis , cell migration , metastasis , angiogenesis resistance radiation chemotherapy cancer patient . Owing important role EGFR play tumorigenesis , new class drug target EGFR , cetuximab , among clinically advanced molecular-targeted therapy . The combination EGFR monoclonal antibody chemotherapy show efficacy colorectal cancer treatment . However , resistance EGFR target therapy recently observe due complicate different drug resistance mechanism . Take EGFR monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , example , response rate cetuximab-plus-irinotecan therapy 23 % . Some study show resistance EGFR cetuximab relate constitutive activation mutant KRAS . However , study show wild type KRAS patient response cetuximab , mutant Kras patient refractory cetuximab . These observation make urgent investigate potential EGFR regulation mechanism may influence predict cetuximab response . Epigenetic modification , alteration DNA methylation pattern histone change , play critical role human disease . Since identification protein arginine methyltransferases ( PRMTs ) , arginine methylation largely recognize robust investigation . During arginine methylation process , PRMTs transfer methyl group S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) guanidine nitrogenes specific arginine residue target protein . After arginine methylation , protein structure , protein-protein interaction , protein localization enzyme activity change . As result , diverse cellular function include signal transduction , RNA processing , DNA repair gene transcription regulation arginine methylation . Recently , emerge evidence show link dysfunction arginine methylation cancer . In prostate cancer , H4R3 methylation PRMT predict risk cancer recurrence ; Mixed Lineage Leukaemia ( MLL ) , PRMT mediate transcriptional upregulation cancer progression . Moreover , aberrantly high expression PRMT observe tumor tissue breast colorectal cancer , notably , associate poor clinical outcome colorectal cancer patient . Given importance PRMT EGFR colorectal cancer development progression , investigator try investigate relation EGFR PRMT colorectal cancer pathophysiology . In preliminary data , investigator find PRMT methylate EGFR , lead up-regulation EGFR signaling . The up-regulated EGFR signaling trigger high cell proliferation rate . In addition , cell higher EGFR methylation level show high tumor growth ability mouse colorectal cancer xenograft model . Importantly , cell higher EGFR methylation level demonstrate high cell growth rate presence cetuximab vitro cell proliferation assay , suggest EGFR methylation may lead resistance cetuximab . In order study clinical correlation EGFR methylation cetuximab resistance , investigator propose collect paraffin embed tissue sample patient without cetuximab treatment analyze EGFR methylation level . Investigators expect patient low EGFR methylation level higher improvement treat cetuximab compare without cetuximab treatment . In contrast , patient higher EGFR methylation level show poor improvement treat cetuximab comparison patient without cetuximab treatment . By detect EGFR methylation level tissue sample analyze correlation EGFR methylation level cetuximab response , investigator provide insight prediction cetuximab response colorectal cancer therapy .</detailed_description>
