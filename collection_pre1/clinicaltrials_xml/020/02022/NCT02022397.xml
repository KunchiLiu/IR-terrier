	<brief_summary>General anaesthesia mandate artificial ventilation tracheal intubation order provide patient artificial breathing . Difficulties related ventilation intubation remain leading cause morbidity mortality general anaesthesia , essentially due inaccuracy pre-operative detection anatomical factor predispose difficult airway . In project investigator develop image video-processing technology software solution allow automatic recognition anatomical feature play key role identification difficult ventilation intubation , leading modification pre-operative anaesthesia management assessment therefore increase patient ' safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Any tracheal intubation require pre-operative screen assessment order obtain essential medical history patient , optimize patient ' condition case co-existing disease operation select best method anesthesia day surgery . The aim assessment identify potential anesthetic difficulty , predictor difficult airway , still nowadays represent first cause litigation anesthesia relate closed claim study . In first step pre-operative assessment procedure , patient analyze software . The patient automatically guide 10 minute series test software analyze real-time his/her morphological dynamic feature order classify patient one 5 category describe next Section . Details relevant difficult ventilation intubation ( static dynamic ) , quantify exact inter-incisors distance ( mouth opening ) , visibility detection anatomical landmark open mouth ( uvulae , pillar , tonsil , tongue , posterior pharynx ) , thyro-mental distance , neck circumference , neck mobility maximal anterior posterior movement . The analysis perform : - automatically compute relevant measure use robust computer vision algorithm capable detect , describe track face neck high level accuracy robustness extreme pose ( leave right rotation movement face ) - develop powerful image processing technique describe compute intra-oral structure . The two set measure combine machine learn approach capable classify patient . The result analysis well record video every single test store central database access real-time doctor continue pre-operative consultancy . The patient undergo plan surgery initially plan time intubate purpose . Proper record grade intubation operate room document introduced assessment database . By mean , database evolve assessment final post-operative intubation score improve automatic predictability machine learn algorithm .</detailed_description>
