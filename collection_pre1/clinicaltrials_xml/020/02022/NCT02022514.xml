	<brief_summary>Clinical trial phase III , prospective , control , randomize , open . We hypothesize work patient chronic coronary occlusion poor myocardial viability fail recover ventricular function subject coronary revascularization new technique recanalization , could achieve improvement ventricular function give regenerative treatment mononuclear cell autologous bone marrow . To test hypothesis design prospective , randomized clinical trial patient recanalized chronic occlusion ventricular dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracoronary Infusion Mononuclear Cells Autologous Bone Marrow Patients With Chronic Coronary Occlusion Ventricular Dysfunction , Previously Revascularized .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label prospective clinical trial patient diagnose chronic coronary occlusion Cardiology Department Hospital Reina Sofía de Córdoba , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion shall include express accordance trial participation signing informed consent . 66 patient improve ventricular function measure Magnetic resonance least 3 month revascularization chronic coronary occlusion include . The 66 patient randomize one one ratio intervention group receive bone marrow mononuclear cell intracoronary autologous ( 0.5 1 x 10 9 total cell ) control group receive conventional medical treatment . The two group patient follow , clinical trial , 6 month . Once test complete , follow accord standard clinical practice Cardiology hospital least 24 month . Patients assess clinical echocardiographic Magnetic resonance method . All patient medically treat similarly ACE inhibitor angiotensine 1 receptor ( AT1 ) receptor antagonist angiotensin II , beta-blockers diuretic . The main objective o study determine efficacy intracoronary infusion mononuclear cell autologous bone marrow patient chronic coronary occlusion previously revascularized stent term improve ventricular function determine magnetic resonance . Secondary objective study : 1 . To confirm , view obtain result , suitability prove protocol treatment chronic coronary occlusion . 2 . To study change functional class ( I-IV NYHA ) patient compare control group . 3 . To evaluate safety treatment , analysis possible cardiac event 6-month follow-up clinical trial 24 month additional clinical follow-up ( death , myocardial infarction , repeat revascularization ) compare control group . 4 . To study change global segmental leave ventricular function study myocardial deformation Speckle track echocardiography bidimensional ( EST2D ) three-dimensional echocardiography comparatively amongst patient along track two group .</detailed_description>
