	<brief_summary>AIM OF RESEARCH . The aim research improve result combined treatment patient locally advanced rectal cancer use endovascular method reservoir plastic surgery . TASKS OF RESEARCH . 1 . To assess immediate long-term result combine ( chemoradiation surgical ) treatment locally advanced rectal cancer . 2 . To make comparative evaluation result independent surgical combine ( chemoradiation surgery ) treatment patient locally advanced rectal cancer . 3 . To examine functional result surgical treatment formation `` neosphincter '' `` neorectum '' patient colorectal cancer.. 4 . To study feature blood supply rectum pool inferior mesenteric internal iliac artery , use method selective angiography , connection development endovascular treatment rectal cancer . 5 . To develop introduce clinical practice method one-stage selective intra-arterial oil chemoembolization upper , middle low rectal artery patient locally advanced rectal cancer , contraindication preoperative radiotherapy . 6 . To assess immediate long-term result combine ( endovascular surgical ) treatment locally advanced rectal cancer . 7 . To optimize tactic combine treatment locally advanced rectal cancer develop algorithm use chemoradiotherapy endovascular intervention preoperative period . NOVELTY OF RESEARCH . 1 . As result research design implement new method selective intra-arterial chemoembolization rectal artery preoperatively patient locally advanced rectal cancer . 2 . Substantiated high effectiveness propose technique removal colonic obstruction , consequence perform radical surgical treatment patient . 3 . First develop dosage concentration chemotherapeutic agent embolic agent safe injection perform selective intra-arterial chemoembolization rectal artery . 4 . Developed complex technique selective intra-arterial chemoembolization rectal artery preoperatively patient locally advanced rectal cancer . 5 . Will make comparative analysis postoperative period evaluation quality life operate patient Obtained data present use clinical practice . POSSIBLE APPLICATION AREAS . Results research design use treatment process department Coloproctology , oncology , well educational process high secondary medical institution . EXPECTED EFFECTIVENESS . It expect use method treatment patient locally advanced rectal cancer clinical practice provide pronounce effect : 1 . Medical social - improve quality care , preservation social activity patient , reduce mortality ; 2 . Economic - reducing time patient ' treatment reduce number therapeutic manipulation ; 3 . Science Technology - improve train level medicine worker treatment patient rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
