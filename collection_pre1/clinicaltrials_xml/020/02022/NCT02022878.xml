	<brief_summary>Chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) encounter almost one-fourth patient undergo coronary angiography . The presence untreated CTO related adverse clinical prognosis , stable angina acute myocardial infarction , often associate persistent symptomatic angina . Depending symptomatic functional status well anatomical complexity , CTO treat optimal medical therapy therapy combine coronary revascularization . The potential benefit percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) CTO include symptom relief , improve leave ventricular function , potentially survival advantage associate success compare failed revascularization . Of note , mark advance endovascular technique device technology result substantial improvement procedural success rate PCI CTO . In spite advance , vast majority patient CTO still manage medically refer coronary bypass surgery rather PCI . The common reason defer PCI patient CTO appear uncertainty predict procedural outcome percutaneous revascularization . Further barrier attempt CTO PCI include difficulty gauge time required procedure use resource . The CT-RECTOR ( Computed Tomography REgistry Chronic Total Occlusion Revascularization ) study design evaluate application coronary compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) prediction procedural outcome PCI CTO international patient population . The main purpose multicenter registry develop noninvasive CTA-based prediction tool ( CT-RECTOR Score ) grade CTO suitability PCI .</brief_summary>

The main advantage coronary CTA characterization CTO include 3-dimensional visualization occlusion trajectory morphology well exact evaluation calcification . Despite , although prior single-center study suggest potential utility individual coronary CTA-based CTO characteristic predict PCI , compile prediction model grade CTO suitability PCI large cohort patient . The CT-RECTOR registry retrospective , multicenter observational study patient undergoing preprocedural coronary CTA attempt PCI CTO 2007 2013 .
