	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy PCI California Hospitals Without Onsite Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : The PCI California Audit Monitored Pilot Offsite Surgery ( PCI-CAMPOS ) program prospective , multi-center pilot trial allow elective PCIs hospital without on-site cardiovascular surgery California . The pilot program establish California Senate Bill No . 891 ( SB 891 ) enact January 2009 authorize California Department Public Health ( CDPH ) set pilot program allow California hospital without surgery on-site perform elective PCIs . The PCI-CAMPOS program design compare PCI outcome pilot hospital offsite cardiac surgery PCI outcomes establish California hospital onsite cardiac surgery . The CDPH request pilot hospital application December 2009 , select 6 hospital 30 applicant hospital May 2010 contract University California , Davis ( UCD ) train , audit , monitor program . The CDPH appoint 12 member Advisory Oversight Committee ( AOC ) 6 at-large member nominate California American College Cardiology ( CAACC ) 6 member pilot hospital ( 1 principal investigator participate pilot hospital ) . The pilot program fund CDPH fee assessment participate pilot hospital . The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) pilot hospital University UCD coordinate center , patient ask provide write informed consent pilot participation ( unless unavailable critically ill patient ) . The National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR® ) CathPCI Registry ( v. 4.3 , 4.4 ) select data entry format pilot hospital non-pilot hospital . The pilot PCI data enter use NCDR® CathPCI Registry v.4.3 v.4.4 internet accessible UCD Velos server ( Velos eResearch v9.1.2 , Velos , Inc. , Fremont , CA ) . The non-pilot hospital enter data use various NCDR® approve onsite software central NCDR® CathPCI v.4.3 v.4.4 website . The pilot hospital data enter within 72 hour procedure immediately available PCI-CAMPOS coordinating center . The non-pilot data enter individually obtain quarterly data harvest submit NCDR® . After mask patient , operator , hospital identity , non-pilot California NCDR® CathPCI registry data download annually NCDR® center UCD PCI-CAMPOS coordinating center . The UCD coordinating center performs pilot audit full access pilot information . The UCD coordinating center performs pilot comparative analysis . Interim data summary analysis present full AOC review 6-12 month interval throughout study . Outcomes : The pilot hospital outcome compare hospital outcome non-pilot California hospital perform either elective PCIs surgery on-site ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) PCIs . The non-pilot clinical data obtain 120 California hospital submit clinical data directly NCDR® data center use analysis data . Both non-pilot pilot data set analyze compare use SAS statistical software ( version 9.3 Windows , SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Study Participants Hospitals : The non-pilot hospital group consist 120 California hospital submit PCI data directly NCDR® central database . For elective PCIs , hospitals on-site surgery available post-PCI patient require emergency coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . The pilot hospital group consist 6 hospital select CDPH , meet eligible hospital criterion require SB891 SEC.2 . Section 1256.01 ( c ) ( 09/25/2008 ) . Operators : Operators approve perform procedure pilot program base operator criterion require SB891 SEC.2 . Section 1256.01 ( c ) ( 09/25/2008 ) . Pilot operator underwent train assessment operator , assessment patient inclusion exclusion requirement UCD staff also require pas competency exam . Non-pilot operator receive special training identity mask comply NCDR® requirement . Emergency ( salvage ) pilot hospital PCIs perform credentialed interventionalists pilot hospital . Non-emergent ( elective , urgent ) PCIs redirect pre-qualified pilot operator . Coders : Data entry coder pilot hospital receive initial 1 day training session , follow competency exam . On-going training , telephone , email access coordinate center available throughout program . Non-pilot coding also perform coder onsite hospital participate NCDR® CathPCI Registry . Patients : All pilot hospital patient consent meet SB891 SEC.2 . Section 1256.01 ( A D ) ( 09/25/2008 ) selection criterion PCI pilot hospital enrol program . All patient STEMI present pilot hospital include STEMI PCI group . STEMI-excluded patient low moderate risk complication include STEMI-excluded group . Patients deem high-risk ( high lesion patient risk ) complication exclude pilot program . These high-risk patient either discharge transfer non-pilot hospital onsite surgery revascularization PCI CABG . Pilot Protocol After completion PCI , require information enter online NCDR® CathPCI Registry v.4.3 v.4.4 UCD server . All case review central coordinate site data field completion data consistency . All case complication [ death , stoke , CABG , shock , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cardiac arrest , IABP ( intra-aortic balloon pump ) , perforation , significant dissection , tamponade , new requirement dialysis ] randomize 10 % non-complication case select pilot-site audit include review medical record angiographic image . Audit review produce multiple query transmit hospital coder discussion operator . An iterative process eventually lead consensus agreement case . In rare case , auditor-operator agreement achieve , case refer angiographic committee AOC final determination . The patient procedure data store Velos Server ; angiographic image save Xcelera R3.3L1 Server ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ) ; statistical analysis store perform SAS software , version 9.3 Windows ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Non-pilot Audits : California hospital PCI data submit individually 3 month harvest NCDR® central database review completeness data accuracy NCDR® receive red , yellow , green light acceptance . The vast majority hospital California perform PCI participate NCDR CathPCI registry . The NCDR® addition employ robust data quality strategy participate hospital also perform limited number site audit directly assess data accuracy . The complete NCDR® non-pilot California data download annually UCD central site comparison analysis . The downloaded data mask protect patient , operator , hospital identity . Statistical analysis : A PCI risk model develop risk-adjusted endpoint compare 6 pilot 120 non-pilot hospital PCI procedures . To compare demographic clinical profile observe outcomes CA-NCDR® ( non-pilot ) PCI-CAMPOS ( pilot ) , continuous categorical variable report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) percentages , compare test chi-square test ( two tail ) , respectively . The primary safety endpoint composite event include in-hospital death ( regardless length stay ) , stroke , and/or patient transfer emergent CABG . The non-pilot data pilot data merge single data source development risk adjustment model composite outcome . With combined data , perform bi-variable analysis identify significant demographic clinical risk factor composite outcome serve candidate risk factor multivariable logistic risk model . We develop parsimonious refine risk model combine data use non-pilot data model validation purpose . All model evaluate Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic . The c- statistic report measure predictive power . The refined model use computation provider 's expect risk-adjusted composite event rate . A general linear model analysis variance ( GLM/ANOVA ) use compare observe , expect risk-adjusted composite event rate CA-NCDR® PCI-CAMPOS hospital . We compute 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) provider 's risk-adjusted composite event rate use Poisson exact probability method pilot non-pilot hospital pilot operator . We determine provider 's performance rating base comparison 95 % CI provider 's risk-adjusted composite event rate California average composite event rate include CABG on-site off-site hospital . Two performance rating analysis conduct hospital ( operator pilot hospital ) : ( 1 ) base PCIs ( 2 ) base PCIs STEMI exclude . We also assess correlation provider 's total STEMI exclude PCI volume risk-adjusted composite event rate among hospital operator pilot hospital . All report p-values 2-sided , p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis conduct UCD use SAS software , version 9.3 Windows ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .</detailed_description>
