	<brief_summary>In standard care patient diagnose primary secondary ( metastasis ) cerebral tumor , currently complex clinical situation clinic Magnetic Resonance Imagery ( MRI ) allow medical team arrive conclusive diagnosis . The therapeutic proposition require delay additional follow-up least 3 month order clarify situation , potential delay diagnosis therefore therapeutic care . The contribution cerebral molecular imagery could allow new additional information bring increase confidence index diagnosis order comfort therapeutic collective attitude propose multidisciplinary meeting ( MM ) . 3.4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ( 18F-FD0PA ) , dopamine precursor amino-acid , Position Emission Tomography ( PET ) , allow study vivo proteic transmembrane transport gliomatous tissue ; active transport happen sodic-independent canal , increase malicious transformation , kinetics give indication regard development primary tumor . In MRIs , tumor tissue growth inject contrast product translate rupture Blood-Brain Barrier ( BBB ) , tumor extraction radiopharmaceutical independent state integrity BBB whose function metabolic tissue activity . This method imagery thus appear promising contribution conventional imagery . Furthermore , different 18F-FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) , similar largely use glucose oncologic molecular imagery , exploration harmful glioma 18F-FDOPA , compromise background noise activity , almost useless healthy cerebral cortex , exception striatal physiological fixation use level reference . The best performance term positive negative predictive value define literature tumor/striatum threshold 1 . According late current European recommendation , turn PET care high-level glioma patient propose evaluation therapeutic response . However , study evaluate in-practice current clinical contribution PET put perspective classic clinical radiological data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Oncologic Cerebral Imagery Contribution 18F-FDOPA Position Emission Tomography ( PET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis rest fact 18F-FDOPA PET imagery modify decision regard treatment patient oncologic neurological MDM . It 's matter measure frequency attitude situation change change often occur . Secondly , study objective , patient follow-up , evaluate pertinence change decision , well usage PET relation clinical situation : - The differential diagnosis radionecrosis pseudo-progression recurrence newly appear contrast zone patient diagnose high glioma level metastasis treat radiotherapy ; either without chemotherapy . - The evaluation end treatment introductory level temozolomide ( TMZ ) ( 6th cycle ) adjuvant radio-chemotherapy high-level primary cerebral tumor . - The evaluation response anti-angeogenic treatment The expect benefit study improvement patient 's care . Indeed , additional information provide Position Emission Tomography ( PET ) could allow healthcare professional precociously test recurrence thus diminish delay therapeutic care . Conversely , PET could allow healthcare professional avoid over-treatment patient MRI would wrongly indicate recurrence . Furthermore , imagery PET bring new level additional information allow increase confidence index diagnose , thus comfort collective therapeutic attitude propose MM .</detailed_description>
