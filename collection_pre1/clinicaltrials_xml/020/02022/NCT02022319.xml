	<brief_summary>Background : The main goal diagnose thyroid nodule differentiate malignant large background benign lesion . Currently available pre-operative test unable rule malignancy subset patient diagnostic surgery necessary . Therefore need develope available diagnostic tool pre-operative diagnostic work-up thyroid nodule . The study investigate novel ultrasonographic technique call Shear Wave Elastography ( SWE ) pre-operative evaluation thyroid nodule . Hypothesis : 1 ) SWE precise tool evaluation thyroid nodule term inter- intra-observer reliability day-to-day variation . The study conduct part large PhD study , evaluation diagnostic value thyroid SWE evaluate large study . Perspectives : An optimization pre-operative risk-stratification diagnosis thyroid nodule reduce unnecessary thyroid surgery , reduction morbidity well use economic surgical resource .</brief_summary>
