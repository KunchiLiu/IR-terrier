	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure common cause death neuromuscular disease . The aim research evaluate thoracopulmonary recruitment comparison inspiratory vital capacity ( VC ins ) inspiratory/expiratory vital capacity ( VC ins-ex ) vital capacity ( VC ) accord pathology severity pulmonary damage patient neuromuscular disease . The methodology consist realize VC support inspiratory/expiratory pressure , patient passive realize maximal inspiratory/expiratory effort simultaneously , aid mechanical insufflation/exsufflation device ( Cough AssistÂ® ) . The evaluation last 30 minute non-inclusion criterion insufflation . The study hypothesis long term insufflation/exsufflation device use could improve thoracopulmonary mobility .</brief_summary>
