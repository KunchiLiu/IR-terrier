	<brief_summary>Even though experimental lung injury animal experiment best analogy change patient , consider kinetics may vary specie . An important question answer common PaO2-oscillations occur patient injurious might . A limitation detection PaO2-oscillations sensing device detects oscillation high temporal resolution . In previous study fiberoptic probe use , measure PaO2 base oxygen-sensitive fluorescence quenching time resolution 10 Hz ( 8 , 13 , 14 ) . This method feasible patient . Previous study show PaO2-oscillations translated peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) . Given technology time resolution high enough ( i.e . &gt; 1 Hz ) , measurement SpO2-oscillations would valid approach detect quantify cyclical recruitment derecruitment non-invasive fashion patient ICU . The Masimo Rad-8 pulse-oxymeter provide method . In current study plan deteted SpO2-oscillations post-operative patient ICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As state cyclical recruitment derecruitment show mechanism VALI . It demonstrate PaO2-oscillations systemic circulation transmit endorgans ( i.e . brain , kidney peripheral organ ) . There study quantify PaO2- SpO2-oscillations human subject . The rationale study measure non-invasively SpO2-oscillations throughout respiratory cycle PaO2 oscillation easily detect . We analyse SpO2-oscillations cohort post-operative patient . Atelectasis major risk factor pulmonary complication . As occurs 90 % surgical patient phenomenon highly relevant . Patients large area atelectatic lung tissue prone cyclical recruitment derecruitment consecutive SpO2-oscillations . There two group patient : One high risk atelectasis one low risk atelectasis . The patient stratify type surgery . Upper abdominal surgery duration 2 hour show independent risk factor atelectasis . Therefore , choose assign patient schedule abdominal surgery anticipate duration surgery 4 hour high-risk group . Patients neurosurgical procedure 4 hour assign low risk group . In patient SpO2-oscillations measure three different respiratory rate ( RR ) . The rationale previous study show cyclical recruitment derecruitment dependent RR .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Interventional group : Patients high risk develop atelectasis end operation , i.e . large abdominal surgery longer 4 hour . Control group : Patients low risk develop atelectasis end operation , i.e . neurosurgical treatment without open abdomen Interventional + control group : Age &lt; 18yr , alcohol drug abuse , pregnancy , participation another study , skin lesion finger , allergy patch severe allergy , patient give consent .</criteria>
