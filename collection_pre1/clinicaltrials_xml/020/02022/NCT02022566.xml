	<brief_title>The Effect Structured Information Individually Adapted Exercise Levels Physical Activity Measured Accelerometer Patients With Knee Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common chronic joint disorder . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate every second woman every fourth man age 60 suffer form OA . OA common hand , knee , hip back . OA rheumatic disorder affect whole joint may start early age 30 . The main symptom pain , stiffness decrease quality life . The primary goal OA management reduce symptom . Patient education exercise recommend basic treatment accord national well international guideline . It known level physical activity decrease age woman le physical active men . A study healthy woman older 56 year show level activity decrease 10 minute per year , every five year increase age . OA common woman irreversible disease , mean proportion old woman osteoarthritis large . In addition OA common cause inactivity among elderly many fear activity damage joint . Inactivity large risk factor poor physical psychological health well premature death . Level physical activity people OA mainly evaluate self-assessment questionnaire . People hip OA active people knee OA correlation degree radiographic change physical activity weak . Only 30 % early OA knee age group 35-65 year meet recommendation physical activity perform least 30 minute per day moderate intensity , five day per week , measure accelerometer . The primary aim study determine effect structure information individually adapt exercise , deliver support self-management osteoarthritis program , overall level physical activity moderate vigorous intensity patient hip knee OA . The secondary aim compare level physical activity patient hip knee OA . Supported self-management program patient osteoarthritis study 's show improve quality life , physical function decrease pain . No study investigate effect support self-management level physical activity . This observational study control group . Assessments make baseline 3 12 month support self-management course . The self-management program comprise three theoretical session , 90 minute , lead physical therapist hold group session 10 participant group . On third session osteoarthritis communicator participates . That person osteoarthritis communicate lifestyle change he/she do live good life OA . After theoretical part patient offer individually adapted exercise program , opportunity practice program together others supervision physical therapist twice per week 6 week . Patients also encourage find one two exercise perform continuously home exercise . During program home exercise alternative change activity , use walk stick , pain management ect introduce order maintain level physical activity extend period time . The importance physically active long time accentuate aspect patient education . The primary aim support self-management program increase level physical activity empower patient manage disease , avoid illness live good life despite osteoarthritis . Physical activity measure accelerometer baseline , 3 month 12 month . We also study correlation objectivity measure physical activity physical activity questionnaire ( UCLA ) , quality life ( EQ-5D ) , pain ( VAS 0-100 ) comorbidity . All subject study also register Swedish national quality register call Better management patient osteoarthritis ( BOA ) . Some data use present study collect register .</detailed_description>
