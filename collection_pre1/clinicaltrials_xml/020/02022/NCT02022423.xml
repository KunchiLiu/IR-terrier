	<brief_summary>With age American population , number adults peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) increase significantly next several decade . Patients PAD increase risk morbidity mortality include cardiovascular all-cause mortality . While regular physical activity reduces risk vascular event recommend treatment PAD patient , patient meet recommended goal . Exercise program increase long-term adherence walk important contribution PAD treatment . Our Internet-based intervention , online community build walk enhancement program develop member team show improve adherence among patient vascular disease coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Using randomize , control trial study design , propose test automate Internet-based walking program social medium component , improve long-term adherence walk increase walk distance , health-related quality life , among patient PAD . Participants randomize 1 four study group : 1 ) weekly telephone counseling , 2 ) Internet-based walk program , 3 ) combination telephone counsel Internet-based walk program , 4 ) usual care group . The Internet-based walking program social medium component show increase adherence walk overall walk duration population chronic complex condition CAD diabetes . There strong need develop intervention , easily generalizable real-world population , improve reach lifestyle intervention result improved physical function adherence regular exercise among complex medical patient . High risk patient PAD ( CAD risk equivalent ) stand benefit program .</brief_summary>
