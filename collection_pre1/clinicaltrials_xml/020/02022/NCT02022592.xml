	<brief_summary>A goal direct , demand-driven administration sedative drug integral part every intensive care treatment . During long-term application sedative , Midazolam commonly use sedative Europe . One major objective problem oversedation agitation intensive care treatment due lack controllability available substance . The Love-Mi RCT investigate clinical controllability Midazolam versus newly available intravenous drug Lormetazepam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Lormetazepam Midazolam Used Sedatives Patients That Require Intensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Midazolam almost exclusively metabolize intrahepatically . The methyl-group position 1 imidazole ring oxidize liver enzyme . The product a-OH-midazolam . This reaction catalyze p450-dependent oxidase liver . Active a-OH-midazolam inactivated biotransformation type II reaction conjugation . The water soluble , conjugate midazolam excrete kidney . During intensive care treatment , p450 dependent metabolization know `` bottleneck elimination '' many drug inactivate pathway . As phase II ( glucuronidation ) non-saturable practice - phase I reaction limit metabolic capacity . This lead unpredictable prolongation midazolam effect . In contrast , Lormetazepam glucuronized directly OH-group phase II reaction . Since glucuronidation non-saturable , Lormetazepam metabolize nearly constant kinetics even repeatedly administer . Due pharmacokinetics hypothesize Lormetazepam improve controllability compare midazolam . As lead le frequent agitation over-sedation , hypothesize multiple beneficial clinical outcome patient treat lormetazepam instead midazolam .</detailed_description>
