	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics , Safety Study Ticagrelor Hemodialysis Patients Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single dose , randomise , open label , parallel group study conduct US examine PK , PD , safety , tolerability ticagrelor ESRD subject HD compare healthy subject normal renal function . Up total 30 male female adult subject age 18 80 year ( inclusive ) weight least 50 kg body mass index 18 40 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) , dose assure 20 evaluable subject ( 10 subject HD 10 healthy subject normal renal function ( CrCL ≥90 mL/min ) . The normal renal function group similar distribution respect age , weight gender . Subjects require inpatient stay day prior dose 48-hour post-dose time-point ensure PK sample collect appropriate timepoints . The study conduct two group : Group A consist ESRD subject HD , Group B consist healthy subject . A crossover design implement Group A subject follow : Group A subject randomize two sequence , Sequence 1 Sequence 2 . In Sequence 1 , subject receive treatment A Period 1 treatment B Period 2 . There washout period least 7 day Period 1 Period 2 Sequence 1 . Similarly Sequence 2 , subject receive treatment B Period 1 treatment A Period 2 . There washout period least 7 day Period 1 Period 2 Sequence 2 well . Treatment A treatment B define follow : Treatment A : subject dose oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet 1 day follow dialysis session 2 day next dialysis session ; • Treatment B : subject dose oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet prior dialysis session . ( NB : Treatment B dosing occur within 5 minute dialysis start ) . Group B subject ( healthy subject ) normal renal function ( CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min ) receive oral 90 mg ticagrelor refer treatment H. All dose administer open-label design .</detailed_description>
