	<brief_summary>The main cause adverse pregnancy outcome ( ) report maternal infection placental , foetal , uterine pathosis . Maternal infection placental pathosis appear important causal factor , possibly cause pre-term labour , premature pre-term membrane rupture , result medically induced pregnancy interruption . There report link poor maternal periodontal health composite adverse pregnancy outcome pre-term low birth weight ( PLBW ) . however , reason correlation still clear . In current study investigator try follow possible path periodontal infection uterus physiology , signal inflammatory marker may leak gingival fluid serum amniotic fluid . investigator collect GCF , serum amniotic fluid patient undergo elective amniocentesis analyse inflammatory marker collect sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Globally , 4 million baby die within first 4 week life third secondary pre-term birth . In United States , pre-term birth second lead cause neonatal mortality . The US pre-term birth ( &lt; 37 week ) rate rise 12.8 % 2006 , increase 21 % since 1990 rate low birthweight ( &lt; 2500 g ) rise 8.3 % 2006 , increase 19 % since 1990 . Neurological disorder , cerebral palsy , often combine mental disability , epilepsy , cognitive impairment , special concern survivor pre-term birth . Even though pre-term birth occur small proportion infant population , societal personal health impact considerable disproportionately high perinatal morbidity , mortality , need costly medical care . However , disappoint date , intervention prevent pre-term birth proven almost universally ineffective . The main cause adverse pregnancy outcome ( ) report maternal infection placental , fetal , uterine pathosis . Maternal infection placental pathosis appear important causal factor , cause pre-term labour , premature pre-term membrane rupture , result medically induced pregnancy interruption . Prominent risk factor pre-term birth include history previous pre-term birth , demographic characteristic , periodontal disease , behavioral factor tobacco use . Offenbacher et al . first report link human poor maternal periodontal health composite adverse pregnancy outcome pre-term low birth weight ( PLBW ) . They report woman periodontal disease much likely periodontally healthy woman experience pre-term low birth weight infant ( OR=7.5 PLBW case ; OR=7.9 primiparous PLBW case ) . Pro-inflammatory mediator generate within diseased periodontal tissue may affect maternal-foetal unit . When present amniotic fluid , chronic high level cytokine prostaglandin may lead intra-uterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , spontaneous pre-term labour , premature rupture membrane , pre-term birth . Several study report association adverse pregnancy outcome high gingival crevicular fluid level PGE2 IL-1β elevate amniotic fluid concentration PGE2 , IL-1β IL-8 Dörtbudak . It possible IL-6 produce inflamed periodontal tissue affect foetal membrane cause pre-term uterine contraction . There evidence gingival crevicular fluid level IL-6 high gingivitis periodontitis compare healthy control . Bacteria activate cell-mediated immunological response , lead production release cytokine , include interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , prostaglandins , endotoxins lipopolysaccharides , may precipitate pre-term labour reach foeto-placental unit . Endotoxin lipopolysaccharide Gram-negative bacteria may detect biological fluid sterile compartment amniotic cavity . Administration endotoxin pregnant animal result embryo resorption , pre-term labour , foetal death . A high risk spontaneous pre-term delivery associate genetically drive excessive amniotic fluid IL-Iβ disturbance bioavailability and/or bio-response cytokine , central pro-inflammatory reaction infectious stimulant . The foetus also role pre-term birth ; foetus recognize hostile intrauterine environment may precipitate labour premature activation foetal-placental parturition pathway . The causality relationship periodontal disease inflammatory mediator ' presence amnionic fluid test date . In present study investigator aim investigate correlation inflammatory mediator serum presence amniotic fluid . The investigator investigate correlation result pregnancy outcome ( gestation age , foetal weight health , etc. ) . Israel amniocentesis healthy woman common . The cellular fraction sample amniotic fluid use amniocentesis test , supernatant discard . For present study investigator aim use supernatant amniocentesis test do healthy woman ( age 21-45 ) well serum . Using ELISA quantify level inflammatory marker IL-6 , TNFα IL-1β . The investigator also test presence endotoxin perio-pathogens DNA serum amnionic fluid . Follow-up data regard gestational outcome also collect . participant follow duration hospital stay , expect average 5 week</detailed_description>
