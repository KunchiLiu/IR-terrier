	<brief_summary>The goal non-invasively study metabolic process within aortic wall think explain progression clinical manifestation aortic aneurysm . Hypothesis non-invasive image Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) contrast ultrasound , couple serum biomarker measurement allow identification vulnerable aortic wall patient risk AAA growth rupture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Predictors Aortic Aneurysm Growth Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim # 1 : Prospective Contrast Ultrasound ( CUS ) image patient AAA predict AAA growth test gender difference rate growth rupture . Aim # 2 : Serum biomarker test patient AAA . CUS finding correlate serum biomarkers AAA wall histology . Prospective Contrast Ultrasound image patient AAA part pilot feasibility study predict AAA growth test gender difference rate growth rupture . CUS finding correlate serum biomarkers AAA wall histology . Potential significance : This study evaluate AAA wall base detect area increase vas vasorum density within aneurysm wall intraluminal thrombus , indicate regional ischemia inflammation aortic wall propensity weakening , enlargement rupture . This novel evaluation aortic wall patient AAA allow individualize treatment base biological potential growth rupture .</detailed_description>
