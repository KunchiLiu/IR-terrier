	<brief_title>CAS Length Hospital Stay After TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number patient receive total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) steadily increase although reliability result procedure excellent , intensive functional rehabilitation need postoperatively obtain satisfactory range motion . Currently , standard length stay hospital 8 10 day patient undergo TKA . The length stay depend factor early mobilization , pain management , major minor complication logistical organizational problem ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . It also depend availability adequate service patient need transfer appropriate facility . Each step develop order improve quality care patient , reduce hospital cost increase availability bed ( 3 ) . As result , reduction average length stay would result reduction cost also great turnover number patient . Several study show application post-operative fast-track strategy may reduce length stay significant manner benefit patient hospital ( 3 ) .Thus , condition allows , patient would rapid post-operative rehabilitation , early joint mobilization D0 ( operative day ) walk D1 ( first post-operative day ) . The Cumulated Ambulation Score ( CAS ) ( 4 ) tool develop tested initial predict in-patient length stay follow hip surgery . The CAS consist document patient 's ability independence perform 3 basic daily activity ( sit stand , transfer bed mobilization ) . It calculate use score 0-2 parameter , give total daily score 0 6 score 0 18 first 3 post-operative day . The CAS sum score first 3 post-operative day . This score prove effective tool predict length stay , parameter investigate survival rate return home proximal femoral surgery .</detailed_description>
