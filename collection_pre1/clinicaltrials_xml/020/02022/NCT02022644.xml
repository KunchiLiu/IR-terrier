	<brief_title>Study Convection-Enhanced , Image-Assisted Delivery Liposomal-Irinotecan In Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High grade glioma ( HGG ) common brain tumor adult , 15,000 new cases/year USA . Despite progress make use combination therapy include surgery , radiation and/or chemotherapy , treatment HGG remain challenge typical median survival 6-12 month patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GB ) 24-36 month patient anaplastic astrocytoma . The time tumor progression patient recurrent GBM nine week median survival 25 week , recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas ( AA ) , time tumor progression 13 week median survival 47 week . More recently , single-agent Avastin see improve 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS-6 ) 42.6 % well increase Median Overall Survival 9.3 month patient recurrent GBM . However , chemotherapy treatment malignant glioma limitation give low activity available antineoplastic agent , emergence de-novo presence resistance agent , sensitivity brain irreversible damage therapeutic modality , compromise delivery agent partially privilege intracranial site . Effective agent novel mechanism action need evaluate HGG account limitation . With limitation mind , study directs attention two particularly appeal delivery modality may improve efficacy neuro-oncologic chemotherapeutic agent : liposome ( liposomal irinotecan ) convection enhance delivery ( CED ) . Liposomes typically compose double chain phospholipid amphiphiles ( chemical compound combine hydrophilic lipophilic property ) combination cholesterol , form spheroidal bilayer membrane structure encompass aqueous internal domain . Based structural/pharmacologic feature , distinct liposome class develop package various therapeutic agent treatment cancer . From circulate bloodstream , liposomes able diffuse across blood brain barrier ( BBB ) due lipophilic characteristic . An example liposomal irinotecan may reduce toxicity irinotecan healthy tissue maintain increase anti-tumor potency . CED improve chemotherapeutic delivery brain tumor intraparenchymally utilize bulk flow , fluid convection , establish result pressure gradient , rather concentration gradient . As , CED offer markedly improve distribution infuse therapeutic within central nervous system ( CNS ) compare direct injection via drug elute polymer , depend diffusion parenchymal distribution . Additionally , CED obviate challenge systemic agent cross blood brain barrier minimize systemic exposure toxicity . Through maintenance pressure gradient delivery cannula tip surround tissue , CED able distribute small large molecule , include high molecular weight protein , clinically significant target volume centimeter rather millimeter diameter . Although develop independently , work combine two delivery option , liposome CED , presently underway effort improve treatment efficacy treatment CNS malignancy . This clinical trial step direction prospective , single-arm , open-label trial delivers liposomal-irinotecan gadolinium ( provide real time image delivery ) CED patient recurrent malignant glioma . Added logic support recent preclinical study University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) compare route delivery liposomal irinotecan ( CED versus IV ) show superior anti-tumor activity CED administration treat mice intracranial glioblastoma xenograft . In total , result indicate liposomal formulation plus direct intratumoral administration therapeutic important maximize anti-tumor effect irinotecan support current clinical trial evaluation therapeutic plus CED route administration combination .</detailed_description>
