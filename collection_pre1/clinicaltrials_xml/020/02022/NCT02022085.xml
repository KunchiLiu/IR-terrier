	<criteria>Adult subject , i.e . ≥ 18 year age Conductive mixed hearing loss ear implant : Bone conduction threshold pure tone average PTA4 &lt; 30 dB hear level ( mean 500 , 1000 , 2000 4000 Hz ) . OR Singlesided sensorineural deafness ( SSD ) : European site : Bone conduction threshold pure tone average PTA4 &lt; 30dB hearing level ( mean 500 , 1000 , 2000 4000 Hz ) good ear . US sit : Air conduction threshold pure tone average PTA4 20 dB hear level ( mean 500 , 1000 , 2000 3000 Hz ) good ear OR Subject indicate AC CROS but—for reason— use AC CROS . No previous bone conduction implant side skull implant . Signed informed consent . Subjects schedule simultaneous bilateral implant surgery . The investigation limit subject unilateral use Baha Attract System ( however , bilateral hearing loss exclusion criterion ) . Suitable implant position BI300 Implant ( 4 mm 3 mm ) find surgery due insufficient bone quality and/or bone thickness . Less 3 mm soft tissue thickness plan implant site . Subjects receive radiation therapy side skull Baha Attract System position . Condition could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound heal judge investigator ( e.g . osteoporosis , psoriasis , use corticosteroid ) . Uncontrolled diabetes judge investigator . Condition may impact outcome investigation judge investigator . Unable follow investigational procedure ( e.g . complete quality life scale ) . Participation another investigation pharmaceutical and/or medical device .</criteria>
