Because traditional trial design evaluate one agent time , evaluation therapy combination require specialized trial design . In place traditional separate phase I II trial , trial us single phase I/II clinical trial evaluate simultaneously safety efficacy combination dose level , select optimal combination dose . Therefore , two part trial Debio 1143 combine concurrent cisplatin radiotherapy ( CRT ) participants previously untreated stage III , IVa IVb head neck cancer . The trial begin initial period dose escalation ( Phase I ) investigate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Debio 1143 safely give combination CRT . Using MTD determine Phase I portion , randomize phase II trial 94 participant compare Debio 1143 placebo , concomitant CRT . The aim evaluate efficacy safety Debio 1143 .</brief_summary>
