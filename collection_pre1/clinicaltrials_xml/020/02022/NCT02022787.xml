	<detailed_description>I n previous study initiate experimental model different inflammatory autoimmune disease extend human , show course inflammatory autoimmune disease , immune system selectively generate auto-Ab response inflammatory mediator , mostly chemokines cytokine , think participate promote inflammatory process ( 1-6 ) . For example , show patient suffer rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) osteoarthritis display significant level neutralize auto- Abs direct TNF-a ( tumor necrosis factor ) ( 3 ) . These patient mount auto-Ab response either several key inflammatory chemokines regulatory mediator , IL-10 ( interleukin-10 ) TGF-b ( tumor growth factor ) ( , even chemokine CXCL12 ( C-X-C motif chemokine 12 ) , also function regulatory mediator select Ag-specific IL-10-producing CD4+ ( cluster differentiation 4 ) T cell ( 7 ) . Complementary experiment suggest experimentally induced RA , anti-TNF-a auto-Abs participate natural regulation disease restrain—although incapable totally preventing—its development ( 3 ) . Nevertheless , selective amplification target DNA vaccine lead rapid recovery ongoing disease ( 8 ) . These study also show selective breakdown tolerance TNF-a due preferential expression partially immune-restricted site undergoing destructive process ( 3 , 8 ) . Very recently , show type I diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) patient preferentially display auto-Ab production CCL3 ( Chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 3 ) several proinflammatory chemokines ( 9 ) . It yet proven chemokine dominate chemokine expression autoimmune site . Nevertheless , previous study show selective neutralization CCL3 suppress T1DM NOD mouse implication important role chemokine disease ( 10 ) . Similarly organ-specific autoimmunity various cancer disease , one cancer prostate ( CaP ) , key inflammatory chemokines express primary tumor site , also undergoes destructive process restrict site . In previous study show primary tumor section prostate cancer subject , CCL2Chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ) predominantly express tumor site chemokines also associate tumor development , include : CXCL12 , CXCL10 , CXCL8 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL5 . Subsequently , immune response selectivity mount Ab-based response CCL2 . These Abs neutralizing Abs . These finding hold diagnostic therapeutic implication . Little known possible function chemokine receptor development progression renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Few study exist deal gene expression chemokines RCC . We therefore suggest study check antibody response chemokines</detailed_description>
