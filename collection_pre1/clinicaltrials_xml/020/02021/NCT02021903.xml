	<detailed_description>Excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) observe 30 50 % patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient , Dementia Lewy Bodies ( DLB ) Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) . It major complain represent socially relevant problem unintended episode sleep also occur drive example . The exact pathophysiology EDS PD , DLB MSA fully elucidate far , although pharmacological factor ( dopaminergic medication ) pathological factor ( neurodegeneration sleep-wakefulness regulatory area ) identify . Arterial hypotension frequently observe patient PD , DLB MSA consider marker autonomic failure . Sleepiness known occur preferentially patient arterial hypotension whatever cause ( i.e . postprandial period , administration hypotensive medication dopamine agonist ) . We hypothesize arterial hypotension associate abnormal sleepiness . We observe association on-going epidemiological survey ( COPARK Cohort 800 PD patient , manuscript preparation ) . Hyperglycaemia induce oral glucose load - standardized model simulate food intake meal - provokes arterial hypotension majority Parkinson 's disease patient dysautonomia . It hypothesise sleep attack patient could mediate fall blood pressure .</detailed_description>
