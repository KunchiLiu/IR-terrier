	<brief_summary>Anaemia condition blood lower normal number red blood cell . It also occur red blood cell contain enough haemoglobin , oxygen carry part blood . Anaemia common patient chronic kidney disease . Healthy kidneys produce hormone call erythropoietin , stimulate bone marrow produce proper number red blood cell need carry oxygen vital organ . Chronic kidney disease general term mean kidney function full potential . The study drug , BAY85-3934 , evaluate drug increase body 's ability produce erythropoietin . The purpose study find study drug , tablet take orally , safe effective treatment anaemia associate chronic kidney disease . The study enroll 120 patient multiple location Europe , Asia Australia . Participation involve screen visit 12 15 study visit schedule period approximately 5 7 month . The estimated total duration study treatment 16 week . During scheduled visit patient undergo number procedure confirm efficacy safety study drug , include measurement heart rate blood pressure , physical examination , Electrocardiogram blood/urine sample collection laboratory test . The study conduct 3 hospital UK . Bayer HealthCare AG funding research .</brief_summary>
