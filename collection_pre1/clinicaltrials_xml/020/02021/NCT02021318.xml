	<brief_summary>This study conduct explore new therapy anemia patient chronic kidney disease . Anemia reduce number red blood cell hemoglobin . Hemoglobin ( contain iron ) important transport oxygen blood . The purpose study see Roxadustat effective safe treat anemia patient chronic kidney disease . Roxadustat study compare darbepoetin alfa , commercially available medicine treatment anemia ( tradename Aranesp ) .</brief_summary>
