	<brief_summary>The main hypothesis research use informatics intervention problem-solving diabetes management , Mobile Diabetes Detective ( MoDD ) , individual type 2 diabetes lead positive improvement number primary secondary outcome relate health management diabetes . The primary outcome reduction individual ' glycolated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , improvement problem-solving ability , self-care behavior . Secondary outcome include reduction individual ' fast blood glucose ( BG ) ; improvement individual ' self-efficacy , emotional aspect living diabetes . We hypothesize primary secondary outcome effect sustain three month twelve month . Exploratory outcomes include decrease individual ' Cardiovascular Risk ( Body Mass Index , Blood Pressure , Total , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) Cholesterol level , Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score ) . We also hypothesize improvement clinical outcome ( HbA1c , fast BG Cardiovascular Risk ) mediate improvement problem-solving ability self-efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Well-developed problem-solving essential successful diabetes management result well diabetes self-care behavior , lead improvement clinical outcome . Problem-solving central many self-management behavior change program ; American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) include problem-solving critical self-care behavior . Given importance problem solve skill , innovative diabetes education program , Discovering Diabetes , develop show effective fostering independent problem-solving . At time , many care management program diabetes education center struggle staff shortage , limited funding , competitive time demand . As result , 50 80 % individual diabetes experience significant knowledge skill deficit . Health Information Technology ( HIT ) make successful intervention available diverse population . At present , however , many HIT intervention target improve patient-clinician communication log monitoring , rather focus specifically foster problem-solving skill . Moreover , HIT intervention rigorously evaluate controlled trial . The main contribution research theoretically-grounded HIT intervention , Mobile Diabetes Detective ( MoDD ) , incorporate best practice current guideline support foster individual ' problem-solving skill context diabetes self-management . In prior work develop evaluate mobile application reflection discovery diabetes management , MAHI ( Mobile Access Health Information ) . MAHI help individual diabetes capture diabetes-related experience reflect supervision diabetes educator . The propose intervention , MoDD extend prior work , specifically focus guide problem-solving experimentation . The intervention utilize open source platform disease self-management develop research team . If result achieve , project significant impact locally globally . Locally , diabetes continue major problem NYC , particularly among disadvantaged population , many serve Health Resources Services Administration ( HRSA ) fund Community Health Centers ( CHCs ) participate study . In past 10 year , number people diabetes NYC double . An estimated 530,000 adult New Yorkers diagnose diabetes , another 265,000 diabetes unaware . In HRSA fund CHCs New York State , 8 % adult patient diagnosis diabetes . At time , prior study show despite barrier low health literacy lower socio-economic status , disadvantage population NYC greatly benefit informatics intervention target health wellness . The propose research use HIT partially assuage ongoing challenge control management diabetes . The expected improvement problem-solving skill show lead improve self-care behavior , careful diet appropriate level exercise , significant reduction HbA1c7 , turn link reduction diabetes-related complication . Thinking broadly , research provide new insight facilitate problem-solving diabetes management HIT , alternative traditional staff-intensive intervention .</detailed_description>
