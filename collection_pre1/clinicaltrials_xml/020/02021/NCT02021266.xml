	<brief_title>Single Patient Expanded Access Protocol : Metabolic Boost</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) establish important therapeutic option patient variety inherit metabolic disorder ( IMD ) . The potential life-threatening complication conventional myeloablative HSCT limit application . Additionally , conventional HSCT available small minority medically suitable candidate histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -identical sibling donate bone marrow mobilize peripheral blood stem cell . Donor mobilize peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow process via novel technology deplete mature immune cell retain hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) graft facilitate cell ( FC ) . A now-standard reduced intensity , nonmyeloablative recipient condition regimen use promote mixed allogeneic chimerism , thereby significantly reduce morbidity mortality . These two enhancement intend significantly improve benefit : risk ratio HSCT patient IMDs . If successful , transplantation become feasible option patient without HLA-identical sibling donate stem cell , could offer patient early disease progression . The objective study establish chimerism follow reduce intensity condition grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . The primary endpoint follow production miss enzyme ≥ 10 % normal level day 180 post-transplant investigational new drug ( IND ) 14070 . This expand access protocol detail approach provide second dose product .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject previously enrol qualified transplant IND 14070 . Subject must free infection normal liver , kidney , heart pulmonary function proceed second transplant . 1 . Patient must adequate function organ system measure : Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/min/1.73m2 . Newborns must creatinine clearance &gt; 25 cc/min . For baby &lt; 3 month age , raw value GFR must &gt; 1 cc/kg/min . Hepatic transaminase ( ALT/AST ) 2.5 x normal , bilirubin &lt; 2.0mg/dl Normal cardiac function echocardiogram radionuclide scan ( ejection fraction shorten fraction &gt; 80 % normal value age ) Pulmonary function test ( PFT ) demonstrate force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) &gt; 50 % predicted age . If child young unable perform PFTs , cry vital capacity result &gt; 50 % normal value age rest pulse oximeter &gt; 92 % room air clearance pulmonologist require . 2 . Patient , parent , legal guardian must give write informed consent accord FDA guideline . 3 . Patient must minimum life expectancy least 6 month . 4 . Female patient childbearing potential pregnant lactating/breastfeeding must either surgically sterile , postmenopausal ( menses previous 12 month ) , must practice effective method birth control determine investigator ( e.g. , oral contraceptive , double barrier method , hormonal injectable implanted contraceptive , tubal ligation , partner vasectomy ) . 5 . Recipient screen include glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , chest Xray ( CXR ) , hepatic renal chemistry , coagulation study , pulmonary function testing , ECHO clinically relevant , chimerism testing , type screen , enzyme level within 30 day retransplant . 1 . Uncontrolled seizure , apnea , evidence recurrent uncontrolled aspiration , need chronic mechanical ventilation . 2 . Subject must previous radiation therapy would preclude total body irradiation ( TBI ) ( determine radiation therapist ) 3 . Uncontrolled infection severe concomitant disease , judgment Principal Investigator , could tolerate reduce intensity transplantation . 4 . Subject positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody test result 5 . Subject pregnant , indicate positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) test 6 . Subject whose donor pregnant time intend transplant 7 . Subject childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception define investigator site 8 . Jehovah 's witness unwilling transfuse 9 . Patient comorbid condition , view Principal Investigators , render patient high risk treatment complication regimen related morbidity/mortality . 10 . Insufficient fund bone marrow processing .</criteria>
