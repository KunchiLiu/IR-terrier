	<brief_summary>1 . Research background - High blood pressure one important risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVDs ) . Reducing population blood pressure control CVD incidence low mortality effectively . Much research proven adjust Na K intake level reduce blood pressure . According China Salt Substitute Study , systolic blood pressure intervention group use salt substitute 5.4 mmHg low control group . Life expectancy Tibet 67 year old . It estimate use salt substitute among population Tibet reduce total mortality Tibet 20 % . China Salt Substitute Study Tibet ( CSSS-Tibet ) , find salt substitute effective lower systolic diastolic blood pressure offer simple , low-cost approach hypertension control among Tibetans China ( unpublished result ) . However , study focus hypertensive patient , effectiveness hypertension control provide free salt substitute entire population remain unknown , large-scale trial need . 2 . Objectives - Primary objective observe effect provide salt substitute population blood pressure Tibet . Secondary objective observe effect intervention population mortality , cardiovascular mortality life expectancy . In addition , data collect high-risk population ( sub-group ) study use China Salt Substitute Stroke Study ( SSaSS ) . Also , serum cholesterol random blood glucose people 60 Tibet collect . 3 . Method - The study open , cluster-randomized , controlled trial . - 30 village 15 35 household distance least five kilometer select Damxung county Maizhokunggar county . The two county average altitude 4000 meter Tibet Autonomous Region . - All select village randomly assign intervention group control group 1:1 ratio . - All household select village recruit meet eligibility criterion . Approximately 4,500 participant enrol - Intervention group receive free salt substitute . Control group continue buy normal salt . Both group receive health education salt reduction . 4 . Outcome - Primary outcome blood pressure . Secondary outcome include total mortality , cardiovascular disease mortality , life expectancy , serum cholesterol level people 60 , random blood glucose level people 60 .</brief_summary>
