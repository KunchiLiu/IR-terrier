	<brief_title>Next Generation DNA Sequencing Patients With Idiopathic Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertility involve 15 % couple attempt conceive male factor account half case . Idiopathic , azoospermia , oligozoospermia , may genetically base , constitute significant number male infertility cases.In recent year , increase recognition genetic abnormality cause male infertility . Genetic factor contribute 15 - 30 % male infertility case . These abnormality may numerical chromosomal abnormality ; common Klinefelter syndrome , structural e.g . Y-chomosome microdeletion , DNA mutations mitochondrial DNA mutation . They account 5 % -10 % case oligozoospermia , 15 % -25 % case non-obstructive azoospermia . In azoospermia , sex chromosome abnormality predominant . However , autosomal structural chromosomal abnormality chief genetic cause oligozoospermia may balance unbalanced . In substantial proportion case ( 32 % infertile men , 1.5 % male population ) , underlie cause unknown ( idiopathic infertility ) . While cytogenetic study successful revealing cause non-obstructive azoospermic men still idiopathic . They believe carry unknown autosomal mutation base study familial male infertility often involve two siblings.Regulation complex process spermatogenesis depend cooperation many gene express various stage differentiation , mitotic , meiotic cell division , postmeiotic development finally lead spermatozoon . Identification gene play crucial role spermatogenesis mainly base observation rodent , particularly mouse model . In human , identification remain largely unavailable difficulty gain access tissue sample male gonad limited possibility functional verification human . Hence genetic cause male infertility yet well recognize . Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) effective tool Mendelian gene identification . So far , 30 Mendelian disease gene identify use NGS , include recessive dominant disease . NGS data also use discover linkage homozygosity interval , well determine copy number number specific interval ( Becker et al . 2011 , Krawitz et al . 2010 ) . 15 , 16 The two major branch next-generation DNA sequence whole-exome ( WE ) whole genome ( WG ) sequence . While WGS comprehensive useful population genetics diseases complex non-exonic inheritance suspect , WES remain powerful , cost-effective tool detect rare mutation within patient population . Our use WGS WES depend nature patient recruit study . In case depth coverage requirement high , WES would better-suited allows 4-6 exomes cover depth cost 1 genome 30X . This would aid sample rarer allele within population discover novel mutation patient present unaffected family member . This especially useful case disease wide allelic heterogeneity may exist , patient test negative common mutation may novel mutation would otherwise undetectable traditional method . Multiple member family may affect infertility similar different presentation testicular failure different histopathologies . In presence normal karyotyping Y-chromosome microdeletion , usually leave unknown genetic abnormality . Genetic cause male factor infertility broadly assume result either de novo mutation inherit patient one parent polymorphisms circulate population . In case , search potential genetic cause infertility must rely comparison DNA sequence patient control fertile member family .</detailed_description>
