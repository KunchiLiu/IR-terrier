	<brief_summary>Low dose sub-anaesthetic dose ketamine show reduce postoperative pain analgesic consumption . However , due heterogeneous result , standard dose regimen available . Recently , effect postoperative outcome development post-operative surgical pain also suggest . Ketamine show reduce post-operative early inflammation especially serum IL-6 . Therefore , study effect post- operative pain outcome due inflammation suggest . Only clinical study assess post-operative pain related inflammation . Pain third molar surgery good model postoperative acute inflammatory pain . A previous study show benefit administer ketamine oral surgery pain relief . However , study demonstrate ketamine use sedative local ketamine third molar surgery could reduce postoperative dental pain , swell trismus . Postsurgical facial oedema difficult quantify accurately three dimensional . Over year , various measurement technique try measure oedema objectively . These include direct linear measurement use tape flexible ruler across fix soft tissue landmark , standardize stereophotographic measurement , computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasonography ( US ) three - dimensional ( 3D ) laser scan . Recently , three dimensional image reconstruction use reversed engineering technique develop used manufacturing industry . This technology could apply clinical set monitoring soft tissue change . In study , investigator aim study use sub-anaesthetic dose ketamine post-operative dental pain recovery outcomes . The investigator hypothesise post-operative pain Bilateral Third Molar General Anaesthesia less patient receive sub-anaesthetic ketamine incision . The magnitude effect compare positive control group ( dexamethasone ) well placebo group ( normal saline ) . Further , investigator aim demonstrate whether ketamine reduce post-operative facial oedema post-operative outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3 group : Ketamine group : • Patient receive single dose intravenous ketamine 0.5mg/kg incision . Dexamethasone group : - Patient receive single dose intravenous dexamethasone 8mg incision Control group - Patient receive single dose intravenous normal saline incision . Process : After obtain informed consent , patient randomly allocate one three group . HADS SF-36 questionnaire complete patient admission . Blood serum IL-6 TNF - α take . 3D laser scan face perform . The patient receive premedication follow routine preoperative preparation . Patients educate use Numerical Pain Rating Scale pain assessment , 0= pain 10 severe pain . P deletion test mini-mental test do ward operation . Before induction , ketamine 0.5mg/kg , dexamethasone 8mg normal saline volume administrate intravenously accord study group allocate . Induction anaesthesia achieve accord standard protocol . Regional block 2 % lignocaine 1 80000 adrenaline perform surgeon start procedure . The surgery start anaesthesia effective . The patient transfer recovery area monitoring least 30 minute postoperatively . The vital sign include blood pressure , pulse SpO2 Ramsay sedation score ( RSS ) assess every 5 minute . Pain score ( NRS ) record every 15 minute . The patient send back general ward parameter normal . P deletion test do postoperative hour 2 general ward performance least operation . Mini-mental test do 2 hour postoperatively . Hourly blood pressure , pulse , SpO2 pain score ( NRS ) perform 4 hour . Pain score ( NRS ) assess 4 hourly afterward . Quality recovery assess operation Chinese QoR . Serum IL-6 TNF-α take postoperative 6th hour 16th hour . Paracetamol 1 g three time daily tramadol 50mg three time daily require prescribed postoperatively . The patient discharge home postoperative day 1 discharge criterion meet . 3D laser scan face perform discharge . They ask degree satisfaction operation . Paracetamol 1 g three time daily tramadol 50mg three time daily require prescribed discharge . A diary give patient . From postoperative day 1 day 3 , morning , average pain score ( NRS ) , analgesic consumption side effect mark diary patient . At 3rd month operation , severity nature pain surgical site ask phone . The patient ask go Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery out-patient clinic Prince Philip Dental Hospital postoperative day 2 3D laser scan face .</detailed_description>
