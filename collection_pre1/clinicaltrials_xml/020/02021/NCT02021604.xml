	<brief_summary>Low blood sugar know cause brain damage newborn baby . One common cause low blood sugar persist beyond new born period condition call congenital hyperinsulinism ( HI ) . This disease whereby pancreas secretes much insulin cause low blood sugar . Twenty forty percent baby brain damage . There two form disease . In one form small part pancreas make much insulin ( focal HI ) , whole pancreas make much insulin ( diffuse HI ) . If surgeon could know part pancreas focal lesion could remove cure patient . The purpose study investigate whether new investigational drug call Fluorodopa F 18 , use PET scan , find focal lesion guide surgeon remove , thus cure patient prevent brain damage</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorodopa F 18 Congenital Hyperinsulinism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital Hyperinsulinism ( HI ) disorder insulin secretion cause profound hypoglycemia lead significant morbidity . It common form persistent neonatal hypoglycemia , dangerous . Inappropriate insulin secretion cause hypoglycemia also inability release free fatty acid adipose tissue inability release glycogen liver . Hence brain deprive major fuel source ( glucose , beta-hydroxybutyrate lactate ) energy thus leading high incidence brain damage . In 50 % case congenital hyperinsulinism , medical therapy fail surgical resection pancreas necessary . Previous technique develop differentiate patient focal HI surgery could result cure invasive put infant risk hypoglycemic brain damage arterial thrombosis . It known beta cell pancreatic islet , similar neuroendocrine tissue , contain amino acid decarboxylase ( AADC ) . Beta cell take L-Dopa convert dopamine AADC . It propose neuroendocrine tumor phaeochromocytoma carcinoid tumor express AADC easily visualize use Fluorodopa F 18 PET also would pancreas easily accurately visualize . After initial report demonstrate effectiveness , safety accuracy , 200 patient HI report literature Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan suggestion referral major HI center Fluorodopa F 18 PET CT integral part standard care management patient HI require surgery . Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan patient Hyperinsulinism establish Europe Australia , close 95 % sensitivity . When link Computed Tomography ( CT ) image pancreas , Fluorodopa F 18 PET allows surgeon image pancreas three dimension , even accurately identify site focal lesion , increase chance sufficient partial pancreatectomy cure patient . The objective study : 1 . To determine , use Positron Emission Tomography , qualitative uptake radiopharmaceutical agent , Fluorodopa F 18 , produce distance far image center , pancreas patient congenital hyperinsulinism . 2 . To determine whether , use method Computed Tomography Scanning combine Fluorodopa F 18 pancreatic image match surgical histopathological finding focal vs. diffuse islet cell abnormalities patient congenital hyperinsulinism receive partial complete pancreatectomy treat disease .</detailed_description>

The patient 's Endocrinologist determine patient safely manage standard medical therapy ( fail ) surgery recommend prevent future episode severe hypoglycemia preserve brain function . Failure medical therapy define : Hypoglycemia ( blood glucose &lt; 70 m/dL ) single measure despite use antihypoglycemic medication , applicable individual patient , include limited diazoxide octreotide Inability fast , define inability maintain blood glucose &gt; 50 mg/dL : 1 ) 12 hour infant &lt; 1 year age ; 2 ) 15 hour 13 year age ; 3 ) 18 hour 3 year age Patients genetic testing ( available informative ) prove diffuse HI disease . Such child might consider one follow situation : genetic testing result ( e.g. , due insurance denial parental refusal ) negative genetic testing ( note : 75 % mutation may find exist technology ) autosomal recessive mutation ABCC8 KCNJ11 maternal allele autosomal dominant mutation ABCC8 KCNJ11 Patients think focal HI disease base genetic test wellcontrolled blood glucose level degree dietary medical management , BUT patient parent ( ) LAR wish proceed surgery possible cure HI disease .
