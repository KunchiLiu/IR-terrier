	<detailed_description>There certain category diseases prevalent Arab world due increase rate consanguinity relatively isolated population . The goal discover mutation use next-generation human genetics tool . These include high-throughput sequence genotyping along necessary bioinformatics analysis lead discovery cause inherited disease region.The secondary objective build comprehensive catalogue genetic variation Arab world . This include detect mutation , subset cause disease ( primary objective ) , also know trait-altering mutation well general diversity DNA level among human population region . This catalogue become widely useful resource many project road , rely anonymizing individual sample instead display data aggregate cohort collect sample grow year . The study include genetic disorder ethnic background Mendelian disease gene mutation already identify exclude . Evidence Mendelian Transmission determine fulfil one follow criterion : Multiple affect family member ( least first degree relative disease ) History consanguinity Severe disease newborn absence family history Sydromic disease single individual Congenital abnormality affect major organ system ( ) Mendelianized extremes common disease ( eg sever familial diabetes/ obesity/ hypertension )</detailed_description>
