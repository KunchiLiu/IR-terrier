	<brief_title>A Pilot , Prospective , Non-randomized Evaluation Safety Anakinra Plus Standard Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kineret ( anakinra ) FDA-approved drug indicate rheumatoid arthritis . Anakinra recombinant , nonglycosylated form human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) . Anakinra block biologic activity IL -1 competitively inhibit IL-1 bind interleukin-1 type I receptor ( IL-1RI ) , express wide variety tissue organ . IL-1 production induce response inflammatory stimulus mediate various physiologic effect include inflammatory immunological response . This pilot , prospective , non-randomized , consecutive enrollment study enroll 12 subject meet study define inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects undergo standard care chemotherapy treatment/regimens ( i.e. , modify FOLFIRINOX ) . Subjects dispense 2 week supply anakinra day begin chemotherapy . They instruct begin self-administering anakinra ( study drug ) injection day first dose chemotherapy . They blood sample collect baseline 6 month follow . If surgery disease , may tissue sample collect later analysis .</detailed_description>
