	<brief_title>Effects Gilenya ( Fingolimod ) Thalamus Pathology Cognitive Impairment Patients With Relapsing Forms Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-blinded , observational , prospective , 24 month follow-up , control study ass efficacy Gilenya thalamus pathology cognitive impairment 30 relapse MS patient na√Øve Gilenya fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion use screening start Gilenya , clinical basis . In addition , 20 HCs include reference population . Because observational study investigate evolution thalamic atrophy , iron deposition , cognitive dysfunction response herpes viruses patient treat Gilenya clinical basis patient start Gilenya investigational drug . Therefore , patient already start Gilenya treatment decision physician ask participate observational study . The screen starting procedure criteria Gilenya clinical basis study define Gilenya PI . All patient clinic standardized assessment start disease-modifying therapy . Once patient decide start Gielnya clinical basis qualify screening , define Gilenya PI , team inform contact patient regard participation present study receive first dose Gilenya . Once informed consent sign , patient follow study procedure , outline protocol study evaluation schedule . All subject assess 0 , 6 , 12 24 month clinical , 3T MRI laboratory , humoral response herpes virus examination . The cognitive assessment evaluation environmental risk factor perform 0 , 12 24 month . Safety also assess 0 , 6 , 12 24 month study . The healthy control ( HC ) serve reference comparison group patient atrophy iron , cognitive response herpesvirus outcome . We consider alternative study design list . The head-to-head comparison untreated comparator-treated patient difficult conduct perform without proper randomization double-blinding costly unfeasible mechanistical study like one propose . The inclusion HC group provide valuable baseline , allow evaluation propose technique normal variation individual , change propose outcome could compare . Use HCs comparison patient population prospective longitudinal pilot study non-conventional MRI , include measurement thalamic atrophy iron deposition , may become attractive approach future several reason . First , ultimate goal therapy normalize patient change time , observe HCs time period . HCs also experience brain change time notion arrest disease progression measure propose outcome require validation reference comparator without disease progression account age-related change . Second , ethical consideration preclude placebo-controlled study use establish MS treatment versus placebo-treatment patient RRMS . The MRI analysis perform fully blind , phase I , II , III IV trial calculate Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center ( BNAC ) , Buffalo , NY . BNAC involve centralized MRI reading center many MS clinical trial include 500 site around world 55 country The detailed procedure MRI DICOM file blind workload distribute part internal standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) accept appropriate following standard audits government industry agency . All participant undergo study eligibility screen consent Clinical Research Project Coordinator . The participant provide description require test study participation , risk describe order person make inform decision regard voluntary study participation . This also opportunity person ask question regard study test component . All study participant choose enroll study ask sign date consent form front Study Coordinator also sign date consent witness .</detailed_description>
