	<brief_title>Effect Shisha Smoking Biology Airway Epithelium Qatar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional shisha smoking practice ~10 % Qatari adult population . Although base tobacco leaf , shisha smoking expose airway epithelium chemical insult intensity duration different cigarette smoking . This study , collaboration WCMC-Qatar WCMC-New York Hamad Medical Corporation ( HMC ) , focus define biology airway epithelium shisha smoker compare non-smokers . Using approved protocol , bronchoscopy use sample airway epithelium , site early change associate smoking . The transcriptome recover epithelium assessed genomic core WCMC-Qatar gene expression use microarrays complete RNA sequence use massive parallel sequencing.Based information , epithelial DNA assess relevant SNPs , copy number variation methylation status . Parallel study carry cigarette smoker , provide comprehensive catalog shisha smoking-induced change compare cigarette smoker non-smokers population .</detailed_description>
