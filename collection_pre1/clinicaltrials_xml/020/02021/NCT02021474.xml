	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Migraine headache affect 28 million person United States ( Foundation ) . Approximately 25 % woman 9 % men experience migraine headache ( Rasmussen BK , 1991 ) ( Lipton RB , 1993 ) ( Ramadan NM , 2002 ) . Individuals migraine headache lose average 4 6 working day year result total annual loss nationwide 64 150 million workday . It estimate direct indirect cost migraine nearly $ 17 billion ( Hu XH , 1999 ) ( RK. , 1999 ) . Headache responsible approximately 2 % visit emergency department ( Goldstein JN , 2006 ) . Migraine headaches typically describe recur , unilateral headache untreated attack last 4 72 hour . The international headache Society Classification Headaches list follow diagnostic requirement migraine headache : least two follow feature : lateral location , throb character , worsen pain routine activity , moderate severe intensity least one follow feature : nausea and/or vomit photophobia phonophobia ( Society , 1988 ) . TREATMENT There cure migraine headache . The treatment migraine headache typically divide non-pharmacologic pharmacologic treatment . The non-pharmacologic treatment design target action behavior know trigger migraine headache . The non-pharmacologic treatment include : regular sleep pattern , regular exercise , avoidance know trigger . Triggers migraine headache include : red wine , age cheese , exposure chemical odor i.e . perfume cleaner . Non- pharmacologic therapy also include relaxation training , biofeedback , cognitive - behavioral therapy , hypnosis , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation , cervical manipulation , hyperbaric oxygen . The pharmacologic treatment migraine headache typically divide abortive therapy prophylactic therapy . The abortive therapy usually divide nonspecific medication use treat migraine : analgesics/NSAIDS ( acetaminophen , aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen sodium , ketorolac ) , narcotic analgesic ( meperidine butorphanol ) , adjunctive therapy ( metoclopramide , prochlorperazine ) . Migraine specific abortive therapy include ergotamine derivative ( ergotamine , caffeine plus ergotamine , dihydroergotamine ) Triptans ( Sumatriptan , Naratriptan , Rizatriptan , Zolmitriptan ) ( Aukerman , 2002 ) . Unlike abortive therapy , take treat exist headache , prophylactic therapy take ( usually daily ) reduce frequency intensity migraine headache . Prophylatic , preventive medication generally divide first-line agent second-line agent . First-line therapy migraine prophylaxis adult include propranolol ( Inderal ) , timolol ( Blocadren ) , amitriptyline , divalproex ( Depakote ) , sodium valproate , topiramate ( Topamax ) ( Modi &amp; Lowder , 2006 ) . Agents could use second-line therapy migraine prophylaxis adult ( list evidence effectiveness ) include gabapentin ( Neurontin ) , naproxen ( Naprosyn ) naproxen sodium ( Anaprox ) , timed-release dihydroergotamine mesylate ( DHE-45 ) , candesartan ( Atacand ) , lisinopril ( Zestril ) , atenolol ( Tenormin ) , metoprolol ( Toprol XL ) , nadolol ( Corgard ) , fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , verapamil ( Calan ) , magnesium , vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) , coenzyme Q10 , hormone therapy ( estradiol topical gel [ Estrogel ] ) , botulinum toxin type A ( Botox ) injection ( Modi &amp; Lowder , 2006 ) . PATHOGENESIS OF MIGRAINE Despite extensive research area migraine headache , precise pathogenesis migraine remain unknown . The list potential candidate pathogenesis migraine extensive . For many year except pathogenesis migraine headache due extracerebral vasodilation . This theory propose auras associate migraine headache due initial vasoconstriction follow vasodilatation extracerebral vessel result pain migraine headache . Others ( Blau , 1984 ) propose migraine primary neurological disturbance secondary vasomotor change . Migraine likely multi-genic condition complex pathophysiology central peripheral component trigeminal pain pathway play role sign symptom . In past two decade trigeminal vascular system ( TVS ) propose possible component migraine attack . Nitric oxide also propose potential mechanism migraine , support production typical migraine headache migraneurs treat nitroglycerin ( NTG ) . 5-hydroooxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) implicate migraine pathophysiology . The role 5-HT metabolism migraine support low central 5-HT disposition associate increase 5-HT release attack ( Panconesi , 2008 ) . Weir Cader ( 2011 ) propose channelopaties may play role migraine headache , especially genetic association . Cortical spread depression implicate cause migraine aura ( Weir 2011 ) . The Neurogenic inflammation ( NI ) theory proposes , vasodilation plasma protein extravasation tissue receive trigeminal innervation occur vasoactive peptide release nerve ending ( Buzzi , 2005 ) . Burstein , et al. , 2011 propose peripheral sensitization major contributor hypersensitivity many painful syndrome include migraine headache . In state primary afferent nociceptive neuron exhibit increased responsiveness external stimulus original site inflammation injury . A large number chemical mediator produce site inflammation tissue injury promote excitation sensitization nociceptors . These chemical mediator include bradykinin , histamine , serotonin ( 5-HT ) , prostaglandins . Cytokines ( interleukins 1 , 6 8 [ IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 ] tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF-alpha ] ) inflammatory mediator know promote peripheral sensitization ( Burstein , et al. , 2011 ) . Central sensitization occur two distinct phase , initiation phase maintenance phase may play role migraine headache . This sensitization mediate excitatory amino acid glutamate neuropeptides substance P neurotrophic factor . The enhanced neuronal excitability central sensitization involve phosphorylation intracellular extracellular kinase enhance production cyclooxygenase . The list chemical mediator involve pathogenesis migraine extensive . The scientific investigation require elucidate exact mechanism responsible migraine headache continue important part ongoing clinical trial . GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND MIGRAINE The relationship migraine headache hunger accept well document phenomenon . Missing meal precipitate trigger migraine susceptible individual . Shaw et al. , 1977 show migraine patient impaired tolerance glucose migraine attack compare control study . There elevation plasma free fatty acid ( FFA ) level migraine attack . Growth hormone cortisol elevate insulin depressed attack . Patients migraine impaired insulin sensitivity ( Rainero , et al. , 2005 ) . During oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , glucose plasma concentration significantly high migraineurs control . Insulin sensitivity ( measure ISI-stumvoll OGIS-180 index ) significantly alter migraine . Cavestro et al . ( 2007 ) report headache patient elevate blood glucose level compare control . They also document insulin level elevate migraineurs compare control patient headache patient . Additional study need explore role impair glucose metabolism migraine include role glucose metabolism may play development new therapy migraine . ROLE OF HISTAMINE IN MIGRAINE In 2003 , Gazerani , et al . demonstrate correlation migraine , histamine , immunoglobulin E. Serum sample collect ( histamine level Immunoglobulin E level ) 70 patient ( 18 - 58 year ) migraine attack remission 45 healthy volunteer . The migraine patient divide two group accord history allergy ( 60 % history allergies 40 % without history allergy ) . Plasma histamine level significantly elevate ( P ≤ 0.0001 ) patient migraine symptom-free period ( Error ! Reference source find . ) migraine event ( Error ! Reference source find . ) compare control group . - RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF STUDY DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF STUDY DISEASE In 1991 , Guerrero , et al . carry initial study provide evidence beneficial effect histamine migraine prophylaxis ( Millan-Guerrero RO , 1999 ) . Their data show subcutaneous administration low dos ( 1-10 ng ) histamine induce significant relief migraine symptom , secondary effect . The possible mechanism histamine migraine prophylaxis , explain histamine control mast cell ; antidromic stimulation trigeminal nerve ending induces release substance P neuromodulatory peptide , turn stimulate release histamine mast cell . In meningeal blood vessel , activation H1-receptors histamine , result vasodilatation plasma protein extravasation , cause neurogenic inflammation ( Akerman S , 2002 ) . Krabbe Olesen ( Krabbe AA , 1980 ) Lassen et al . ( Lassen LH , 1995 ) show migrainous subject , intravenous administration relatively high dos histamine ( 0.5 mg/kg per minute 20 min ) cause immediate headache infusion , follow delayed migraine attack abolish pre-treatment H1-R antagonist , mepyramine . However , degranulation mast cell neuropeptide release C fiber ending inhibit histamine low-concentration interaction H3-receptors ( H3-R ) , probably reflect local feedback circuit C-fiber nerve ending mast cell , control neurogenic inflammation ( Dimitriadou V , 1994 ) ( Arrang J-M , 1983 ) ( Arrang J-M G. M.-C. , 1987 ) ( Placeholder21 ) . Guerrero , et al . propose administration low dos histamine , achieve maintain low-circulating concentration , may lead selective interaction histamine H3-R. Histamine could constitute new therapeutic drug migraine prophylaxis act limit excessive inflammatory response involve migraine pathophysiology .</detailed_description>
