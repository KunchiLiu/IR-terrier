	<brief_title>Effects Methylphenidate ( Ritalin® ) Neural Basis Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) affect 5-10 % general U.S. population point lifetime ; however , prevalence much high among certain subgroup , include active duty military personnel veteran . Pharmacotherapy PTSD make little headway past two decade . Methylphenidate ( Ritalin® ) stimulant drug amplifies dopaminergic noradrenergic signal brain . Dopamine norepinephrine think play critical role fear extinction moderate medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) activity . The magnitude mPFC activity seem crucially affect degree fear extinction . The model fear extinction one approach conceptualize PTSD . Thereby previously neutral stimulus pair highly aversive unconditioned stimulus . Fear extinction refers decrement condition fear response occur repeat presentation condition neutral fear stimulus without aversive stimulus . While preclinical data suggest single dose methylphenidate enhances fear extinction , less clear methylphenidate affect fear extinction human . However , expose PTSD patient new therapy difficult . In present study , investigator investigate effect methylphenidate ( 40 mg ) mPFC activity healthy male volunteer fear extinction use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Additionally , investigator examine effect methylphenidate aversive interoceptve arousal . The present study help identify brain structure network involve anxiety give insight methylphenidate possible adjunct behavioral therapy patient anxiety disorder . Further , study may provide important information possible use fMRI help development drug treatment anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
