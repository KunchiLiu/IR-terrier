	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Dengue Virus Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 4 type dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) ; cause dengue illness range mild illness life-threatening disease . More 2 billion person tropical subtropical region world risk acquire dengue , development dengue vaccine top public health priority . The purpose study evaluate ability single dose TetraVax-DV-TV003 ( TV003 ) vaccine protect infection rDEN2∆30 , attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine . This study enroll healthy adult history previous infection flavivirus ( group viruses include dengue virus ) . Participants randomly assign receive either TV003 vaccine placebo vaccine Day 0 ( study entry ) . At Day 180 , participant receive injection `` challenge '' virus , rDEN2∆30 , attenuate ( weaken ) DENV-2 vaccine . For least 30 minute vaccination , participant remain study clinic monitor adverse effect vaccine . Participants record temperature least 3 time day 16 day first second vaccination . In addition vaccination visit Day 0 Day 180 , participant attend study visit Day 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 150 , 182 , 184 , 186 , 188 , 190 , 192 , 194 , 196 , 201 , 208 , 236 , 270 , 360 . At study visit , participant give medical history undergo blood collection ; study visit , participant undergo physical examination . Female participant pregnancy test select study visit .</detailed_description>
