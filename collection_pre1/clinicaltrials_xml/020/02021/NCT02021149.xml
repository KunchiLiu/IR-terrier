	<brief_summary>According 2005 National Comorbidity Survey-Replication study , approximately 20.9 million American adult , 9.5 percent population age 18 suffer mood disorder include major depressive disorder , chronic , mild depression bipolar disorder . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) predict second leading cause disability worldwide year 2020 ; sub-clinical mood disturbance impact many additional people major reason people seek psychotherapy service . The economic burden depression United States significant : $ 83.1 billion 2000 increase . Much burden come high rate sub-optimal treatment outcome associate disorder . Indeed , 50 % MDD patient recover less 12 week adequate treatment , 20 % patient fail adequately respond currently available intervention . Moreover , current treatment come cost significant central nervous system ( CNS ) side effect , highlight need effective treatment few side effect . To address press clinical issue , investigator conduct placebo control , clinical trial determine Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) enhance effect psychotherapy compare psychotherapy alone medically healthy patient moderate severe mood disorder . The investigator plan recruit sample 24 medically healthy individual mood problem randomize examine whether WBH enhance effect psychotherapy . To determine acute sustained effect WBH +psychotherapy mood disorder , study include basic psychiatric questionnaire-based assessment three therapy session prior single session conduct receive one two intensity WBH treatment . Subjects elect conduct therapy session WBH chamber still able complete study questionnaire therapy session . This study challenge exist paradigm determine peripheral afferent sensory pathway access enhance treatment mood disorder thus avoid problem expose brain non-selective drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our research group observe open trial single session whole body hyperthermia ( WBH ) induce rapid antidepressant effect persist least week patient major depression ( MDD ) severe enough warrant inpatient hospitalization . In addition reduce depression , single session WBH induce prolonged reduction mean core body temperature , consistent basic science data group suggest hyperthermia activate skin-to-brain pathway target specific serotonergic nuclei raphe . In animal model , nuclei show important mood body temperature regulation . Consistent know anatomy preliminary study depress patient , reduction core body temperature highly correlated reduction depressive symptoms time period ( one week post WBH ) . Moreover , patient higher mean core body temperature prior treatment enhance antidepressant effect . Because increase body temperature outcome poor function skin-to-brain pathway activate WBH data suggest WBH may actually sensitize pathway way promote change brain functioning known promote emotional well-being . The result first open trial encourage u conduct large , rigorous placebo-controlled , double blind study WBH MDD , currently underway University Arizona Medical School . In addition impact depressive symptom body temperature , The investigator observe WBH induces strike increase prosocial self-disclosing behavior many individual . This effect initiate heat phase treatment culminate maximum body temperature . Importantly , observation thus far suggest prosociality occur person hyperthermia box accompany someone he/she know least degree . For example , recent subject silent initial WBH treatment attend one staff never meet . He elect get repeat WBH session . The `` attendant '' present second WBH session , session patient become strikingly talkative without prompt self-disclosed range intimate personal issue relate depression , previously undisclosed history childhood sexual abuse . The goal current proposal conduct pilot study evaluate whether observed prosocial effect WBH might employ accelerate deepen formation therapeutic alliance patient undergoing 8-12 session course cognitive behavioral psychotherapy ( CBT ) . Our study design also rigorously test clinical observation prosocial effect WBH . In addition potentially enhance psychotherapeutic outcome , current study may provide data relevant large issue relate near universal use hyperthermia indigenous culture around world spiritual health purpose .</detailed_description>
