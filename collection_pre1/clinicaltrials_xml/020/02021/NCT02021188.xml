	<brief_summary>This VISION study aim investigate role inflammation atherosclerosis use 68Ga- DOTATATE PET , validate 68Ga-DOTATATE PET image detection quantification vascular inflammation aorta , coronary carotid artery . This study test hypothesis subject undergo carotid endarterectomy symptomatic plaque , positive correlation carotid artery 68Ga-DOTATATE PET signal underlie degree carotid inflammation measure immunohistochemical analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical event atherosclerosis largely driven inflammation . Molecular image atherosclerosis potentially identify high-risk lesion , help guide treatment illuminate underlying biology disease . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) PET gold-standard nuclear molecular imaging technique well-established role atherosclerosis image . However , arterial 18F-FDG signal non-specific , although relate increased macrophage activity contribution hypoxia angiogenesis . Coronary artery image 18F-FDG particularly difficult , mainly due high background myocardial cell 18F-FDG uptake , obscure interpretation coronary signal . Efforts suppress myocardial 18F-FDG uptake dietary manipulation challenge patient limited efficacy . PET tracer currently use cancer imaging , 68Ga-DOTATATE , potentially specific inflammation also lack myocardial muscle uptake . 68Ga-DOTATATE might therefore well suit 18F-FDG imaging inflammation , particularly within coronary artery . The VISION study prospective , observational study design investigate biology plaque inflammation atherosclerosis , use PET image somatostatin receptor ligand 68Ga-DOTATATE . 50 subject atherosclerosis undergo sequential PET/CT image 68Ga-DOTATATE 18F-FDG , along contrast angiography carotid coronary artery . Autoradiography immunohistochemistry excise carotid plaque use validate image data . If successful , 68Ga-DOTATATE imaging offer cheap , specific non-invasive measure inflammation 18F- FDG , particularly coronary artery . This open possibility well risk stratification patient atherosclerosis could provide non-invasive platform test effect novel anti-atherosclerosis drug .</detailed_description>
