	<brief_title>DNA Methylation Gene Expression Qataris With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The global prevalence Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) rapidly rise throughout region develop develop world . In Middle East country , particularly Gulf Council country , diabetes pandemic along rate obesity rise due adoption modern lifestyle . In Qatari population alone , T2D highly prevalent 18 % Qatari adult estimate suffer disease . Consanguineous marriage , sedentary lifestyle , obesity bad dietary habit cite main cause high incidence rate . Chronic hyperglycemia cause long-term uncontrolled diabetes state lead devastate complication cardiovascular disease , neuropathy , retinopathy . Such complication also highly prevalent Qatari population , perhaps due relatively low adherence clinical guideline vary among Qatari individual base genetic predisposition share family environment.It already know inflammation part complex biochemical process initiate develop cardiovascular complication diabetes . Experimental model show exposure hyperglycemia induces epigenomic change inflammatory pathway , subsequently regulate gene expression lead development vascular inflammation . The investigator therefore hypothesize chronic hyperglycemia lead alter DNA methylation dysregulation gene expression peripheral blood monocyte lymphocytes patient type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
