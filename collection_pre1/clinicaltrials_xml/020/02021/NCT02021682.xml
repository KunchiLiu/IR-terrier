	<detailed_description>The overall goal determine change occur amyloid-beta ( Aβ ) metabolism Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) model production , transport , metabolism clearance Aβ human central nervous system ( CNS ) periphery improve clinical trial design also possibly develop AD blood test . Clearance brain Aβ occur enzymatic digestion ( e.g . Insulin Degrading Enzyme , Neprilysin , etc . ) , cellular uptake breakdown , transport across blood-brain-barrier , transport brain cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) blood . However , relationship CNS Aβ blood Aβ know human partly understood animal . The goal determine kinetics Aβ CNS blood test hypothesis alter Aβ kinetics CNS AD associate altered blood Aβ labeling kinetics . Understanding blood CSF Aβ kinetics contribute good understanding Aβ production , transport , breakdown within brain , CSF blood compartment . These fundamental measurement Aβ kinetics AD help determine effect peripheral Aβ metabolism pathophysiologic change AD . This information provide key insight whole body Aβ metabolism useful understanding cause AD . Further , result may lead specific blood biomarker AD . Aim 1 . To determine blood Aβ isoform SILK ( stable isotope-linked kinetics ) use exist steady state infusion label blood sample amyloid positive amyloid negative control participant . Blood Aβ kinetics compare CSF Aβ kinetics combine utilizing multi-compartment structural model determine direction magnitude transport breakdown . Current label method employ prim continuous infusion label Aβ near steady-state . In order provide additional kinetic information Aβ kinetics potentially well distinguish AD control , alternative pulse label protocol propose . In addition provide clear information Aβ transport clearance , simplify label method make blood Aβ kinetics feasible clinical test treatment trial diagnostic test . Aim 2 . To perform pulse bolus label amyloid positive amyloid negative control measure CSF Aβ isoform kinetics blood Aβ isoform kinetics . Participants recruit complete pulse labeling study . Results Aim 2 incorporate complimentary model result Aim 1 ongoing study provide measure Aβ production , transport , breakdown within brain , CSF blood compartment . Approach : Based preliminary data publish study , hypothesis test blood Aβ isoform kinetics disrupt AD model Aβ production , transport clearance brain periphery . The data study useful model production , transport breakdown Aβ throughout human body . Results aim utilized complimentary modeling approach combine result prior study provide comprehensive model vivo Aβ kinetics human CNS periphery . The data model able confirm exclude current hypothesis human Aβ metabolism . The goal aim determine CNS Aβ isoform kinetics pulse label protocol ( Aim 1 ) , determine peripheral blood Aβ isoform kinetics pulse label protocol ( Aim 2 ) . Experimental Design : A pulse label protocol twenty participant complete simplify labeling . Pulse label experiment provide additional kinetics result determine Aβ kinetic model . Of next sixty participant re-enrolled complete prior intravenous steady-state labeling Aβ SILK study . All participant PET/PIB scan complete fibrillar amyloid deposition measurement CSF Aβ42 concentration measurement . Clinical Study : A single pulse dose leucine give begin study blood and/or CSF collect 24-36 hour . Data Analysis : We compare pulse label blood Aβ SILK result amyloid positive vs. amyloid negative control group Aβ38 , Aβ40 , Aβ42 , ratio isoforms vs. test amyloidosis PET/PIB scan and/or CSF Aβ42 concentration .</detailed_description>
