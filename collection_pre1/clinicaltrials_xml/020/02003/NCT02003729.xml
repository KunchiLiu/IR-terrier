	<brief_title>SIESTA : Home Sleep Study With ApneaDx™ Diagnosis Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Ontario , approximately 130,000 sleep study conduct 2008 , twice number sleep study report 1999 . In 2008 , Ontario spend approximately $ 40 million polysomnography ( PSG ) test alone , despite fact access PSG remain limited , average waiting time approximately 3.5 month in-laboratory sleep study approximately 12 month referral appropriate treatment . Portable monitor ( PM ) develop effort substitute costly labor intensive clinic-based PSG . As 2011 , 40 PM commercially available United States different configuration cardiorespiratory neurophysiologic signal . At request Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee ( OHTAC ) , panel make recommendation Ontario Ministry Health Long-Term Care uptake diffusion health technology , Toronto Rehabilitation Institute convene expert panel 2007 explore alternative approach diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Members expert panel suggest despite availability large number PMs , home assessment problematic technician require ensure continuous placement electrode reliable test . They also suggest good screening tool available time . The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute therefore undertake research study eventually lead development ApneaDx™ PM . ApneaDx™ new PM use microphone record breath sound acoustical analysis algorithm breath sound determine ( Apnea Hypopnea Index ) AHI . Results preliminary study suggest AHI derive ApneaDx™ approximates PSG . In preliminary study , appear diagnosis sleep apnea , home sleep study ApneaDx™ simple reliable even conduct untrained user . This study evaluate effectiveness cost-effectiveness OSA diagnose assist home sleep study ApneaDx™ . This study conduct Toronto Health Economics Technology Assessment ( THETA ) Collaborative . Data study use support practice recommendation regard use home sleep study ApneaDx™ input diagnosis OSA OHTAC reimbursement consideration Ontario Ministry Health Long-Term Care .</detailed_description>
