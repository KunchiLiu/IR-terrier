	<brief_summary>The primary aim confirm efficacy new non-invasive method measure oxygen uptake general anesthesia patient undergo surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . The method already successfully test laboratory control condition . In patient group chosen , oxygen uptake simultaneously calculate , comparison purpose , monitoring measurement make routinely part normal patient care case , use pulmonary artery catheter - invasive technique severe complication occasionally arise , include death . A secondary aim elucidate time course uptake anaesthetic vapor , isoflurane , kind surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Improved Method Measurement Oxygen Anaesthetic Agent Uptake Patients Using Foldes-Biro Equation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In series 30 patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass , change nitrogen concentration fresh gas enter anesthetic breathing system exhaust gas leave otherwise closed system use determine total gas uptake principle insoluble gas dilution . Oxygen anaesthetic agent uptake automatically determine computer directly link rapid gas analyzer , every 15 second . As control , oxygen calculate use reverse Fick method . Measured arterial mixed venous oxygen saturation use , cardiac output determine thermodilution .</detailed_description>
