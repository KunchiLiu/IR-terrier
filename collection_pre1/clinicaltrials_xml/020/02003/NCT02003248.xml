	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate safety initial effectiveness ExAblate Transcranial MRI-guided focus ultrasound ( MRgFUS ) treatment patient dyskinesia Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) - Safety : To evaluate incidence severity adverse event ( AE/AEs ) associate ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment dyskinesia PD - Effectiveness : To determine level effectiveness ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment dyskinesia PD.Efficacy determine utilizing UPDRS-IV dyskinesia PD examination baseline every 3-Months post-ExAblate treatment . This study design prospective , single-site , single arm , nonrandomized study . Assessments make three month MRgFUS clinical symptom relief , quality life ( QoL ) improvement , safety MRgFUS treatment LID . Relative Safety evaluate use common description Significant Clinical Complications patient treat study . This study perform 3T MR scanner .</brief_summary>
