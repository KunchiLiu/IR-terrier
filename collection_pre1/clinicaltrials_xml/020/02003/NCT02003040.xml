	<brief_title>Role Mespere Venus 1000 Predicting Heart Failure Hospital Readmissions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rehospitalizations heart failure link poor clinical outcome , rate remain high despite different attempt decrease . Clinical indicator volume congestion time discharge associate increased rate readmission . Clinical evaluation volume status remain gold standard determination readiness time hospital discharge , however identification persistent congestion might prove difficult . Assessment right atrial pressure do non-invasively bedside ; however , precision accuracy method variable . Echocardiography valuable tool estimation elevate central pressure , , however time consume require trained personnel . While invasive measurement provide accurate estimation central venous pressure , impractical approach patient , notwithstanding risk associate insertion catheter central circulation . Since significant proportion readmitted patient return hospital congestive symptom , attempt make improve ability ass volume status . Current clinical evidence suggest BNP-guided management patient congestive heart failure decrease all-cause mortality heart failure rehospitalization . However , biological variation natriuretic peptide high , optimal target difficult determine individual patient . The Mespere Venus 1000 system non-invasive tool previously show reliable correlation accuracy central venous pressure obtain invasively catheterization laboratory good correlation jugular venous pressure bedside .</detailed_description>
