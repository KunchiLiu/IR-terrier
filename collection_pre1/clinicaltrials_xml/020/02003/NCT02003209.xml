	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , pertuzumab estrogen deprivation see work compare docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , pertuzumab without estrogen deprivation treat patient hormone receptor-positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast cancer operable spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , pertuzumab , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use goserelin acetate aromatase inhibition therapy may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy without hormone therapy may effective treatment hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive , operable locally advanced breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy consist therapy docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , pertuzumab ( TCHP ) yield great rate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) ( breast node ) TCHP alone administer woman operable , hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy consist TCHP increase pCR rate breast compare TCHP alone administer woman operable , hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive breast cancer . II . To determine whether addition estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy consist TCHP improve recurrence-free interval ( RFI ) woman operable , hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive breast cancer . III . To determine whether addition estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy consist TCHP improve overall survival ( OS ) woman operable , hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive breast cancer . IV . To compare rate second primary invasive cancer treatment arm . V. Assessment pattern pCR , RFI , OS menopausal status . VI . To evaluate cardiac toxicity associate regimen . VII . To compare effect add estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy endocrine-related symptom patient treatment arm . VIII . To compare effect add estrogen deprivation neoadjuvant therapy vasomotor symptom , musculoskeletal , vaginal complaint well quality life . IX . To determine relationship pCR potential mechanism resistance/sensitivity hormone receptor-positive , HER2-positive tumor . X . To evaluate tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) immune biomarkers predictor pCR . XI . To study early change TILs immune biomarkers response TCHP . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . NEOADJUVANT : ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute , carboplatin IV 30-60 minute , trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute , pertuzumab IV 30-60 day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients enrol Amendment # 4 undergo 2 core biopsy prior course 3 treatment . ARM II : All patient receive docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , pertuzumab arm I. Premenopausal patient also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) every 28 day surgery aromatase inhibition therapy investigator 's discretion daily 1 day surgery . Postmenopausal patient receive aromatase inhibition therapy investigator 's discretion daily 1 day surgery . Patients enrol Amendment # 4 undergo 2 core biopsy prior course 3 treatment . SURGERY : Patients undergo lumpectomy mastectomy . RADIATION : Patients undergo whole breast irradiation within 8 week follow surgery . ADJUVANT : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-60 minute every 21 day 1 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
