	<brief_summary>Breast neoplasm second common type world . Radiation therapy key component treatment breast cancer . Acute skin reaction one common side effect radiation therapy . Several study perform prophylaxis adverse event , however , moment consensus clinical practice . Second meta-analysis , ideal candidate radiodermatitis prevention would agent capable repair damage DNA agent promote cell proliferation . The low power laser promote tissue repair ( reduces inflammatory phase induces collagen synthesis ) . Its use treatment adverse event cancer treatment well establish two situation : prophylaxis treatment mucositis treatment lymphedema . The purpose study use low power laser patient breast cancer undergo radiotherapy treatment evaluate effect Laser InGaAIP 660Nm prevent radiodermatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser InGaAlP ( 660Nm ) Prevent Radiodermatitis Breast Cancer Patients Submitted Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective double- blind trial . Patients breast cancer stag I-III undergoing radiotherapy include . The participant allocate intervention group ( laser therapy 26 patient ) control group ( 26 patient laser disable without affect apparent function ) , five day week radiotherapy . The low level laser therapy use trial Photon Lase III ( DMC , approve ANVISA medicinal purpose ) . This InGaAIP laser emits pulse 660 nanometer beam average output 80 milliwatts average energy density deliver breast 3 J/cm2 . Skin reaction grade weekly nurse , radiotherapist oncologist use common toxicity criterion ( CTC -developed National Cancer Institute ) Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ( develop Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ) . The patient answer modify visual analogue scale pain ( patient self-evaluation ) .</detailed_description>
