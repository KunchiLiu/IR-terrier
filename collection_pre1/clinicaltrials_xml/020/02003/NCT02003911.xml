	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic lung condition child , often require hospitalization acute exacerbation . Azithromycin use successfully chronic lung disease , include cystic fibrosis . Despite limited clinical evidence , pediatrician use azithromycin child hospitalize asthma , cite either treatment atypical pathogen propose anti-inflammatory property . We propose clinical trial determine azithromycin shorten length stay child hospitalize acute asthma exacerabations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic lung condition account 130,000 pediatric hospitalization nationally cost almost 1.4 billion dollar . The Children 's Hospital Montefiore locate area one high asthma rate United States : Bronx , New York . Atypical pathogen implicate initiate asthma trigger acute asthma exacerbation . Azithromycin , macrolide antibiotic , know antibacterial activity atypical pathogen gram positive bacteria . More recently , macrolides increasingly use effective gram negative bacteria inflammation lung patient chronic respiratory illness . This effect may secondary immunomodulary effect macrolides posse , addition anti-bacterial effect . In long-term therapy macrolides , patient asthma show improved bronchiolar hyperreactivity , spirometry , symptom , quality life . However , study short-term treatment acute set child limit . Some practitioner use azithromycin treatment acute asthma , despite limited data . The investigator propose double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial azithromycin child age 4-12 year persistent asthma hospitalize acute asthma exacerbation . Children enrol within 12 hour admission randomize receive three day either azithromycin placebo suspension ( 10mg/kg/dose , max 500mg ) . The primary outcome measure length stay ( LOS ) . Secondary outcome measure include : day school/work miss , readmission rate , return medical care rate , recurrence symptom , steroid course . In future , patient may also approach enroll `` Mechanism Subset Study '' separate pilot feasibility study require two blood sample two nasal aspirate sample test atypical pathogen , intraleukin-8 level , neutrophil/eosinophil count . The average length stay patient age range asthma 2011 institution 3.0 day . The investigator enroll achieve power 80 % , alpha 0.05 , require 107 patient group detect 16 hour ( 0.67 day ) difference primary outcome , LOS . We hypothesize azithromycin treatment child hospitalize acute asthma decrease LOS .</detailed_description>
