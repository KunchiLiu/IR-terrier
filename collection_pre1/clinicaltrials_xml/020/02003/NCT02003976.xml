	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing High Tibial Osteotomy Plus Non-Surgical Treatment Non-Surgical Treatment Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two group , parallel design randomize controlled trial compare patient medial compartment knee OA varus alignment receive optimized non-surgical treatment plus High Tibial Osteotomy ( HTO ) similar patient receive optimized non-surgical treatment . All participant receive non-surgical treatment individualized patient include medication , physiotherapy nutritional seminar . The non-surgical treatment include supervise physiotherapy nutritional seminar per week 12 week , accompany follow home program , follow-up appointment potential modification every three month duration study . Participants randomize surgery also undergo medial opening wedge HTO 12 week optimize non-surgical treatment . Both group follow schedule clinic visit throughout 24 month follow-up period . MRI-derived measure articular cartilage morphology , biological marker articular cartilage degradation synthesis , gait biomechanics patient-reported outcome assessed baseline , 12 24 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
