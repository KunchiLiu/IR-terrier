	<brief_summary>Some patient ' heart rate increase need activity exercise , make feel tired fatigue easily . The patient study pacemaker FDA approve rate response sensor , sense activity level sense motion ( component know accelerometer ) and/or breathe change ( know minute ventilation ) . These change motion breathe make pacemaker increase patient 's heart rate . This study conduct see rate response sensor well ( motion driven breathe drive ) . The study also investigate whether optimize sensor base individual patient give good result term increase patient 's exercise capacity . The hypothesis rate responsive pacing drive minute ventilation sensor result improve functional capacity compare accelerometer chronotropically incompetent patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study double-blind , randomize , two-arm ( crossover arm ) trial investigate benefit rate responsive pacing either MV XL pacemaker patient chronotropic incompetence ( CI ) . Blinding occur patient research personnel collect primary endpoint data . The study enroll patient implant dual/single chamber pacemaker , minute ventilation ( MV ) accelerometer ( XL ) rate-adaptive sensor . The initial study visit call baseline visit newly implant patient ( 2 week implant ) previously implant patient ( time enrol study ) . Patients complete 6-min walk test baseline study visit screen CI base intrinsic heart rate achieve walk pacemaker set DDD/VVI sensor set passive . All patient enrol study get treadmill exercise stress test chronotropic assessment exercise protocol ( CAEP ) confirm CI . Patients determine CI complete maximal effort exercise treadmill stress test peak perceive exertion Borg scale &gt; 16 ( 18 ) pacemaker program DDD/VVI device sensor set passive . Patients meet criterion CI CAEP treadmill test continue trial . Patients CI randomize 1:1 ratio program rate-adaptive sensor either MV XL . The MV XL rate-adaptive sensor optimize patient use stress test derive age predict maximum heart rate adjust response factor achieve MCR slope 1 . At 4-week visit , patient CI complete second CAEP treadmill test randomize set pacer set DDDR/VVIR . They also complete 6-minute walk test pacemaker interrogation . They cross sensor group time change sensor set . At 8 week visit , patient another CAEP treadmill test , 6-minute walk test pacemaker interrogation randomize crossed group set . Patients CI get quality life assessment use SF-36 questionnaire Aquarel questionnaire baseline visit , 4 8 week visit randomize setting .</detailed_description>
