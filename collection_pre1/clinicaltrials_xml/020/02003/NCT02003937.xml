	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy type III , ( SMAIII ) recessively inherited disease lower motor neuron anterior horn spinal cord lead progressive muscle weakness atrophy . Currently effective treatment available SMA . We previously show patient muscular dystrophy improve oxidative capacity ( VO2max ) , muscle strength daily function aerobic conditioning . Patients SMAIII share many clinical feature condition , although mechanism muscle weakness different . In study , investigate patient SMAIII respond aerobic training . 6 patient 9 healthy age- sex-matched control complete 12 week train program . Subjects perform total 42 training session 30 min stationary cycle ergometer home . The work intensity moderate set match target heart rate . VO2max measure incremental exercise test use indirect calorimetry training period . Functional test adressing patient walk stair climb ability , perform training period . Changes activity daily live adressed standardized questionnaire training period . Training induced increase without induce muscle damage . There change patient ' functional capacity . However , training-induced fatigue major complaint patient , cause one patient drop , increase need sleep three patient two modify train program . The fatigue limit use therapy . The training-induced fatigue , encounter muscle disease , warrant investigation alternative train method improve quality life patient SMAIII .</detailed_description>
