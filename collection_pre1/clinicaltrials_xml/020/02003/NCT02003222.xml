	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy blinatumomab see well work compare induction chemotherapy alone treat patient newly diagnose breakpoint cluster region ( BCR ) -c-abl oncogene 1 , non-receptor tyrosine kinase ( ABL ) -negative B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , blinatumomab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective without blinatumomab treat newly diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Blinatumomab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed BCR-ABL-Negative B Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) blinatumomab conjunction chemotherapy chemotherapy alone patient BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) minimal residual disease ( MRD ) positive induction intensification chemotherapy , base multiparameter flow cytometric ( MFC ) assessment residual blast . II . If superiority blinatumomab MRD positive group show , compare OS blinatumomab conjunction chemotherapy chemotherapy alone patient BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor ALL MRD negative induction intensification chemotherapy , base MFC assessment residual blast . III . If superiority blinatumomab MRD positive group show , compare OS blinatumomab conjunction chemotherapy chemotherapy alone overall population patient BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor ALL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare relapse-free survival ( RFS ) blinatumomab conjunction chemotherapy chemotherapy alone MRD positive patient , MRD negative patient overall population induction intensification chemotherapy . II . To determine blinatumomab convert patient MRD positive MFC assessment residual blast induction intensification chemotherapy MRD negativity . III . To assess toxicity blinatumomab patient population . IV . To assess toxicity modify E2993 chemotherapy regimen patient population . V. To describe outcome patient proceed allogeneic blood marrow transplant treatment without blinatumomab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine difference MRD kinetics among patient BCR/ABL1-like B-lineage ALL , assess efficacy blinatumomab molecular subgroup . II . To evaluate incidence anti-blinatumomab antibody formation .

Patients may undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) proceed consolidation therapy per investigator discretion . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Beginning second course blinatumomab ( patient randomize blinatumomab group ) intensification therapy ( patient randomize blinatumomab ) , patient receive cytarabine IV 30 minute SC day 1-5 , etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 , methotrexate IT day 1 , pegaspargase IM IV day 5 . Beginning 4 week day 1 course 1 , patient receive cytarabine , etoposide , methotrexate course 1 . Beginning 4 week day 1 course 2 , patient receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV 10-15 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; dexamethasone PO daily day 1-7 ( 15-21 patient age &lt; 55 year ) ; methotrexate IT day 2 ; cyclophosphamide PO IV 30 minute day 29 ; cytarabine IV 30 minute SC day 30-33 37-40 ; mercaptopurine PO day 29-42 . Beginning 8 week day 1 course 3 , patient receive cytarabine , etoposide , methotrexate course 1 . Patients randomize blinatumomab repeat course 4 receive blinatumomab IV continuously day 1-28 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Within 12 week begin last course consolidation therapy , patient receive mercaptopurine PO daily , methotrexate PO IV 6 hour weekly 2.5 year , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 every 3 month , prednisone PO day 1-5 every 3 month , methotrexate IT day 1 every 3 month . Treatment continue 2.5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
