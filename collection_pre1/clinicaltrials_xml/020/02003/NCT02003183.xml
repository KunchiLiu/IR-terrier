	<brief_summary>The project design assess early diagnosis Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CTE ) , neurobehavioral syndrome manifest failed relationship , marriage , business , emotional disturbance , depression , alcohol substance abuse , suicide attempt completion . CTE typically begin latency period several year follow single repeat Traumatic Brain Injuries ( TBIs ) . A history cerebral concussion may may present . This study build upon prior work UCLA use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) identify normal abnormal functional pattern brain study person history TBI include limited : amateur professional athlete , active veteran member arm force , well victim motor vehicle work accident , physical battery/domestic violence . This project aim expand finding population large . Identification syndrome critical identifying potential individual likely benefit potential prevention treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : The propose project focus application small molecule radiolabeled probe tau neurofibrillary tangle ( NFTs ) vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) image brain pathology early detection treatment monitor Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CTE ) relate neurodegenerative disease ( dementias cognitive impairment ) . Investigators plan test follow hypothesis : PET image small molecule probe , form novel fluorescent dye radioactive label , demonstrate distinct cerebral pattern bind subject CTE . These cerebral pattern differentiate age-matched person cognitively intact patient neurodegenerative disease . The binding pattern match disease specific pattern brain pathology characteristic CTE ( dementia , study ) . CTE distinguish dementias clear tauopathy : NFTs neuritic thread . In addition , brain CTE subject show white matter change inflammation . In order ass vivo deposition CTE 's tauopathy , investigator propose use PET image [ F-18 ] FDDNP , molecular image probe PET , high vitro bind affinity NFTs fibrillar tau deposit show fluorescent microscopy non-radioactive FDDNP . The analysis [ F-18 ] FDDNP allow investigator evaluate specificity sensitivity image probe detection brain pathology utilization method detection early deposition monitoring therapeutic intervention aim stop reduce deposition neuropathologic aggregate . Simple blood-based biomarkers correlate biochemical change clinical cognitive status , use conjunction genetic risk status , may increase power predict decline asymptomatic population . An additional aspect protocol obtain blood base biomarker information identify differences marker CTE sufferer . Better characterize relationship various biochemical marker disease status may allow u improve understand CTE cause , enhance ability diagnose early , may lead effective treatment future . Researchers propose investigate several blood-based biomarkers related inflammation , ( Interleukin ( IL ) -1 , I-309 , IL-6 , IL-13 , superoxide dismutase 3 ; SOD3 ) diseased ( clinical diagnosis AD ) healthy APOE e3 APOE e4 carry individual well characterize inflammation level genetic group . In addition hypothesis , neuropathological data autopsy follow-up use determine correlation regional plaque tangle deposition pattern PET signal . Investigators create PET cortical surface map [ F-18 ] FDDNP-PET subject Traumatic Brain Injury control compare region interest analysis transaxial PET image . MRI scan available diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , investigator use DTI measure confirm anticipate finding great white matter integrity control compare AD patient . Background : Emerging evidence indicate repetitive , mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) may long lasting effect follow exposure contact sport military activity . As result recent military conflict , 95 % U.S. veteran return war return war Iraq Afghanistan head injury result non-penetrating mechanism . The syndrome Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CTE ) establish WVU researcher 25 contact-sport athlete , include one military veteran previously diagnose Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . CTE first diagnose 2005 neuropathologist Bennet Omalu , M.D . ( 1-3 ) . In addition , study retire NFL player find high incidence dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , mild cognitive impairment , depression patient . The correlative risk factor presence three significant concussion MTBI 's NFL play career ( 4,5 ) . Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy consist characteristic neurobehavioral syndrome manifest failed relationship , marriage , business , emotional disturbance , depression , alcohol substance abuse , suicide attempt completion . It typically begin latency period several year follow single repeat Traumatic Brain Injuries ( TBIs ) . A history cerebral concussion may may present . The clinical syndrome usually terminate suicide ( 6-8 ) . The neuroanatomical correlate consist tauopathy , abnormal stain indicative tau protein deposition neuronal cell body axonal dendritic connection . These representative change neurofibrillary tangle ( NFTs ) neuritic thread ( NTs ) characteristic CTE , distinguish form dementia . In addition , white matter change inflammation also see brain specimen ( 8 ) . Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy classical distribution differs form dementia , sub-typing base location distribution reflect recent Omalu-Bailes classification ( 8 ) . The area involvement temporal frontal cortex , addition mesencephalon upper pons , locus cereuleus , substantia nigra . This distribution , along history multiple exposure MTBI , age distribution , anatomical pattern distinguishes condition Alzheimer 's disease form dementia . In addition , 70 % athlete diagnose postmortem CTE positive apolipoprotein A3 ( 8 ) . Currently , method diagnose CTE post-mortem brain examination , utilize special immuno-staining technique tau protein deposit NFTs NTs . The ability image tau protein collection vivo form NFTs would provide tremendous benefit clinical management , treatment , possibly prevention pre-morbid diagnosis could confirm . The implication sport community , military organization , general population , potential exposure MTBI , tremendous . UCLA scientist develop currently available vivo method measure NFTs fibrillar tau deposit brain . This discovery lead Dr. Jorge Barrio ( Molecular Medical Pharmacology ) , Dr. Gary Small ( UCLA Center Aging , Aging Memory Research Center Semel Institute UCLA ) , others , work UCLA PET scan program . They seek way directly measure physical evidence Alzheimer 's disease - abnormal amyloid brain protein deposit include amyloid plaque tau NFTs- living patient . A key discovery realization internal environment abnormal protein hydrophobic , , less friendly water fat . Dr. Jorge Barrio synthesize new group compound thrive hydrophobic environment , molecule pass easily blood stream brain tissue . In initial autopsy study , UCLA group find one new compound ( call FDDNP - UCLA Patent Ref . No . 1998-507-1 ) clearly display well-defined amyloid proteins characteristic disease . They inject radioactive form compound vein live Alzheimer 's patient , PET scan accurately measure concentration compound patient 's brain . This allow see first time , increased signal come live human brain area contain dense collection abnormal protein . . The chemical marker essentially seek temporarily attache abnormal amyloid , thus provide clear PET scan signal area brain Alzheimer 's strike . In healthy people without Alzheimer 's , brain region produce little signal . However , people disease , signal strong accurate actually correlate individual 's degree memory impairment . The UCLA group also find people risk Alzheimer 's disease ( mild cognitive impairment ) amyloid-PET pattern intermediate normal people patient Alzheimer 's [ F-18 ] FDDNP bind influence APOE-4 status ( 9,10 ) . Therefore , technology likely assist early detection disease prevention treatment might use prior significant cognitive decline . It also useful detect develop treatment condition . Patients dementias different treatment approach ( e.g. , frontotemporal ) [ F-18 ] FDDNP-PET pattern distinct Alzheimer 's , patient cognitive impairment associate prion disease ( 11 ) . Potential participant screen via telephone staff member determine eligibility . Subjects meet eligibility criterion enrol . Oral consent require perform telephone screen .</detailed_description>
