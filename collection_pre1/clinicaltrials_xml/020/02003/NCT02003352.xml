This study use baseline CAPS assessment investigator establish cut point randomize within establish stratified randomization within group . Subjects undergo treatment outcome CAPS score obtain end treatment primary outcome calculate change score statistically clinically significant . Investigators also utilize secondary outcome measure change score obtain instrument . These instrument measure Computerized Dynamic Posturography video electronystagmography saccadometry obtain initiation treatment treatment terminate measure change score . All instrument use measure change function relate change PTSD symptomatology neurological function</detailed_description>
