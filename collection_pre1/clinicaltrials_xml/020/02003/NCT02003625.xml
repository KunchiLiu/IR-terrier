	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call meloxicam see provide benefit people receive Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( AHSCT ) . The participant currently schedule receive AHSCT , procedure remove blood-forming stem cell ( cell blood cell develop ) body . These stem cell store later give back participant process call apheresis . This standard procedure treat certain blood disease lymphoma multiple myeloma . However use meloxicam procedure consider investigational . Meloxicam non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) give decrease fever , swell pain may come inflammation . It approve FDA treatment arthritis however approve use people receive AHSCT . This study compare combination meloxicam drug call G-CSF ( also call neupogen ) , combination G-CSF agent medicine ( placebo ) . G-CSF substance cause blood stem cell change increase number give people undergo AHSCT . The researcher would like learn give meloxicam combination G-CSF people undergo AHSCT increase number stem cell available blood collect make collection process easy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : Because one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one study group : - G-CSF meloxicam - G-CSF placebo ( pill medicine ) Randomization mean participant put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither participant research doctor choose group participant . The participant equal chance place group . - Study Drug ( meloxicam placebo ) : If participant take part research study , participant give study drug-dosing diary . The study drug come pill participant take mouth daily 5 day , start 6 day ( Day -6 ) participant schedule undergo first apheresis procedure ( Day 0 ) continue 2 day apheresis ( Day -2 ) . The participant take meloxicam placebo total 5 day . The diary also include special instruction take study drug ( ) . -G-CSF : All participant receive G-CSF injection skin ( subcutaneous ) clinic , daily start 4 day ( Day -4 ) first apheresis procedure ( Day 0 ) . The participant continue receive G-CSF 3 day apheresis . - Apheresis : The participant may receive 4 apheresis procedure , depend body reacts stem cell mobilization . The participant receive either meloxicam placebo combination G-CSF Days -6 -2 describe . Clinical Exams : While participant receiving procedure , participant regular physical exam ask specific question problem might . The participant also blood test every day look bone marrow recovering , give possible transfusional support , see liver kidneys function . Planned Follow-up : The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition rest life . The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition 6 month study see .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Patients hematologic malignancy autologous stem cell transplantation deem clinically appropriate . Patients participate study patient go first attempt stem cell mobilization . NonHodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's lymphoma : refractory/relapsed chemosensitive disease . Patients CR PR eligible protocol . The designation PR require follow : At least 50 % decrease sum product diameter ( SPD ) six large dominant node nodal mass . These node mass select accord following : clearly measurable least 2 perpendicular dimension ; possible disparate region body ; include mediastinal retroperitoneal area disease whenever site involve . No increase observe size node , liver , spleen . Splenic hepatic nodule must regress â‰¥ 50 % SPD , single nodule , great transverse diameter . With exception splenic hepatic nodule , involvement organ usually assessable measurable disease present . Bone marrow assessment irrelevant determination PR sample positive treatment . However , positive , cell type specify ( eg , largecell lymphoma small neoplastic B cell ) . Patients achieve CR criterion , persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement consider partial responder . Multiple myeloma first second remission . Patients CR VGPR eligible protocol . [ VGPR : Serum urine Mprotein detectable immunofixation electrophoresis 90 % great reduction serum Mprotein plus urine Mprotein level &lt; 100mg per 24 h ] Ages 1875 year ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Patients NSAIDs eligible NSAIDs month . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Cardiac disease : symptomatic congestive heart failure RVG echocardiogram determine leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % , active angina pectoris , uncontrolled hypertensionParticipants may receive study agent . Pulmonary disease : severe chronic obstructive lung disease , symptomatic restrictive lung disease , correct DLCO &lt; 50 % predict . Renal disease : serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl . Hepatic disease : SGOT SGPT &gt; 3 x normal ; serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl due Gilbert 's syndrome hemolysis Uncontrolled infection . Pregnancy lactation Patients NSAIDs allergy , include patient experience prior GI bleed due NSAIDs exclude . Patients recent GI bleed less 2 week ago exclude . Patients therapeutic dose anticoagulant exclude protocol .</criteria>
