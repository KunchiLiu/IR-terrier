	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) group disorder development movement posture often change motor impairment syndrome . The spastic subtypes common manifestation cerebral palsy perform movement difficultly due hypertonia . Decease spinal cord pathway , hyperactivity alpha gamma motoneuron reduction presynaptic inhibition may cause tendon reflex increase hypertonia individual CP . There many way improve hypertonia . In past study , fast repeat range motion could reduce muscle 's activation effectively . The polyarticular movement training might increase joint range motion reduce muscle activation . But polyarticular movement training difficulty individual CP . The single joint movement training may achieve effect polyarticular movement training . The purpose study investigate effect continuation passive range motion ( CPM ) training whether could get improvement soleus hypertonia individual CP .</brief_summary>
