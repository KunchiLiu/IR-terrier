	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Cardiovascular disease highly prevalent kidney transplant population , account approximately 40 % death significant morbidity . The morbidity mortality experience kidney transplant recipient result excess pre-transplant risk factor exacerbate kidney transplantation along development novel risk factor . Hypertension ( HTN ) consistent cardiovascular disease risk factor transplant recipient . The majority patient kidney failure HTN close 30,000 individual annually HTN primary cause kidney failure . A number immunosuppressive medication exacerbate HTN transplantation . Further , clear effect decline allograft function cardiovascular disease risk . A large number study do general population compare ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) casual , office base home measure blood pressure ( BP ) . The result clearly demonstrate ABPM give accurate representation BP arguably use part routine patient care . ABPM show reveal patient white-coat masked HTN , nocturnal HTN lack nocturnal dipping . The information successfully use accurately aggressively treat patient . Compared general population , data kidney transplant population relatively limited . Ambulatory BP measure afford u non-invasive , highly accurate way evaluate treat kidney transplant recipient . Live kidney donor ( LKD ) significantly expand supply critical organ . Of paramount importance course always donor safety . A significant amount time go screen evaluation live donor candidate . As result , candidate know healthy time donation . Following donation , however , less know outcome . Historically , nationalize , systematic mechanism follow LKD . What known date result largely single-center , retrospective study . There documented incidence kidney failure proteinuria increase prevalence HTN . There longitudinal study effect kidney donation blood pressure . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring allow unique opportunity examine effect live kidney donation blood pressure profile LKD . Significance Cardiovascular disease major cause death kidney transplant recipient . Methods well define , describe modify cardiovascular risk factor population essential . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring allow u best method well define at-risk population , good understand relationship HTN kidney transplant recipients end-organ consequence define appropriate surrogate marker . There also role use specific medication class show reestablish normal circadian BP pattern monitor patient . Utilization ABPM , population potential advance medical research decrease morbidity mortality kidney transplant recipient . Live kidney donor unknown cardiovascular risk . Retrospective study document low overall risk death may capture morbidity may associate kidney donation . In addition , low mortality LKD may still exceed would expect basis initial low risk donor candidate . One easily measurable modifiable factor contribute cardiovascular risk blood pressure . Accurate measurement LKD blood pressure pattern would allow good understanding effect live donation HTN risk provide necessary information modify improve outcome LKD . Methods Study Design : Prospective , 5-year , single center study ABPM , cardiovascular graft outcome incident prevalent live kidney donor , kidney kidney-pancreas transplant candidate recipient . Anticipated enrollment : 1,000 subject Inclusion Criteria : All live donor candidate kidney/kidney-pancreas candidate evaluate U M transplant center successful kidney/kidney-pancreas recipient . Intervention ( Recipients ) : As part standard University Michigan Transplant Center protocol , kidney/kidney-pancreas transplant recipient 24-hour ABPM do approximately 3 12 month post-transplant annually thereafter . Pre-transplant recipient candidate enrol consent additional ABPM measure do prior transplantation . Enrolled recipient subject allow access ABPM medical record research consent study blood draw ABPM placement time kidney biopsy . In addition , recipient urine collect examine marker renal dysfunction prior follow transplantation . Intervention ( Donors ) : Donor candidate consent 3 ABPM measurement do . Donor candidate first ABPM place prior donation , additional ABPM measure do 3 12 month post-donation . Enrolled donor subject also consent release donor medical record research . Donors consent study blood draw time ABPM placement along urine collection prior follow donation . Samples may store U M , Division Nephrology Bio-bank future research effort .</detailed_description>
