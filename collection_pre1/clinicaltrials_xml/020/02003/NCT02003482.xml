	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Serial CT Imaging Evaluation Dosimetric/Volumetric Changes During IMRT Head/Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator 's hypothesis patient bulky head neck cancer undergo definitive radiation therapy without chemotherapy change dose distribution lead significant change dose tumor and/or normal tissue . It possible dosimetric change could occur either patient undergo resection . In study patient undergone resection stratify separately analysis , however , study power detect difference two group . The rational stratification operate group patient patient also lose weight treatment provide u detection magnitude change dose cause weight loss independent tumor shrinkage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>AJCC pathological stage IIV cancer head neck meet follow criterion : If gross total resection perform must complete within 7 week registration Site tumor origin nasopharynx , oral cavity , oropharynx , parotid , larynx , hypopharynx ( exclude lip , sinus ) Pretreatment evaluation require eligibility include : History physical examination within four week prior study entry Dental evaluation management accord guideline Appendix IV prior start radiation Serum pregnancy test , applicable , within one week prior study entry ; urine dipstick test first day treatment Radiographic Studies : Preoperative CT MRI primary tumor neck clinical staging required Patients must â‰¥ 18 year age . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must willing consent use effective contraception treatment . Pregnant woman ineligible radiation therapy involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] , accordance local regulation , whichever sensitive ) . Patients must sign studyspecific inform consent form prior registration . Histology positive melanoma . Gross ( visible palpable ) disease leave surgery . Less gross total resection patient require stag surgery . Prior head neck radiotherapy . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period</criteria>
