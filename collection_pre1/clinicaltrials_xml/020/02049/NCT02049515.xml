	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Extension Study Duvelisib Ofatumumab Patients With CLL/SLL Previously Enrolled Study IPI-145-07</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , two- arm , extension study design enable subject experience radiologically- confirmed disease progression Study IPI-145-07 receive alternative treatment ( either IPI-145 ofatumumab ) receive study IPI-145-07 . Subjects previously receive ofatumumab study IPI-145-07 receive start dose 25 mg IPI-145 BID continuously 21 day cycle Cycle 1 follow 28- day treatment cycle thereafter disease progression , discontinuation study participation , start subsequent therapy , whichever come first . Subjects previously receive IPI-145 study IPI-145-07 receive start dose 300 mg ofatumumab Day 1 follow seven weekly dos 2000 mg . Thereafter , subject receive 2000 mg ofatumumab every month four month unless disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . Administration ofatumumab exceed 12 dos ( within 7 cycle ) .</detailed_description>
