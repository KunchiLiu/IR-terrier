Histological cytological confirmation ER+ status ( define &gt; 1 % positive tumor cell ) , histological cytological confirmation HER2negative ( HER2 ) status local laboratory test use criterion American Society Oncology ( ASCO ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) Clinical Practice Guideline update . [ 44 ] 3 . Female patient 18 year age older : Are postmenopausal least 1 year Screening visit , menopause define : Age ≥ 55 year 1 year amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 year 1 year amenorrhea , estradiol assay &lt; 20 pg/mL oSurgical menopause bilateral oophorectomy Note : Ovarian radiation treatment luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist ( goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate ) permit induction ovarian suppression . 4 . Patients history brain metastasis eligible study provide follow criterion meet : Brain metastasis treat No evidence disease progression ≥ 3 month hemorrhage treatment Offtreatment dexamethasone 4 week administration first dose MLN0128 No ongoing requirement dexamethasone antiepileptic drug 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . 6 . Clinical laboratory value specify within 4 week first dose MLN0128 : Bone marrow reserve consistent absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L ; platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L ; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min base either CockcroftGault estimate base 12 24hour urine collection Fasting serum glucose ≤ 130 mg/dL fast triglyceride ≤ 300 mg/dL 7 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) within 5 absolute percentage point institutional standard normal measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) within 4 week first dose MLN0128 ( ie , institutional standard normal 50 % , LVEF may low 45 % eligible study ) . 8 . Able provide paraffin block minimum 10 unstained slide available archival tumor tissue ( paraffin block prefer ) . If archival tumor tissue available , tumor biopsy may perform patient begin treatment MLN0128 . If few 10 slide available tumor content/area requirement meet , study eligibility determine upon discussion sponsor . 9 . Ability swallow oral medication , willingness perform mucositis prophylaxis , suitable venous access studyrequired blood sampling . 10 . Voluntary write consent must give performance study relate procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Phase 1b Only : In addition previously mention inclusion criterion , patient must meet following inclusion criterion enrol phase 1b portion study : 11 . Patients may SD disease progression recent treatment exemestane fulvestrant , everolimus combination either exemestane ( country ) fulvestrant ( US ) . Exemestane fulvestrant combination MLN0128 also initiate new line therapy . Phase 2 Only : In addition previously mention inclusion criterion , patient must meet follow inclusion criterion enrol phase 2 portion study : 12 . Measureable disease define follow : At least 1 extraosseous lesion accurately measure least 1 dimension . The lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm conventional image technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT MRI , Bone lesion ( lytic mixed [ lytic plus sclerotic ] ) absence measurable disease define 13 . Patients must disease progression treatment everolimus combination either exemestane ( country ) fulvestrant ( US ) ( duration treatment ≥ 4 week ) must tolerate everolimus treatment combination exemestane ( country ) fulvestrant ( US ) adequately accord treat physician 's judgment . Everolimus combination exemestane fulvestrant require recent treatment enrollment , progression recent anticancer therapy require enrollment . 14 . Patients enrol PK/TumorPD Cohort must extraosseous disease assessable serial tumor biopsy Exclusion Criteria Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion enrol study : Phase 1b Phase 2 1 . Prior anticancer therapy investigational therapy within 2 week administration first dose MLN0128 ( except exemestane fulvestrant , continue ) . Treatment everolimus must discontinue 2 week administration first dose MLN0128 . 2 . Chronic concomitant therapy bisphosphonates denosumab prevention bone metastasis . Concomitant treatment bisphosphonates denosumab permit treatment osteoporosis management exist bone metastasis initiate least 4 week administration first dose MLN0128 . 3 .

Previous treatment dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor TORC1/2 inhibitor . 6 . Manifestations malabsorption due prior gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery , GI disease , unknown reason may alter absorption MLN0128 . 7 . Poorly control diabetes mellitus define glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 7 % ; patient history transient glucose intolerance due corticosteroid administration may enrol study inclusion/exclusion criterion meet . 8 . Other clinically significant comorbidities , uncontrolled pulmonary disease , active central nervous system disease , active infection , condition could compromise participation patient study . 9 . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . 10 . History follow within last 6 month administration first dose MLN0128 : Ischemic myocardial event , include angina require therapy artery revascularization procedure Ischemic cerebrovascular event , include transient ischemic attack artery revascularization procedure Requirement inotropic support ( exclude digoxin ) serious ( uncontrolled ) cardiac arrhythmia ( include atrial flutter/fibrillation , ventricular fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ) Placement pacemaker control rhythm New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure Pulmonary embolism 11 .
