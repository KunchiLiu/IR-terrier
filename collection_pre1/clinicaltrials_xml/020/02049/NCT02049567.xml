	<brief_summary>Traditional lens cataract patient monofocal , mean offer clear distance vision , patient must wear eyeglass contact lens order see clearly thing close , newspaper . The FluidVision™ lens test study design allow patient see far object clearly regular lens , also see near object clearly regular lens .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation FluidVision Accommodating Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FluidVision lens IOL utilize eye 's natural accommodative force reshape anterior surface lens change optical power . It use proprietary hydraulic mechanism drive fluid periphery device central lens portion back , change curvature lens surface facilitate accommodation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must eligible primary intraocular lens implantation correction aphakia follow cataract extraction . 2 . Patients best correct distance visual acuity worse 20/40 either without glare source present ( e.g . Brightness Acuity Tester ) 3 . Patients predict best correct distance visual acuity must 20/40 good cataract removal AIOL implantation determine potential acuity meter ( PAM ) potential vision test surgeon estimation eye . 4 . Patients must ≤1.0 D preoperative keratometric astigmatism . 5 . Patients must clear intraocular medium cataract . 6 . Patients must preoperative endothelial cell density 2200 cells/mm2 . 7 . Patients must least 50 year age . 8 . Patients must willing able comply schedule followup visit thirty six month surgery . 9 . Patients must calculate AIOL power within range investigational device ; 10 . Patients must provide write informed consent . 1 . Patients must take medication may affect accommodation ( include limit mydriatic , cycloplegic miotic agent ; tricyclic antidepressant , phenothiazine , benzodiazepine , first generation antihistamine , anticholinergic agent ) . 2 . Patients must systemic disease could increase operative risk confound outcome ( e.g . autoimmune disease , diabetes ) . 3 . Patients must systemic medication may confound outcome increase risk subject i.e tamsulosin hydrochloride ( Flomax ) medication similar side effect . 4 . Patients must ocular condition may predispose future complication ( e.g . anterior segment pathology include glaucoma potentially occludable angle , corneal dystrophy , ocular inflammation , poor pupil dilation ) . 5 . Patients must previous intraocular corneal surgery might confound outcome investigation increase risk subject . 6 . Patients must pregnant , lactate course investigation , another condition associate fluctuation hormone could lead refractive change . 7 . Patients must degenerative visual disorder ( e.g . macular degeneration retinal disorder ) predict cause future best correct visual acuity loss bad 20/40 . 8 . Patients must condition increase risk zonular rupture cataract extraction procedure may affect postoperative centration tilt lens ( e.g . pseudoexfoliation syndrome ) . 9 . Patients must sensitivity plan study medication . 10 . Patients must simultaneously participate ophthalmic drug device clinical trial . 11 . Patients intact capsulorhexis posterior capsular bag time cataract extraction lens implantation . 12 . Patients floppy/weak zonule , incomplete zonule zonular rupture cataract extraction . 13 . Patients capsulorhexis size &lt; 5.5 mm &gt; 6.0 mm . 14 . Patients decentered capsulorhexis &gt; 1.0 mm relation limbus . 15 . Patients posterior capsular opacity observe cataract extraction . 16 . Patients complicate cataract surgery damage AIOL prevent implantation AIOL ( e.g . pupillary constriction , poor visibility due corneal edema ) .</criteria>
