	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether increase prophylactic dose ( 3 gram ) cefazolin time cesarean delivery superior coverage adipose tissue current establish dose 2 gram . The tissue serum concentration value , use increase prophylactic dose , compare pilot study assay hop determine optimal dose obese morbidly obese population undergo cesarean delivery . A previous study perform University California , Irvine ( UCI ) Long Beach Memorial Medical Center/Miller Children 's Hospital ( LBMMC ) show standard dose antibiotic ( 2 gram cefazolin ) provide adequate coverage organism obese extremely obese population . The purpose research study evaluate whether increase dose antibiotic give cesarean delivery ( 3 gram cefazolin ) reach adequate level adipose ( fat cell underneath skin ) serum ( blood ) sample . In addition , researcher hope evaluate if/how mother 's weight effect level antibiotic tissue ( group similar cell ) . This follow study ( prior study HS # 2009-7015 UCI ) enroll obese ( Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 30-40 ) morbidly obese ( BMI &gt; 40 ) woman receive increase dose prophylactic cefazolin time schedule cesarean delivery UCI LBMMC . Researchers hope enroll total 35 woman overall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increased Cefazolin During Cesarean Delivery Obese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This follow-up original pilot study ( HS # 2009-7015 UCI/587-08 LBMMC ) . This study also design prospective , non-randomized , non-blinded trial effect obesity adequacy antimicrobial ( cefazolin ) concentration increase dos ( 2 gram 3 gram ) preoperative prophylactic antibiotic within adipose tissue time cesarean delivery . Inclusion Criteria : â€¢ Patients term ( &gt; 37 week ) undergo cesarean delivery LBMMC UCI . Exclusion criterion : - pre-gestational diabetes - chronic hypertension - collagen vascular disease - renal impairment - multiple gestation - contraindication cefazolin administration ( know anaphylactic reaction penicillin 's know cephalosporin allergy ) - exposure cephalosporins one week prior cesarean section - need emergent cesarean delivery diagnosis chorioamnionitis Study Procedure : All patient require cesarean delivery non-emergent circumstance , determine physician , approached participation study co-investigators . They approach Labor Delivery intake evaluation day schedule procedure . Based published literature preliminary power analysis expect 2 study group need 1414 subject demonstrate statistically significant difference antibiotic concentration within adipose tissue . The two group consist : 1 . OBESE GROUP ( BMI 30-40 ) 2 . MORBIDLY OBESE GROUP ( BMI &gt; 40 ) 1 . All subject receive cefazolin least 30 , 60 minute prior skin incision . 2 . At time cesarean delivery , follow tissue sample collect : - adipose tissue immediately follow skin incision ( prior incision fascia ) - adipose tissue prior skin closure - serum sample skin incision prior completion operative procedure Approximately 2 gram tissue sample site 5 cc blood require analysis . All sample collect Dr. Swank , Dr. Wing physician previously proctor proper tissue collect technique either mention investigator . Upon collection , tissue specimen blot remove residual blood debris , weigh , place freezer ( -80 ` C ) analysis . Serum sample draw red top tube immediately place wet ice . Immediately follow completion surgery , centrifuge 10 minute 3G ( 3200 rpm ) place lock -80 ` C freezer analysis . Tissue serum sample send David P. Nicolau , PhD , FCCP , FIDSA , Center Anti-Infective Research Development , Hartford Hospital , Hartford , Connecticut . Samples batch send together completion study enrollment . Dr. Swank study nurse responsible securely pack sample dry ice overnight ship Dr. Nicolau . Once Dr. Nicolau , tissue sample homogenize analyzed determine zone inhibition . The Cefazolin concentration determine serum sample use previously validate high-performance liquid chromatography method . 16 Tissues serum send without direct identifier . Dr. Nicolau access identity research subject provide sample .</detailed_description>
