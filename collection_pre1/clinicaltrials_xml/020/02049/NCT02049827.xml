	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation treatment choice end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) improve quantity quality life dialysis patient . Although prolongation graft survival short term prevent release observe immunosuppression ( IS ) powerful , longer-term survival improve . Indeed , IS direct deleterious effect kidney transplant , weak IS promote rejection , strong , promote emergence viral disease polyomavirus BK ( BKV ) . BK nephropathy ( BKVAN ) virus accompany irreversible impairment renal function , leading loss graft follow premature return dialysis least 50 % case . Plasma BKV reactivation observe mainly first year transplantation 15 % patient complication annually BKVAN concern 5 % recipient . Currently , treatment option limit , decrease IS show partially effective care early . There specific antiviral effective treatment disease . In addition , way predict patient develop BKV reactivation BKVAN despite low tax . The diagnosis interstitial nephritis BKV base detection viral DNA PCR plasma confirm histological analysis renal tissue . Plasma quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) measure progression disease therapeutic efficacy . Control BKV viremia direct antiviral immune response quality base primarily effective anti- T lymphocyte activity BKV reflection . In context , inhibition lymphocyte activation induce IS block establishment T-cell response anti- BKV transplant , low presence T lymphocytes generally observed patient anti- BKV ( LYT - BKV ) blood . Our preliminary study validate vitro sensitive test measure functionality blood LYT - BKV . This test use evaluate concentration functionality LYT - BKV present small volume blood measure specific proliferation stimulation peptide cocktails BKV . Proof concept feasibility test establish small series sample highlight significant difference lymphocyte anti-BKV different patient . Put good use post-transplant follow-up , type test provide clinician valuable data assess quality anti- BKV T response compare intensity type IS treatment . Early identification patient risk reactivation BKV , risk BKVAN BKV viremia observe , would adapt therapeutic response monitoring arrangement fair . The objective project conduct feasibility study assess relevance post-transplant monitoring anti- BKV T response BKV viremic patient first year post- transplant . Immunological data analyze relation virological data bioclinical data .</brief_summary>
