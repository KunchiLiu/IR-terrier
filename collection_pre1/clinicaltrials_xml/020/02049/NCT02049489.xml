	<brief_summary>This study evaluate type immunotherapy patient 's immune system stimulate kill tumor cell . ICT-121 dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine make patient 's white blood cell . This vaccine test patient recurrent glioblastoma ass safety , tolerability clinical response . Patient 's white blood cell ( WBC ) collect blood cultured yield autologous DC . The DC mixed purify peptide CD133 antigen . The DC vaccine give back patient several month . The goal stimulate patient 's immune system CD133 kill patient 's glioblastoma tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ICT-121 Dendritic Cell Vaccine Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy hold promise oncology potential provide target anti-tumor therapy minimal adverse event . The goal study assess immunotherapy direct CD133 autologous dendritic cell product call ICT-121 . CD133 antigen overexpressed many type cancer cell associate shorten survival . CD133 positive cancer stem cell resistant chemotherapy . Patients recurrent glioblastoma HLA A2 phenotype receive autologous vaccine DC pulse purified peptide CD133 . Approximately 20 patient recurrence glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) treat . After informed consent screening , patient undergo apheresis collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . Monocytes purify cultured dendritic cell ( DC ) pulse purified peptide CD133 antigen . The pulsed dendritic cell aliquoted frozen . Patients autologous DCs reinfused intradermally . Patients receive least four intradermal injection autologous DC vaccine additional vaccine maintenance phase . The goal induce cytotoxic T cell response CD133 positive cell . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability . Clinical response rate monitor well immune response CD133 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any recurrence glioblastoma multiforme 2 . ≥ 18 year age 3 . Human leukocyte antigen HLA A2 positive 4 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % 5 . Baseline hematologic study chemistry profile must meet following criterion : hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9.9 g/dL absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) &lt; 30 mg/dL creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 4x upper limit normal ( ULN ) prothrombin time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.6 x control unless therapeutically warrant 6 . Female patient child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test 7 . If surgically sterile , male female patient childbearing age must use double barrier contraception ( hormonal ; intrauterine device ; barrier ) 8 . Written informed consent , Release Medical Records Form HIPAA review sign patient legally authorize representative 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 10 . Any Grade 3 4 toxicity ( accord NCI CTCAE ) resolve least 2 week prior first treatment 1 . Radiosurgery include Gamma Knife , linear accelerator base radiosurgery , CyberKnife placement Gliadel wafer 2 . Presence active malignancy prior history malignancy , except : basal cell carcinoma skin , cervical carcinoma situ , early stage prostate carcinoma require active treatment 3 . New York Heart Association &gt; /= Grade 3 congestive heart failure within 6 month prior study entry 4 . Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include : Myocardial infarction transient ischemic attack stroke within 6 month prior enrollment Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) ; Clinically significant abnormality electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 5 . Pulmonary disease include great grade 2 dyspnea laryngeal edema , grade 3 pulmonary edema pulmonary hypertension accord CTCAE 4.03 6 . Severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition could increase risk associate trial participation trial drug administration could interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry trial . This include limited following : 1 . Immunosuppressive disease 2 . Chronic renal disease / failure 3 . Concurrent neurodegenerative disease , 4 . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol . 7 . Presence acute infection require active treatment antibiotics/antivirals ; prophylactic administration allow 8 . Known history autoimmune disorder 9 . Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity acquire immunodeficiency syndrome related illness serious medical condition 10 . Breastfeeding 11 . Received therapeutic investigational agent within 30 day screen , except immunotherapy . Patients previous immunotherapy eligible regardless time . 12 . Contraindication MRI 13 . Foreseeable condition would preclude reduction steroid ( dexamethasone ) maximum 2 mg BID within week prior apheresis</criteria>
