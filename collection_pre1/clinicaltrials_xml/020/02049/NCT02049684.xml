	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tear ( injury muscle tendon stabilise shoulder ) one common condition affect shoulder . Small medium size rotator cuff tear manage arthroscopic keyhole surgery . Very large massive tear difficult operate often poor rate heal . As result surgeon investigate use product improve outcome surgery massive tear . The product investigator currently use try improve outcome surgery massive rotator cuff tear call patch . The patch provide scaffold support muscle rotator cuff . Studies rotator cuff surgery use similar patch find recovery improve low rate postsurgical problem . The aim study look whether use patch improve pain clinical function shoulder surgery . In addition , investigator would like understand patch work . To investigator scan ( take image ) shoulder use magnetic resonance image look muscle damage shoulder surgery .</brief_summary>
