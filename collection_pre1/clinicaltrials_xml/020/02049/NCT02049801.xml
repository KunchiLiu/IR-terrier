	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study MEK inhibitor MEK162 see safe patient combine idarubicin cytarabine . MEK inhibitor MEK162 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , idarubicin cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving MEK inhibitor MEK162 , cytarabine , idarubicin may effective treatment acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MEK162 ( MEK inhibitor MEK162 ) patient RAS-mutated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) combine sequential induction chemotherapy ( 3+4 ) measure development grade 3-4 dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Analyze downstream inhibition RAS signal follow therapy single-agent MEK162 exploratory pharmacodynamics ( PD ) study . II . Perform preliminary efficacy analysis combination MEK162 induction chemotherapy ( 3+4 ) patient RAS-mutated AML measure complete remission rate , 2-year overall survival , duration response . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -4 -1 day 5-18 , cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously 24 hour day 1-4 , idarubicin IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Patients may receive second course induction discretion principal investigator . POST-REMISSION THERAPY : Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously 24 hour day 1-3 , idarubicin IV 1 hour day 1 2 , MEK inhibitor MEK 162 PO BID day 4-17 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
