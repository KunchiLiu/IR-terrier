	<detailed_description>Interventions : Participants group attend physiotherapy 4 occasion , addition initial appointment baseline data collect . All participant provide individualised home exercise program . This provide base investigator ' clinical experience evidence base program . The participant provide handout detail exercise complete , include dosage . If excessive pain difficulty associate complete exercise participant advise cease particular exercise review researcher follow week . Participants knee tap accord either therapeutic flexible tap protocol , placebo tap protocol depend group randomly allocate three occasion one week interval . All participant provide write information regard tape allergy remove tape knee . To control Hawthorne effect participant aware whether intervention placebo group . Participants attend appointment per week three week . They three week period intervention return review completion study . At time participant refer physiotherapy intervention clinically indicate . This may include physiotherapy The Alfred Hospital , private practice participant ' local health service . If anytime participant wish withdraw study refer investigator continue physiotherapy appropriate setting . Sample size calculation : The investigator hypothesise combination tap exercise program give rise clinically significant improvement functional capacity , symptom quality life . If truly difference change VAS placebo therapeutic base group , 30 patient require 90 % sure 95 % confidence interval exclude difference mean 20mm . This demonstrated Tubach colleague 2005 . This assume standard deviation change VAS 21.5 . Due participant attrition anticipate additional 20 % recruited sample . This total 36 participant total . Feasibility : The osteoarthritis hip knee clinic The Alfred hospital review approximately 13 patient per week majority would appropriate inclusion trial . There also many referral orthopaedics , rheumatology emergency patient appropriate inclusion . It therefore anticipate recruitment study barrier completion trial . Statistical analysis : All data analyse intention treat . Continuous variable analyse use analysis covariance , control baseline value recruitment centre . The proportion participant complete program compare group use chi-squared test relative risk non-completion determine . Alpha set 0.05</detailed_description>
