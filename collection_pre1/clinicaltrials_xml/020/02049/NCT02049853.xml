	<brief_summary>Acute dyspnea common chief complaint patient present emergency department . Patients acute dyspnea display high mortality rate . In-hospital mortality high 10 % hospitalization 30 % within 6 month follow-up . The Triple A Initiative Study design improve coordination care patient acute dyspnea alert Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) . We hypothesize coordination care start EMS level include point-of-care testing cardiac biomarker NTproBNP support preclinical clinical diagnostic clarification . Treatment derive earlier diagnostic clarification reduce length stay hospital , treatment cost improve patient 's outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Triple A Initiative Study ( `` Aktionsb체ndnis Akute Atemnot '' )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim prospective , randomize study evaluate effect point-of-care test NT-proBNP patient present acute dyspnea Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) .Patients enrol Emergency Medical Services participate German hospital ( Klinikum N체rnberg , Klinikum F체rth , Universit채tsklinikum Jena ) . To enrol study , patient must meet follow inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Patients acute dyspnea randomize POCT group get NT-proBNP-POCT measurement EMS . The emergency physician EMS decide apply predefined treatment strategy accord result work hypothesis . Patients acute dyspnea randomize standard care group NOT get NT-proBNP measurement scene . The emergency physician ED construct work hypothesis follow current treatment recommendation . The major focus study initiate treatment heart failure early possible .</detailed_description>
