	<brief_summary>Background : - Depressed people appear problem regulate level brain chemical call glutamate people depress . The drug diazoxide may help regulate glutamate level people depression . Researchers want know rapidly improve depression symptom . This would help many people depression , medication take long time work . Objectives : - To see diazoxide quickly improve depressive symptom people treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Eligibility : - Adults 18 65 year old MDD , currently depress without psychotic feature . Design : - Participants hospitalize entire study , 11 13 week . They may allow short leaf . Participants interview many time study . They also fill questionnaire . - Phase I last 4 week . &lt; TAB &gt; - Participants screen lab test , psychiatric medical history exam . &lt; TAB &gt; - Participants slowly go current medication . They drug-free 2 week . - Phase II last 8 9 week . - Participants monitor , answer question , give blood sample . They drink glucose drink , give saliva sample , scan brain take . - Participants take study drug daily mouth one 3-week session . - They take placebo daily mouth 3-week session . - There drug-free period 14 21 day session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Enhancing Glutamate Transporter Function Produces Antidepressant Effects People With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To date , available pharmacological treatment major depressive disorder ( MDD ) proven modestly effective acute phase . We systematically test different glutamatergic modulators patient mood disorder order develop improve therapeutic . A recent report find ( beta ) -lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone increase glutamate uptake increase GLT1 ( EAAT2 ) function , antidepressant-like effect animal model . Using learned helpless model depression develop outbred line , define new anatomy helplessness , determine synaptic loss due excess extracellular glutamate appear involved pathophysiology helplessness ; animal show 40 % decrease EAAT2 astrocytic transporter expression . Together , data suggest astrocytic glutamate reuptake system may central pathophysiology treatment depression , agent directly increase astrocytic glutamate uptake may represent novel class antidepressant . With protocol , propose test specific , new mechanism use diazoxide chronically increase expression glutamate transporter EAAT2 , result removal glutamate synaptic cleft . Diazoxide enhance glutamate uptake glia activate ATP-sensitive potassium ( KATP ) channel . We expect effect reduce excessive glutamate transmission associate acute antidepressant effect . The model present clinically testable one . If successful , may lead development group novel pharmacological treatment major depression . Study Population : 24 individual treatment-resistant major depressive disorder . Design : Male female patient , age 18 65 year , diagnosis MDD , currently episode major depression , recruit study . This study consist double-blind crossover administration either diazoxide ( 200-400 mg/day give orally ) placebo . The study ass efficacy 3 week glutamate transporter enhancer ( diazoxide , 200-400 mg/day give orally ) compare placebo improve overall depressive symptomatology patient treatment-resistant MDD . Other aim study include : 1 ) determine whether change brain neurochemical ( glutamate ) correlate antidepressant response ( decrease Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score ) diazoxide patient treatment-resistant MDD , 2 ) examine biomarkers response . Outcome Measures : Primary : MADRS total score . Secondary outcome measure : Proportion subject achieve remission ( MADRS le equal 10 ) response ( equal 50 % reduction baseline MADRS total score ) ; change baseline Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) total score .</detailed_description>
