	<detailed_description>Noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) affect estimate 5 % worldwide population , 30-40 million Americans expose hazardous sound noise level regularly . Sources noise may occupational ( e.g. , manufacturing , construction ) , blast noise ( e.g. , firearms explosion ) , recreational ( e.g. , loud music , power tool ) . Trauma inner ear occur transient hearing loss ( temporary threshold shift , TTS ) permanent hearing loss ( permanent threshold shift , PTS ) . Although hear recovers TTS 24-48 hour , grow evidence suggest repeat TTS may lead PTS . Both TTS PTS lead decrease hearing threshold 3000 6000 Hz . Currently , treatment human NIHL although area active investigation . Protection NIHL consist limit noise exposure Occupational Safety Health Administration ( OSHA ) limit occupational noise wear hearing-protection device ( e.g. , ear muff earplug ) . There known medication use clinically prevent NIHL human . LePrell colleague successfully establish protocol induce TTS use digitally-modified pop rock music . This model experimentally-induced TTS intend provide ethical way test medication might prevent NIHL . In mouse model , Bao colleague able use zonisamide , anti-epileptic medication approve treatment partial seizure , methylprednisolone , glucocorticoid medication , protect noise-induced PTS . The long-term goal research find medication prevent NIHL . The goal present pilot study evaluate zonisamide methylprednisolone medication prevent TTS human . Specific Aim 1 : Examine zonisamide possible prophylactic medication prevent noise-induced hearing loss , use escalate dose protocol . Healthy volunteer would give 100 200 mg zonisamide one-time dos daily medication two week ( establish steady-state ) . They would expose digitally-modified pop rock music 4 hour undergo serial test hear monitoring side effect sound exposure 3-4 hour . They would monitor one day one week post-exposure hearing side effect . Hypothesis : Zonisamide able protect noise-induced hearing loss human . Specific Aim 2 : Examine methylprednisolone possible prophylactic medication prevent noise-induced hearing loss , use escalate dose protocol . Healthy volunteer would give 32 64 mg methylprednisolone one-time dos . They would undergo music exposure post-sound exposure monitoring describe . Hypothesis : Methylprednisolone able protect noise-induced hearing loss human</detailed_description>
