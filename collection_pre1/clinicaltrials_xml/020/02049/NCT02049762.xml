	<brief_title>Aspirin Impact Platelet Reactivity Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Novel P2Y12 Inhibitors Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Current knowledge data support use dual anti-platelets patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Novel P2Y12 inhibitor show superiority clopidogrel regard morbidity mortality , cost high bleed rate - even low dos aspirin increase risk gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding . In geographical analysis PLATO trial show difference outcome . When high dose aspirin use , superiority ticagrelor reduce . The use platelet reactivity test prove acknowledged usefulness gauge bleed ischemic risk . Few study show clopidogral inhibit ADP activity , also arachidonic acid ( AA ) pathway consider aspirin specific pathway . Examining effect potent P2Y12 inhibitor healthy volunteer show increased inhibition AA pathway . Not add aspirin , show little effect inhibition AA pathway . It demonstrate vascular endothelial function inversely correlate platelet reactivity individual without establish cardiovascular disease ( control ) acute myocardial infarction patient . Objective Our goal examine effect ( platelet function test endothelial function ) aspirin add novel P2Y12 inhibitor treat ACS patient . Design The propose study randomized-controlled , double blind trial , conduct among ACS patient treat percutaneously . Eligible patient recruit hospitalization due ACS percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , randomization envelope 1:1 basis take place month index event , follow-up visit cardiac clinic . Platelet function Endothelial function test take month index event , 2 week period follow aspirin/placebo therapy , cross-over return open-label aspirin . Study end-points The primary end-point platelet function test response AA . Secondary end-points include endothelial function platelet reactivity accord platelet activity VerifyNow test response ADP platelet activation Clinical outcome include all-cause cardiac mortality hospitalization , recurrent ischemia stent thrombosis , bleed event along blood transfusion , record safety end-points .</detailed_description>
