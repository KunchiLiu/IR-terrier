	<brief_summary>The study conduct compare long 2 oral formulation ( reference test formulation ) CC-122 stay body , whether take test formulation high-fat meal affect absorption formulation . There 3 dosing period study , one formulation one test formulation + meal . The subject ask fast least 10 hour take capsule formulation . During one period , subject ask eat high-fat meal 30 minute give capsule swallow . Subjects randomly ( chance ) assign treatment sequence determine order subject receive reference formulation , test formulation , test formulation + high-fat meal . Blood sample take interval study assess amount drug time point . Blood sample also collect certain time point determine level special protein may help explain CC-122 work .</brief_summary>
