Cancer stage must confirm document computed tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan Prior concurrent CRT define follow : Minimum 2 cycle platinumbased chemotherapy Radiotherapy total tumor dose great equal ( &gt; = ) 60 Gray single fraction dose &gt; = 1.8 Gray Overlap radiotherapy minimum 2 cycle platinumbased chemotherapy ( one cycle define either 3 4 week depend chemotherapy regimen ) . A deviation 2 3 day exact overlap acceptable . Purely radiosensitizing dos chemotherapy acceptable ( example [ e.g . ] , daily low dose regimen ; weekly carboplatinum + paclitaxel regimen allow ) . Subjects must complete primary thoracic CRT least 4 week ( 28 day ) later 12 week ( 84 day ) prior randomization . Subjects receive prophylactic brain irradiation part primary CRT eligible .
