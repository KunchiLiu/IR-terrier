	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory condition unknown aetiology , characterize diffuse confluent mucosal inflammation colon start rectum relapse remit course . Conventional endoscopy think reliable parameter disease activity , microscopic inflammation persist despite normal mucosal finding . Histologically detectable inflammation associate great risk subsequent relapse . A flare UC activity difficult predict , simple , easily measure biological marker relapse would important guide appropriate therapy . Recent technological advance fiber optic , light source , detector , molecular biology stimulate development numerous optical method promise significantly improve ability evaluate human epithelium vivo . These method , collectively term `` optical biopsy , '' nondestructive situ assay mucosal histopathology use light provide instantaneous tissue assessment . Narrow band imaging ( NBI ) novel technique enhance diagnostic capability endoscopes characterise tissue use filter redgreenblue ( RGB ) sequential illumination system . This result improve mucosal contrast detail . UC always involve distal colon activity usually great rectosigmoid area . This make evaluation rectum sigmoid attractive marker patient UC . Unlike serum faecal marker , endoscopic assessment mucosa unlikely affect systemic disease would acceptable test patient physician . We plan evaluate THE rectosigmoid mucosa patient UC flexible endoscope use white light NBI endoscopy . These patient follow one year relapse , whichever come first . The aim study develop endoscopic biomarkers predict relapse acute quiescent UC .</brief_summary>
