	<brief_summary>Nicotine alcohol frequently use together combine use contribute half million death year , alcoholic die smoking-related disease alcohol-related disease . Using new multi-modal MRI approach combine data fusion , investigator propose study nicotine modulate alcohol-induced change function brain circuit . The investigator hypothesis : - functional connectivity ( FC ) reward network , contain component mesolimbic dopamine system , alter alcohol , additional increase FC observe nicotine also present ( e.g. , additive effect ) . - co-administration nicotine counteract effect alcohol FC multiple brain network , include visual , sensorimotor motor brain circuit , may associate impair effect alcohol</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-term Objectives : Our long-term objective bring together non-invasive quantitative functional magnetic resonance imaging ( q-fMRI ) newly develop cutting-edge analysis method study change neuronal metabolism cerebrovascular function occur psychoactive drug use . Specific Aims : Our first specific aim validate component q-fMRI acquisition , require several different kind fMRI scan ( multimodal measurement ) . The second aim applies q-MRI method study functional brain network define brain activity person simply rest engage activity . These network consist unique set region spontaneously fluctuate together order `` tune '' future task performance . The effect nicotine alcohol interaction rest state network focus application new q-fMRI strategy . q-fMRI measurement require several different scan , include make measurement perfusion oxygen metabolism , integrate analysis different result much informative separate analysis measurement . However , analysis method , link independent component analysis ( link ICA ) approach new never apply q-fMRI measurement measurement psychoactive drug effect . Thus , third aim apply novel analysis method data acquire different drug condition identify pattern related activity multimodal fMRI data . Research Design Methods : A randomized within-subject study 23 healthy subject do follow : fMRI scan begin four hour pre-treatment either nicotine placebo patch ( randomize ) . Alcohol consume subject scanner second scanning session do combination nicotine ( placebo ) + alcohol ass change rest state functional connectivity due alcohol nicotine interaction . Significance : Linked ICA q-fMRI measurement innovative strategy study brain function could significant impact ability fMRI give integrated picture spectrum effect drug abuse may brain function , thus ideally suit goal CEBRA mechanism . By apply technique study alcohol nicotine co-use , also contribute greatly understanding significant health problem .</detailed_description>
