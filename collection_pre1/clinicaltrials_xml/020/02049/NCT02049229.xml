	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) frequent cause death , account approximately 13 % death . In western country , incidence ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) around 77/100 000/year , whereas patient non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) , incidence 132/100 000/year . Thus , incidence STEMI decreasing , concomitant increase incidence NSTE-ACS . NSTE-ACS STEMI usually consider different entity , recent report suggest prognosis either subgroup MI similar despite different management strategy . In STEMI , primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) recommend reperfusion therapy fibrinolysis perform experienced team within 2 hour first medical contact . Treatment patient NSTE-ACS base risk acute thrombotic complication . A clear benefit early angiography ( &lt; 48 h ) PCI report high-risk patient . However , deferral intervention improve outcome . In addition , routine stenting recommend basis predictability result safety . Consensus emerge early PCI use result favourable outcome , especially high-risk patient . The ESC guideline NSTE-ACS update 20113 STEMI 2012 . Currently , PCI prefer reperfusion strategy patient acute STEMI NSTE-ACS . Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) show reduce in-stent restenosis PCI compare bare metal stent ( BMS ) . Over previous decade , appearance first-generation drug-eluting stent ( Taxus™ , Cypher™ ) scene revolutionize practice coronary intervention , result reduction restenosis rate one-half two-thirds 5 year follow-up , amount roughly 10-15 % need target vessel revascularization follow DES long-term . However , early randomize first-generation-DES trial exclude patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) , even though invasive approach currently prefer method treatment acute MI . Later randomize trial meta-analyses clinical trial use DES treatment acute STEMI demonstrate use DES safe improve clinical outcome mainly decrease risk re-intervention compare BMS . However , accumulate evidence meta-analyses registry question long-term safety first-generation DES , raise concern high risk late - late - stent thrombosis ( ST ) , potentially life-threatening complication . A step forward take design second-generation DES . In SPIRIT I-III trial , everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) show promising mid-term clinical outcome select patient group result FDA approval . Newer , second generation DES available every day practice interventional cardiology . In context , Xience-V™-EES significantly reduce late lumen loss , assess angiography , compare paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus ) , non-inferior rate composite outcome safety efficacy . Subsequent randomized trial demonstrate , compare first-generation DES , Xience-V-EES able reduce restenosis ST rate overall elective patient population . In Examination trial , Xience-V-EES show reduce rate repeat revascularization ST STEMI patient compare traditional BMS . On hand , novel Promus-Element™-EES show non-inferior compare Xience-V-EES recent comers-trial . The Promus-Element stent use identical drug coat formulation drug dose density Xience-V- stent . Although , DES deliver antiproliferative drug adurable polymer significantly reduce restenosis compare BMS , apparent increase risk adverse event , durable polymer associate hypersensitivity reaction , delayed healing , incomplete endothelialization may contribute increase risk late ( 30 day 1 year ) late ( beyond 1 year ) stent thrombosis compare BMS . A number stent technology develop attempt modify propose mediator late thrombotic event include bioabsorbable polymer , nonpolymeric stent surface , bioabsorbable stent . Synergy™-EES novel Promus-Element stent platform deliver everolimus ultrathin bioabsorbable polymer apply abluminal surface . In randomized EVOLVE trial , SYNERGY stent noninferior PROMUS Element stent primary angiographic endpoint in-stent late loss 6 month . Clinical event rate low comparable , stent thrombosis observe . These result support safety efficacy abluminal bioabsorbable polymer SYNERGY EES treatment patient de novo coronary artery lesion . The safety titanium-nitride-oxide-coated bioactive stent ( Titan-2™-BAS ) establish several report real-life unselected population . Interestingly , prospective study demonstrate even 'better ' outcome Titan-2-BAS compare paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus ) high-risk patient complex coronary lesion , patient present acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The recent BASE-ACS trial demonstrate patient undergo early PCI acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , insertion Titan-2-BAS non-inferior Xience-V-EES concern occurrence primary composite endpoint MACE 12 month follow-up . The relative risk ratio MACE Titan-2-BAS 1.07 ( 0.6-percentage-point absolute risk difference ) compare Xience-V-EES , difference meet chief aim trial non-inferiority Titan-2-BAS reduce MACE patient category . Moreover , albeit adequately powered address individual component safety efficacy , non-fatal MI occur significantly less frequently ARC-definite ST trend low Titan-2-BAS group compare Xience-V-EES group . On hand , stent coat compound like titanium-nitride-oxide seem decrease acute surface thrombogenicity , reduce in-stent restenosis compare conventional stainless steel stent . Optimax™ stent novel , next generation BAS , thicker layer titanium-nitride-oxide coating insert stent strut . The rationale obtain efficient rapid vascular heal site stent implantation . After initial enthusiasm DES base impressive reduction restenosis , increase concern increase risk late ST. Consequently , recommendation duration dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel ( DAPT ) incrementally extend initially 3 month Cypher™-DES 6 month Taxus™-DES recently least 12 month DES . Not commonly , cardiologist recommend indefinite DAPT patient bleed complication first 12 month . The need long-term DAPT costly remain Achilles ' heel DES ; namely increase risk bleed complication . Newer generation stent show impressively low ST rate , therefore excessive bleeding risk DAPT reconsider . Current guideline recommend oral thienopyridine ( clopidogrel , prasugrel ticagrelol ) must continue 12 month STEMI , strict minimum 1 month patient receive BMS 6 month patient receive DES . Because early discontinuation DAPT recognize potent predictor DES thrombosis , discussion patient regard need duration DAPT , ability comply tolerate DAPT , mandatory DES implantation . When patient unable tolerate comply DAPT , well surgery anticipate within 12 month DES implantation individual bleeding risk high , BMS implantation prefer . In attempt increase biocompatibility BMS , therefore reduce risk ST well restenosis without use polymer-eluted drug , various coating use . Among , diamond-like carbon-coated stent above-mentioned titanium nitric oxide-coated stent show promising result make therefore point DAPT duration shorter 3 month commonly recommend BMS . The purpose prospective , randomized multicenter trial compare clinical outcome patient present ACS , treat PCI use Optimax-BAS versus Synergy-EES . Second objective explore whether Optimax-BAS use superior compare Synergy-EES use respect hard end point ( cardiac death , MI major bleeding ) . Long-term ( 12 month ) follow-up patient present ACS ( STEMI NSTE-ACS ) receive either Optimax-BAS Synergy-EES result comparable clinical outcome ( non-inferiority ; MACE include cardiac death , MI repeat revascularization ) . Secondly , strategy Optimax-BAS use superior Synergy-EES use 18 month follow-up hard end point ( superiority ; cardiac death , MI major bleeding ) .</detailed_description>
