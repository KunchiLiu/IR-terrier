	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor BKM120 give together rituximab treat patient relapsed refractory low-grade B-cell lymphoma . PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 rituximab may effective treatment B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study BKM120 &amp; Rituximab Patients With Relapsed Refractory Indolent B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combine rituximab BKM120 ( PI3k inhibitor BKM120 ) patient previously treat indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) ( include follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , marginal zone lymphoma , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine specific toxicity associate combined BKM120 rituximab . II . Evaluate efficacy BKM120 combination rituximab disease . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 . Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 day 1 course 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients asymptomatic progression may continue treatment 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
