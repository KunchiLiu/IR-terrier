	<brief_title>Difference Pain , Quality Life Following Vaginal Hysterectomy With Vaginal Reconstruction Versus Robotic Colpopexy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction DaVinci robotic system ( Intuitive Surgical , Sunnyvale , CA ) , considerable debate regarding use , cost-effectiveness , subsequent impact patient care . While study examine surgical outcome analyzed cost technique compare open , laparoscopic , vaginal approach , remain unclear whether one route superior . Indeed , data evaluate robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach hysterectomy show similar patient result , report note high cost longer operate time robotics . Others suggest contrary information , comparable surgical time , reduce blood loss , short hospital stay , low rate conversion laparotomy use robotic-assisted hysterectomy compare laparoscopic abdominal . Research contrast robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy abdominal myomectomy posit great cost associate robotic procedure , enhance benefit decrease blood loss , complication rate , length stay . However , issue explore urogynecologic patient . A single study compare robotic versus vaginal urogynecologic procedure elderly woman show robotic surgery associate few postoperative complication vaginal route . Nevertheless procedures always perform conjunction hysterectomy , analysis retrospective . In practice , vaginal hysterectomy prefer method correct uterovaginal prolapse . We address reconstruction either vaginally robotically . Vaginal repair comprise follow : vaginal vault suspension use uterosacral ligament , enterocele repair , anterior repair , posterior/rectocele repair . The robotic procedure perform robotic sacral colpopexy use lightweight , polypropylene mesh , well posterior/rectocele repair transvaginally . Both technique well-researched , effective approach address prolapse durable way . However , clear whether one superior patient-related quality life outcome . We seek compare patient quality life assess difference subjective impression pain follow procedure</detailed_description>
