	<brief_summary>Background : - Normal bacteria tiny organism find healthy human mouth . These call oral microbiota . It unclear exactly oral microbiota may affect health . For example , microbial composition abnormal , may lead mouth condition like periodontitis . Researchers want study microbiota change time . This help plan future disease study . Objectives : - To see oral microbiota change time . Eligibility : - Forty adult employee National Cancer Institute Shady Grove . Design : - For 12 hour first visit , participant eat drink ( except water ) . They brush , floss , use mouthwash , chew gum , eat lozenge candy , smoke cigarette , chew tobacco . - At first visit , participant : - Be give saliva collector . They spit 2 mL saliva . - Fill online questionnaire . - Every 2 month , participant visit clinic repeat visit 1 . - The study end 1 year . Sponsoring Institute : National Cancer Institute</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Variation Over Time Oral Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ) , start 2008 , aim characterize microbial community skin , oral nasal cavity , gastrointestinal urogenital tract . This project cross-sectionally described microbial community healthy human population , adequately describe longitudinal stability . Out 236 adult include HMP , second saliva sample collect small subset ( N=74 ) long interval collection , average 203 day . Community similarity calculate two visit ; saliva sample , Spearman correlation high ( rs=0.8 ) . However , unclear metric community similarly use calculation . When obtain HMP data calculate Spearman correlation specific diversity metric saliva sample , correlation weaker range 0.225 0.524 Shannon Index PD tree , respectively . Other study fewer people , time point , conflict conclusion temporal variation oral microbiome . Given variability , vital establish whether single measurement representative typical composition microbiota specific body site use two time point . In epidemiological study , often impractical , impossible , collect biological sample measurement multiple time participant study period . However , biological sample measurement take , concern single assessment representative typical value . For example , serum 25 ( OH ) D level , use assess individual vitamin D exposure , seasonal fluctuation , study establish single measurement sufficiently reliable represent typical exposure . The correlation sample time also use create accurate power calculation future study . Since previous work adequately address temporal variation oral microbiome , propose : 1 ) establish cohort 40 adult willing provide oral sample approximately every two month one year ; 2 ) process oral sample evaluate presence quantity microbiota use 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence ; 3 ) calculate appropriate reliability measure sample time use intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) &lt; = diversity metric ; 4 ) empirically evaluate efficiency different longitudinal design include two sample collection outcome body mass index ( BMI ) . Because complexity high prevalence human DNA saliva , metagenomic analysis oral sample yet feasible , however , sample obtain study available use future metagenomic analysis technology operationalized . The current study essential establish reliability single measure oral microbiome determine appropriate sample size future cohort study consider effect oral microbiome risk cancer health outcome .</detailed_description>
