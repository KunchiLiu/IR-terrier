	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Voglibose Compared With Acarbose Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call voglibose . Voglibose test treat type 2 diabetes people diabetes inadequately control metformin alone . This study look glycemic control people take voglibose . The study enroll approximately 380 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group : - Metformin maximum tolerate dose voglibose 0.2 mg 2 week follow 0.3 mg 10 week - Metformin maximum tolerate dose acarbose 50 mg 2 week follow 100 mg 10 week . All participant ask take current dose metformin tablet either voglibose acarbose tablet three time day throughout study . This multi-centre trial conduct China . The overall time participate study 20 week participant make 8 visit clinic .</detailed_description>
