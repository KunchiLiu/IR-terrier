	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give gefitinib together anastrozole work compare give gefitinib together fulvestrant treat postmenopausal woman recurrent metastatic breast cancer . Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use anastrozole fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen . Gefitinib ( ZD1839 ) may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes necessary growth . It yet know whether gefitinib effective combine anastrozole fulvestrant treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anastrozole ZD1839 Compared With Fulvestrant ZD1839 Postmenopausal Women w/ Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor activity anastrozole give combination EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 , fulvestrant give combination EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 . II . Evaluate safety anastrozole give combination ZD1839 fulvestrant give combination ZD1839 . III . Evaluate interaction biological characteristic predict response breast cancer treatment anastrozole ZD1839 fulvestrant ZD1839 . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients stratify accord prior hormonal therapy ( yes vs. ) dominant site disease ( soft tissue/lymph node vs. bone vs. visceral ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral anastrozole oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Arm II : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses arm repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
