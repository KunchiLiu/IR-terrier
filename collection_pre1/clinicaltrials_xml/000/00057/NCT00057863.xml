	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate combination paclitaxel oxaliplatin patient metastatic locally recurrent cervical cancer . II . To determine toxicity recovery toxicity patient cervical cancer receive paclitaxel oxaliplatin . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow ever 3 month .</detailed_description>
