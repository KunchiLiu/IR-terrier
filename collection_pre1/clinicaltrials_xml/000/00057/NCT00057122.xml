	<detailed_description>AIDS lead cause death sub-Saharan Africa , TB lead cause death patient AIDS continent . Preventive therapy HIV infect people latent TB infection important reduce risk progression active TB . Although preventive TB therapy generally recommend throughout Western world people HIV , routinely advocate provided patient develop country . Six month self-supervised INH gold standard preventive TB therapy . Newer preventive regimen short duration treatment intermittent dosing could improve compliance permit treatment supervision dose observation . This study compare standard INH regimen two new regimen : rifapentine INH observe weekly 12 week rifampin INH observe twice weekly 12 week . Patients interview identify risk factor TB symptom active TB . A physical examination chest radiograph perform potential patient identify exclude active TB case ( patient refer appropriate treatment infection ) . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize one follow treatment arm : rifapentine/INH 12 week , observed weekly ; rifampin/INH 12 week , observed twice weekly ; INH 6 month , self-supervised ; continuous INH , self-supervised . Patients randomize two self-administered INH arm give 1 month supply INH instruct take one pill day . Patients continuous INH arm take INH continuously end study . Depending patient enrolls study , patient could take INH 1 4 year . Each patient provide education need adhere protocol information potential study drug relate toxicity . All patient give first dose study medication enrollment period . Patients shorter-course , observed regimen give dos clinic supervision study nurse . At study encounter , possible toxicity assess via interview . Patients follow every 6 month completion preventive therapy study close . Outreach worker perform home visit encourage follow-up determine vital status patient miss schedule follow-up visit . Patients evidence active tuberculosis follow-up visit evaluate treated appropriately . Patients offer small incentive fulfilling study requirement . The equivalent $ 5 ( 30 rand ) pay successful entry trial 6 month visit compensation time spend study cover travel expense .</detailed_description>
