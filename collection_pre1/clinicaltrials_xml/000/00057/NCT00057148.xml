	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND / RATIONALE : Postoperative pain often undertreated . Although study demonstrate many patient experience substantial degree unrelieved pain follow operative procedure pain increase incidence serious complication , management discomfort continue suboptimal . Narcotic analgesia mainstay acute postoperative pain management patient , clinician , institutional barrier often limit effectiveness drug treatment . Furthermore , pharmacologic intervention alone may address factor involve conscious experience pain . Massage complementary adjunctive medical technique use thousand year . Yet scant research relate use massage therapy postoperative pain management . Used tandem pharmacologic treatment , massage may potential substantially improve acute pain relief . OBJECTIVE ( S ) : The propose research test hypotheses : 1 ) perceive post-operative pain anxiety decrease time ( 5 day ) rapidly massage group compare focus attention routine care group ; 2 ) perceive post-operative pain anxiety immediately reduced massage group compare focus attention routine care group . ( difference pre/post daily score ) ; 3 ) post-operative complication rate reduce function improve adjuvant use massage compare control group ; 4 ) adjuvant use massage reduces postoperative length stay cost care ; 5 ) patient satisfaction postoperative pain relief enhance adjuvant use massage . METHODS : The study prospective , randomized clinical trial conduct Ann Arbor Indianapolis VA medical center . Patients undergo operative procedure involve either sternotomy abdominal incision least 8 cm length randomly assign one three parallel treatment group : 1 ) routine postoperative care , 2 ) focus attention massage therapist spends dedicated time ( massage give ) patient day ( 20 min ) post-operative day 1 5 ; 3 ) effleurage massage ( 20 min ) perform massage therapist per day post-op day 1 5 . The anticipated sample size 582 patient . Postoperatively patient ask rate intensity pain , well-being , function ( ability cough , deep breathe , sleep activity level ) daily five day ( less discharge prior day five ) . Data collect aspect narcotic analgesia use include name drug , dose , route , time administration . On day six patient complete survey assess satisfaction pain management . Using Department Veterans Affairs National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( NSQIP ) format , data collect postoperative complication first 30 day procedure . Other factor relevant veteran population may affect pain control assess relationship pain management . STATUS : This study begin September 2002 . We currently data analysis phase project plan finish December , 2005 . IMPACT : Although pharmacologic agent ability effectively limit pain , acute postoperative pain often poorly manage analgesic drug alone . This study first large-scale randomized clinical trial massage complementary treatment management acute postoperative pain . This study help determine massage serve useful adjuvant therapy management acute postoperative incisional pain . Results study would inform pain management guideline allow VA scientific community make inform decision regard potential benefit one form CAM ( Complimentary Alternative Medicine ) .</detailed_description>
