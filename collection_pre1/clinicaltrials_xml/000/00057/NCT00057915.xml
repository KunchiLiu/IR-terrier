	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IV Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety feasibility administer 1 2 course vaccination carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D ( CAP 1-6D ) - CMV pp65 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cell patient refractory stage IV CEA-expressing malignancy . - Determine ability regimen induce CAP 1-6D- CMV pp65-specific T cell patient . - Determine antitumor effect regimen , term progression-free survival , patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients undergo leukapheresis collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell dendritic cell ( DC ) generate pulsed carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D ( CAP 1-6D ) CMV pp65 peptide . Patients assign 1 2 vaccination cohort . - Cohort I : Patients receive vaccination CAP 1-6D-pulsed DC CMV pp65 peptide-pulsed DC subcutaneously intradermally every 3 week total 4 vaccination . - Cohort II : Patients receive vaccination cohort I every 3 week total 8 vaccination . For cohort , safe dose vaccine define dose 1 6 patient experience unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12 patient ( 6 per cohort ) accrue study within 24 month .</detailed_description>
