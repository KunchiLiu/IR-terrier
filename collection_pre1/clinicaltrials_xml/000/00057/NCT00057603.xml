	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Treatment-Resistant Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance pharmacological behavioral therapy OCD , substantial number patient fail improve significantly follow year conventional experimental intervention . For patient , stereotactic neurosurgery promising option available . Although procedure relatively side effect majority OCD patient may lead endure benefit , effect brain tissue function irreversible . Bilateral deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) adjustable partially reversible procedure may effective treatment patient OCD . This study determine effectiveness , safety , tolerability DBS patient treatment-refractory OCD . Participants receive DBS treatment 30 month . Obsessive Compulsive scale , depression scale , neuropsychological evaluation , survey use assess participant . Participants monitor 2 year DBS treatment .</detailed_description>
