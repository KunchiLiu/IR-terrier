	<brief_summary>An individual suffering stroke brain injury may lose function one side body ( partial paralysis ) . As individual shift activity favor unaffected side , problem worsens . Constraint induce ( CI ) therapy force individual use neglect arm restraining good arm sling . This study examine effectiveness CI therapy improve arm motion stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Arm Mobility Use After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Profoundly impaired motor dysfunction major consequence stroke . As result , large number 700,000 people America sustain stroke year limitation motor ability compromise quality life . Therapeutic intervention design enhance motor function promote independent use impair upper extremity quite limited . CI movement therapy , `` force use , '' involve motor restriction less effected upper extremity 2 week . Over time , repetitive use effect upper extremity promote many hour day . This treatment produce long lasting improvement extremity use among patient 1 year post-stroke ability initiate extension wrist digit joint . This study determine CI therapy hemiparetic upper extremity patient sub-acute ( 3 9 month post-cerebral infarct ) stroke lead functional improvement enhance quality life measure usual care . Patients randomize treatment usual care group stratify movement capability high low function category . Higher function patient define least 20 degree active wrist extension 10 degree active finger extension digit joint . Lower function patient define least 10 degree wrist extension 10 degree extension thumb joint joint two digit . Patients randomize control group receive treatment one year later permit replication effort finding use therapy patient chronic stroke . The intervention consist make patient use impaired arm constrain movement less impaired limb waking hour 2 week period . The constraint tap splint hand rest prevent limb use enable protective response . A micro-switch within splint permit monitor contact time ( wear ) . Each weekday 2 week , patient come clinic/laboratory specific task training . Evaluations laboratory actual use test make prior treatment , 2 week later , 4 month interval thereafter . Changes psychosocial functioning also measure . Primary outcome include Wolf Motor Function Test Motor Activity Log . Secondary outcome include Stroke Impact Scale , Actual Amount Use Test , accelerometry .</detailed_description>
