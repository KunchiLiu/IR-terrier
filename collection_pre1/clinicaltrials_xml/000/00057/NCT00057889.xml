	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine activity anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody patient metastatic clear cell renal cancer refractory ineligible interleukin-2 . - Determine impact drug T-cell number phenotype patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ongoing partial response may receive additional course therapy . Patients follow 4 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-103 patient accrue study within 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
