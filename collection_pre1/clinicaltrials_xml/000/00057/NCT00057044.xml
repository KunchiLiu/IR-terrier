	<brief_title>From Research Practice - Lipid Management Low HDL-Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The overall purpose project improve clinical outcome veteran ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) implementation evidence-based lipid management , particular focus veteran whose primary lipid abnormality low level HDL-cholesterol ( �good� cholesterol ) . Objectives : The major objective 1. determine whether multifaceted intervention result improve guideline-concordant lipid management patient low HDL-cholesterol ; 2. test relative effectiveness three different reminder system physician prescribe behavior . Methods : The primary care clinic six VISN 13 facility serve intervention site . Within site randomize provider one three reminder system . Control sit consist twelve facility match intervention sit basis facility characteristic . We use modified �pre-post� nested cohort design allow u evaluate effect intervention control secular trend . Target patient identify base follow : 1. IHD diagnosis within past 5 year ; 2. regular follow-up primary care clinic ; 3. recent LDL-cholesterol &lt; 130 mg/dl HDL-cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dl ; 4 . No lipid therapy within prior 6 month . The intervention consist : a. on-site interactive educational workshop provider ; b. reminder ( either patient-directed mailed reminder , computer-chart reminder time visit , automatic consults ) ; c. opinion leader recruitment �activation� . The primary outcome proportion target patient receive guideline-concordant therapy . For objective 1 , outcome compare intervention control sit . For objective 2 , outcome compare three group randomize different reminder system . In addition , provider survey write questionnaire determine reaction educational workshop different reminder system . Status : Intervention data collection complete . Data analysis undertaken , final report soon follow .</detailed_description>
