	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . It yet know whether gemcitabine effective without radiation therapy treat pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial study effectiveness gemcitabine without radiation therapy treat patient locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival progression-free patient locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer treat gemcitabine without radiotherapy . - Compare objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life ( QOL ) patient treat regimen . - Determine effect gemcitabine radiotherapy QOL patient improve objective response rate progression-free overall survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord performance status ( 0 vs. 1 ) weight loss within past 6 month ( less 10 % vs. 10 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I ( Gemcitabine alone ) : - Induction : Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute weekly 6 week follow 1 week rest . - Consolidation : After 1 week rest , patient receive gemcitabine IV weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II ( Gemcitabine radiotherapy ) : - Induction : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30-60 minute weekly 6 week begin day 1 . Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 day week 5.5 week begin day 1 . - Consolidation : Approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30-60 minute weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , week 6 , week 15 ( arm II ) , week 16 ( arm I ) , 9 month . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . Patients receive treatment beyond 3 year follow survival . ACCRUAL : 74 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
