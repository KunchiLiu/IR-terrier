	<detailed_description>Background : In addition medical treatment heart failure ( HF ) , variety non-pharmacological intervention demonstrate benefit patient . Some include system weight monitor medication reminder , exercise program , individually tailored evaluation treatment plan dietitian , social worker , psychologist , nurse case manager . While many approach show increase adherence medication guideline result decrease health care utilization , rely heavily large team specialize health care provider . It remain unknown whether intervention low intensity specialize care use sophisticated automate computer track Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) techniques impact care HF patient . Objectives : The primary hypothesis study Heart Failure Telephone Intervention ( HearT-I ) decrease hospitalization clinic visit veteran population heart failure . Methods : The HearT-I intervention consist three component : 1 ) computer-initiated medication refill clinic appointment reminder ; 2 ) IVR access educational module ; 3 ) weekly computer-initiated phone call series question regard weight symptom . Four hundred eighty-eight HF patient ( NYHA class II-IV ) randomize HearT-I intervention vs. usual care . Upon enrollment , patient complete questionnaire assess HF knowledge , behavior , self-efficacy , perception HF health care , HF relate Quality Life ( Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , KCCQ ) . Both group also receive digital scale , educational material , view educational video HF perform six-minute walk test . We test hypothesis HearT-I intervention decrease health care utilization measure hospitalization unscheduled outpatient visit HF one year . Secondary endpoint include KCCQ score , patient satisfaction , adherence medication , general knowledge heart failure management . Status : Preliminary data analyisis begin .</detailed_description>
