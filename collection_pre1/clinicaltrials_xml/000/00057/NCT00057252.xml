	<brief_summary>This study develop evaluate new technique computer-aided detection diagnosis ( CAD ) medical problem use image diagnostic test compute tomography ( CT ) , ultrasound , nuclear medicine x-ray image . The Food Drug Administration approve CAD technique detect mass calcification mammography lung nodule use chest x-ray . Many application CAD would potentially benefit patient . This study explore additional us CAD . The study use image data , demographic information , medical information medical chart Clinical Center patient test evaluate new CAD application . Such application include detection subcutaneous ( skin ) lesion melanoma patient , bone lesion patient advanced cancer , pulmonary embolus ( blood clot lodge lung artery ) patient know pulmonary embolus , use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Computer-aided Detection Diagnosis From Imaging Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiologic image become complex , utilization radiologic technique accelerate . Radiologists clinician inundated radiologic data . Computer aid detection diagnosis ( CAD ) potential improve patient care increase sensitivity diagnostic test , reduce false positive improve physician efficiency . Computer aid detection diagnosis development many year yet still much work do move bench bedside . The purpose project develop evaluate technique CAD use exist radiologic data available Clinical Center 's Department Diagnostic Radiology . Such technique include limited automated detection melanoma , bone metastasis pulmonary embolus . The outcome study algorithm software accurately detect lesion radiologic study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion availability radiologic examination clinical PACS ( picture archive system ) Clinical Center . Existing Patient scan without target lesion include . Examples target lesion include subcutaneous bone lesion pulmonary emboli , although patient scan disorder depict radiologic study may include appropriate . Patient scan without target lesion may include determine specificity computer aid detection diagnosis algorithm . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : There exclusion criterion .</criteria>
