	<detailed_description>Background : This series two prospective study base Department Veterans Affairs drug treatment guideline pharmacologic management gastroesophageal reflux disease . Our hypothesis novel strategies medical management gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) decrease resource utilization without adversely affect patient quality life . The strategy test project include 1 ) step-down management , whereby patient render asymptomatic proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) treat less expensive medication , 2 ) intermittent therapy , define administration medication recurrence GERD symptom . We choose examine intermittent strategy PPI administration since addition VA guideline require step-down therapy , over-the-counter PPIs administer intermittent therapy become available use patient study period . Objectives : The objective project determine efficacy step-down therapy intermittent therapy patient GERD , impact strategy direct healthcare cost health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . Additionally , examine patient factor predictive non-response management strategy may alternative traditional continuous PPI administration . Methods : Two separate study conduct population patient GERD symptom ( heartburn acid regurgitation ) render asymptomatic PPIs . Both study randomize subject intervention strategy ( Step-down Intermittent therapy ) control group PPIs continue daily basis . Step-down therapy : Step-down subject discontinue PPIs prescribe histamine2-receptor antagonist ( H2RAs ) 2 week , still asymptomatic , H2RAs discontinue . If symptom recur , H2RAs reinitiated , still symptomatic , subject prescribe PPIs dose initially alleviate symptom . Intermittent therapy : Intermittent therapy subject discontinue daily use PPIs prescribe short course PPI ( daily 8 week ) recurrence GERD symptom . The primary efficacy measure proportion subject remain free GERD symptom prescribe therapy ( step-down group : symptom H2RAs GERD medication ; intermittent therapy group : PPIs �2 week discontinuation , &lt; 3 symptom recurrence require PPIs ; control group : GERD symptom PPI ) . Follow conduct 6 month randomization . In addition primary efficacy measure , examine total resource utilization ( pharmacy non-pharmacy ) , HRQOL , potential predictor non-response step-down intermittent therapy ( requirement daily PPI control symptom ) . Logistic regression random-effects model adjust covariates cluster effect . Status : Enrollment follow-up complete . Efficacy measure report . Outcome measure include comparison direct health care cost , health-related quality life , determinants non-response step-down intermittent therapy examine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients GERD symptom treat PPIs . For purpose study , GERD symptom include heartburn acid regurgitation . Symptoms dyspepsia ( epigastric pain , nausea , bloating , early satiety ) may present , may use sole criterion inclusion study . 2 . Asymptomatic ( heartburn acid regurgitation ) PPI therapy . 1 . Complications gastroesophageal reflux disease include esophageal stricture , hemorrhage due erosive esophagitis , Barrett�s esophagus adenocarcinoma esophagus , extraesophageal manifestation reflux disease ( pulmonary laryngeal disease due acid reflux ) . 2 . Concurrent diagnose gastrointestinal disease include gastric duodenal ulcer , ZollingerEllison syndrome hypersecretory disorder , gastric cancer . 3 . Esophagitis secondary nonacid peptic cause : infection ( viral , bacterial , fungal ) , medication cause esophageal erosion . 4 . Inability maintain followup , either due excessive distance VA primary care facility lack telephone service . 5 . Unwillingness participate study .</criteria>
