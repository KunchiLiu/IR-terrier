	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial STI571 Treatment Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate , time tumor progression , overall survival patient metastatic gastric cancer treat STI571 fail one chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . II . To assess toxicity STI571 patient . III . To obtain preliminary data molecular correlate determine clinical efficacy toxicity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk ( good risk [ chemona√Øve ] v poor risk [ 1 prior chemotherapy regimen ] ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-41 patient accrue study within 1-1.5 year .</detailed_description>
