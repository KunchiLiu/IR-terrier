	<brief_summary>This study look safety effectiveness experimental medication contain antibody ( Omr-IgG-am™ ) people West Nile Virus ( WNV ) already brain and/or spinal cord inflammation high risk develop problem weak immune system . WNV cause problem headache , fever , muscle weakness , coma , death . Study investigator believe people able fight infection well may risk develop neurologic problem ( brain , spinal cord , nerve , muscle ) get WNV infection . Up 110 subject , 18 year old , participate 3 month receive either Omr-IgG-am™ , Polygam® S/D , placebo give small tube place blood vessel arm . Hospitalization , 5 additional study visit , blood sample collection , MRI picture brain spinal cord , neurological , muscle , heart activity test also require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IVIG - West Nile Encephalitis : Safety Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass whether Omr-IgG-am™ , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) contain antibody specific West Nile virus ( WNV ) , safe well-tolerated patient suspect laboratory diagnose WNV disease . An initial estimation efficacy also make . This Phase I/II study enroll hospitalize adult presumptive diagnosis West Nile encephalitis and/or myelitis positive laboratory test diagnosis WNV infection high risk progress severe neurologic disease base age immunosuppression . Patients randomize block five receive either Omr-IgGam ™ , Polygam® S/D ( IVIG contain minimal anti-WNV antibody ) normal saline ratio 3:1:1 . Patients investigator blind treatment assignment . Patients receive single intravenous dose study medication one two placebo . The study participant receive 0.5 grams/kg Omr-IgG-am™ Polygam® S/D comparable volume normal saline . All patient follow safety , natural history endpoint , efficacy . A subset patient pharmacokinetic measurement specific anti-WNV antibody assess follow treatment . The primary endpoint safety tolerability follow Omr-IgG-am™ administration . Secondary endpoint include pharmacokinetics specific anti-WNV antibody , mortality confirm WNV positive patient , combination mortality functional status three month confirm WNV-infected patient patient intention treat . This combined endpoint measure use four standardized measure cognitive functional status : Barthel Index ; Modified Rankin Scale ; Glasgow Outcome Score ; Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination . A comparison outcomes make group receive Omr-IgG-am™ versus receive either placebo , two placebo group . Other secondary endpoint include proportion patient group return pre-morbid baseline subject 's improvement 3 month compare subject 's bad ( previous ) evaluation . Natural history endpoint also assess . They include duration intensive care unit hospital stay , development persistence WNV-specific IgG IgM antibody , combine functional score mortality 3 month group encephalitis and/or myelitis baseline versus group positive WNV test , outcomes patient treat late coma correlation outcome time-to-treatment follow symptom onset .</detailed_description>
