	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sulindac together tamoxifen work treat patient desmoid tumor . Sulindac may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes necessary cancer cell growth . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen may fight cancer block use estrogen . Combining sulindac tamoxifen may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulindac Tamoxifen Treating Patients With Desmoid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient desmoid tumor recurrent amenable standard therapy treat sulindac tamoxifen . II . Determine safety efficacy regimen , term event-free survival , patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tumor response rate patient treat regimen . II . Correlate change Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) signal feature tumor clinical outcome patient treat regimen . III . Correlate pathological study cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) estrogen/progesterone receptor expression tumor clinical outcome patient treat regimen . IV . Collect information clinical factor make tumor unresectable diagnosis resectable four course study treatment . V. Determine whether short-term endocrine toxicity associate treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sulindac oral tamoxifen twice daily 12 month ( four 3-month course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 1 additional month treatment beyond documentation CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
