	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give GTI-2040 together capecitabine work treat patient metastatic breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . GTI-2040 may help capecitabine kill tumor cell make sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GTI-2040 Capecitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate response duration combination therapy GTI-2040 capecitabine treatment metastatic breast cancer . II . To safely evaluate toxicity drug combination schedule patient population first use low dose follow escalation . III . To determine pharmacokinetic data plasma level GTI-2040 patient population . IV . To investigate potential molecular marker ribonucleotide reductase inhibition fluoropyrimidine metabolism patient population treat combination GTI-2040 capecitabine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously day 1-15 first course day 1-14 subsequent course . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 2-15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
