	<brief_summary>This study evaluate usefulness FDG-PET scan distinguish autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) lymphoma . Lymphoma cancer lymph system . ALPS condition involve persistent enlargement lymph gland , spleen , liver , range problem relate blood cell count abnormal immune activity , immune system attack healthy tissue . People ALPS particularly abnormal Fas gene also increase risk develop lymphoma . The Fas gene code protein cause immune cell call lymphocytes die longer need . FDG-PET new nuclear image test effective detecting lymphoma . It important identify cancer quickly possible , since curable catch early . Since ALPS lymphoma share several common characteristic , reliable , non-invasive method distinguish two , FDG-PET might offer , crucial . FDG-PET us radioactive sugar molecule produce image show metabolic activity tissue . Because cancer cell grow divide rapidly normal cell , metabolize sugar fuel . This increased activity identifies cancer FDG-PET scanning . For procedure , subject inject sugar molecule lie doughnut-shaped machine ( PET camera ) imaging . Adults child 10 year old old ALPS , without lymphoma , may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Participants FDG-PET scan DEXA scan . The DEXA scan measure fat non-fat tissue use help interpret FDG-PET result . For test , subject lie table fast X-ray take head toe . Patients develop sign symptom suggest development recurrence lymphoma ( enlargement lymph gland , unexplained fever weight loss , abnormal scan ) may undergo tissue biopsy . For procedure , small piece lymph tissue surgically remove examination microscope . In addition , patient develop symptom may ask undergo additional FDG-PET scan two year patient without lymphoma , many need patient lymphoma evaluate response treatment guide future therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Evaluate Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS ) ALPS-associated Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS ) inherit disorder associate defective lymphocyte apoptosis , clinically characterize prominent non-malignant lymphadenopathy , hepatosplenomegaly overt autoimmune disease hemolytic anemia , autoimmune thrombocytopenia neutropenia . Additionally , ALPS patient significantly increase risk develop non-Hodgkin 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The diagnosis lymphoma particularly troublesome ALPS many ALPS manifestation overlap clinical feature suggestive lymphoma . Therefore , individual ALPS may undergo repeated biopsy course disease . Finding non-invasive test predictably discriminate benign malignant lymphadenopathy ALPS , help discern whether invasive lymph node biopsy necessary , would desirable . Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) increasingly use non-invasive imaging technique stag monitor therapeutic response patient lymphoma . This technique might able assist u distinguish whether enlargement lymph node due ALPS versus ALPS associate lymphoma . However , FDG-PET study patient ALPS . This study first explore whether ALPS patient lymphadenopathy show FDG uptake . If uptake show , study obtain initial quantitative data compare FDG uptake ALPS patient lymphadenopathy , ALPS patient associated lymphoma . The ultimate goal assess FDG-PET reliable non-invasive method differentiate lymphadenopathy due ALPS versus ALPS associate lymphoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ALPS Patients without Lymphoma : Participants must : 1 . Fulfill current criterion diagnosis ALPS follow : 1 . Documented chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly , 2 . Greater equal 1.5 percent TCR alpha/beta+ CD4 CD8 T cell peripheral blood . 2 . Be enrol ALPS Natural History Protocol 93I0063 . 3 . Have clinical evidence lymphadenopathy define multiple palpable lymph node least 1cm radiographic evidence lymphadenopathy define multiple lymph node least 1 cm CT scan , evaluation NIH Clinical Center . 4 . Be 8 year age old . The study target child 8 year age old adult young child may able stay still duration FDGPET scan procedure . Sedation use child study , except clinically indicate procedure FDGPET scan child lymphoma . 5 . Be due routine [ every 2 year ] CT scan protocol 93I0063 , need CT scan medical reason [ e.g . marked change adenopathy ] . CT scan within 3 month prior FDGPET scan necessary locate node appropriate FDGPET analysis . ALPS Patients Lymphoma : Patients must : 1 . Fulfill current criterion diagnosis ALPS follow : 1 . Documented chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly . 2 . Greater equal 1.5 percent TCR alpha/beta + CD4 CD8 T cell peripheral blood . 2 . Be enrol ALPS Natural History Protocol 93I0063 . 3 . Have histologically prove diagnosis lymphoma , confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI ( Anatomic Pathology Dept , CC ) whether yet treat . Lymphomas classify accord WHO classification , use appropriate immunophenotypic histological feature . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patient exclude follow present : 2 . Concurrent infection inflammatory disease ( e.g. , sarcoidosis ) , often show increase FDG uptake PET could interfere interpretation study result . 3 . Active neoplasia lymphoma . 4 . History chemotherapy radiation treat malignancy within 5 year prior study procedure , except lymphoma . 5 . Hyperglycermia ( regardless etiology ) determine fast glucose great 130 mg/dl . Individual underlie defect glucose metabolism may exhibit abnormal metabolism FDG . 6 . Weights excess 136 kg , exceed weight limit scanner table . 7 . Pregnancy breastfeeding . For woman childbearing potential , negative urine serum pregnancy test require within 24 hour prior FDGPET scan .</criteria>
