	<brief_summary>This study examine effect iron buildup hearts patient hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) , genetic disease cause body accumulate excess amount iron . The excess iron damage heart , liver , pancreas , skin , joint . Generally , early treatment phlebotomy ( periodic removal unit blood ) , case chelation ( use drug remove iron body ) slow organ damage HH patient . This study try elucidate effect iron buildup heart determine phlebotomy chelation help keep heart healthy . Patients HH healthy volunteer 21 year age old may eligible study . ( Normal volunteer provide normal value heart function use verify abnormality detect HH patient . ) Patients must gene abnormality Hfe gene Cys282Try homozygote . They may may receive treatment HH must heart symptom serious organ damage due HH . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , Holter EKG ( 24-hour EKG monitoring , see description ) , chest x-ray . Participants undergo follow test procedures 2 5 day : - Exercise test : The participant exercise treadmill wear mouthpiece , use measure much oxygen use . Electrodes place chest arm monitor heartbeat test . - Echocardiography : This ultrasound test use sound wave take picture . A small probe hold chest allow technician take picture heart ass function . A drug call Optison may inject arm vein need enhance ultrasound image . - Exercise stress echocardiography : The participant exercise stationary bike heart function measure echocardiogram , EKG , blood pressure cuff . - 24-hour Holter EKG : The participant wear small machine record heart rhythm continuously 24 hour . The recorder connect cable electrode place chest . - Magnetic resonance imaging : This test use magnetic field radio wave obtain detailed image heart blood vessel . The participant lie flat table slide inside scanner , large hollow tube . All test perform normal volunteer patient receive standard treatment HH . Untreated patient repeat test 6 month begin phlebotomy chelation . Additional time point test might add evaluation need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) common hereditary metabolic abnormality among Caucasians . Homozygosity Cys282Tyr mutation , common know mutation predisposition iron overload , occurs estimate frequency 8 per 1000 Caucasians . Hemochromatosis advance stage associate severe cardiac complication include congestive heart failure , premature coronary artery disease , cardiac arrhythmia . The clinical manifestation HH due increase iron absorption abnormal iron cycle excessive iron deposition various organ . Mutations Hfe gene chromosome 6 recently identify . Although pathophysiology remain incompletely understood , homozygote mutation Cys282Tyr present 84 100 % clinically confirm HH case . This discovery permit early diagnosis disease could use screen identify asymptomatic case . Therefore , NHLBI January 2000 launch 30 million dollar project name HEIRS ( HEmochromatosis IRon overload Study ) screen 1,000,000 adult HH , recently complete enrollment . &lt; TAB &gt; Increased leave ventricular wall thickness mass find early cardiac manifestation HH appear onset contractile dysfunction . Interestingly , report also indicate functional abnormality heart see predominantly asymptomatic HH patient group . Such abnormality diastolic function detect Doppler echocardiography . Observations support theory asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction detectable non-invasive cardiac imaging patient HH . &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; Although pathophysiology cardiac dysfunction HH well characterize , speculate enhanced production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) may responsible tissue damage . Therefore , biochemical and/or genetic marker oxidant stress might helpful determine whether mechanism involve produce cardiac dysfunction . In protocol , propose retrospective pilot study small-sized nested prospective study cardiac function patient HH . The intention utilize obtain result design large definitive study result warrant . The following hypothesis test : Cardiac abnormality 1 ) diagnose conventional non-invasive cardiac image HH patient New York Heart Association Functional Class I ( asymptomatic ) , 2 ) limit patient ' exercise capacity , 3 ) associate elevate oxidant stress level , 4 ) improve phlebotomy efficacy correlate reduction oxidant stress .</detailed_description>
