	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy exercise alone combine modified diet home-based intervention prevent increase body fat adjuvant chemotherapy woman stage I , II , IIIA breast cancer . - Compare efficacy regimen , term reduce gain adipose tissue , reduce loss absolute amount lean body tissue , reduce gain weight , influence level biomarkers associate risk breast cancer and/or comorbid condition , improve self-efficacy exercise behavior , reduce depression , improve quality life patient . - Compare adherence rate regimens patient . - Determine association study condition adherence change endpoints patient treat regimen . - Determine feasibility conduct home-based exercise diet study use infrastructure cooperative group . OUTLINE : This pilot , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord body mass index ( 25 kg/m^2 v 25 kg/m^2 ) , race ( white v non-white ) , prior exercise history ( vigorous exercise least 30 minute , 3 time week prior diagnosis ) ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I ( calcium-rich diet ) : Patients receive material counsel promote diet contain ample amount calcium ( 1,200-2,500 mg/day ) . - Arm II ( calcium-rich diet exercise ) : Patients receive material counsel arm I instruction material promote strength training endurance exercise . - Arm III ( calcium-rich , high fruit vegetable , low-fat diet exercise ) : Patients receive material counsel arm II material counsel consume least 5 serving vegetable fruit per day limit fat intake le 20 % total calorie . In arm , patient continue regimens 6 month . Measurements body composition , weight , waist circumference , serum level insulin , insulin-like growth factor , sex hormone-binding globulin , total cholesterol obtain baseline 6 month . Quality life , depression , diet composition , physical activity assess baseline 3 6 month . Patients follow 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 90 patient ( 30 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 16 month .</detailed_description>
