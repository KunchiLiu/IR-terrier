	<brief_title>Lycopene Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine percentage patient asymptomatic androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer elevate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level sustain decline PSA 4 month treatment lycopene . Secondary - Determine response duration PSA decline patient treat therapy . - Determine time first consistent PSA increase patient treated therapy . - Determine whether decline PSA coincide evidence disease regression physical examination radiographic assessment patient treat therapy . - Determine adverse event profile therapy patient . - Determine factor motivate prostate cancer patient enroll nutritional-based therapy study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lycopene twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day least 4 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
