	<brief_title>Study PI-88 Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PI-88 investigational drug work novel mechanism may reduce rate growth tumor , also spread cancer cell around body . It also effect upon blood clotting . The purpose study ass PI-88 benefit patient advance melanoma , well gain information safety drug . All patient study receive study drug dose level . The dose PI-88 give base dose find best phase I portion study . The drug inject subcutaneously ( skin ) daily 4 day every week . Patients treat PI-88 6 month , drug well tolerated effective , patient may offer treatment drug .</detailed_description>
