	<brief_title>S0330 Erlotinib Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response ( confirm , complete , partial ) patient unresectable metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor treat erlotinib . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . - Correlate , preliminarily , indicator epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) function ( e.g. , expression , phosphorylation , marker signal transduction downstream EGFR ) response progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine feasibility accrue patient cooperative group set . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least confirmed partial response become resectable undergo surgical resection ( without radiotherapy ) receive 2 additional course erlotinib . Patients respond disease become resectable continue erlotinib . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course erlotinib beyond CR . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
