	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth .

	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy bortezomib , term response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) , patient recurrent refractory extensive stage small cell lung cancer previously treat platinum-based therapy . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Correlate select molecular marker outcomes patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord platinum-sensitivity status ( platinum sensitive [ temporarily close accrual 8/1/04 ] v platinum refractory [ temporarily close accrual 6/1/04 ] ) . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-80 patient ( 20-40 per stratum ) accrue study within 0.5-1 year .</detailed_description>
