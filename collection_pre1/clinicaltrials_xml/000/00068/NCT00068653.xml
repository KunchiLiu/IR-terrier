	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Celecoxib may slow growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Combining gefitinib celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine gefitinib celecoxib treat patient non-small cell lung cancer refractory platinum-based chemotherapy ( cisplatin carboplatin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Celecoxib Treating Patients With Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient platinum-refractory non-small cell lung cancer treat gefitinib celecoxib . Secondary - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral gefitinib daily oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-27 patient accrue study within 22 month .</detailed_description>
