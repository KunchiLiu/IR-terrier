	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy topotecan use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Combining topotecan bortezomib may kill tumor cell . This phase I trial study side effect best dose topotecan bortezomib give together treat patient metastatic unresectable cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Finding Phase I Trial Combination Topotecan PS-341 , Novel Proteasome Inhibitor , Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety combination PS-341 topotecan . II . Determine dose limit toxicity maximum tolerate dose well recommended phase II dose combination . III . Assess pharmacokinetics topotecan alone combination PS-341 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate objective response rate combination PS-341 topotecan deliver day 1-5 every three week define RECIST criterion . II . Assess pharmacodynamics topo I level . III . Determine expression DNA repair enzyme XRCC1 tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos topotecan bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
