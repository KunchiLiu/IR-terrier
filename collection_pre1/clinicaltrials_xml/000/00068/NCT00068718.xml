	<brief_title>Donor Lymphocyte Infusion Treating Patients With Persistent , Relapsed , Progressing Cancer After Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) adoptive immunotherapy persistent relapse malignant disease patient related unrelated nonmyeloablative transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine disease response , progression free overall survival , chimerism , grade graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , infection . OUTLINE : Patients undergo unirradiated DLI 15-30 minute day 0 . Patients undergo restaging day 28 may undergo second DLI least 4 week significant GVHD develop disease status worsen least 8 week disease status unchanged persistent donor T-cells document . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
