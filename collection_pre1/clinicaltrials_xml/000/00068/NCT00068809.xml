	<brief_title>4-Day-A-Week Treatment Plan HIV Infected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infect adolescent require therapy face lifetime antiretroviral treatment . Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) associate short- long-term complication , concern mount cumulative effect complication adolescent enter third fourth decade life . A management strategy suppress virus decrease overall drug exposure need . In addition , schedule requirement antiretroviral therapy interfere socialization independence adolescent must accomplish gain skill successful adult life . Not surprisingly , nonadherence prescribed medication common teen . This multicenter , prospective , proof concept trial evaluate Short Cycle Therapy ( SCT ) adolescent sustain viral suppression least 6 month . While maintenance viral load suppression view either safety efficacy endpoint , trial construct assessment safety . Eligible participant standard HAART therapy consist Protease Inhibitor switch SCT therapy ( 4 day treatment , 3 day treatment week ) entry . Participants see clinic every Monday first month , monthly 24-weeks every two month end 48-week study period . Plasma HIV RNA level CD4 cell count perform every visit . Medication adherence self-report conduct every 2 week week 24 every 4-weeks thereafter week 48 . Fasting serum triglyceride cholesterol measure baseline , week 24 end study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Twelve 24 year age , regardless mode transmission . Subjects must stable HAART regimen contain least one PI two NRTIs NNRTI least 3 month willing continue PIcontaining regimen throughout study period . Acceptable viral load define least three plasma HIV1 RNA level ≤ 400 copies/ml within 12 month study entry plasma HIV1 RNA level &gt; 400 copies/ml within 6 month entry date employ clinically available viral load assay . Pre entry plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 200 copies/ml ultrasensitive assay ( Roche 1.5 ) within 30 day study entry , perform assign PACTG core virology laboratory . CD4+ T cell count &gt; 350 cells/microL within 30 day study entry . Ability subject parent legal guardian ( appropriate ) give write informed assent/consent permission respectively . Subjects currently enrol ATN 015 Version 2.0 eligible follow : Subjects randomize standard continuous therapy ( control arm ) . These subject eligible enrol ATN 015 Version 3.0 new subject meet entry criterion ATN Version 3.0 . If eligible , follow full 48 week . Subjects randomize short cycle therapy ( experimental arm ) . These subject eligible rollover ATN 015 Version 3.0 continue SCT meet study endpoint . These subject may viral load value meet study endpoint ( viz . confirm viral load &gt; 400 copies/ml ) continue intensive monitoring complete 24 week enter less intensive 24 week phase study . Female subject must nonpregnant willing remain effective contraception duration study . ( Examples acceptable form birth control include limited form hormonal contraception along barrier method , double barrier method , tubal ligation , abstinence choice subject . ) On HAART regimen contain NNRTI HAART regimen Abacavir ( include Trizivir® ) . On prohibited medication time screen . Subjects underlie reactive airway disease either inhaled brief , intermittent systemic steroid consider status must review protocol chair vice chair standard ATN protocol query process . Active HIVrelated opportunistic infection malignancy time screen . ( Female subject treat adequately cervical dysplasia CIN eligible study unless systemic immunosuppressive therapy ) . Current treatment know suspect active serious bacterial infection . Pregnancy . Any laboratory abnormality Grade 3 great define Appendix III time screen . Subjects receive pharmacological treatment elevate cholesterol triglyceride level . If candidate fail eligibility criterion ( inclusion exclusion ) , may screen eligibility period 30 day .</criteria>
