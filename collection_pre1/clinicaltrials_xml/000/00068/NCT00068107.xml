	<brief_summary>This study determine safety effectiveness increase Replagal infusion certain patient Fabry disease . Replagal genetically engineer form Alpha-galactosidase A , enzyme normally break fatty substance call globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) . In patient Fabry disease , Alpha-galactosidase A function properly , therefore , Gb3 build , cause problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . Patients Fabry disease participate NIH protocol 00-N-0185 02-N-0220 may eligible study . This include patient currently take Replagal whose kidney function continue worsen , patient certain test result much improve Replagal infusion . Participants receive Replagal infusion ( 0.2 mg/kg body weight ) vein week ( oppose previous dosage every 2 week ) 2 year . The first infusion , others , give NIH Clinical Center , administer patient 's local doctor . Vital sign measure , immediately , 1 hour infusion . Baseline evaluations do inpatient basis NIH Clinical Center 1-week period first Replagal infusion 6-month interval study . Tests include check vital sign ( temperature , respiratory rate , pulse rate , blood pressure ) ; weight measurement ; physical neurological examination ; routine blood urine test ; 24-hour urine collection ; electrocardiogram ; review treatment side effect . In addition , follow test do : - Quantitative sensory testing : This non-invasive test measure ability sense warm , cold vibration hand foot . - QSART : This test measure amount sweat particular area skin sweat enough . A small amount medicine call acetylcholine put skin make enter skin use small electric current . - Doppler skin blood flow : This test measure blood flow blood vessel skin . A machine take picture blood flow skin forearm use laser beam . Pictures take application medicine cause blood vessel dilate . Acetylcholine use one forearm nitroprusside use . The medication make enter skin use small el ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dosing Study Replagal Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The goal study determine whether high frequency dose enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) either significantly slow decline renal function continuously sustain normalization objective function patient Fabry disease receive intravenous infusion Replagal ( agalsidase alfa ) dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight administer every 2 week . Study Population : Patients Fabry disease currently clinical research protocols 00-N-0185/TKT011 02-N-0220/TKT015 demonstrate progressive decline calculate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) least 5 ml/min/year ERT consistently show transient improvement objective function ( sweat ) day post-infusion . Design : This open label study compare one dose regimen previous less intensive dose regimen . Patients receive dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight every week . Outcome Measures : The main outcome measure change mean linear rate decline estimate calculated GFR . The main hypothesis frequent administration previous dose Replagal significantly reduce mean slope decline calculate glomerular filtration rate GFR compare currently observe slope dose 0.2 mg/kg administer every 2 week . At 2-year time point , dose increase 0.4 mg/kg patient whose GFR continue significantly decline . Secondary outcome measure globotriaosylceramide ( Gb ( 3 ) ) plasma urinary sediment , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , quantitative sensory test . Study duration 2 year possibility additional one-year extension .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients Fabry disease participate 00N0185/TKT011 02N0220/TKT015 may eligible . No Fabry patient eligible . Patients lose GFR rate great 5 ml/min/year despite ERT agalsidase alfa great equal 2.5 year 00N0185/TKT/003/006/011 Study ERT great equal 1.0 year 02N0220/TKT/010/015 Study . Patients least twice demonstrated significant improvement normalization sweat function ( QSART thermoregulatory sweat test ) reduction serum creatinine least 10 % return preinfusion state subsequent biweekly enzyme infusion . Patients freely agree participate study understand nature , risk benefit study give write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients Fabry disease , already part 00N0185/TKT011 02N0220/TKT015 . Patients protocols stable serum creatinine ( less rise serum creatinine stipulate inclusion criterion ) , show objective evidence incomplete clinical response biweekly infusion ( e.g . sweat function ) . Patients begin dialysis receive renal transplant . Patients tolerate study procedure unable unwilling travel study center require protocol . Patients intercurrent medical condition would render unsuitable mthe study e.g . HIV , diabetes . The reason pathology condition significant confounders assess effect experimental therapy adverse event . Patients opinion investigator ( whatever reason ) think unsuitable study .</criteria>
