	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness three adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens treat patient receive radiation therapy fluorouracil either surgery stage II stage III rectal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . It yet know adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat patient receive radiation therapy fluorouracil either surgery rectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Rectal Cancer Who Are Receiving Radiation Therapy Fluorouracil Before After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient treat irinotecan , 5-FU leucovorin versus treat oxaliplatin , leucovorin 5-FU versus treat leucovorin 5-FU patient stage II III rectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively assess rectal function use Patient Bowel Function/Uniscale questionnaire FACT Diarrhea Subscale patient treat adjuvant program pelvic radiation therapy chemotherapy . II . To correlate TS , DPD TP expression ( key target 5-FU ) ; retention chromosome 18q allele MSI TGFÎ²1RII mutation ( marker 5-FU efficacy ) ; ERCC1 , ERCC2 XPF expression ( participant repair adduct oxaliplatin ) ; p53 gene mutation tumor tissue specimens treatment efficacy . III . To correlate tumor molecular prognostic marker ( chromosome 18q allelic loss MSI ) survival . IV . To determine physician preference regard radiation-chemotherapy sequence Intergroup . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , chemotherapy/radiotherapy sequence ( preoperative v postoperative ) , risk group ( high risk [ T3 , N+ , M0 T4 , N , M0 ] vs low risk [ T1-2 , N+ , M0 T3 , N0 , M0 ] ) . Patients treat 1 2 group accord physician preference randomize 1 3 treatment arm . GROUP I ( preoperative chemoradiotherapy additional adjuvant chemotherapy ) : Preoperative chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive 1 3 treatment regimen , determine treat physician . REGIMEN A ( radiotherapy fluorouracil ) : Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5 1/2 week ( total 28 fraction ) . Patients also receive concurrent fluorouracil IV continuously 7 day week 5 1/2 week . REGIMEN B ( radiotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium ) : Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy regimen A . Patients also receive concurrent fluorouracil IV leucovorin calcium IV continuously 4 day week 1 5 . REGIMEN C ( radiotherapy capecitabine ) * : Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy regimen A . Patients also receive concurrent oral capecitabine twice daily 5 1/2 week . NOTE : *Regimen C allow patient enrol protocol NSABP-R-04 . Surgery : Within 21-56 day completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgical resection . Additional adjuvant chemotherapy : Within 21-56 day complete surgical resection , patient randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour follow immediately fluorourcil IV bolus day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 8 course . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour follow immediately fluorourcil IV bolus day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 8 course . ARM III : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 3 course . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP 2 ( postoperative chemoradiotherapy additional adjuvant chemotherapy ) : Within 21-56 day complete surgical resection , patient randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive irinotecan , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil group 1 , arm I 4 course . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil group 1 , arm II 4 course . ARM III : Patients receive leucovorin calcium fluorouracil group 1 , arm III 1 course . Within 4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo concurrent pelvic chemoradiotherapy describe group 1 preoperative chemoradiotherapy Regimen A , B , C , follow 4-6 week later 4 additional course adjuvant chemotherapy arm I II 2 additional course adjuvant chemotherapy arm III . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
