	<brief_title>S0331 : Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Merkel Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility Southwest Oncology Group Phase II trial oral STI-571/imatinib ( Gleevec ) administer patient metastatic unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma . II . To evaluate objective response probability ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial response ) oral STI-571/imatinib ( Gleevec ) administer patient metastatic unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma . III . To assess qualitative quantitative toxicity oral STI-581/imatinib ( Gleevec ) administer patient metastatic unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma . IV . To analyze tumor sample activate mutation STI-571/imatinib-sensitive kinase ( KIT , PDGFRA , PDGFRB ) denature HPLC direct DNA sequencing . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , symptomatic deterioration . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
