	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor blood , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . Objective : This study collect white blood cell normal volunteer white blood cell and/or tumor cell , patient screen eligible NCI Surgery Branch treatment protocol . The cell collect normal volunteer use growth factor cell period laboratory growth . The cell and/or tumor patient use make cell treatment product . Eligibility : Patients must eligible NCI Surgery Branch Treatment Protocol Normal Volunteers must meet criterion blood donation Design Both patient normal Volunteers undergo apheresis . Patients undergo test require treatment protocol . There require follow normal volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There numerous clinical trial underway Surgery Branch , NCI patient administer autologous lymphocyte anti-tumor activity generate either peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) . All adoptive cell therapy protocols require certain cell criterion evaluate meet prior enrollment . OBJECTIVES : - To obtain autologous blood , stem cell and/or tumor tissue patient currently cancer laboratory analysis ex vivo generation autologous anti-tumor lymphocyte future enrollment Surgery Branch adoptive cell therapy clinical trial , research purpose . - To obtain allogeneic PBMC via apheresis , blood sample healthy volunteer use generate anti-tumor patient lymphocytes ex vivo , research . - To obtain PBMC via apheresis , blood sample , skin biopsy subject spontaneous vitiligo research purpose . ( With amendment-X , long enrol cohort ) - To conduct genomic , proteomic immunologic research study sample collect . ELIGIBILITY : Patients cancer must 16 year age old meet laboratory safety test infection include cell therapy treatment trial . Healthy volunteer must meet safety evaluation criterion establish FDA donation blood product include HIV , HCV , HTLV , CMV , HBsAg , HBc , Trypanosoma cruzi , syphilis , West Nile Virus . They must also meet strict behavioral medical history requirement . DESIGN : Once cancer patient determine potential candidate one Surgery Branch clinical trial , undergo apheresis and/or tumor resection future treatment and/or research purpose . In addition , protocol allow pheresis healthy volunteer allogeneic PBMC use generate autologous antitumor lymphocytes laboratory , research purpose . No treatment , investigational standard therapy , administer protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH A CURRENT DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must form cancer currently study adoptive cell therapy Surgery Branch . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative understand sign Informed Consent Document . Patients must great equal 16 year age . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . Seronegative HIV ( The experimental treatment evaluate depend upon intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . Seronegative hepatitis B surface antigen seronegative antibody hepatitis C. If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . If Surgery require obtain TIL cell acquisition , expect procedure must associate minimal morbidity minimal hospitalization . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , major medial illness cardiovascular , respiratory , immune system . Patients give proper inform consent adoptive cell experimental therapy due active psychiatric disorder inability understand nature propose therapy attendant risk . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR NORMAL DONORS : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal donor must great equal 18 year age . Seronegative HBsAg , AntiHBc , AntiHCV , AntiHIV1/2 , HIV 1/HCV/HBV NAT , antiHTLV1/2 , RPR , T. cruzi , West Nile Virus NAT Normal donor must meet strict behavioral medical history requirement EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Has babesiosis . Is risk CreutzfeldJakob Disease . Is steroid therapy medication receive vaccination might interfere cell preparation per Principal Investigator discretion . Has ongoing illness would cause harm volunteer apheresis procedure determine Principal Investigator . Has yellow jaundice , liver disease , hepatitis since age 11 Has uncontrolled diabetes Has hematologic malignancy bleed abnormality Has receive type organ transplant past 12 month . Has undergone xenotransplantaion time . Has receive dura mater graft . If female , pregnant last six week Has body pierce tatoos within past year Has spend time outside United States restrict country Has participate highrisk activity</criteria>
