	<brief_title>Using fMRI Evaluate Instructional Programs Children With Developmental Dyslexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reading uniquely human endeavor failure develop skill lead serious educational emotional consequence . Reading slowly less accurately , case developmental dyslexia , occur 5 % 15 % individual United States . Developmental dyslexia significantly interfere academic achievement activity daily live require reading skill . Although dyslexia consider reading disorder , dyslexia 's clinical sign vary include deficit sensory domain , abnormal phonological awareness , problem relate linguistic skill . Phonological awareness train visual perceptual training improve reading ability child dyslexia . Recent functional imaging study sensory language processing dyslexia demonstrate involvement posterior temporal inferior parietal cortical system brain . However , brain area change result dyslexia treatment determine . This study investigate neurophysiologic change treatment 11- 14-year-old child immerse Lindamood-Bell training utilize either phonological ( LiPS ) visual ( Seeing Stars ) strategies . These training program successful behavioral outcome , neurophysiologic change evaluate . The study determine whether behavioral change read skill result physiological difference brain identifiable functional brain image whether initial physiological observation indicative degree success intervention . Participant randomize receive either Lindamood-Bell training , math intervention ( active control ) , intervention ( passive control ) . The intervention last 6 week ; child pre- post-intervention behavioral test fMRI scan .</detailed_description>
