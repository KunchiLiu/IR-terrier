	<brief_title>3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy In Treating Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Lumpectomy Axillary Node Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine technical feasibility reproducibility three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy confine region lumpectomy cavity woman stage I II breast cancer . - Determine cosmetic result patient treated regimen . - Determine complication rate patient treated regimen . - Determine local control rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily 5 day begin within 8 week surgery . Patients follow 6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-46 patient accrue study within 6.3 15.3 month .</detailed_description>
