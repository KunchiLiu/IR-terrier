	<brief_summary>This project clinical project Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) proposal design understanding urinary tract infection ( UTI ) woman . Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) occur estimate 7-11 million woman year , annual cost care woman think approach $ 1.6 billion . Approximately 20-30 % woman suffer frequent recurrent infection . UTIs young woman result substantial symptom , time lose work , medical cost . An improved understanding mechanism underlie UTIs could result new approach prevention reduce number woman infection amount antibiotic use . In project seek good understanding cause UTI . Most expert believe vaginal colonization UTI-causing bacteria rectal flora precedes colonization urethra ( tube bladder urination ) bladder subsequent UTI , relationships event establish . Moreover , recent information study mice strongly suggest persistent bladder infection follow initial bladder infection . In project , prospectively follow large group woman recurrent UTI determine : 1 ) relationship time vaginal colonization UTI-causing bacteriuria , asymptomatic bacteriuria ( bacteria bladder without UTI symptom ) symptomatic UTI , 2 ) presence persistent bacteria bladder follow symptomatic UTI entry study whether bacteria relate later UTIs cause bacteria cause UTI entry study . We thus able determine relative importance vaginal colonization vs. persistent infection bladder origin bacteria cause recurrent UTI . UTI-causing bacteria culture woman symptomatic UTI asymptomatic bacteriuria undergo study Dr. Scott Hultgren 's group Washington University Project 1 identify unique gene may help u understand bacteria cause symptom others . The effect bacteria cause UTI woman host response also determine study Dr. Jeff Gordon 's laboratory Washington University Project 3 . A good understanding molecular epidemiologic basis UTI critical develop best possible prevention management strategy .</brief_summary>
