	<detailed_description>Smallpox serious disease fatal 1 3 patient . Smallpox exist naturally world , case smallpox world since 1980 . Smallpox prevent use effective vaccine call vaccinia virus ( Dryvax ) . After world consider free smallpox , production smallpox vaccine discontinue , due recent concern smallpox virus may use mean bioterrorism , production smallpox vaccine may restart . Although Dryvax known effective vaccine prevention smallpox , little known ability body develop defenses prevent disease ( immune response ) vaccine .
