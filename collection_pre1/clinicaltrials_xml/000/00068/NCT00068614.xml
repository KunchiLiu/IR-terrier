	<brief_title>HER-2 Protein Vaccine Treating Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety HER-2 protein AutoVac™ woman breast cancer . Secondary - Determine ability drug bypass tolerance HER-2 self-protein raise HER-2 antibody patient . - Determine kinetics immune response HER-2/neu patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive HER-2 protein AutoVac™ intramuscularly week 0 , 2 , 6 , 10 absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10 patient accrue study within 3 month .</detailed_description>
