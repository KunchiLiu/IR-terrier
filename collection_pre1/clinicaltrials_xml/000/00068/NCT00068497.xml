	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Head Neck Cancer Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility enrol patient age 75 year old 50 year younger metastatic unresectable head neck cancer non-small cell lung cancer , structure pilot study include pharmacokinetic sample special patient population . II . To preliminarily compare ZD-1839 peak concentration level , elimination half-life steady state level two patient age group . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( 75 year vs 50 year ) Patients receive oral gefitinib day 1 daily begin day 8 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 30 day 3 year study registration .</detailed_description>
