	<brief_title>Sleep Apnea Look AHEAD Participants - Ancillary Look AHEAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Weight loss frequently recommend treatment obese patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . The empirical support recommendation lack . Based descriptive study , weight loss appear improve abolish sleep disorder breathing . Moreover , degree improvement OSA quite variable directly proportional weight loss . The lack randomized trial , study predominantly male sample , absence follow-up evaluation leave physician patient unsure utility weight loss treatment obese OSA patient . The study ancillary Look AHEAD clinical trial sponsor primarily National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases secondarily National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , National Institute Nursing Research , Office Research Women 's Health , National Center Minority Health Health Disparities , Centers Disease Control Prevention . The Look AHEAD study multicenter , randomize clinical trial examine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss overweight diabetic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study assess effect weight loss sleep disorder breathe 120 obese , Type 2 diabetic obstructive sleep apnea ( respiratory disturbance index [ RDI ] great equal 15 ) randomly assign either weight loss ( n=60 ) usual care ( n=60 ) treatment within context Look AHEAD study . Home polysomnography study perform treatment one two year . Among 60 weight loss subject , investigator assess relative importance change neck abdominal fat explain variability change sleep disordered breathing weight loss . Finally , examine relationship change sleep-disordered breathing change blood pressure weight loss 60 weight loss participant . Specifically , research : 1 ) determine efficacy weight loss program reduce sleep disordered breathe obese Type 2 diabetic ; 2 ) identify source variability sleep disorder breathing associate weight loss ; 3 ) examine role sleep disorder breathe mediating change blood pressure associate weight loss . The result study provide empirical basis make recommendation effectiveness weight loss Type 2 diabetic OSA .</detailed_description>
