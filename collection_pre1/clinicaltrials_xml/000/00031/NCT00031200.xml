	<brief_title>MRI Derived Organ &amp; Tissue Mass Changes With Weight Loss - Ancillary Look AHEAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Advances science often achieve development technology allow scientist differentiate refine concept previously undifferentiated . The field obesity research progress simple measurement weight loss multi-compartment model fat , fat-free mass regional distribution fat . An opportunity refinement present magnetic resonance image technology use image individual organ tissue . This present opportunity investigate important unresolved question . For example , information lacking effect weight loss individual organ tissue . The loss fat free mass ( FFM ) fully explain reported decrease rest energy expenditure ( REE ) accompanies weight loss . Since FFM compartment consist numerous tissue organ , different oxidative metabolic capacity , possibility exist individual vital organ may change disproportionately change total FFM weight loss , thereby explain reduction REE post weight loss . Complete organ-tissue volume mass reconstruction major compartment possible , use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The study ancillary Look AHEAD clinical trial sponsor primarily National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases secondarily National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , National Institute Nursing Research , Office Research Women 's Health , National Center Minority Health Health Disparities , Centers Disease Control Prevention . The Look AHEAD study multicenter , randomize clinical trial examine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss overweight diabetic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study describe composition weight loss diabetic subject tissue/organ level body composition ; specifically , determine whether degree different tissue organ conserve lose comparison total fat free mass ( FFM ) change weight loss . The study also assess effect age organ tissue mass 50+ year old diabetic men woman control group . The study test whether portion weight loss relate change rest energy expenditure ( REE ) explain change relative fraction body mass high ( brain , heart , liver , kidney ) low ( skeletal muscle , adipose tissue ) metabolic activity tissue respect oxidative metabolism 50 plus year old diabetic men woman . A secondary aim ass effect weight loss cardiac structure function use cardiac gate MRI . Consenting , eligible Look AHEAD participant St. Luke 's University Pittsburgh participate MRI REE test . Seventy men woman measure , equally distribute two site , equally distributed Lifestyle Intervention group Community Care group . Measures acquire baseline , follow one year intervention ( Year 1 ) , follow one year maintenance ( Year 2 ) , produce 2 X 3 factorial design .</detailed_description>
