	<brief_title>Biomarkers Oxidative Stress LOOK AHEAD - Ancillary LOOK AHEAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Overweight diabetes increase risk cardiovascular disease mechanism ( ) account effect remain clarify . Oxidation low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) think contribute atherosclerosis . Diabetes may increase oxidative stress , may contribute increase risk cardiovascular disease diabetic . Caloric restriction initiation exercise may increase oxidative stress short term may thus adversely affect cardiovascular disease . Over long term , metabolic adaptation may reduce oxidative stress . Such adaptation , together beneficial change lipoprotein concentration , composition , character , may allow expression beneficial effect weight loss cardiovascular endpoint . However , influence weight loss measure lipoprotein oxidation/oxidative stress antioxidant status overweight diabetics never investigate . The study ancillary Look AHEAD clinical trial sponsor primarily National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases secondarily National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , National Institute Nursing Research , Office Research Women 's Health , National Center Minority Health Health Disparities , Centers Disease Control Prevention . The Look AHEAD study multicenter , randomize clinical trial examine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss overweight diabetic . The study response initiative Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release June , 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The primary aim project determine influence intensive lifestyle intervention lipoprotein oxidation assess autoantibody oxidize low-density lipoprotein . Other complementary index oxidative stress , antioxidant status assess circulate concentration lipophilic antioxidant , compare lifestyle intervention community care ( control ) arm Look AHEAD study . Such comparison perform early intervention later metabolic adaptation expect . By contrast subgroup define differential compliance diet exercise , gender , menopausal status , ethnicity , age , secondary aim consider whether change lipoprotein oxidation/oxidative stress antioxidant status differ subgroup . Other aim consider whether difference lipoprotein oxidation/oxidative stress among subgroup account difference lipoprotein concentration , composition , character , carbohydrate metabolism , antioxidant status . The result study provide potential mechanistic explanation difference cardiovascular endpoint intervention community care group .</detailed_description>
