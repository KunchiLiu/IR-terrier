	<brief_summary>The purpose study document development associate puberty determine child previously participate another research study diagnose cancer . The previous study Collaborative Antiviral Study Group ( CASG ) protocol entitle `` Evaluation Ganciclovir ( DHPG ) Treatment Symptomatic Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infections . '' One medication use study treat cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , ganciclovir , know cause cancer affect development gonad ( ovary females testis male ) administer animal . Children , 9-14 year old , participate previous research study , participate study 1 day . Subjects evaluate endocrinologist follow procedure perform : complete physical examination , single blood sample collect , x-ray left wrist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neonatal CMV-Ganciclovir Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ganciclovir show carcinogenic , teratogenic , gonadal toxic animal model . Mice treat ganciclovir experienced increase incidence tumor preputial gland ( male ) , harderian gland ( male ) , forestomach ( male female ) , ovary ( female ) , uterus ( female ) , mammary gland ( female ) , clitoral gland ( female ) , vagina ( female ) , liver ( female ) . While preputial clitoral gland , forestomach , harderian gland mice human counterpart , ganciclovir consider potential carcinogen human . Animal data indicate administration ganciclovir cause inhibition spermatogenesis subsequent infertility , possibly due inhibition rapidly divide cell population include spermatogonia . In animal model , effect reversible low dos irreversible high dos . In male female mouse , ganciclovir show cause decrease fertility . Gonadal toxicity rat , mouse , dog include testicular atrophy male , variable , ovarian atrophy female . There data human demonstrate effect follow treatment ganciclovir . This study seek formally establish overall sexual development , cancer incidence , pubertal status study subject previously receive six week ganciclovir approach puberty . The original study perform 1986 1991 , therefore subject enrol nine fourteen year age .</detailed_description>
