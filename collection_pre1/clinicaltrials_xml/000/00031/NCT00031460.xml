	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether long term treatment acyclovir give orally ( mouth ) improve outcome infant herpes simplex virus infection brain spinal cord ( known central nervous system [ CNS ] ) . Infants herpes viral infection CNS spread part body enrol study . All participant receive treatment hospital 21 day acyclovir , give intravenously ( needle insert vein ) . Participants divide two group : CNS disease spread skin , whose viral infection spread involve CNS . Both group randomly assign receive either oral acyclovir placebo ( inactive substance ) 6 month . Infants US Canada participate 5 year . A physical exam , hear exam , eye exam , evaluation nervous system perform throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acyclovir Herpes Infections Involving Central Nervous System Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) disease complicate approximately 1 every 3,000 delivery United States , result estimate 1 , 500 case annually country . HSV-1 HSV-2 infection neonate manifest : disseminated disease ; central nervous system ( CNS ) disease ; disease limit skin , eye , mouth ( SEM disease ) . This study evaluate efficacy long term suppressive therapy oral acyclovir infant CNS disease , without evidence dissemination organ ( include skin ) . It determine suppressive oral acyclovir therapy improve neurologic outcome infant follow HSV disease CNS involvement address significance positive cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) result CSF parameter either remain normal show improvement . Comparisons make group respect post-randomization time first positive CSF PCR result initial 12 month life , result correlate clinical neurological assessment . It determine continuous administration oral acyclovir suspension suppresses recurrent skin lesion infant follow HSV disease CNS involvement , confirm safety long-term administration oral acyclovir therapy cohort infant HSV disease CNS involvement . Finally , effect suppressive acyclovir therapy issue pharmacoeconomics family infrastructure assess quantitated . Infants CNS disease ( without evidence viral dissemination organ , skin , liver , lung ) qualify study . Following 21 day course treatment intravenous ( IV ) acyclovir , infant CNS disease , without cutaneous involvement , randomize either continuous oral acyclovir placebo ( CNS Sub-Study ) . Similarly , infant disseminate disease CNS involvement randomize either continuous oral acyclovir placebo ( Disseminated CNS Involvement Sub-Study ) . The subset infant CNS disease ( without dissemination ) clear acute infection 21 day IV acyclovir therapy eligible enrollment Pilot Sub-Study . This group expect insufficient number able obtain statistical significance establish efficacy . Per protocol amendment date 19-Nov-1998 , 66 subject recruit sub-study . Subjects begin oral drug therapy 8 hour final IV acyclovir dose oral drug therapy administer 6 month . Whole blood ( 1.0 cubic centimeter ) obtain study enrollment completion IV antiviral therapy HSV PCR analysis , per protocol amendment date 4-May-1998 . This amendment replace obtain serum HSV PCR analysis . In event whole blood available , serum provide instead . All child follow 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month age . Physical examination , hear assessment , retinal examination perform follow-up visit . Standardized neurological evaluation perform 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . The primary study endpoint evaluate neurological impairment 12 month life . The secondary endpoint evaluate post-randomization detection HSV DNA CSF PCR time initial 12 month life 2 few episode post-randomization cutaneous recurrence HSV disease initial 12 month life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Viral Culture : 1 . If cutaneous lesion present , isolation Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) 1 HSV2 viral culture site ( skin , oropharynx , cerebral spinal fluid [ CSF ] , urine , etc . ) require study entry . 2 . If cutaneous lesion present , viral isolation culture adequate study entry require . In case cutaneous lesion negative viral culture , however , CSF polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) must positive . 3 . Additional sit HSV culture attempt include conjunctiva , oropharynx , blood buffy coat , urine , CSF . Evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) HSV disease acute illness , include one following : 1 . Abnormal CSF index term infant : great 22 white blood cell ( WBCs ) /mm^3 protein great 115mg/dl . 2 . Abnormal CSF index preterm infant : great 25 WBCs/mm^3 protein great 220 mg/dl . 3 . Abnormal neuroimaging study ( compute tomography [ CT ] contrast , magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] gadolinium , head ultrasound ) [ NOTE : CT contrast prefer image study ] . 4 . Abnormal electroencephalography ( EEG ) , perform ( NOTE : EEG suggest evaluation infant HSV disease require study ] . 5 . Positive CSF PCR HSV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) [ NOTE : If cutaneous lesion present viral culture negative , CSF PCR must positive . If lesion present culturepositive , abnormal CNS neurodiagnostic study abnormal CSF index sufficient study entry ] . Negative CSF PCR result within 48 hour prior completion intravenous acyclovir therapy . Less equal 28 day age time initial presentation CNS disease . Birth weight great equal 800 gram . Infants either grade 3 grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage ( IHV ) prior study enrollment . Breast feeding infant whose mother take acyclovir , valacyclovir , famciclovir great 120 hour ( great 5 day ) . If point follow enrollment mother take antiviral drug great 120 hour ( great 5 day ) , ask refrain breast feed take drug . Infants know born woman human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive ( HIV test require study entry ) . These infant know risk acquire HIV , would alter immune response infection , include herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection . Additionally , may receive antiretroviral and/or antiviral drug time study suppressive oral acyclovir conduct . As , exclude mother 's positive HIV status know time evaluation study inclusion . If point follow enrollment learn infant HIV positive , however , he/she continue study protocol . Infants HSV infection limit skin , eye , mouth ( SEM ) . Patients SEM HSV infection consider enrollment randomization ongoing Collaborative Antiviral Study Group ( CASG ) evaluation oral suppressive acyclovir therapy follow neonatal HSV infection limit SEM . Infants creatinine great 1.5 mg/dl time study enrollment .</criteria>
