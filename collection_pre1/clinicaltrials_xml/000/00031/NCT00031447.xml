	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether long-term treatment oral acyclovir improve outcome infant herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) disease skin , eye , mouth ( SEM ) . Study participant include infant United States Canada HSV disease skin , eye , mouth , central nervous system disease present . Initially , subject treat acyclovir administer IV access ( vein ) 14 day hospitalize . Participants place one two group , acyclovir give mouth placebo ( substance medication present ) . The participant study site know group subject assign . All child follow 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month age . During follow visit , physicals , hear assessment , eye assessment , neurological assessment complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acyclovir Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) Skin , Eye , Mouth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) disease complicate approximately one every 3,000 birth United States . This study placebo-controlled Phase III evaluation suppressive therapy oral Acyclovir suspension follow neonatal HSV infection limit skin , eye , mouth ( SEM ) . This study evaluate efficacy long-term suppressive therapy oral acyclovir infant SEM disease . It determine suppressive oral acyclovir therapy improve neurological outcome infant follow SEM disease . Only infants SEM disease qualify study . After qualify study obtain informed consent , infant complete 14 day intravenous ( IV ) Acyclovir ( 20 mg/kg/dose give every 8 hour ) . Patients randomize receive suppressive oral Acyclovir versus placebo continue meet study inclusion criterion completion IV therapy . This study double-blinded placebo control . At time randomization , patient place 1 2 group ( oral suppressive Acyclovir versus placebo ) . If patient either group cutaneous HSV recurrence , open-label oral Acyclovir ( 80 mg/kg/day divide 4 dos per day ) provide 5 day . During time administration open-label oral Acyclovir , study drug withheld . All child follow 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month age . Physical examination , hear assessment , retinal examination perform follow visit . Standardized neurologic evaluation perform 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month age .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Isolation viral culture herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) 1or HSV2 cutaneous lesion , conjunctiva , oropharynx . Detection HSV sit sufficient , presence skin lesion require study enrollment . Normal cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) index ( &lt; 22 white blood cell ( WBCs ) /mm^3 protein &lt; 115 mg/dl term infant ; ( &lt; 25 WBCs/mm^3 protein &lt; 220 mg/dl preterm infant time diagnosis HSV disease time study randomization . No evidence HSV central nervous system ( CNS ) disease compute tomography ( CT ) contrast , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gadolinium , head ultrasound ( HUS ) [ NOTE : CT contrast prefer image study ] . Normal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , perform [ NOTE : EEG suggest evaluation infant HSV disease require study ] . No evidence visceral dissemination HSV infection ( normal liver function test , normal chest xray , etc. ) . Negative CSF HSV polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) result specimen obtain within 72 hour initiation intravenous acyclovir therapy within 48 hour prior completion intravenous acyclovir therapy . Less equal 28 day age time initial presentation skin , eye , mouth ( SEM ) disease . Birth weight great equal equal 800 gram . Infants either grade 3 grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) prior study enrollment . Breast feeding infant whose mother take acyclovir , valacyclovir , famciclovir &gt; 120 hour ( &gt; 5 day ) . If point follow enrollment mother take antiviral drug &gt; 120 hour ( &gt; 5 day ) , ask refrain breast feed take drug . Infants know born woman human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive ( HIV test require study entry ) . These infant know risk acquire HIV , would alter immune response infection , include HSV infection . Additionally , may receive antiretroviral and/or antiviral drug time study suppressive oral acyclovir conduct . As , exclude mother 's positive HIV status know time evaluation study inclusion . If point follow enrollment learn infant HIV positive , he/she continue study protocol . Infants either central nervous system ( CNS ) disseminate HSV infection . Patients CNS HSV infection consider enrollment randomization ongoing Collaborative Antiviral Study Group ( CASG ) evaluation oral suppressive acyclovir therapy follow neonatal HSV infection involve CNS . Infants creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl time study enrollment . Infants receive acyclovir expectantly qualify study never develop HSV disease . Expectant therapy describe infant culture approximately 24 hour life risk HSV infection ( i.e . born woman active genital lesion ) . Oftentimes , culture positive , infant receive course intravenous acyclovir prevent development HSV disease . However , since never actually HSV disease , potential outcome compare infant typical skin , eye , mouth ( SEM ) disease , include study .</criteria>
