	<brief_summary>This study evaluate control HIV infection HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) affect response hepatitis C treatment peginterferon alpha-2b ribavirin HIV-infected patient chronic hepatitis C. HIV worsen liver disease cause hepatitis C. Since treatment HIV infection HAART improve immune function , may beneficial start HAART treat HCV . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old chronic hepatitis C infection may eligible study . Patients must HCV viral load great 2000 copies/mL CD4 count either 500 cells/mm3 , 350 cells/mm3 HIV viral load great 40,000 particles/mL . Candidates screen current previous disease , condition treatment may exclude study . Screening include medical history physical examination , eye examination , blood urine test , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , liver ultrasound , , possibly , liver biopsy , recent one available . The liver biopsy optional do determine severity liver disease . Patients sedated test . The skin area biopsy site numb local anesthetic , needle insert rapidly liver obtain small tissue sample . Patients remain hospital overnight monitoring . Women childbearing age pregnancy test . Patients enrol study randomly assign one follow treatment group : 1 ) pegylated interferon ribavirin 48 week ( control group ) ; 2 ) HAART 6 month , follow 48 week pegylated interferon ribavirin . HAART group - Patients take HAART follow clinic every 2 week first month monthly next 5 month . After 6 month HAART begin take pegylated interferon ribavirin follow dose follow-up schedule outline patient control group . Control group - Patients weekly injection skin peginterferon alpha-2b ribavirin pill daily mouth . Clinic visit schedule follow : - Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 21 - Blood drawn safety test measure blood level HIV HCV . HCV medication inject day 7 21 . - Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 52 , 56 , 64 - Blood urine test do determine side effect pegylated interferon ribavirin treatment effect HCV infection . Eye examination do every 3 month . - Week 48 end treatment - Treatment pegylated interferon ribavirin stop 48 week . At time ( early complete 48 week treatment ) , patient return clinic routine visit , blood test ( include test hepatitis B ) abdominal ultrasound . Patients may also hospitalize 2 day repeat optional liver biopsy . - Week 72 extend follow-up visit - At week 72 , patient return blood test routine clinic visit . HCV viral load measure . Follow-up visit every 3 month additional year include blood test measure HCV viral load complete physical examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact HAART Response Hepatitis C Treatment Patients Taking Peginterferon Alpha-2b Ribavirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coinfection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) rise dramatically since explosion HIV pandemic twenty year ago , one third HIV positive person also infect HCV . Numerous study suggest HIV exacerbate several step natural history hepatitis C , survival among HIV-infected patient increase , hepatitis C-related morbidity mortality expect follow similar trend coinfected patient . Some investigator advocate initiation highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) population prior initiation HCV therapy . It postulate HAART improve host immune function increase CD4+ cell count decrease HIV viral load , think advantageous patient start HCV therapy . Despite promising hypothesis , whether HAART ultimately lead reduction HCV load coinfected person remain controversial . This non-blinded , randomize control trial evaluate impact HAART immunologic , virologic , clinical response HCV treatment peginterferon ribavirin coinfected individual CD4 great equal 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) great equal 350 cells/mm ( 3 ) viral load less equal 40,000 copies/mL . The study also address safety efficacy administer combination HAART along peginterferon alpha-2b ribavirin HIV-infected individual . 128 patient coinfected HIV HCV recruit study randomize receive one two treatment regimen : 1 ) control group : treat peginterferon alpha-2b ribavirin 48 week , 2 ) experimental group : treat highly active antiretroviral therapy six month . At point , begin receive peginterferon alpha-2b ribavirin dos control group 48 week . During 72-week follow period , patient monitor HCV HIV viral load CD4+ lymphocyte count . The result study enable u good delineate relationship immune reconstitution effect induce HAART clinical , immunologic , virologic response coinfected person treat peginterferon ribavirin . In addition , evaluate safety coadministering peginterferon , ribavirin , HAART refine best therapeutic regimen patient population .</detailed_description>
