	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness modify stem cell transplant procedure treat leukocyte adhesion deficiency ( LAD ) . LAD inherit blood disorder leukocyte ( infection-fighting white blood cell ) leave patient vulnerable life-threatening infection . Transplantation donate stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature blood cell ) improve immune system patient LAD . However , procedure carry significant risk death , particularly patient active infection require completely suppress immune system high-dose chemotherapy radiation . In addition , T-cells ( type white blood cell ) donor may cause call graft vs. host disease ( GvHD ) , donor cell recognize patient 's cell foreign mount immune response destroy . To try reduce risk , donor 's T-cells remove rest stem cell transplant . Patients LAD weigh least 12 kg ( 26.4 LB ) , active infection , family member well-matched donor may eligible study . Pregnant breast feeding woman may participate . Candidates medical history , physical examination blood test , lung heart function test , X-rays compute tomography ( CT ) scan body , dental eye examination . They fill questionnaire measure emotional well , quality life intelligence ( ability learn understand ) . Stem cell collect patient donor . To , hormone G-CSF injected skin several day move stem cell bone marrow bloodstream . The stem cell collect apheresis , blood drawn needle place one arm pump machine separate remove required cell . The rest blood return needle arm . Before transplant , central venous line ( large plastic tube ) place major vein . This tube stay body used entire treatment period deliver donate stem cell , give medication , transfuse blood , need , withdraw blood sample . Several day transplant procedure , patient begin condition regimen low-dose chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , Campath 1H . When condition therapy complete , stem cell infuse . To help prevent rejection donor cell , cyclosporine give mouth vein start 1 month transplant procedure . The average hospital stay stem cell transplantation 21 day . After discharge , patient return follow-up clinic visit weekly twice weekly 2 3 month . These visit include symptom check , physical examination , blood test . Subsequent visit schedule 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month transplant , often require , yearly</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency ( LAD ) inherit disorder leukocyte function . Patients profoundly immunocompromised plague early life recurrent often life threaten infection . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly improve immune function patient LAD however severe toxicity associate conventional approach treatment . The primary objective phase II study investigate efficacy novel approach allogeneic stem cell transplantation design promote partial complete donor stem cell engraftment ( hematopoietic chimerism ) reduce transplant morbidity mortality . In attempt reduce toxicity pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning , highly immunosuppressive , low intensity bone marrow condition regimen use . Patients transplant peripheral blood stem cell HLA identical family member . T-lymphocytes remove stem cell graft attempt decrease risk graft v host disease . Donor T-cells infuse various time point follow transplant augment donor hematopoietic chimerism aid immune reconstitution . The primary end point study establishment donor hematopoietic chimerism , acute chronic graft versus host disease , transplant related mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Minimum weight 12 kg . Disease criterion : LAD : le 20 % expression CD18 ( measure fluorescence intensity compare control ) peripheral leukocyte flow cytometry either : ) clinical history 2 severe infection require intravenous antibacterial antifungal treatment OR b ) history lifethreatening nonhealing skin lesion . Free active infection . Patients nonhealing skin lesion may enrol superinfection contain . Patients consent HLAmatched related donor meet donor selection criterion . Patients adequate organ function measure : Cardiac : Asymptomatic , symptomatic , leave ventricular ejection fraction rest must great 40 % ; Hepatic : SGOT within 4x normal range total bilirubin le 4 mg/dl ; Renal : Creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ; Pulmonary : DLCO ( diffusion capacity ) FEV1 great 45 % predict ( correct hemoglobin ) . Minors pulmonary function test possible evaluated significant pulmonary dysfunction pulmonary consultant . Written inform consent/assent conform institutional guideline obtain patient parent . Absence coexist medical problem would significantly increase risk transplant procedure judgment principal investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . ECOG performance status 2 less great 50 % Lansky scale age 010 . Seropositivity HIV . Evidence rapid deterioration due progressive infection and/or organ damage . Malignant disease liable relapse progress within 5 year . DONOR SELECTION : Donors must fit receive GCSF give peripheral blood stem cell ( normal blood count , normotensive , history stroke , history severe heart disease , great 12 kg ) . Related patient HLAphenotypically identical patient HLAA , B DRB1 allele . Matching assess minimally serology Class I DNA type Class II antigens . Peripheral blood cell express normal level CD18 . If donor sibling minor , he/she old eligible sibling adult eligible donor . Written inform consent donor . Donors minor evaluate social worker , psychologist psychiatrist prior assent process determine willingness participate . If willingness participate confirm , inform consent obtain adult parent legal guardian . Informed assent obtain minor donor presence third party assess comprehension voluntary participation .</criteria>
