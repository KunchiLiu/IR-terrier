	<brief_title>Adding New Drugs HIV Infected Patients Failing Current Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite success potent combination therapy patient limited prior antiretroviral therapy , clinical experience demonstrate regimens less likely achieve durable suppression HIV-1 replication patient extensive prior treatment nucleoside analogues . The response treatment patient fail multiple previous regimen disappoint . Thus , urgent need new approach treatment patient . Recent study show effective add investigational drug optimize background drug regimen select base resistance test . This study ass virologic immunologic activity amdoxovir ( DAPD ) versus placebo combination enfuvirtide ( T-20 , ENF ) plus optimize background ( OB ) antiretroviral therapy highly treatment-experienced patient . Patients study continue take current ( fail ) antiretroviral regimen register study . Patients randomize receive DAPD placebo . Patients receive DAPD placebo together ENF plus OB regimen contain least three five antiretroviral agent . The OB regimen select base result screen HIV-1 drug resistance test expect remain stable least first 24 week study . Only ENF DAPD supply study , provide participant beyond end study . ENF inject abdomen , deltoid , anterior aspect thigh . Patients teach self-administer ENF . Medical staff observe self-injection first dose ENF clinic visit schedule Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 . During Week 4 , patient undergo pharmacokinetic testing . This require patient come clinic approximately 12 hour blood test different time take study drug . After Week 4 , follow-up visit every 4 week Week 48 . Blood work , ophthalmologic exam , urinalysis do clinic visit , except Week 1 . Participants may continue receive study treatment beyond Week 24 48 week total , unless experience confirm loss virologic immunologic response . Regardless treatment , patient follow 48 week . In March 2004 , participant study unblinded . Participants DAPD placebo give option discontinue placebo replace active antiretroviral , one available . Participants active DAPD give option continue DAPD Week 48 , discontinue replace another antiretroviral agent . All participant may continue receive ENF Week 48 .</detailed_description>
