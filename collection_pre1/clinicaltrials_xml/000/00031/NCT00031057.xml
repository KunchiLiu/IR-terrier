	<brief_summary>The purpose study see vitamin B treat mild hyperlactatemia ( high normal level lactate blood ) patient take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . Hyperlactatemia potentially life-threatening condition associate NRTI therapy . A lack vitamin B may relate development hyperlactatemia . However , study do evaluate . This study propose high dos vitamin B may bring elevated lactate level back normal among patient take NRTIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperlactatemia , without lactic acidosis , potentially life-threatening condition appear associate NRTI therapy . The natural history lactate elevation complication NRTI therapy clearly understood ; however , patient receive therapy experience progressive increase lactate symptomatic level . Deficiencies thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ) implicate cofactor produce hyperlactatemia lactic acidosis NRTI-treated patient . A nontoxic intervention could prevent reverse advance lactic acidosis preserve NRTI use would highly desirable . To date , control study do examine potential role dietary intake , B vitamin deficiency , B vitamin therapy pathogenesis clinical course NRTI-associated lactic acidosis . The hypothesis propose high-dose vitamin B treatment normalize elevated lactate level among NRTI-exposed individual moderately elevate lactate level . This study consist 2 step : Step 1 ( screen ) Step 2 ( treatment ) . Patients screen Step 1 sustain hyperlactatemia Step 2 eligibility . Patients sustain hyperlactatemia symptom indicate high risk progression lactic acidosis plan change exist NRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy may enter Step 2 . A fasting , nonexercise , venous lactate level obtain Step 2 entry use baseline measurement , every patient receive high-dose oral vitamin B1 B2 therapy 4 week . Fasting , nonexercise , venous lactate level measure Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 observe kinetics change lactate level study treatment .</detailed_description>
