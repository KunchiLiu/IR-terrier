	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heavy metal heterogeneous group highly reactive substance , may act essential cofactor physiologic process and/or toxic element . Chromium , particular , associated obesity , diabetes , weight loss . Other heavy metal associate consequence obesity , include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cardiovascular disease . The Look AHEAD Study , large randomize controlled trial intensive lifestyle intervention weight loss obese patient Type 2 diabetes mellitus , provide excellent opportunity address impact chromium weight loss diabetes control , well assess impact heavy metal physiologic consequence weight loss . The study ancillary Look AHEAD clinical trial sponsor primarily National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases secondarily National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , National Institute Nursing Research , Office Research Women 's Health , National Center Minority Health Health Disparities , Centers Disease Control Prevention . The Look AHEAD study multicenter , randomize clinical trial examine long-term effect lifestyle intervention design achieve maintain weight loss overweight diabetic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This ancillary prospective observational study within Look AHEAD trial . The ancillary study collect toenail clipping participant ( n = 5,000 ) baseline 1-year visit , analyze random subset toenail heavy metal content use instrumental neutron activation analysis . Toenails provide time-integrated measure heavy metal exposure , instrumental neutron activation analysis provide concentration 50 heavy metal toenail sample , include chromium . This information allow evaluation relationship baseline toenail chromium concentration weight loss , well interaction heavy metal beneficial effect weight loss . The propose study may provide , valuable insight determinant efficacy weight loss intervention . In fact , Look AHEAD trial , size , may one study relationships measure reliably . In addition , ancillary study permit setup specimen bank toenail use future case-cohort nest case-control study association heavy metal Look AHEAD endpoint , especially myocardial infarction cardiovascular death .</detailed_description>
