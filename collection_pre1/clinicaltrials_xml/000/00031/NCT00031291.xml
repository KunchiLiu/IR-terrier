	<brief_summary>This protocol joint project National Institutes Health , Centers Disease Control United States Army Medical Research Institute Infectious Diseases . It design collect plasma healthy employee Department Defense vaccinate anthrax . The collected plasma pool make anthrax-fighting antibody solution call anthrax immune globulin intravenous ( AIGIV ) . This solution use : - Animal experiment test effectiveness prevent development anthrax inhalation exposure ; - Treating people severely ill anthrax improve standard antibiotic therapy ; - Treating people expose spore bacteria cause anthrax try prevent development disease . Healthy volunteer 18 65 year age receive least four dos anthrax vaccine meet criterion blood donor may eligible participate study . Volunteers recruit Department Defense civilian military employee . Candidates screen interview blood test . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Have health history screen donate plasma - Measurement heart rate , blood pressure temperature - Fingerstick check hemoglobin level - Blood test HIV , hepatitis B C , syphilis infectious disease - Blood test anthrax antibody level - Plasmapheresis collect blood plasma ( liquid part blood ) In plasmapheresis , whole blood drawn needle place arm vein . The blood flow cell separator machine , spun separate plasma blood cell . The plasma collect plastic bag machine , rest blood return donor needle arm . During procedure , donor give blood thinner call citrate prevent blood clot cell separator machine . The procedure last 60 90 minute . Only small fraction body 's total plasma remove , quickly replace body long-term health effect . Participants may request donate plasma often every 3 4 day infrequently month maximum six donation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhalational anthrax infection associate 60-100 % mortality rate , depend rapidity appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiate . Experiments use animal model inhalational anthrax suggest adjunctive therapy equine-derived anti-anthrax antiserum may associate high survival rate , however human-derived antiserum currently available . The purpose protocol provide mechanism obtain high-titer anti-anthrax immunoglobulin plasmapheresis human volunteer recently receive course anthrax vaccination . Volunteers Department Defense ( DoD ) employee military personnel within 3 12 week receive fourth great dose AVA four six total inoculation give , within 6 month last dose seven AVA inoculation give . All vaccinee vaccinate requirement tour duty otherwise meet blood donor eligibility criterion , accord Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) requirement American Association Blood Banks ( AABB ) standard . Plasmapheresis accomplish use license apheresis device standard collection technique , product meet blood safety test requirement currently mandate FDA . Plasma component collect protocol store frozen state fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) protocol administration component human patient critically ill inhalational anthrax infection review approve IRB 's NIH , CDC , USAMRIID . Following approval , product undergo standard Cohn-Oncley fractionation concentrate immunoglobulin preparation suitable intravenous use , designate anthrax immune globulin intravenous ( AIGIV ) . Intravenous administration product derive plasma collect protocol , whether single-donor FFP AIGIV , occur Phase I/II trial involve Investigational New Drug ( IND ) exemption , IND hold Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) . The plasma product collect protocol also use pharmacokinetic , dose finding , efficacy study animal , establish repository reference serum standard CDC . This study represent collaborative effort DTM/NIH , CDC , DoD .</detailed_description>
