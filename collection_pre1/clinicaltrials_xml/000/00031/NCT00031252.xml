	<brief_title>Neighborhood-Level Influences All-Cause Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study examine social physical feature neighborhood interact individual factor influence disparity health , important understudied area research . This project create rich new database individual ' socioeconomic status ( SES ) health indicator link characteristic specific neighborhood subsequent mortality . Thus , build important exit data base create contextual-level database information mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Few study examine social physical feature neighborhood interact individual factor , e.g. , health behavior socioeconomic status ( SES ) , influence disparity health . The investigator propose test independent interrelate effect neighborhood social environment ( e.g. , neighborhood SES , social disorganization , Hispanic concentration , crime rate ) , neighborhood physical environment ( e.g. , housing condition , availability good service license alcohol distributor , fast food restaurant , grocery store , gun shop , educational resource , recreational facility , banking/lending institution ) , individual risk factor predict all-cause cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality woman men . They conduct prospective mortality follow-up study 8,847 white ( non-Hispanic ) Hispanic woman men participate Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program ( SHDPP ) , also refer Stanford Five-City Project . This population-based CVD study include random sample woman men age 25-74 participate one five cross-sectional survey ( 1979-1990 ) four socioeconomically diverse California city . The SHDPP recognize comprehensive well-standardized survey physiologic measure include SES ( education , income , occupation ) , CVD risk factor ( e.g. , smoking , high cholesterol saturate fat ) , psychosocial factor , health-related measure . The investigator propose match survey data death record all-cause CVD mortality endpoint , link geocoded address census data archival data measure neighborhood social physical environment . This work would create new database individual ' SES health indicator link characteristic specific neighborhood . Based empirical finding , identity neighborhood currently high low risk mortality , conduct focus group map neighborhood environment ( e.g. , social , physical , service feature ) create geographic information system ( GIS ) . These two activity hopefully extend empirical finding , generate new hypothesis , guide development Community Outreach Education Program ( COEP ) . The COEP build collaborative partnership member study city , health advocate , health agency serve low SES medically serve population . With involvement partner , integrate empirical finding knowledge exist study disseminate result via Internet , medium , target mailing , program offer California State local county health department four study city .</detailed_description>
