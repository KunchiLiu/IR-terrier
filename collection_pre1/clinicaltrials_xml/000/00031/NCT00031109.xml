	<brief_summary>The purpose study see investigational vaccine make antibody ( protein find blood ) humans influence course AIDS-like disease monkey . Hopefully , result study applied human . AIDS , cause infection HIV , associate many death occurrence disease . Although recent advance make anti-HIV therapy AIDS , cure HIV infection AIDS , drug therapy expensive infected population . Some organization try make safe effective vaccine may prevent HIV infection AIDS worldwide . Certain vaccine generate specific antibody human , inhibit HIV infection laboratory test . It possible , however , antibody may make HIV disease less severe follow infection . For reason , monkey use evaluate role specific human antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Human Antibodies Influencing AIDS-Like Disease Monkeys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIDS , cause infection human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) associate enormous morbidity mortality worldwide . Although recent advance make antiretroviral therapy AIDS , cure HIV infection AIDS , drug therapy expensive infected population . The development safe , effective vaccine prevent HIV infection AIDS worldwide commitment health-oriented organization . A major goal effort design effective vaccine identification immunologic correlate protective immunity . Non-neutralizing antibody might possess clinically important anti-HIV activity remain defined warrant investigation . The role play antibody minimal neutralizing activity induce various HIV vaccination strategy unknown . It possible low-level neutralization activity may lead improvement worsen disease course follow infection . For reason propose challenge trial rhesus macaque SHIV model perform , role antibody , derive non-infected human vaccinee , evaluate . This 2-part study . Part I involve human participant ; Part II involve rhesus macaque . Part 1 : Human participant divide 2 group : Group I : Participants previously enrol specific AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group ( AVEG ) protocols immunized single dose recombinant gp160MN/LAI-2 vaccine alum ( aluminum hydroxide adjuvant ) Day 0 study . Group II : Participants vaccine naive receive immunization . Each participant 5 clinic visit study . Blood drawn visit routine test immune system check . Sera drawn participant neutralize antibody determination . Approximately 3 week immunization ( Day 18 ) , blood drawn participant group plasmapheresis procedure platelet plasma remove . This process repeat 1 week later . Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) purify plasma vaccinate participant . Part II : Juvenile rhesus macaque divide 4 group infuse IgG human participant Groups I II Day 0 . At Day 1 , macaque expose SHIV-89.6P . At Days 3 , 7 , 10 , weekly Day 73 , CD4 lymphocyte count , plasma viremia , antibody macaque measure .</detailed_description>
