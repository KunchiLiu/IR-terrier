	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cancer Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor cytostatic activity OSI-774 measure probability survive progression-free least 6 month patient persistent recurrent squamous cell carcinoma cervix . II . To determine nature degree toxicity OSI-774 cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine partial complete response rate patient squamous cell carcinoma cervix receive OSI-774 . II . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival within patient population treat OSI-774 . III . Assess effect prognostic factor : initial performance status age . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) p110 truncate EGFR ( p110 sEGFR ) isoform expression level primary tumor , tumor sample obtain pretreatment follow four week therapy determine tumor response ( resistance ) OSI-774 inhibition EGFR tyrosine kinase . II . To correlate EGFR p110sEGFR expression level either MAPK AKT phosphorylation status tissue sample obtain pretreatment follow four week drug treatment determine downstream effect response OSI-774 inhibition EGFR . III . To determine whether pretreatment serum p110 sEGFR concentration useful prognostic indicator whether altered and/or sEGFR concentration useful indicator therapeutic responsiveness , time progression , overall survival cervical carcinoma patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
