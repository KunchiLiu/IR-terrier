	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Filgrastim Pegfilgrastim Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Cancer Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity docetaxel , gemcitabine , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) pegfilgrastim patient persistent recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 90 minute day 1 8 , docetaxel IV 1 hour day 8 , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 9-15 pegfilgrastim SC day 9 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 10-24 month .</detailed_description>
