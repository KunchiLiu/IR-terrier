	<brief_summary>A common group virus infect human enterovirus . Enteroviruses produce illness child may range mild ( summer cold ) severe ( infection brain , liver , heart ) . The purpose study determine new drug call pleconaril help treat baby enteroviral sepsis . In addition , researcher attempt determine safe effective dose pleconaril help baby disease . Infants 15 day young diagnosed enteroviral disease eligible study . Two 3 baby randomly assign receive Pleconaril one three receive placebo ( inactive substitute ) . Participants hospitalize receive study medication . Babies receive standard treatment care symptom observe medical progress . Participants may study 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enteroviral infection serious health problem newborn infant . Approximately 60-70 % infant diagnosed enteroviral disease within first 10 day life acquire infection transmission mother time delivery . Congenital infection rare often fatal . Perinatal transmission enteroviral infection newborn nursery also implicate important route spread disease newborn infant postnatal transmission enteroviral infection seasonal peak enterovirus activity occur commonly . Thus , period high prevalence enterovirus infection community , many potential source infection discharge nursery , include mother , family member , hospital staff . Approximately 75 % case neonatal enteroviral disease carry benign outcome , diagnosis symptomatic treatment non-intensive care unit setting . For remainder patient , serious consequence result systemic enteroviral infection , include meningoencephalitis , cardiovascular collapse , myocarditis , hepatitis . These last two organ-specific complication carry high mortality rate . Historically , symptom management supportive care rule management patient . No specific therapeutic intervention currently available management gravely ill neonate . The current study evaluate antiviral drug pleconaril treatment enterovial sepsis syndrome . This trial multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled study evaluate virologic efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics pleconaril treatment severe enteroviral sepsis syndrome . Patients randomize 2:1 drug placebo . For enrollment trial , infant must evidence severe hepatic involvement , myocardial involvement , and/or consumptive coagulopathy . Their age must 15 day less time onset disease symptom . Enrollment continue 45 subject confirm enteroviral disease enrol . The primary objective investigation determine administration pleconaril critically ill neonates enteroviral sepsis syndrome result rapid clearance virus various body site . Other objective study assess safety pharmacokinetics drug patient population . The effect pleconaril measure clinical outcome also evaluate . These include degree inotropic blood product support require acute illness ; duration hospitalization ; time resolution residual organ injury ; short-term ( 2 month age ) long-term ( 1 year age ) survival . The primary endpoint percentage patient shed virus ( detected viral culture ) oropharynx ( i.e . throat ) 5 day begin study drug . The secondary endpoint include : duration ( day ) shed virus ( detected viral culture ) oropharynx , rectum , urine , serum ; change baseline laboratory abnormality [ aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin , platelet , creatinine ) , reflect either resolution progression enteroviral disease ; pleconaril pharmacokinetics ; safety ; duration ( day ) total hospitalization ; survival 2 month age ; time ( day ) resolution residual organ-related abnormality follow acute disease ; survival 1 year age .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent statement parent legal guardian . Age less equal 15 day time onset disease symptom . Symptoms systemic illness include limited fever , irritability , poor feeding , emesis , diarrhea . Signs systemic illness include , limited , jaundice , seizure , lethargy . Onset disease symptom less equal 10 day ( 240 hour ) prior administration first dose study medication . Birth weight great equal 1500 gram . Gestational age great equal 32 week . Suspected proven enteroviral disease . One follow three condition : 1. serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) great 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; 2. platelet count le 100,000 prothrombin time great 1.5 time ULN positive fibrin split product ; 3. cardiac shorten fraction le 25 % cardiac ejection fraction le 50 % measure echocardiography . Diagnosis bacterial nonenterovirus viral pathogen produce constellation presenting symptom , know time study enrollment . Imminent demise ( estimate life expectancy le 24 hour ) . Cyanotic congenital heart lesion . Alimentary tract abnormality may interfere absorption study drug . These include mechanical obstruction gastrointestinal tract , necrotizing enterocolitis , severe ileus ( definition leave clinical judgment participate investigator ) . Infants know born woman human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive ( HIV test require study entry ) . These infant know risk acquire HIV , would alter immune response infection , include enteroviral infection . Additionally , may receive antiretroviral and/or antiviral drug time study pleconaril conduct . As , exclude mother 's positive HIV status know time evaluation study inclusion . If point follow enrollment learn infant HIV positive , however , he/she continue study protocol .</criteria>
