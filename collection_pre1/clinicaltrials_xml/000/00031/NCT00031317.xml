	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety effectiveness drug combination paroxetine clonazepam treat people panic disorder ( PD ) major depression . The main goal treat people PD rapidly reduce symptom severity improve functioning . While numerous drug therapy use treat PD , treatment limit variable response rate suboptimal side effect profile . Evidence suggest clonazepam give selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) facilitate rapid reduction PD symptom . However , unclear whether comorbid depression influence treatment response clonazepam SSRI regimen . This study examine whether combine treatment clonazepam SSRI paroxetine accelerate clinical response participant PD comorbid depression . This study also examine whether benefit treatment sustain end study despite taper clonazepam midpoint study . Participants study screen medical psychiatric interview , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood test . Participants randomly assign receive either paroxetine plus clonazepam paroxetine plus placebo ( inactive pill ) 12 week .

	<detailed_description>The main goal treatment patient Panic Disorder ( PD ) effect rapid reduction symptom severity improve functioning . While numerous pharmacological approach use treat PD , treatment limit variable response rate , 6-week lag period prior onset clinical response , sub-optimal side effect profile , include possible worsening anxiety insomnia . There recent evidence benzodiazepine clonazepam prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) facilitate rapid reduction symptom PD . The improvement symptom maintain despite taper clonazepam prior end study . However , unclear co-morbid depression influence treatment response regimen . In addition , recent study patient major depression demonstrate combined fluoxetine-clonazepam treatment result rapid antidepressant response fluoxetine-placebo combination . The propose study examine whether combine treatment clonazepam paroxetine patient PD comorbid depression accelerate onset clinical response panic depression symptom . PD comorbid major depression severe disorder PD alone . We also examine whether rapid clinically meaningful benefit sustain end study , despite taper clonazepam midpoint study . If study turn case combine SSRI-benzodiazepine treatment may become standard initial therapeutic approach PD comorbid major depression .</detailed_description>
