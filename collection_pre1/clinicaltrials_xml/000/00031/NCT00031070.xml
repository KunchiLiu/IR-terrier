	<brief_summary>The purpose study see cyclosporine , take patient begin highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , increase number CD4 T-cells ( blood cell fight infection ) patient 's blood . This study also explore safety briefly give cyclosporine patient start HAART .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing HAART-Induced Immune Restoration With Cyclosporine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The availability HAART substantially decrease morbidity mortality cause HIV-1 infection . There clinical laboratory evidence suggest treatment HIV-1 infection arrest progressive immune deterioration cause HIV-1 , also associate least partial immune reconstitution . After start HAART , patient chronic HIV-1 infection experience increase CD4 T-cells , magnitude CD4 lymphocyte rise highly variable . Patients experience substantial rise circulate CD4 lymphocytes remain risk opportunistic infection . Strategies enhance immune restoration HIV-1 disease need . Studies show immune restoration HAART patient chronic HIV-1 infection incomplete . There , however , several potential method use possibly may enhance magnitude CD4 lymphocyte rise induce HAART . It propose lymphoid tissue , lymphocytes trap activated die , major site immunopathology cellular loss HIV-infection . Interference lymphocyte trap death lymphoid tissue cyclosporine , immunosuppressant , administered time initiation HAART may result enhancement magnitude cellular restoration patient initiate HAART . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : Arm A : Weeks 1 2 : abacavir ( ABC ) /lamivudine ( 3TC ) /zidovudine ( ZDV ) . Weeks 3 48 : ABC/3TC/ZDV efavirenz ( EFV ) . Arm B : Weeks 1 2 : ABC/3TC/ZDV cyclosporine . Weeks 3 48 : ABC/3TC/ZDV EFV . Patients arm receive follow immunization : Weeks 8 12 : Hepatitis A vaccine inactivate rabies vaccine . Week 16 : Rabies vaccine . To ascertain whether augmentation rise CD4 lymphocyte sustain , number circulate CD4 lymphocytes 48 week start therapy compare . To examine functional significance cellular increase , ability patient respond immunization recall neoantigens compare cyclosporine plus HAART arm HAART alone arm . Substudy A5139 : A 2-week substudy design explore mechanisms first-phase cellular restoration perform . Patients undergo 4 lymph node aspirate . Lymphocytes analyze use flow cytometry correlate finding main study . There limit patient enrollment . Patients register substudy immediately randomize main study .</detailed_description>
