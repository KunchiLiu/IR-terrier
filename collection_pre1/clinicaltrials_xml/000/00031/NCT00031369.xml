	<brief_summary>This study use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) look subtle difference brain anatomy patient focal hand dystonia ( also call writer cramp ) healthy normal volunteer . Patients hand dystonia prolong muscle contraction cause sustain twist movement abnormal posture . These abnormal movement often occur activity write , type , play certain musical instrument guitar piano , play golf dart . Patients focal hand dystonia healthy volunteer enrol study . Patients recruit NINDS database patient focal hand dystonia . Volunteers select match patient age , sex handedness . This study involve two visit NIH Clinical Center . The first visit screen visit , patient volunteer medical history , physical examination , neurological examination , assessment handedness . Women childbearing age screen pregnancy test . Pregnant woman exclude study . Those join study return second visit magnetic resonance imaging . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For procedure , participant lie still stretcher move scanner ( narrow cylinder contain magnet ) . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit use scan process . The scan last 45 60 minute , . Some volunteer may ask return third visit obtain second MRI different scanner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The term , dystonia , use describe syndrome characterize prolonged muscle contraction cause sustain twist movement abnormal posture affect body part ( ) . Although structural brain abnormality definitively demonstrate visual inspection MRI scan patient primary focal dystonia , several line evidence subtle structural brain abnormality subcortical cortical level . We hypothesize abnormality might detect use appropriate acquisition analysis method . Study population This research conduct use patient primary focal dystonia normal volunteer . Design By use high-resolution 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) 3 Tesla high resolution anatomical image 7 Tesla , detect structural change patient primary focal dystonia comparison control subject . VBM DTI method implement statistical parametric mapping software ( SPM2 ) . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) use special software calculate gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) level region interest . Outcome measure VBM DTI analysis SPM2 enable u make voxel-wise comparison local concentration/volume gray/white matter among group subject . This study lead improve knowledge pathophysiology primary hand dystonia help elucidate dystonia pathogenesis/etiology may lead specific preventative therapeutic approach . The MRS study enable u study GABA level sensory motor cortex , prefrontal cortex basal ganglia primary dystonia patient normal subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Healthy volunteer consent participate study match age , sex , handedness group patient primary focal hand dystonia . PATIENTS : Patient primary focal dystonia dystonia patient database consent participate study . This criterion establish preliminary screening Human Motor Control Outpatient Clinic . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The following subject exclude : Healthy volunteer cognitive complaint , abnormal neurological exam history past neurological disease . Dystonia patient presence second neurological disease condition ; abnormal neurological finding exam related primary focal dystonia . Subjects past present neuropsychiatric illness , head trauma loss consciousness , epilepsy , cerebrovascular disease , migraine , past present history alcohol abuse , medical condition may alter cerebral structure . Subjects abnormal MRI finding visual inspection ( prominent normal variant mega cisterna cavum septum pellucidum , sign severe cortical subcortical atrophy , brain tumor , vascular disease , trauma AVMs ) . Subjects metallic object within prior MR imaging ( cardiac neural pacemaker , aneurysm clip [ metal clip wall large artery ] , metallic prosthesis [ include heart valve cochlear implant ] shrapnel fragment . Welders metal worker also risk injury may take part study possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . Subjects capable give informed consent . Women pregnant Children</criteria>
