	<brief_title>Study Genetic Risk Factors Spina Bifida Anencephaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term spina bifida anencephaly include range developmental malformation result abnormal incomplete closure neural tube . Despite advance treatment prenatal detection , condition remain one common serious group birth defect . Spina bifida associate increased mortality morbidity , anencephaly always fatal . The occurrence condition profound influence affected individual family important public health implication . The etiology NTDs considerable interest several decade . They know etiologically heterogeneous occur association chromosome abnormality , teratogenic exposure , occasionally part single gene disorder . However , specific causative agent identify vast majority affect individual . The etiology NTDs `` non-syndromic '' patient believe complex involve genetic environmental risk factor . Using comprehensive research program , study evaluate potential genetic determinant SB anencephaly large , well-characterized sample . The family constellation use study consist proband ( individual NTD - SB A ) proband 's biologic parent maternal grandparent . Blood saliva sample obtain individual family . Genomic DNA study participant prepare sample , genetic locus evaluate . The proband , his/her parent , complete study questionnaire obtain family history epidemiologic information .</detailed_description>
