	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) explore brain activity involve perform learn automatic movement . Automatic movement perform without concentrate detail movement . Healthy adult volunteer eligible study . Candidates medical history brief physical examination fill questionnaire . Women childbearing potential urine pregnancy test . Pregnant woman enrol . Participants perform certain task involve movement right leave hand undergo MRI scan . They undergo scan twice-before practice movement task . Before second scan , participant practice follow task 1 week : - Tapping task - subject use left index finger tap button certain frequency . - Sequential movement task - subject perform sequential finger-tapping movement right hand , tap button finger certain frequency 25-second period . There two sequence different length , refer sequence-4 sequence-12 , base number movement unit sequence . - Visual distraction task - 14-letter sequence consist letter A , G , L , O present subject ask identify number time see target letter . - Dual task - complete task , subject perform follow dual task : Tapping visual task Sequence-4 finger tap visual task Sequence-12 finger tap visual task Tapping sequence-4 finger tap Tapping sequence-12 finger tap When participant perform dual task correctly 90 percent time , movement consider automatic , subject undergo MRI scanning . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For procedure , subject lie still stretcher move scanner ( narrow cylinder contain magnet ) . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit use scan process . The scan last 1.5 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Study Automatic Movements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A general characteristic motor system people perform learn movement automatically . The underlying neural correlate automatic movement investigate , fully understood . In present study , order investigate brain activity contribute phenomenon , use specially design dual task paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique . Forty healthy adult subject ask perform motor task ( squeeze hand sequential movement finger ) listen auditory distraction task , execute two different motor task simultaneously . fMRI obtain performance task . By analyze fMRI result , explore brain region especially devote automatic movement .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Forty normal adult volunteer include . Volunteers recruit people register HMCS Normal Volunteers . All subject participate MR study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . Procedures functional fMRI experiment follow Standard Operating Procedures HMCS Neuroimaging group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects pacemaker , cardiac , neural defibrillator , intracranial aneurysm clip , intraorbital metallic structure , insulin pump , cochlear implant , metallic object scan . We scan pregnant woman safety high magnetic field fetus establish . Therefore , administer urine pregnancy field female childbearing potential prior functional MRI scan . If result urine pregnancy test available reason , medical doctor judge base proper information prior scan . We also exclude child study complex .</criteria>
