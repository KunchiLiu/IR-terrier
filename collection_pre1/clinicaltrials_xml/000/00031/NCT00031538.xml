	<brief_summary>This study analyze tissue blood sample patient gliomas ( type brain tumor ) develop new classification system tumor . Tumor classification help guide treatment , part predict aggressive tumor may . Gliomas currently classify accord grade ( quickly may grow ) type cell compose . This system , however , always accurate , sometimes two tumor appear identical microscope different growth pattern responses treatment . The new classification system base tumor gene protein , may use future good predict give tumor behavior response therapy . Patients evidence primary brain tumor patient know glioma undergoing surgery remove tumor may participate study . A sample tumor tissue remove course participant normal clinical care use study laboratory analysis gene chromosome abnormality . A small blood sample also collect genetic analysis . In addition , clinical information patient condition response treatment collect every 6 month several year . This information include finding physical neurologic examination , radiographic finding , response therapy , include surgery , radiation chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Primary brain tumor increasingly important cause cancer-related morbidity mortality country . Little progress make treatment patient gliomas last decade . One large problem understand , ultimately successful treatment glioma great heterogeneity tumor . Objective : The purpose study generate large publicly accessible molecular genetic database prospective corollary clinical data 1000 glioma purpose allow investigator around world ask important question regard pathogenesis tumor , development novel molecular classification schema , identification potentially new important therapeutic target . To substantially enlarge grow glioma genomic corollary clinical database currently generate Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative ( GMDI ) record Repository Malignant Brain Tumor Database ( REMBRANDT ) , accrual potential glioma patient bank formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue block rather restrict accrual patient undergo surgical resection tumor . ( NCI Only ) Cell line create use glioma tissue harvest surgery . The cell line use research NOB laboratory well advance public scientific knowledge make available intramural , extramural private sector investigator research . This would do execute Material Transfer Agreement ( MTA ) need case case basis . The PI study contact directly initiation cell line transfer another organization investigator . ( NCI Only ) Eligibility : Any patient radiographic suggestion primary glial neoplasm patient know glial neoplasm . Medically indicate ( diagnostic and/or therapeutic ) tumor resection , biopsy . Design : All attempt make obtain specimen immediately adjacent area resection take `` permanent section '' order optimize likelihood tumor see permanent section representative take genetic analysis . Once tumor specimen acquire , immediately bring liquid nitrogen cell/tissue storage container , -70/-80 degree C , -20 degrees C freezer ( order preference ) storage . Following storage specimen , NCI-based study specimen coordinator contact determination frozen specimen send NCI analysis . 10 ml whole blood obtain analysis SNP Analogs . Patients evaluate every 6 month minimum . A total 1000 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
