	<brief_summary>This study examine whether blind people develop change brain improve memory function . Previous study show blind people , average , perform good memory task sight people . A possible reason part brain process visual information sight individual engage process mnemonic ( remember ) information blind people . Blind sight people 18 year age old eligible study . Healthy , sight individual may participate Part 1 study , design find appropriate word use test Part 2 study . Part 2 include sight people blind people . It examine whether ( visual ) brain blind people process mnemonic information way help day-to-day memory function . Blind participant study must lose sight age 4 . Candidates screen medical interview examination brief test short-term long-term verbal memory . Sighted patient also test visual memory handedness . Part 1 - Word Recognition Testing ( 2 session ) - Session 1 : Participants listen number word loudspeaker try remember memory test give 30 minute later . For test , subject listen word press one three button quickly possible hearing word . The button signal whether subject recognize word 1 ) high level confidence 2 ) low level confidence . - Session 2 : Participants hear noun loudspeaker find appropriate verb , verb ( read ) noun ( book ) . Part 2 - MRI Scanning TMS Experiments ( 5 - 7 session ) - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : Participants perform procedure describe Part 1 undergo MRI brain . For test , subject lie table inside MRI scanner - narrow cylindrical tube strong magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . ( Earphones use hear word test instead loudspeaker . ) - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) : Participants undergo TMS performing procedure describe Part 1 . For TMS , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Subjects may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle arm leg . During TMS , electrical muscle activity record electrode computer record device . Each session last maximum 3 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Plasticity Verbal Memory Blind</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cross-modal plasticity refers concept cortex normally responsive one sensory modality , deprive usual input , become responsive input sensory modality . In blind subject , visual cortex process somatosensory auditory information . A recent functional imaging study find verbal memory recall verb generation significantly activate primary visual cortex early blind human . The magnitude occipital activation positively correlate subsequent performance verbal memory verb generation task . These result raise untested hypothesis primary visual cortex may neural substrate mediate superior verbal memory performance early blind individual . The purpose protocol test hypothesis . The first experiment identify magnitude activation cortical area associate successful verbal memory encode retrieval , verb generation , blind individual sight control . The expected outcome increase involvement visual cortex early blind group . In second experiment , test hypothesis disruption activity activate visual cortex ( use TMS ) deleterious effect verbal memory encode verb generation early blind subject , late blind subject sight control . The TMS experiment necessary identify cause-effect link occipital activation improve memory performance . Experiment 1 : We plan study early blind subject , late blind subject sight control encode retrieval episodic verbal memory , verb generation , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . The primary outcome measure number voxels significantly activate primary visual cortex early blind subject vs. late blind subject sight control . Experiment 2 : We plan apply rTMS leave primary visual cortex , leave prefrontal cortex , control site encode word retrieval word episodic memory ( primary task ) , verb generation task . Sighted volunteer , early blind late blind subject study . The primary outcome measure performance memory test rTMS apply different site different group . This investigation important provide novel evidence hierarchically high function primary visual cortex blind .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY : Early Blind Subjects : Only compliant early blind subject lose vision age 4 year due disease affect peripheral component visual system , i.e. , blind subject without neurological problem , normal MRI scan , select . Late Blind Subjects : Only compliant late blind subject lose vision age 4 year due disease affect peripheral component visual system , i.e. , blind subject without neurological problem , normal MRI scan , select . Sighted Controls : Only compliant adult healthy volunteer history neurological psychiatric illness able concentrate perform simple attentional task eligible . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Blind Subjects : Early late blind subject ( age 18 ) include protocol . Handedness assess Edinburgh inventory scale . All experimental session study outpatient basis . Sighted Subjects : Healthy sight ( normal correctedto normal vision ) match age , sex level education blind subject . Handedness assess Edinburgh inventory scale . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion study current medical surgical condition psychiatric neurological illness . Furthermore , individual medication potential influence nervous system function , history surgery metallic implant know history metallic particle eye , cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , neural stimulators , cochlear implant , pregnancy , history drug abuse , exclude study .</criteria>
