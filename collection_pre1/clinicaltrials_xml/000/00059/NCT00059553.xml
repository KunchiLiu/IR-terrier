	<detailed_description>Conventional rehabilitation follow spinal cord injury ( SCI ) emphasize functional gain strengthen compensation , use brace assistive device achieve mobility . Rehabilitation practice use compensatory approach base prevail assumption neural recovery possible follow SCI . Recent evidence contradicts assumption . Stimulated proper activation peripheral afferent associate walking , neuronal circuit may reorganize strengthen exist previously inactive descend connection local neural circuit . New approach locomotor recovery SCI utilize sensory information relate locomotion improve treadmill overground walk . Locomotor train velocity may critical , task-specific , activity-dependent parameter afford appropriate phasic , afferent input neural system promote neural plasticity . The purpose study evaluate effect train velocity long-term locomotor training program neurophysiological behavioral plasticity individual incomplete SCI . Sixteen patient incomplete SCI recruit participate study . Baseline evaluation include American Spinal Injury Association classification , rate-sensitive depression , phase-dependent H-reflex modulation self-selected fast overground walk velocity , MRI spine . Patients wear step activity monitor 48-hour period , quantify baseline walking activity level . All patient participate locomotor train program . Patients randomly assign either train self-selected treadmill velocity normal walk velocity . Patients 45 training session 9 week . Each training session include 30 minute walk . Interim test rat depression , spatial-temporal parameter walk , MRI , walk activity occur 9-week training period . Post-testing occur within 2 day last training session 1 month completion training . During month follow long-term training , patient instruct return self-selected routine activity daily live .</detailed_description>
