	<brief_summary>This study examine tissue glioma ( type brain tumor ) remove surgery gene mutation , change , think involve tumor formation growth . One common gene mutation cause receptor protein call epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) active state time , allow uncontrolled cell growth lead tumor formation . This study analyze blood tumor tissue sample patient glioma : - Changes EGF gene tumor - Changes gene , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) - Changes level EGF EGFR , proteins gene respond change level protein tumor - Changes EGF gene protein blood The study also determine production EGF EGFR obtain glioma blood cell derive tumor alter laboratory grow indefinitely culture . Patients 18 75 year age brain tumor require surgical treatment may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 3 10 day . They physical neurological examination , blood urine test , test , medically necessary , evaluate prepared surgery . During surgery , much tumor possible remove . A small amount tumor tissue collect study . No tissue remove study would otherwise remove . Some tissue use culture glioma cell rest frozen store examination , describe . If normal-appearing brain tissue remove surgery order enhance safety remove tumor , normal tissue study well . Brain tissue appear normal remove strictly research . During surgery day surgery , blood sample drawn catheter ( plastic tube ) place artery vein surgery . If catheter longer place , blood drawn needle vein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) important biological mediator normal growth repair critical epithelial tissue development maturation central nervous system , among function . EGF natural focus interest cancer research influence mitogenesis , proliferation , tumorigenesis . In addition , unregulated expression receptor , EGFR , identify common event neoplastic transformation . In patient malignant primary tumor brain , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , alteration EGFR expression level identify approximately 50 % patient . We postulate EGF-EGFR interaction may important development , progression , prognosis human glioma alteration EGF gene may predict potential glioma progression severity disease . Patients suspect , prior biopsy proof , WHO grade II-IV central nervous system ( CNS ) glial tumor ( ) see Surgical Neurology Branch , NINDS , consider entry study . Tissue sample tumor resect part standard care collect surgery preserve research . Blood sample also collect . Blood also collect anonymous normal volunteer donate blood NIH Blood Bank ; anonymous donor serve control .</detailed_description>
