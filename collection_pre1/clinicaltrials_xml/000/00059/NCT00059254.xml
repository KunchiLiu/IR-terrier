	<brief_summary>Differences diet fat convert energy could explain reported difference health effect among different class dietary fat ( e.g . monounsaturated vs. saturate ) . Recently , laboratory show monounsaturated fat turn energy readily saturate fat . These result may mean one feed monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) less saturated fatty acid ( SFA ) diet , body fat might accumulate low rate . This could affect risk obesity Type 2 Diabetes . This project two principal Specific Aims assess healthy young adult feed liquid formula contain either approximately equal amount MUFA SFA ( control ) much great amount MUFA much less SFA : 1 . To determine high intake MUFA reciprocally low intake SFA associate high rate fat oxidation . We hypothesize rate fat oxidation eat high subject randomize MUFA-enriched diet compare control . 2 . To measure energy intake require maintain constant body weight diet measure fat-free mass fat mass , dietary change . We hypothesize high MUFA diet need high energy intake require maintain constant body weight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our Preliminary Data indicate rate oleic acid ( OA ) oxidation ( amount/unit time ) 21 % increase compare palmitic acid ( PA ) fatty acid feed person intake . We hypothesize ratio OA PA diet increase , rate total fatty acid oxidation fed state also would increase metabolic condition . If principal hypothesis correct , overall daily fat balance might decrease human fed diet enrich OA . This would potential significance treatment prevention obesity . In order address hypothesis , propose follow double-masked , randomize control trial . Indirect calorimetry perform fed fast state young , healthy adult study two condition : 30-day , supervised , solid food diet 30-day formula diet . The subject randomize receive either Control Formula Diet macronutrient fatty acid composition solid food diet ( OA=PA=16.4 % total kcal ) High Oleic Acid Formula Diet ( OA=31.4 % total kcal PA=1.7 % total kcal ) . The Control Diets ( solid liquid ) provide amount ( per kcal ) total fat , saturate fat , OA similar 50-75th percentile intake young adult Americans intake total fat saturate fat recommend optimal long-term health . The High OA Formula Diet design simulate fat source Mediterranean Diet . The High OA diet result 167 % increase intake/kcal OA sn-1 sn-3 position dietary triacylglycerol . Using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , monitor body composition diet , adjust energy intake maintain constant body weight . The follow Specific Aims address : 1 . To determine high intake oleic acid ( reciprocally low intake palmitic acid ) associate high rate fat oxidation . We hypothesize rate fat oxidation ( g/hr ) fed state , adjust covariate effect rate fat oxidation solid food diet , high ( &gt; 30 % ) subject randomize OA-enriched diet compare control . Furthermore , hypothesize fat oxidation high express proportion energy expenditure OA-enriched formula group . That , expect energy expenditure feed state high feed OA-enriched diet . 2 . To measure energy intake require maintain constant body weight diet measure fat-free mass fat mass , dietary change . We hypothesize high rate fat oxidation high OA diet associate high energy intake require maintain constant body weight . 3 . To compare fat oxidation liquid formula diet observe solid food diet . We hypothesize fat oxidation increase feed OA-enriched diet . 4 . To measure thermic effect feed solid food formula diet period . We hypothesize high OA feeding associate high thermic effect feeding .</detailed_description>
