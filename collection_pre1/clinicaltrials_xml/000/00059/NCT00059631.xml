	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : -Establish dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) weekly mitoxantrone combination weekly PS-341 patient advance AI-PCa . Secondary objective : - Evaluate effect bortezomib mitoxantrone combination PSA level among patient baseline PSA level &gt; /=5 ng/mL treat near maximum tolerate dose . - Monitor effect escalate dos bortezomib combine mitoxantrone select parameter clinical benefit ( i.e . performance status , tumor-related symptom , measurable disease response ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Weekly Intravenous PS-341 ( Bortezomib ) Plus Mitoxantrone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mitoxantrone use treat bone pain advanced prostate cancer inhibit many protein cancer cell need multiply . Bortezomib member new class drug possess powerful broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity inhibit many protein cancer cell need survive multiply . Pre-study test include brief physical examination , vital sign ( weight , height , temperature , pulse , respiratory blood pressure ) , chest x-ray , EKG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) , echocardiogram , blood test , urine test , depend stage disease , CT scan and/or bone scan . During treatment , participant receive one dose Mitoxantrone combine one dose Bortezomib every week 4 week row follow 2 week rest ; call course . If side effect severe , Mitoxantrone Bortezomib infuse rapidly vein participant receive normal saline ( `` salt water solution '' ) rate 100ml/hour . They receive salt solution entire time treatment area . Participants vital sign ( temperature , pulse , breathing , blood pressure ) take one hour treatment . All side effect course one reviewed , serious side effect take place , participant may additional course . A pill may give mouth every day decrease risk clot formation pill diarrhea , nausea , and/or vomit doctor believe participant may need . Also treatment , participant complete physical examination physician designate representative ( nurse physician assistant ) week treatment . Bone Scan and/or CT Scan do necessary . Participants blood test do every week study . A special blood test , call 20S proteosome , do weekly Cycles 1 2 evaluate activity drug . Blood collect receive treatment 1-2 hour afterward . About 2 teaspoon blood collect time . Bone scan , chest x-ray and/or CT scan repeat study every course . Participants take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Side effect think related study drug renal failure result death , grade 3 rash require treatment steroid recur subsequent treatment . The maximum amount time participant remain study 8 course treatment . Long term follow-up participant include phone call every 6 month . This investigational study . Bortezomib approve FDA investigational use . Mitoxantrone approve FDA treatment symptom advance prostate cancer . Only Mitoxantrone commercially available . About 42 participant take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
