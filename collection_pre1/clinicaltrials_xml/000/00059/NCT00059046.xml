	<brief_summary>Serotonin chemical involve regulation emotion , anxiety , sleep , stress , body function . The purpose study use brain image technology study serotonin work brain . The serotonin transporter ( SERT ) regulate release sertonin throughout body . Until recently , radioactive chemical call tracer suitable view SERT activity . However , newly develop tracer call [ 11C ] DASB use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image view part brain use serotonin . Participants study screen medical psychiatric examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood urine test . This study comprise two part . During Part 1 , participant undergo whole-body PET scan . During Part 2 , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . At next study visit , participant one two PET head scan . If possible perform scan day , additional visit schedule second PET scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The serotonin transporter ( SERT ) modulate activity central serotonergic system SERT also primary target widely prescribe specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor . Until recently , suitable radioligands vivo image SERT available . However , recently develop PET radioligand , [ 11C ] DASB , appear suitable quantify SERT human . In two protocol approve CSRP submission IRB , plan use [ 11C ] DASB PET study pathophysiology SERT Parkinson 's disease OCD . This protocol create address criticism raise NIH RDRC committee external scientific review . 1 . The NIH RDRC ( Radioactive Drug Research Committee ) review protocol ask obtain human biodistribution data confirm expect low level radiation exposure , base upon prior study monkey . 2 . To address one criticism raise CSRP review , namely 1 ) quantify SERT bind parameter [ 11C ] DASB 10 normal subject 2 ) determine reliability reproducibility SERT binding parameter measurement perform second retest [ 11C ] DASB PET study subject , data available radioligand . PET scan perform intravenous injection 20 mCi [ 11C ] DASB 2 h , multiple arterial blood sample also obtain . The reproducibility SERT binding parameter assess calculate variability well intraclass correlation coefficient test/retest measurement . We expect 1 ) accurately quantify SERT bind parameter use [ 11C ] DASB PET image 2 ) [ 11C ] DASB PET measurement SERT bind reliable reproducible .</detailed_description>
