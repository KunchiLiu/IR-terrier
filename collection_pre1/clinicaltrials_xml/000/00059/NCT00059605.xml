	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dose DOTAP : Chol-fus1 give participant treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . This study attempt transfer gene ( fus1 ) cancer cell , use drug DOTAP : Cholesterol-fus1 . Researchers also study side effect experimental gene transfer different dos , conduct test see effect tumor size different dos . Experimental transfer fus1 gene human never try . Objectives : - Assess toxicity DOTAP : Cholesterol-fus1 Liposome Complex ( DOTAP : Chol-fus1 ) administer intravenously . - To determine maximal tolerate dose recommend phase II dose DOTAP : Chol-fus1 administer intravenously . - Assess expression fus1 follow intravenous delivery DOTAP : Chol-fus1 tumor normal bronchial epithelial cell biopsy . - Assess anti-cancer activity DOTAP : Chol-fus1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study IV DOTAP : Cholesterol-Fus1 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DOTAP : Chol-fus1 drug help transfer fus1 gene cancer cell . It think absence fus1 gene may involve development lung cancer tumor . The idea try replace gene lung cancer cell . Participants study must advance lung cancer worsen receive prior chemotherapy . Before treatment begin , participant physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine test perform . Women able child blood pregnancy test . Please note possible tumor could cause `` positive '' pregnancy test result , pregnant . If pregnancy test come back positive , reason and/or research staff believe may error , additional test may do confirm rule pregnancy . The participant 's tumor measure use CT , PET/CT MRI scan . Participants also EKG ( heart function test ) MUGA scan echocardiogram . A treatment cycle study 3 week . Participants receive pre-medications dexamethasone diphenhydramine prior infusion DOTAP : Chol-fus1 try lessen potential reaction infusion . The participant receive short infusion DOTAP : Chol-fus1 vein every 3 week . Participants examine doctor treatment . In addition , participant return clinic day 2 , 3 , 8 first dose blood test do , vital sign check , look side effect . After every two treatment cycle 6 week , participant 's tumor measure use CT MRI scan . Participants continue receive treatment tumor get bad , side effect become severe , maximum 6 treatment give . Treatment may continue participant continue benefit treatment end plan 6 treatment treat physician , principle investigator , advisor FDA agree . Participants return clinic 3 week last dose DOTAP : Chol-fus1 vital sign check look side effect . After treatment finish , participant contact every 3 month update health gather information treatment ( ) receive . Participants enter give dose level able receive high dose study . A group 3 participant receive DOTAP : Chol-fus1 vein dose level . After treat 3 participant give dose level , participant observe 2 week evaluate toxicity . The information show participant develop severe side effect , refer dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , record compute chance toxicity . This information use help select dose level next group participant . The goal find dose level 10 % participant develop severe side effect ( dose-limiting toxicity ) . All participant treat dose-escalation fashion start low level . The next dose level move calculation side effect show high dose need . However , skip dos allow . This investigational study . Up 51 individual receive study drug study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically document nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) 2 . For NSCLC subject : Locally advance , unresectable , incurable stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) stage IV NSCLC , recurrent NSCLC potentially curable radiotherapy surgery . Patients must receive least one prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen NSCLC . For SCLC subject : Extensive disease recurrent disease initial treatment limited disease . Patients must receive prior platinumbased chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy . All subject : There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . 3 . Preference give patient tumor amenable biopsy . In expansion cohort MTD , patient must tumor amenable biopsy must consent biopsy . 4 . Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; = 70 % , Zubrod Performance Status &lt; = 1 . 5 . Negative serum pregnancy test ( serum HCG ) female childbearing potential . Since betaHCG may falsely elevate result malignancy , woman childbearing potential elevate serum betaHCG level eligible enrollment two Transvaginal Ultrasound ( TVUS ) scan one week apart serial betaHCG level two week apart inconsistent pregnancy Gynecology consult ensure beta HCG level value high enough see pregnancy TVUS . Subjects must agree practice effective birth control study period . 6 . Negative serology Human Immunodeficiency Virus . 7 . Patients must &gt; /= 4 week beyond major surgical procedure thoracotomy , laparotomy joint replacement , must &gt; /= 1.5 week beyond minor surgical procedure biopsy subcutaneous tumor , pleuroscopy , etc , must evidence wound dehiscence , active wound infection , comparable major residual complication surgery . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500 * 10**9/mm**3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000 * 10**9/mm**3 . Prothrombin time ( PT ) Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.25 time institutional upper limit normal . 8 . Adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min . 9 . Adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl SGOT SGPT &lt; /= 1.5 * upper limit normal . 10 . FEV1 correct DLCO &gt; /= 40 % predict . 11 . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis treat eligible follow criterion meet : No history seizures precede 6 month . Definitive treatment must complete ≥4weeks prior registration . Subjects must steroids administered brain metastasis related symptom ≥2 week . Posttreatment image within 2 week registration must demonstrate stability regression brain metastasis . 12 . Stable cardiac condition leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % . 13 . Patients must voluntarily sign inform consent accordance institutional policy . 1 . Females pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Patients receive investigational therapy , monoclonal antibody bevacizumab cetuximab , receive radiotherapy skull , spine , thorax pelvis within 30 day entry protocol . Patients permit received palliative radiotherapy extremity provide least 14 day elapse since completion therapy , provide patient receive 10 radiotherapy fraction dose high 30 Gy site , provide skull , spine , thorax pelvis radiotherapy field . 3 . Patients brain metastasis ( except allow inclusion criterion # 11 ) . Neurological assessment use determine brain metastasis . 4 . Active systemic viral , bacterial fungal infection require treatment . 5 . Patients serious concurrent illness psychological , familial , sociological , geographical , concomitant condition , opinion investigator , would permit adequate followup compliance study protocol . 6 .
