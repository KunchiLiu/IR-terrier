	<brief_title>MDX-060 Monoclonal Antibody Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability MDX-060 monoclonal antibody patient refractory relapse CD30-positive lymphoma . - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy ( antilymphoma activity ) drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody IV 90 minute weekly 4 week . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos MDX-060 monoclonal antibody maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 16 patient accrued receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody MTD . Patients follow monthly 3 month every 3 month 18 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
