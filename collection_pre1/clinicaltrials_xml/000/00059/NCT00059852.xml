	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy gemcitabine work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Combining gemcitabine erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine gemcitabine erlotinib treat patient metastatic breast cancer previously treat anthracycline and/or taxane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With An Anthracycline and/or Taxane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine anti-tumor activity erlotinib gemcitabine patient metastatic breast cancer previously treat anthracycline and/or taxane . - Determine adverse event profile regimen patient . - Determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor HER-2 receptor intensity serum concentration impact clinical response patient treat regimen . - Determine impact genetic difference proteins involved drug response ( transport , metabolism , mechanism action ) clinical response adverse event associate gemcitabine patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV day 1 8 oral erlotinib day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response follow every 6 week 5 year disease progression ( PD ) . Patients discontinue study therapy reason follow every 3 month PD every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
