	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cerebral vasculopathy stroke among serious complication sickle cell disease . Not every patient develop central nervous system disease child evidence cognitive impairment 10 % overt stroke forestall transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) screening , identification individual great risk estimate maximal cerebral blood flow commence prophylactic transfusion . The basis recommendation study child age 2-years stroke prevalent . Transfusion without serious considerable risk measure delay prevent cerebral vasculopathy would valuable . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) reduce morbidity mortality sickle cell anemia adult ; likely pertain child . Unknown effect HU infant young child whether successful use reduce risk sickle cerebrovascular disease . If HU associate reduced TCD velocity , safe infant , medical implication would high . Baby TCD ancillary study initial phase BABY HUG , multicenter clinical trial fund NHLBI . In BABY HUG , infant ( 12-17 month old ) sickle cell disease ( SCD ) randomize either hydroxyurea ( HU ) placebo follow 24 month . There broad interest effect hydroxyurea central nervous system child study . Stroke occur age 1 year evidence process cerebrovascular disease start early patient . The Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease document high risk incident stroke 2-6 year age group . The study response initiative Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release June , 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study perform TCD 40 child BABY HUG baseline end study . TCD proven useful estimation stroke risk child SCD age 2-16 year , center paradigm primary stroke prevention recommend National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute base STOP study . If stroke risk could detect early stage ( i.e. , young 2-16 year-old subject STOP ) , physician would able provide preventive treatment earlier stage disease . TCD perform 24 month treatment . TCD performance read centrally control STOP-consistent . The investigator experience TCD infant , age target parent study . TCD compare HU control group , treatment . In addition , investigator access data 400 child 2-4 year age range STOP screening program perform mid- late 1990s . Since patient HU transfusion dataset use give estimate prevalence high stroke risk without HU treatment , compare HU group Baby HUG , add another important comparative dimension analysis . Although sample size purposely small design parent study , large difference prevalence high-risk patient end treatment could detect Baby TCD .</detailed_description>
