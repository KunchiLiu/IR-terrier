	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) complex disorder constitute major health problem Western society . The study assess unknown genetic background CHD investigate common familial dyslipidemia predispose CHD , familial combine hyperlipidemia ( FCHL ) . The population prevalence FCHL estimate 1-2 percent disorder affect 10-20 percent family premature CHD . In FCHL , serum cholesterol , triglyceride , elevate . Both environmental genetic factor suggest affect complex FCHL phenotype . Since molecular basis FCHL unknown , significant number genetically predisposed individual remain unidentified exposed premature CHD . The study use sample genetically isolate population Finland . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator use unique study sample genetically isolate population Finland apply molecular genetic tool first restrict genetic locus identify characterize causative gene underlie FCHL disorder chromosome 1q21 . Specifically , first aim restrict region dissect different component trait . They genotype extend study sample consist available family member 61 FCHL family dense set microsatellite marker single nucleotide polymorphisms fully utilize refine quantitative phenotype information fine mapping . Second , aim build transcript map critical region 1q21-q23 identify causative FCHL gene among regional candidate gene . This region 1q21-q23 orthologous region mouse chromosome 3 , locus ( Hyplip 1 ) combine hyperlipidemia identify . They analyze human homolog Hyplip 1 gene disappointingly , human Hyplip 1 gene find 10 Mb peak linkage marker evidence emerge Hyplip 1 causative gene FCHL . Their target identify FCHL gene currently gene show strong association near linkage peak . The FCHL gene functionally characterize prove biological dysfunction . Characterizing one gene FCHL would improve understand molecular mechanism cardiovascular disease , potentially lead accurate diagnosis , treatment prevention .</detailed_description>
