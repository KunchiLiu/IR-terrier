	<brief_title>Oblimersen Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate metastatic renal cancer combination G3139 plus α-Interferon ( α-IFN ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical toxicity combination . II . To evaluate impact G3139 plus α-IFN molecular target involve regulation apoptosis tumor cell lymphocytes . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics G3139 give α-IFN dose schedule . IV . To evaluate potential toxicity combination cell immune system . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 interferon alfa subcutaneously day 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 course 1 day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive additional 2 course past CR . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-41 patient accrue study within 20-24 month .</detailed_description>
