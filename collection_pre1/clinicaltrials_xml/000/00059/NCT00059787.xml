	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect give erlotinib together carboplatin paclitaxel see well work treat patient stage III stage IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Biological therapy erlotinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish whether addition OSI-774 ( Tarceva ) combination paclitaxel carboplatin encourage pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate patient Stage III optimally cytoreduced ( stratum 1 ) Stage III suboptimally cytoreduced Stage IV ( stratum 2 ) ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma use front line therapy . II . To determine degree type toxicity associate combined regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish baseline epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , truncate EGFR ( EGFRvIII ) , phosphorylated EGFR ( pEGFR ) relate signal transduction pathway protein expression level ( mitogen activate protein kinase p-ERK , AKT phosphorylation Her2/neu ) tumor sample obtain pretreatment , correlate achieve pCR . II . To describe change EGFR , EGFRvIII , pEGFR expression level relate signal transduction pathway expression occur treatment OSI-774 combination chemotherapy . III . To determine effect addition OSI-774 ( Tarceva ) combination paclitaxel carboplatin progression-free interval patient Stage III optimally cytoreduced ( stratum 1 ) Stage III suboptimally cytoreduced Stage IV ( stratum 2 ) ovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma use front line therapy . IV . To determine tolerability twelve month maintenance treatment OSI-774 patient achieve pCR , measure progression-free interval population . V. To document cutaneous effect OSI 774 prospectively , correlate degree skin rash clinical translational endpoint . OUTLINE : This non-randomized study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( stage III optimal residual disease v stage III suboptimal residual disease stage IV ) . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive oral erlotinib daily . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve pathologic complete response , initially suboptimally debulked response , patient elect undergo surgical reassessment achieve complete clinical response receive maintenance erlotinib additional 12 month .</detailed_description>
