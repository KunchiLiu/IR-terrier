	<brief_title>Mental Effort Muscle Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Training involves heavy load resistance strengthen muscle . Recent data suggest substantial voluntary strength gain achieve train involve low resistance strong mental effort . In contrast , individual train low intensity contraction low mental effort show improvement strength . This study evaluate relationship mental effort muscle strength improvement compare improvement muscle strength participant train different level mental effort . In addition evaluate muscle strength , study also examine neural mechanism underlie muscle strength improvement . Four group volunteer ( 65 year old ) participate train program direct elbow-flexor muscle . One group train intensity near level maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC group ) ; second group train high mental effort , low muscle intensity contraction ( HME group ) ; third group train low mental effort , low muscle intensity elbow-flexion contraction ( LME group ) ; fourth ( control ) group train participate strength test . Training perform every weekday 12 week . Participants evaluate functional MRI ( fMRI ) , EEG-derived motor activity-related cortical potential ( MRCP ) , surface EMG signal , MRI T2 relaxation time . Preliminary analysis result show HME group gain 13 % strength , LME group show statistically insignificant 6 % change , no-practice control group show change elbow flexor muscle strength . We expect MVC group high strength gain among four group .</detailed_description>
