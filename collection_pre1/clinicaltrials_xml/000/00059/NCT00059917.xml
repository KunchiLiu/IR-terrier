	<brief_title>Polyglutamate Camptothecin Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose polyglutamate camptothecin ( CT-2106 ) patient advanced malignancy . - Determine tolerability drug patient . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Determine disease response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive polyglutamate camptothecin ( CT-2106 ) IV 10 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive 2 additional course beyond confirmation complete response . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CT-2106 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 3 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-48 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
