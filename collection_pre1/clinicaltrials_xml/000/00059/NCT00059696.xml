	<brief_summary>After stroke , many patient leave impaired arm . Restricting use good arm may improve use bad arm . In `` Constraint-Induced Movement '' therapy ( CI therapy ) , good arm put sling force increase use bad arm . The bad arm also train day several week . This study evaluate effectiveness CI therapy patient chronic disability stroke whether rate recovery decrease elderly patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke afflict 700,000 Americans year . Behavioral technique impact plasticity nervous system need incorporate practical , evidence-based therapeutic intervention . This especially true time duration treatment reimburse third party payer shorten . CI therapy derive basic research animal subject human volunteer . Randomized , control study indicate substantially reduce motor deficit patient mild moderate chronic stroke increase independence period year . CI therapy involve motor restriction less affected upper extremity period 2 3 week concurrently train affect upper limb . This give rise mass concentrated repetitive use affect extremity . CI therapy lead large increase use-dependent cortical reorganization involve recruitment region brain innervation affect extremity movement . One main aim propose research determine CI therapy use therapeutic success increase amount real-world extremity use patient chronic stroke . Another aim ascertain whether locus lesion size , determine MRI , factor influence extent motor function recover use CI therapy . Eighty patient chronic stroke randomly assign receive either CI therapy General Fitness control intervention . Two year study entry , patient control group cross receive CI therapy . Primary outcome measure laboratory motor function test amount extremity use real-world setting . Changes psychosocial functioning also measure .</detailed_description>
