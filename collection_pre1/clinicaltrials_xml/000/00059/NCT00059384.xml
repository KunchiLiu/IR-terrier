	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV drug usually give patient fix , standardized dos . This study investigate alternative way dose anti-HIV drug improve viral control . Study hypothesis : The optimal dosage regimen require obtain maximum benefit antiretroviral therapy achieve strategy control pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic variability among patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Dosing Strategy Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While optimism benefit antiretroviral therapy remain justified , response therapy vary widely . This variability arise difference among patient virologic , immunologic , behavioral , pharmacologic factor , impact therapeutic success . Antiretroviral agent presently administer adult standard fixed dos . However , dose produce systemic intracellular concentration patient . Recent research show adjusting dos antiretroviral agent achieve target concentration plasma associate improved anti-HIV response compare standard dose therapy . This study extend paradigm concentration-controlled therapy develop intensified pharmacologic regimens patient experience persistent viremia receive antiretroviral therapy . Two approach investigate : 1 ) regimen target concentration antiretroviral drug 50th 75th percentile expect concentration adult ; 2 ) novel regimen target concentration base upon desire ratio phenotypic drug susceptibility ( IC90 ) concentration pharmacologically active moiety , specifically intracellular nucleoside triphosphates unbound protease nonnucleoside inhibitor . Participants randomize either one investigational approach ( Cohort II ) control group receive standard dose therapy ( Cohort I ) . There two study visit first month ; first month , study visit schedule monthly five additional month . Study visit include laboratory test virologic immunologic parameter , pharmacokinetic sampling , adherence counsel monitoring .</detailed_description>
