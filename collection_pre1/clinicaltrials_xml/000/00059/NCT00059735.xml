	<brief_title>A Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Study E7070 Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) account approximately 2 % cancer incidence increase worldwide death 100,000 patient per year . About 50 % RCC patient inoperable metastatic disease surgery perform . RCC also consider resistant radiotherapy cytotoxic chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness E7070 assess progression free survival , tumor response rate , duration response/stable disease , survival time . E7070 administer single iv infusion 60 minute Day 1 cycle . Patients continue treatment E7070 longer clinical benefit disease progression , toxicity lead patient withdrawal .</detailed_description>

Blood transfusion growth factor aid hematological recovery within 2 week prior start study treatment . Any following abnormal screen liver function test : serum bilirubin &gt; = 1.5 x upper normal limit ( ULN ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALAT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( ASAT ) &gt; = 2.5 x ULN ( unless relate liver metastases case &gt; = 5 x ULN ) . The follow abnormal screen renal function test : either serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( estimate serum creatinine ) &lt; 40 mL/minute . Prior radiotherapy ( except palliative ) . Participation investigational drug study immunotherapy within 4 week precede treatment start . History hypersensitivity sulphonamides . Any concurrent previous malignancy different tumor type within 5 year start E7070 treatment except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . Significant disease , Investigator 's opinion would exclude patient study . Surgically resectable metastatic disease . Legal incapacity .</criteria>
