	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose protocol 1 . To comprehensively evaluate patient autoinflammatory disease clinically , genetically immunologically autoinflammatory disease clinic NIH . 2 . To follow patient autoinflammatory Diseases genetically define include Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease ( NOMID ) , severe clinical phenotype Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes ( CAPS ) , Deficiency IL-1 Receptor Antagonist ( DIRA ) , Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis Lipodystrophy Elevated temperature ( CANDLE ) , STING-Associated Vasculopathy onset Infancy ( SAVI ) , genetically undefined autoinflammatory disorder determine long-term disease outcome . 3 . To develop biomarkers help u assess disease activity response treatment . 4 . To assess eligibility affected patient inclusion ongoing plan treatment protocol . Goal : The goal study understand underlie immune dysregulation , identify genetic cause translate finding novel treatment improve patient disease outcome . Eligibility : - Patients know NOMID/CAPS , DIRA , CANDLE , SAVI , CRMO , Still 's Disease , yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory disease . - Healthy adult pediatric relative . - Volunteers Design : Participants evaluate NIH 2-5 day . All participant detail medical history , physical exam , blood test evaluation depend extend autoinflammatory disease . Participants may also expect follow assessment : 1 . Clinical test help assess organ damage functional impact hear vision , memory learning test . 2 . Imaging study characterize organ involvement inflammatory disease include : X-rays , CT scan , special MRIs , bone scan . 3 . Laboratory evaluation include clinical marker disease activity , research sample genetic study , blood sample cytokine/biomarker assessment , gene expression profiling. &lt; TAB &gt; 4 . Completion questionnaires assess disease activity quality life . 5 . If indicate , procedure may administer include : lumbar puncture CNS inflammation suspect skin biopsy skin inflammation present . gastrointestinal procedure clinically indicate . 6 . Patients research skin biopsy take . Participants may return single follow-up visit long term-follow depend disease willingness follow long-term .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Natural History , Pathogenesis , Outcome Autoinflammatory Diseases ( NOMID / CAPS , DIRA , CANDLE , SAVI , CRMO , Still 's Disease , Behcet 's Disease , Other Undifferentiated Autoinflammatory Diseases )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory multisystem disease group diseases characterize recurrent episode systemic inflammation well organ specific inflammation involve skin , eye , joint , bone , serosal surface , inner ear , brain . The prominent role IL-1 pathogenesis disorder first become evident discovery mutation CIAS1 cause cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome ( CAPS ) include severe presentation Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease ( NOMID ) . Over year identify additional autoinflammatory disease include DIRA ( Deficiency IL-1 Receptor Antagonist ) , disease cause mutation IL1RN . Therapy anakinra , IL-1 receptor antagonist , life-saving . We also study additional rare diseases IL-1 mediate include CANDLE ( chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis lipodystrophy elevate temperature ) cause mutation proteasome component , recently SAVI ( STING associate vasculopathy onset infancy ) cause mutation TMEM173 . Many additional autoinflammatory phenotype genetic cause , include autoinflammatory disorder even clinically define . Clinical condition include spectrum CRMO ( Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis ) , Still disease , Beh ( SqrRoot ) ( Beta ) et disease ( BD ) possible involvement IL-1 dysregulation also interest.. In research protocol seek comprehensively evaluate affect patient clinically , genetically , immunologically , endocrinologically . In addition intend evaluate longterm outcome biomarkers time observation . Eligibility ongoing plan treatment protocol determine screen patient protocol . We plan evaluate patient consultative basis autoinflammatory diseases possible enrollment study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients NOMID / CAPS DIRA , CANDLE , SAVI , mutation positive disease fulfill clinical criterion disease . Patients noninfectious osteolytic bone lesion Patients fulfill criterion definite probable Still disease Patients fulfill criterion definite probable Behcet disease Patients suspect autoinflammatory disease There : No age limit Patients legal guardian need able willing give inform consent pediatric patient need willing assent protocol whenever possible . Relatives patient autoinflammatory disease healthy volunteer may include genetic testing . The genetic evaluation conduct collaboration Dr. Fleisher laboratory Clinical Center laboratory group . See genetics consent form . We may also collect blood serum RNA analyse establish cohort healthy control match age , gender ethnicity study patient . Skin biopsy research may request patient , patient relative healthy volunteer EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Active malignancy medical condition opinion investigator would warrant exclusion Inability provide consent Inability return follow visit</criteria>
