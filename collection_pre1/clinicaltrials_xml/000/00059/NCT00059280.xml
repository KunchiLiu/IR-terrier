	<brief_summary>Pompe disease ( also know glycogen storage disease type II , `` GSD-II '' ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient Pompe disease , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . This study conduct evaluate safety effectiveness recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase ( rhGAA ) potential enzyme replacement therapy Pompe disease . Patients diagnose infantile-onset Pompe disease less equal 6 month old study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : The patient patient 's legal guardian ( ) must provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure perform ; The patient must clinical symptom ( documented medical record ) infantileonset Pompe disease . In addition , patient must : a. endogenous GAA activity le 1 % mean normal range assess cultured skin fibroblast ; AND b. cardiomyopathy ( LVMI great 65 g/m2 ) echocardiography ; The patient must older 26 week 0 day , he/she receives first dose rhGAA ; The patient his/her legal guardian ( ) must ability comply clinical protocol . Exclusion criterion : Symptoms respiratory insufficiency , include : . Oxygen saturation le 90 % room air measure pulse oximetry ; OR b. venous PCO2 great 55 mmHg room air OR arterial PCO2 great 40 mmHg room air ; c. ventilator use time enrollment ; Major congenital abnormality ; Clinically significant organic disease ( exception symptom relate Pompe disease ) , include clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal disease , medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , would preclude participation trial potentially decrease survival ; Use investigational product within 30 day prior study enrollment ; Received enzyme replacement therapy GAA source .</criteria>
