	<brief_summary>Shingles infection commonly see child weaken immune system ( immunocompromised child ) . The immune system weaken result medication patient receive cancer serious illness result bone marrow transplantation . Shingles child weaken immune system may spread throughout body instance may life-threatening . Acyclovir medication routinely use treat immunocompromised child shingle order prevent spread shingle help heal faster . Acyclovir also give bone marrow transplant patient prevent reactivation HSV infection . Valacyclovir new drug metabolize ( broken body ) acyclovir . Valacyclovir give mouth study do adult show effective acyclovir give mouth . The purpose study - study pharmacology drug ( body handle drug ) , - determine oral Valacyclovir safely give child shingle , - determine type side effect occur oral Valacyclovir give immunocompromised child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients shingle : Patients shingle receive oral Valacyclovir three time day 5 10 day . For first 24 hour treatment , patient admit hospital close monitoring . If problem first 24 hour patient may discharge take medicine home . After discharge patient see examined clinic daily first 5 day , day 7 every day shingle show evidence healing . A final physical exam blood test occur day 21 . A small amount fluid take one shingles lesion use fine needle verify presence virus cause shingle . This do first dose Valacyclovir 3 day later . Blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) perform twice week monitor toxic effect drug . Blood sample draw evaluate pharmacology drug ( body handle drug ) . Nine blood sample ( less one teaspoon ) obtain 24 hour first day treatment . The total amount blood drawn 9 teaspoon ( 3 tablespoon ) . For child toilet train , urine collect 12 hour start study . This urine use evaluate kidney function , pharmacology valacyclovir . If unacceptable side effect evidence disease spreading , despite Valacyclovir 48 hour , take study start acyclovir vein . Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation : Patients undergo bone marrow transplant receive single dose valacyclovir place first schedule dose acyclovir . They receive acyclovir outline physician . Blood sample draw evaluate pharmacology ( body handle drug ) study drug . Fifteen blood sample ( less one teaspoon ) obtain 24 hour first day treatment . The total amount blood drawn 9 teaspoon ( 3 tablespoon . The total amount blood drawn blood work include routine blood test well pharmacokinetics great 5 % patient total blood volume . This amount blood loss safe amount even small child</detailed_description>
