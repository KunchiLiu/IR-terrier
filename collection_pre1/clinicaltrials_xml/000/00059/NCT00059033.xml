	<brief_summary>This study conduct test patient primary chronic autonomic failure ( CAF ) learn disorder , include pure autonomic failure , multiple system atrophy , Parkinson 's disease autonomic failure , autoimmune autonomic neuropathy . Healthy volunteer patient primary CAF 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test : - Blood study , include arterial catheter insertion measure blood pressure collect arterial blood sample , blood flow study use sensor apply skin pressure cuff around limb , blood draw genetic study . - Bladder motility : Ultrasound test bladder function . - Electrocardiogram heart ultrasound . - Responses change temperature : Warm water room temperature water pass watertight pad apply back front body body temperature measure . - Gastrointestinal motility : Bowel sound record use microphone place abdomen . - Lower body negative pressure : The low body place airtight barrel-like chamber . Some air suck barrel , cause blood pool leg , occur stand . - Lumbar puncture : A needle inserted space bone low back collect small sample cerebrospinal fluid . - Microdialysis measure level chemical body fluid certain tissue . A solution pass thin tube insert skin . Chemicals body tissue enter solution . The solution collect chemical level measure . - PET scanning : A nuclear medicine test produce image body organ . For patient urinary problem , catheter insert bladder start scan . - Pupillometry : The pupil eye measure use special camera light-controlled room . - QSART . A small amount brain chemical apply skin tiny amount electricity , sweat nearby patch skin measure . - Measurement saliva production , use cotton-like material place teeth gum absorb saliva . - Skin electrical conduction test , use sensor skin measure sweat production . - Skin core temperature measurement use sensor skin ear canal . - Speech swallow assessment patient speech swallow difficulty . - Stress echocardiogram : A catheter place subject 's arm sampling blood give drug subject exercise . During test , blood pressure , pulse rate , EKG continuously monitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : In dysautonomias , alter function one component autonomic nervous system adversely affect health . Primary dysautonomias classify clinically chronic autonomic failure ( CAF ) syndromes include pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , Parkinson disease ( PD ) autonomic failure ( manifest especially neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) ) . Clinical assessment alone often inadequate correct diagnosis provide insight mechanism identify new therapeutic target . This protocol call continuous development assessment physiological , neuropharmacologic , neurochemical , neuroimaging , clinical laboratory approach , identify lesion type sit CAF improve diagnosis , increase mechanistic understanding , incite novel therapeutic . PAF , MSA , PD exemplify alpha synucleinopathies , deposit protein alpha-synuclein occur Lewy body catecholamine-producing neuron ( PD , PAF ) cytoplasm glial cell ( MSA ) . Only Lewy body form synucleinopathy consistently associate loss catecholaminergic neuron . Under protocol obtain evidence patient Lewy body disease decreased ability take intra-neuronal catecholamine cytoplasm storage vesicle . Cytoplasmic catecholamine cytotoxic , enzyme-catalyzed conversion highly reactive catecholaldehydes . By study CAF patient hope make discovery yield unifying , integrative concept pathogenesis different clinical manifestation Lewy body disease . Autonomic function test protocol also require screening purpose entry protocols Clinical Neurocardiology Section . Moreover , comprehensive autonomic function test request patient NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program . Finally , long-term project member Autonomic Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium apply test study natural history neurogenic OH . Study Population : The study population consist patient idiopathic , primary , CAF , emphasis PAF , MSA , PD . Comparison group include healthy volunteer ( HVs ) , patient PD OH , patient iatrogenic CAF bilateral thoracic sympathectomy . Design : Subjects undergo multiple physiological , neuropharmacologic , neurochemical , neuroimaging , test , see result different modality agree point specific sit types lesion . Outcome Measures : Physiological outcome measure include hemodynamic response Valsalva maneuver , orthostasis , altered temperature skin back . Neuropharmacologic measure include cardiovascular response test drug probe specific component autonomic nervous system . Neurochemical measure include plasma , cerebrospinal fluid , microdialysate , urine , skin biopsy tissue level catecholamine relate compound . Neuroimaging measure include positron emission tomographic scan injection 18F-dopamine , 18F-DOPA , 13N-ammonia , 11C-methylreboxetine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject patient know suspected primary CAF , base referral information confirmation clinical diagnosis intake evaluation . They classify result intake evaluation undergo comprehensive autonomic function test . Patients primary iatrogenic CAF include . Control patient previously diagnose PD MSA without OH , confirm time intake evaluation . Healthy Volunteers 18 year old old include . People increase risk PD CAF consent study patient ( e.g. , enable DNA extraction storage ) . All subject must able provide consent participate exist Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) place . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : People younger 18 year old exclude . Risk : A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator Clinical Director , protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . This include risk associate air travel NIH . A candidate subject exclude , opinion Principal Investigator Clinical Director , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . Disqualifying Conditions A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition hepatic renal failure ( define serum creatinine 1.5 g/dL ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , refractory ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic coronary heart disease . Patients exclude participation result intake evaluation lead diagnosis secondary form CAF , diabetic autonomic neuropathy . Candidate subject unable give consent exist DPA place exclude . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study . Medications Patients know suspected allergy hypersensitivity test drug exclude receive drug . Patients discontinue medication patient patient doctor discus Principal Investigator , Research Nurse , Nurse Practitioner . If decided discontinuing medication would unsafe , patient may exclude part study . Herbal Medicines Dietary Supplements Certain herbal medicine dietary supplement know suspect interfere experimental result , herbal medicine dietary supplement may disallow enrollment study . For many herbal medicine dietary supplement , mechanism action therefore possible effect experimental result unknown . In case subject wish continue herbal medicine dietary supplement study , search available medical literature fail identify effect know expect interfere experimental result , subject may participate . Practical Limitations Patients feel would difficult insert catheter vein may exclude . Subjects expect clinically tolerate lying still procedures may exclude . Pregnancy Pregnant lactate woman exclude protocol overall . In woman childbearing potential , blood test pregnancy do 24 hour initial test ( except obtain medical history physical examination ) test involve radioactivity protocol . Repeat pregnancy test do procedure drug administration protocol take place one week previous pregnancy test . Participants start remain study pregnancy test positive . Refusal Undergo Certain Procedures Candidate subject exclude refuse undergo certain procedure . These : ( 1 ) IV catheter ; ( 2 ) electrocardiogram ; ( 3 ) blood drawing ; ( 4 ) DNA extraction storage ( patient nonHV control ) ; ( 5 ) DNA analysis ( patient nonHV control ) .</criteria>
