	<brief_summary>This study examine loss balance elderly . Falls due balance problem major health issue old people , often result bone fracture bodily injury , functional decline . In addition , fear fall lead elderly people restrict movement social activity , cause depress mood decrease enjoyment life . Risk factor fall elderly include stand position old people usually experience balance problem , lean forward backward . This study examine unstable position brain mechanism associated loss balance elderly . Normal volunteer 20 90 year age may eligible study . Candidates must good health , difficulty perform activity daily live , must able walk least 400 meter ( 1/4 mile ) . They screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants undergo follow three experiment : - Movement task : The subject stand platform marker place different part body record body movement . A cap electrode ( metal disk ) place head electrocardiographic ( EEG ) record electrical activity brain ( brain wave ) experiment . The position foot platform measure . While stand platform , subject lean forward backward far possible without lose balance . ( Subjects secure safety harness prevent actual fall . ) The task repeat 5 time . The experiment last 2 hour . - Postural response task : This study identical first , except subject voluntarily lean forward backward , push device cause forward backward movement . The experiment last 1 2 hour . - Perceptual task : The subject sit front computer screen watch postural movement human body model forward backward direction . When subject recognize unstable position movement , press computer mouse . An EEG record brain activity task , last 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A number study explore role visual , vestibular somatosensory system control upright posture . However , cortical control postural stability , general , role higher cognitive function assessment postural stability , specific , less study . It well establish certain feature postural control change advance year life stability posture problem elderly . However , neural mechanism postural stability decline age make old adult prone fall identify specifically . To characterize specific cause fall elderly problematic , human posture product extremely complex dynamical system like physical activity undergo dramatic change organization throughout life-span . In previous research show existence specialize neural detector embody spatiotemporal pattern brain activiation ( Slobounov et al. , 200 ) capable discrimination unstable posture dynamic situation . We propose neural detector may deteriorate aging , result difficulty ( ) initiate compensatory postural adjustment balance danger , ( b ) discriminate relevant irrelevant information control upright posture . This documented via change behavioral correlate postural control spatiotemporal pattern brain activation function advance age . Accordingly , purpose study investigate age-related cortical control postural stability combine electroencephalography postural control measure . This do subject physically approach postural stability boundary subject solves cognitive task identify unstable posture dynamic situation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects enrol balance study within range 2090 year old ; good health ; report difficulty need help perform selfcare instrumental activity daily live ; able walk least 400 meter . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We unable study people substantial congitive impairment base mental status screening test ; history cardiovascular disease ( include angina , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular disease ) ; cancer ; neurological disease ; birth defect ; kidney liver disease ; gastrointestinal ( G.I . ) disease ; musculoskeletal disorder ( cause pathological weakness and/or chronic pain ) ; important sensory deficit condition precludes test standard neurophyschological test . Pregnant woman exclude study . In addition , follow criterion consider marker pathological condition use exclusion criterion study enrollment : 1 . HIV virus infection ; 2 . WBC great 12,000 ML ; 3 .
