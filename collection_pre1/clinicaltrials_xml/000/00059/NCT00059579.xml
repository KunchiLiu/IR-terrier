	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine brain regulates emotion healthy people patient major depression anhedonia ( loss feeling pleasure thing normally give pleasure ) . Healthy normal volunteer patient 18 50 year age major depression , without significant anhedonia , eligible study . Candidates screen psychiatric interview , physical examination include blood urine sample , electrocardiogram , questionnaire emotion . Participants perform monetary reward task lie MRI scanner . The task similar playing computer video game possibility win cash . The amount cash largely dependent subject 's performance . The accumulated amount cash earn session fluctuate depend subject 's continuing performance level . That , single session , subject could lose money earn early session performance later session good earlier . MRI picture take performance task . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 1 1-1/2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anhedonia one two key diagnostic criterion major depressive disorder ( MDD ) since publication The Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Third Edition , yet little known neural substrate . Neuroimaging study identify numerous brain region think involve MDD . Most study deal MDD syndromal entity , surprisingly , yield quite variable result respect area brain identify , nature functional change ( i.e. , decrease increase activity ) , lateralization , correlation clinical symptom . Clinical heterogeneity lack symptom-specific target presumably among factor contribute variability . The hypothesis functionally impaired mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway may comprise part neural substrate underlie core MDD symptom anhedonia loss motivation propose . Nevertheless , roles brain reward mechanism mediate anhedonia MDD remain unclear . Availability appropriate experimental paradigm use empirically measure anhedonia prerequisite test hypothesis . Recent study use monetary incentive paradigm couple neuroimaging technique identify hemodynamic response structure serve part mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway processing reward healthy human . We hypothesize anhedonia MDD associate impairment brain reward mechanism dysfunction orbital ventromedial frontal cortex involve impaired hedonic attribution capacity , dysfunction ventral striatum area contains nucleus accumbens involve reduced lack reactivity reward environmental stimuli patient MDD . Our hypothesis link specific neural substrate two psychiatric component anhedonia , i.e. , loss interest lack reactivity , define diagnostic criterion MDD . We plan operationally test hypothesis use empirical measurement reward response MDD patient without significant anhedonia use condition task assess appetitive aversive learning without performance aspect spatial delay response task assess relationship reward , performance mood event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging method . We expect find reduced activation ventral striatum , orbital ventromedial frontal cortex response monetary incentive stimulus MDD patient significant anhedonia relative MDD patient without anhedonia healthy control . In order ass role dopamine anhedonia reward processing , propose assess effect dietary tyrosine plus phenylalanine depletion neural behavioral response associate perform monetary reward task investigate herein additional sample subject . Dietary depletion tyrosine phenylalanine , two DA precursor , validate method induce significant reduction brain DA concentration show two previous [ 11C ] Raclopride PET study . We hypothesize depressed patient show less activation control brain region associate mesolimbic DA system , striatum , amygdala , anterior cingulate gyrus orbitofrontal cortex response reward placebo condition . We expect tyrosine phenylalanine depletion induce similar neural impairment reward healthy subject , include reduction neural activation striatum , amygdala , anterior cingulate gyrus orbitofrontal cortex response reward . The reduction neural activation region stronger healthy control depressed patient . Finally , hypothesize tyrosine depletion influence negatively valence rating reward stimulus healthy subject . In depressed patient , anhedonia score correlate negatively valence rating reward stimuli placebo condition already . The outcome propose work may provide clue diagnosis , classification , treatment MDD , may also yield lead identify fundamental neural mechanism underlie anhedonia disable psychiatric condition schizophrenia addiction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA For patient control group : Age 18 50 ethnicity without significant medical condition Not active use illicit drug heavy consumption alcohol No metallic implant onplants ferromagnetic Competent sign consent form participate study . For patient group : For group significant anhedonia , current MDD , define DSMIV criterion , significant anhedonia define PAS and/or SAS score one standard deviation appropriate norm . For group without significant anhedonia , current MDD , define DSMIV criterion , without significant anhedonia define PAS and/or SAS score within one standard deviation appropriate norm . The BPD subject meet DSMIV criterion bipolar I II disorder , recent episode depress currently major depressive episode . We use Young Mania Rating Scale assess severity disorder Subjects may enrol either inpatient outpatient entrance study . For control group : No prior history psychiatric condition include substance dependence No family history MDD , bipolar disorder , psychosis PAS and/or SAS score within one standard deviation appropriate norm . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Medical condition concomitant medication likely influence cerebral blood flow neurological function include cardiovascular , respiratory , endocrine neurological disease ; History psychosis , current mania substance dependence ; Exposure psychiatric medication past 4 week ; History repeat selfmutilation homicidal attempt , current active suicidal / homicidal ideation ; Current recent ( within past six week ) illicit drug use heavy alcohol consumption ( 2 sixpack beer equivalent alcoholic beverage per week ) ; Pathological gambler define DSMIV .</criteria>
