	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill cancer cell . Combining rituximab interleukin-2 may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine rituximab interleukin-2 treating patient relapse refractory intermediate- high-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Intermediate- High-Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical efficacy rituximab interleukin-2 patient relapse refractory intermediate- high-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Determine 2-year progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Correlate response natural killer cell number rituximab , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , soluble IL-2 receptor level patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV weekly week 1-4 interleukin-2 subcutaneously 3 time weekly week 2-9 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 12 week 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50-100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
