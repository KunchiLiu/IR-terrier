	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dose PS-341 give carboplatin chemotherapy treatment patient ovarian , abdominal , fallopian tube cancer . Researchers also hope find give drug together help shrink slow growth tumor patient consider resistant platinum drug . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 Plus Carboplatin Platinum Taxane Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bortezomib drug turn certain gene protein inside cancer cell responsible cell growth . Researchers believe certain gene protein turn , ability cancer cell survive decrease . Before treatment start , participant complete checkup , blood test , urine test , heart test , chest x-ray , either CT scan MRI scan . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test within 14 day begin treatment . Blood test complete checkup also do course therapy month treatment end . Approximately 2-3 teaspoon blood obtain routine blood test time blood drawn study . Participants study receive Bortezomib carboplatin catheter ( tube ) place vein . This Day 1 therapy . Bortezomib give first ( 5 10 second ) follow carboplatin ( one hour ) . Bortezomib give alone Days 4 , 8 , 11 . There treatment give Days 12-28 . One course therapy 28 day long include one dose carboplatin 4 dos Bortezomib . All treatment give outpatient basis M. D. Anderson . There 4 different dose level Bortezomib study . The dose Bortezomib participant receive depend enrol . It also depend whether participant side effect treatment . Up 6 patient could treat dose . Before course therapy , participant physical exam blood test . A CT scan MRI scan repeat Cycles 2 4 end treatment . Participants partial complete response ( tumor shrink 50 % disappear completely ) repeat CT MRI 4 week later confirm response . Participants may receive 8 course treatment . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , participant take study . This investigational study . Bortezomib approve use FDA , patient multiple myeloma . Carboplatin approve FDA , though use Bortezomib experimental . A total 24 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologicallyconfirmed ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer advance and/or metastatic disease . All patient must consider platinum taxane resistant . Platinum resistance define : 1 . Progression disease platinum taxane chemotherapy , 2 . Progression disease within 6 month complete platinum taxane chemotherapy 3 . Failure achieve complete response , persistent macroscopic disease , 6 cycle chemotherapy , last two cycle measurable change disease status Patients may number prior chemotherapy regimen , except high dose chemotherapy an/or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( high dose : high standard dos chemotherapy ) Patients must measurable disease . Zubrod performance status &lt; 2 . Patients must give voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care . Adequate liver , renal bone marrow function , define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L . Platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin &lt; 1.7 umol/L Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; 1.5 x Upper Limits Normal ( ULN ) Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN . Chemotherapy within four week first course PS341 . ( Patients may hormonal therapy ) . Patients previously receive highdose chemotherapy ( high standard dos chemotherapy ) and/or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Radiation therapy within four week enrollment ( except palliative XRT ) . Patients recover toxic effect previous chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody therapy . Patients &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . Surgery within four week study enrollment . History severe hypersensitivity reaction carboplatin Electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia new conduction system abnormality . Myocardial infarction within six month enrollment . Patients brain metastases central nervous system disease evidence clinical symptom . History malignancy , except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 5 year . Chemotherapy give prior cancer exclude patient participate study . Patients previously document human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . HIVpositive patient exclude study base theoretical concern regard effect PS341 certain aspect immune function . NFKB critical T cell activation protein ( include CD40L/CD 154 stimulation ) also involved cytokine production . Because PS 341 effectively block NFKB therefore could reduce block ability T lymphocytes immune cell fight HIV , PS341 administer HIVpositive patient . Additional experiment animal model conduct well elucidate effect PS341 HIV . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . Other serious medical psychiatric illness could , investigator 's opinion , potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol . Patients pregnant , suspected pregnant , breastfeed . Patients know hypersensitivity PS341 , boron , mannitol .</criteria>
