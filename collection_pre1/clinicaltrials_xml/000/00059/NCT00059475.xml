	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness side effect experimental vaccine prevent recurrence melanoma . The likelihood melanoma return high patient melanoma lesion deep skin , patient positive lymph node , patient surgery metastatic disease ( cancer spread beyond primary site ) . Melanoma tumor produce protein call glycoprotein 100 ( gp100 ) melanoma-associated antigen recognize T cell 1 ( MART-1 ) . Vaccination specific piece protein ( peptide ) may boost immune system 's fight cancer . The vaccine injection mixed oil-based substance call Montanide ISA-51 , intend increase immune response peptide . Patients 16 year age old whose melanoma surgically remove currently free disease may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination blood urine test . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , x-rays imaging study do recent result available . Some candidate may require heart test , cardiac stress test echocardiogram , lung function test . In addition , candidate test human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) tissue type ; patient must type human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) *0201 , type vaccine base . Participants randomly assign receive one four different vaccine determine peptide offer best immunity . Each treatment course consist two injection vaccine every 3 week four time . The injection give skin thigh . After every treatment course ( every 6 month ) , patient undergo series x-ray scan look tumor . The immunization may continue 12 month long melanoma return . The injection give National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center . Patients monitor 1 hour injection blood test physical examination look treatment side effect . Patients follow blood test every 12 week monitor body function . They also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure collect white blood cells-before start treatment 3 4 week fourth vaccine evaluate vaccine affect action immune system cell . For procedure , blood drawn needle arm , similar donate blood . The blood go machine separate lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) , rest blood return needle arm . Some patient may undergo biopsy-surgical removal small piece tissue local anesthetic-of normal skin tumor lymph node tissue examine effect vaccine tumor immune cell . Patients whose disease return first course vaccine therapy surgery remove tumor continue receive vaccine treatment . Patients whose tumor return complete one course therapy may receive substance call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , boost immune function tumor . interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) give intravenously ( small tube place vein ) every 8 hour 4 day . This regimen repeat 10 14 day . Those respond interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) third course treatment 2 month . Patients whose disease recur treatment take study refer back refer physician another study , appropriate one available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) *0201 positive patient high risk recurrence melanoma , completely resect metastatic melanoma receive immunization peptide represent human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -restricted T cell epitopes melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART-1 ) glycoprotein 100 ( gp100 ) melanoma antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 Montanide trademark ( TM ) ISA 51 vegetable grade ( VG ) . Patients randomize receive one three different melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART-1 ) peptides receive combination melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART-1 ) peptide plus glycoprotein 100 ( gp100 ) peptide . This study design evaluate immunologic effect different peptide immunization .</detailed_description>
