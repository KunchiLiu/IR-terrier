	<brief_title>Automated Calls With Nurse Follow-Up Improve Diabetes Ambulatory Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Regular outpatient follow-up important diabetes patient , need frequent attention health unstable , treatment regimen complex , social support inadequate . However , many patient live access barrier limit use outpatient service , fail attend outpatient appointment , experience bad outcome trial aggressive management suggest possible . Although labor-intensive , telephone care program one potential strategy bring diabetes management service patients� home improve glycemic control . Automated telephone disease management ( ATDM ) system augment telephone care provide frequent monitoring health education large patient panel focus clinicians� attention individual need . Although technology show promise , rigorously evaluate , particularly VA . Objectives : This study evaluate Automated Telephone Disease Management ( ATDM ) call telephone nurse follow-up mean improve quality VA diabetes care . Specifically , determine whether service improve patient ' glucose control ; improve important outcome quality life , satisfaction care , health service use ; improve health behavior self-monitoring blood glucose , fat intake , medication adherence ; effect vary across patient subgroup . Methods : Patients diabetes mellitus use hypoglycemic medication enrol outpatient visit university-affiliated VA health care system randomize usual care bi-weekly ATDM assessment self-care education call follow-up nurse educator . The intervention process evaluate examine patients� pattern ATDM use reliability validity information provide . Telephone survey use measure intervention effect 12-months patients� self-care , symptom , satisfaction care , perceive access barrier . The impact VA utilization evaluate use electronic utilization database , glycemic control measure use laboratory test . A total 292 patient randomize 272 ( 93 % ) provide data 12-months . Intervention patient complete ATDM assessment consistently throughout observation period assessment identify group intervention patient vary degree health risk baseline . Compared control patient , intervention patient 12-months report frequent glucose self-monitoring , few access problem , great satisfaction care ( p = 0.05 ) . Intervention patient likely control see podiatry clinic ( 53 % versus 31 % , p = 0.003 ) diabetes specialty clinic ( 31 % versus 17 % , p = 0.03 ) study . The intervention influence mean endpoint HgA1c level overall . However , among patient baseline HgA1c = 8 % , mean endpoint value among intervention control patient 8.7 % 9.2 % , respectively ( p = 0.05 ) ; intervention effect even great among patient baseline HgA1c = 9 % . Moreover , intervention patient follow-up report few symptom poor glycemic control patient receive usual care ( 3.6 versus 4.4 , p = 0.03 ) . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
