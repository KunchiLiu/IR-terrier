	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety immunization autologous vitro-treated tumor cell dendritic cell combination sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient stage IV recurrent melanoma . - Determine frequency conversion delay tumor hypersensitivity test patient treated regimen . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine objective tumor response rate patient measurable melanoma treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord presence measurable disease study initiation ( yes v ) . Patients undergo tumor cell harvest . Patients multiple persistent site metastatic disease harvest may receive systemic therapy ( biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy ) tumor cell line expansion approximately 4 month . The tumor cell line expand , irradiate , treat interferon gamma . Patients undergo leukapheresis collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain dendritic cell ( DC ) . The PBMC treat sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-4 7 day produce DC . The DC culture treated tumor cell 18 hour . Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity test intradermally 1 week prior vaccination week 4 . Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise autologous treated tumor cell dendritic cell suspend GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly 3 week . Vaccine therapy continue monthly additional 5 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
