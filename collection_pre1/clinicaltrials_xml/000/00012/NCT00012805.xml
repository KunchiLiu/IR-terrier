	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one common chronic illness among veteran adult population , account substantial morbidity mortality population . Interventions enhance symptom self-monitoring increase understand COPD therapy may lead early detection clinical deterioration permit timely intervention health care provider . However , intervention labor-intensive expensive , typically require patient go medical facility regular basis . A novel mean provide intervention Telephone-Linked Computer ( TLC ) system , computer-based telecommunication system monitor , educate , counsel patient regular automate conversation patients� home . In previous study , demonstrate applicability TLC technology clinical monitoring adult chronic disease condition hypertension hypercholesterolemia . Objectives : The objective study determine whether telecommunication system COPD care ( TLC-COPD ) lead improvement functional status quality life ( QOL ) well reduction health care utilization cost exceed TLC intervention . Methods : The study design form randomize control trial involve subject COPD receive care two Boston-area VA hospital . Subjects assign either TLC-COPD usual care control group . Status : Complete .</detailed_description>
