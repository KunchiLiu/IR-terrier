	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure major public health burden United States characterize increase morbidity mortality , reduce exercise capacity distress symptom dyspnea fatigue . Evaluating effect complementary intervention ( exercise training ) functional status QOL clinically important relevant HF patient . In last decade , hospital-based home bicycle exercise program HF show improve peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) symptom score , restore autonomic balance . These program may costly patient perform . Improved peak VO2 may necessarily translate improved functional status quality life . To date , effect home walk exercise program alone functional status , QOL autonomic tone evaluate . Objectives : The specific aim compare functional status ( FS ) , quality life ( QOL ) autonomic tone 2 group advance HF patient ( nurse-managed home walking exercise ( HWE ) group vs. control group ) . Methods : A randomized control trial compare 12-week nurse-managed progressive HWE protocol usual activity conduct 79 HF patient ( 78 [ 99 % ] male ; mean age 62.6 � 10.6 year ; EF 27 � 8.8 % ; 63 [ 80 % ] NYHA II , 15 [ 20 % ] NYHA III-IV ; HF duration 39.2 � 41.8 month ) VA medical center university affiliate medical center . The 12- week HWE program day , 5x week initiate 10 minute progressively increase duration intensity 60 minute . Pre- post-study measure FS ( peak VO2 ventilatory threshold via CPX , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) Heart Failure Functional Status Inventory ( HFFSI ) ) , QOL ( Cardiac Quality life Index ( C-QLI ) , SF-36 , Dyspnea-Fatigue Index ( DFI ) global rating symptom ) , autonomic tone ( norepinephrine ( NE ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) ) . Intention-to-treat analysis repeat measure ANOVA use identify group difference . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
