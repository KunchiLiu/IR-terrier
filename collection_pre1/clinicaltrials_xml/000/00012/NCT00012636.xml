	<detailed_description>Background : Hypertension major risk factor heart disease stroke . Evidence-based guideline support use specific drug patient specific comorbidities maximize decrease cardiovascular risk ; yet , many physician follow guideline choose drug therapy . Objectives : The goal project evaluate method implement clinical practice guideline , use hypertension model . We hypothesize provide patient-specific recommendation clinician time clinic contact hypertensive patient would substantially improve guideline concordance drug therapy without adversely affect ( possibly improve ) blood pressure control . Our long-term goal develop evaluate method implement clinical practice guideline build current knowledge effective approach change clinician behavior , extend method cardiovascular disease . Methods : This project , know ATHENA , include two major component : ( 1 ) We conduct randomize controlled trial patient-specific recommendation drug therapy hypertension , deliver primary care clinician time primary care clinic visit . The recommendation base VA Hypertension Guidelines . The trial include 36 clinician 4500 hypertensive patient enrol primary care clinic VA Palo Alto Health Care System . We compare general intervention individualize intervention . Both general intervention group clinicians receive extensive guideline education , part VISN-mandated hypertension guideline implementation . Clinicians randomize individualized intervention receive , addition , computer-generated patient-specific recommendation drug therapy hypertension , deliver clinic encounter form visit . ( 2 ) In 2nd major component study , collaborate Stanford Medical Informatics develop hypertension decision support system ( ATHENA DSS ) . ATHENA DSS combine detail patient information VA electronic medical record ( VistA ) hypertension guideline knowledge base VA JNC 6 hypertension guideline . A special feature ATHENA DSS knowledge system easily browse updated clinician-managers , knowledge keep date emerge clinical trial finding best treatment . We develop infrastructure implement system pop-up window CPRS-GUI primary care clinic VA Palo Alto . We also conduct offline test program logic compare ATHENA DSS recommendation make physician 100 randomly select VA patient . Status : In past year , complete data collection data analysis randomize trial , test ATHENA DSS , prepare manuscript . A new project evaluate implementation guideline ATHENA DSS 3 VA medical center begin October , 2000 .</detailed_description>
