After determine concurrent reliability , validity , prognostic significance ATDM assessment , examine variation ATDM-reported outcomes across Networks , facility , patient group . In second phase study , conduct effectiveness trial one year follow period . We use finding process evaluation modify ATDM assessment design provider feedback report . We enroll 240 patient two Networks ( i.e. , 480 patient overall ) . Patients assign experimental usual care control group use combination randomization cutoff-based assignment . We measure intervention 's impact patient ' glycemic control , symptom , self-care , patient-centered outcome . We use VA cost database Medicare claim file evaluate cost-effectiveness . Status : Analyses ATDM assessment data suggest method feasible VA diabetes patient provide comparable data regard patient ' satisfaction care function telephone survey .
