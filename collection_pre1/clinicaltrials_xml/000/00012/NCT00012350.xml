	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness R115777 treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Evaluation FTase Inhibitor ( FTI ) Treatment Advanced Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate objective response disease stabilization patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat R115777 . II . Determine whether degree inhibition FTase activity farnesylation lamin-B , H- , K- , N-RAS peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor tissue correlate tumor response patient treat regimen . III . Determine whether presence activate RAS mutation myeloma cell predict treatment response patient treat regimen . IV . Correlate R115777 plasma level RAS mutation status tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow least 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 12-42 patient accrue study within 25 month .</detailed_description>
