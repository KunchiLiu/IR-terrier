	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Sargramostim Treating Patients With Refractory Myeloid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 give combination GM-CSF . II . To describe quantify frequency toxicity combination continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 subcutaneously administer GM-CSF . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe impact combination bryostatin-1 GM-CSF differentiation cell cycle distribution myeloid cell vivo . II . To describe impact combination bryostatin-1 GM-CSF T lymphocyte population . III . To assess pharmacokinetics continuous infusion bryostatin-1 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bryostatin 1 . Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease stabilization improvement may continue treatment 12 course . Cohorts 2 patient receive escalate dos bryostatin 1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 30 % patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 45 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
