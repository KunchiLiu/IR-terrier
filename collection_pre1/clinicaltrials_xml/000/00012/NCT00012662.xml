	<detailed_description>Background : Social , medical economic burden diabetes care result microvascular , macrovascular neurological complication . Sustained reduction hyperglycemia reduce incidence complication much 50 percent . Studies demonstrate improved glycemic control nurse case-management educational care model . However , none control independent contribution , intervene advanced practice nurse ( APN ) , target high risk individual . Objectives : The objective project examine whether intervention diabetes self-management education program without APN case manager improve outcome cost effective . Methods : Patients randomly assign one four group : 1 ) Disease-management diabetes education ; 2 ) Disease-management alone ; 3 ) Diabetes education alone ; 4 ) Routine Care . Veterans receive primary care VISN-5 meeting high-risk criterion ( HbA1c ï¿½ 9.0 % ) screen inclusion . Patient outcome measure collect baseline , three month twelve month . These include : Quality Life ( QOL ) , HgbAlc level , incidence diabetes-related hospitalizations/ER visit . In addition , patient-level intervention cost , health care use cost examine . ANOVA comparison use test hypothesis . Status : Recruitment final analysis underway .</detailed_description>
