	<detailed_description>Background : This study one several initiate investigator reduce musculoskeletal injury patient care provider . Nurses one high incidence work relate back injuries profession . Over past 20 year , effort reduce work-related injury nurse largely unsuccessful . Objectives : The goal study reduce incidence severity occupational musculoskeletal injury nurse redesign stressful patient handle task . This study address three objective : 1 ) conduct quantitative , biomechanically base , ergonomic evaluation eleven `` risk '' task nurse practice ; 2 ) redesign technique equipment need perform task safely reduce risk musculoskeletal injury ; 3 ) conduct laboratory- base assessment biomechanical benefit propose intervention strategy . Methods : Using randomized experimental design control group , ten `` risk '' task evaluate . The sample include 160 experienced nursing staff . Data collect use : 1 ) Caregiver Data Form Anthropometry Data Sheet ; 2 ) 3-D Electromagnetic Tracking System ; 3 ) EMG ; 4 ) modify Borg Scale Perceived Comfort . Include : caregiver characteristic , joint torque , spinal force , spinal tolerance limit damage load limit , erector spinae surface EMG , joint angle , percent population capable perform task gender , velocity lift , reach , heart rate , perceive comfort . Status : This project complete .</detailed_description>
