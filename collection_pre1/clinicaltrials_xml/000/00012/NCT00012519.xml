	<detailed_description>Combination regimens RTV IDV adult offer benefit two potent antiretroviral agent , convenience twice-daily dosing , unrestricted timing meal , few renal complication . There limited , largely anecdotal data child suggest initial virologic response also attain child give IDV RTV , sufficient pharmacokinetic data define appropriate dose regimen . This study evaluate clinical feasibility combination RTV IDV regimen child . Patients stratified basis age/Tanner stage ability swallow intact capsule . Patients randomize either Balanced Dose Low Dose RTV treatment arm . Patients Balanced Dose Arm receive RTV IDV approximately equal dos . The Low Dose RTV Arm receive dose ratio RTV : IDV approximately 1:3 . Patients schedule study visit every 4 week 6 month , every 3 month approximately 18 month . Study visit consist medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . Patients intensive pharmacokinetic analysis Week 4 ( 2 week stable dose study drug reach ) Week 16 . Study visit include pharmacokinetic analysis last 9 13 hour . At study visit , patient closely assessed drug toxicity virologic response . At end study , patient good virologic response evidence toxicity may choose enter 48 week extension phase continue take combination regimen .</detailed_description>
