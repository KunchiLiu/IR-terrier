	<detailed_description>Background : A Web-based telemedicine system monitor status patient pressure ulcer develop . It consist three major data collection component : ( 1 ) digital photograph ulcer ; ( 2 ) quantitative measurement wound status ( i.e. , ulcer area volume , skin elasticity ) ; ( 3 ) wound patient data collect nurse . Data collect via laptop computer transmit central database , computer program transforms data necessary reporting format . The output post onto World Wide Web page access consult physician . The system incorporate data requirement assessment recommend AHCPR 's Clinical Practice Guideline , Treatment Pressure Ulcers . Objectives : The primary objective pilot study evaluate clinical accuracy telemedicine system assess status pressure ulcer , chronic surgically repair . The principal hypothesis : ( 1 ) use telemedicine system result diagnose in-person patient assessment ; ( 2 ) patient satisfied telemedicine system . Methods : Two VA medical center two specialty participate study : Ann Arbor ( plastic surgery ) Augusta ( plastic surgery , physical medicine rehabilitation ) . They contribute inpatient outpatient pressure ulcer stage II , III , IV one-year enrollment period . All study patient assess in-person ( `` gold standard '' ) telemedicine system . The in-person telemedicine physician provide yes/no response four diagnostic question concern wound heal infection , base AHCPR guideline , blind otherï¿½s assessment . Patient satisfaction data collect use specially design , self-administered questionnaire measure perception regard burden telemedicine system , confidence evaluation , absence direct contact physician . Status : Completed</detailed_description>
