	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Fusion Protein Uveitis Associated With Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , TNFR : Fc significantly reduce joint pain swell adult patient rheumatoid arthritis , Food Drug Administration approve drug use . Because medicine arthritis often help patient eye inflammation , study examine whether TNFR : Fc help patient uveitis . Patients uveitis respond well standard treatment , steroid , patient side effect medicine use treat uveitis refuse treatment possible side effect may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination . The eye exam include check vision eye pressure , examination back eye ( retina ) , front eye , include measurement protein inflammation . Candidates also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure photograph take retina see leakage eye 's blood vessel . A blood test joint evaluation also do . Study participant give injection TNFR : Fc twice week 12 month may continue medicine may take , prednisone methotrexate . They follow-up examination week two month one , two , three four . Those wish continue treatment fourth month receive drug another eight month follow-up exams month six , nine 12 , one month treatment end . Each follow-up visit include repeat screen exams evaluation side effect discomfort medicine .</detailed_description>
