	<detailed_description>Background : Many patient diabetes sub-optimal glycemic control . Central clinician 's task improve glycemic control management hypoglycemic medication therapy , include use drug insulin sulfonylurea . Clinical trial demonstrate intensive hypoglycemic medication therapy result improved glycemic control . Yet quality measure critical process care develop know little physician actually manage hypoglycemic medication . Objectives : We propose develop quality measure describe intensity physician ' hypoglycemic medication therapy . We provide feedback VA physician regard practice access expert diabetes care determine whether intervention lead improvement glycemic control . Methods : The study divide two phase . During first phase use exist data model decision increase hypoglycemic medication . At medical visit , determine whether increase medication therapy occur . We use recursive partitioning develop model identify patient characteristic visit , recent laboratory result diagnosis , associate decision increase therapy . This model assign predict probability increase therapy visit . We use prediction define intensity hypoglycemic medication therapy physician compare actual predict number increase patient-visits . The second phase randomize trial clinician experimental site receive feedback performance access expert opinion usual care provide control site . Feedback performance provide twice 6 month . The change intensity treatment score glycosylated hemoglobin level pre- post-intervention site compare performance primary care physician control sit receive intervention . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
