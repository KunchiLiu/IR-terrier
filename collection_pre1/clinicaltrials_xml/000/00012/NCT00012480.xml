	<brief_summary>Our data indicate environmental exposure heavy metal lead widespread currently appreciate exposure associate production human male subfertility . Lead 's effect observe male partner infertile couple attend IVF clinical , men act semen donor artificial insemination program men representative general public . Our goal identify mechanism ( ) underlie lead 's anti-fertility action .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our goal understand environmental occupational exposure heavy transition metal ion injure human male reproductive tract . The American Urological Association American Society Reproductive Medicine report ~15 % couple ( i.e. , 6.1 million people U.S. ) experience infertility time . The male responsible infertility 20 % couple contribute infertility another 30-40 % . However , cause ( ) male infertility many case unknown . Our data suggest lead exposure ( air , food drinking water ) underlie significant fraction `` unexplained '' male infertility . We find blood seminal plasma lead level elevate 22 % normospermic male couple seek infertility treatment , 29 % semen donor participate artificial insemination program 23 % unselected semen donor answer advertisement research participation . These elevate lead level associate decreased sperm fertility potential IVF , artificial insemination pregnancy coitus . The negative effect lead sperm function correlate expression specific form sperm ion channel ( metal binding protein allow lead enter cell ) , suggest protein serve marker susceptibility resistance reproductive toxic effect lead . Further , case human male lead level change markedly time , correspond change sperm ion channel , sperm function sperm fertility potential . These change link change calcium modulate process human testis biopsy obtain infertility patient could mimic testis rat experimentally feed lead . In current study , plan identify change gene expression important production infertile state compare gene express testis control lead expose rat resistant susceptible lead . These finding help explain lead exposure kill cell within testis . We determine whether change occur human testis biopsy ejaculate sperm infertile male high body burden lead . The expected outcome study identification possible mechanism explain male infertility associate low sperm count idiopathic male infertility , tools diagnosis male infertility hope rationale treatment .</detailed_description>
