	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one common chronic illness adult population account approximately 25,000 discharge VA hospital calendar year . In addition burden put health care system , COPD disable condition adversely affect functional status quality life ( QOL ) . Several report suggest exercise training program reduce frequency hospitalization COPD ; however , report important methodological limitation program widely implement VA health care system . Although underlying lung pathology COPD may unalterable , physical recondition clearly demonstrate improve cardiorespiratory status COPD patient . These physiologic change potential substantially improve QOL reduce functional disability . Moreover , improved cardiorespiratory reserve may decrease utilization health care resource mild moderate exacerbation COPD . Objectives : The overall goal project determine whether exercise training lead reduction chronic institutionalization , acute hospitalization , outpatient physician visit improve functional status QOL patient COPD . The follow specific objective accomplish : 1 ) test hypothesis addition exercise training usual care reduces use health care service one-year follow-up period ; 2 ) test hypothesis exercise training lead improvement functional status QOL . Methods : Hypotheses test mean randomize control trial involve subject COPD ( age 50-79 year ) receive care two Boston area VA hospital . Subjects randomize intervention group receive eight-week program thrice-weekly exercise training session . Outcomes include standardize QOL questionnaire objective test functional status ( 6-minute walk activity daily live performance ) . Status : Subject recruitment intervention complete ; data collection complete ; currently analyze data effect intervention health care utilization parameter .</detailed_description>
