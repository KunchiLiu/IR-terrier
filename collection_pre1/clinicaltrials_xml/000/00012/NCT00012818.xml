	<brief_title>Efficacy Cost Effectiveness Relaxation Response CHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Despite development significant pharmaceutical treatment , morbidity mortality chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patient remain high , patients� quality life poor , health care utilization heavy . It therefore important find cost effective non-pharmaceutical treatment help CHF patient manage disease . The relaxation response find effective manage CHF-related condition . With favorable physiological change , relaxation response likely benefit CHF patient . Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effect 15-week relaxation response intervention program improve functional capacity health-related quality life compare ongoing 15-week educational program cardiac disease management , control group usual cardiac care ; 2 . To identify cost conduct intervention cardiac care education cost associate cardiac care service ; compare cost among three study group . Methods : This single-blind three-armed randomize trial CHF patient receive care Boston VA Medical Center . Enrolled patient randomly assign , equal number , one three study group . Outcomes include cardiac functional capacity self-reported health-related quality life . We also conduct qualitative study interview patient phone experience study . Status : This project complete data collection phase data analysis phase .</detailed_description>
