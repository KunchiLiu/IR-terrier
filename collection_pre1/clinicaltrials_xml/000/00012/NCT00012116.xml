	<brief_title>Temozolomide Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Spread Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Assess response rate patient cerebral metastasis fail refused standard therapy treat temozolomide . II . Assess safety tolerability drug patient . III . Determine quality life patient treated drug . IV . Determine response rate systemic disease outside central nervous system patient treat drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral temozolomide daily 6 week . Treatment repeat every 10 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess day 1 10-week course . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-48 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>

Subjects must give write informed consent . Subjects must histologically confirm advanced solid malignancy brain metastasis , without systemic disease . Subjects must fail refuse prior standard therapy cerebral metastasis image evidence progressive disease . Prior therapy may include surgery and/or whole brain radiotherapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery . At least 2 week must elapse since completion radiotherapy site brain , prior start study medication . At least 4 week must elapse since completion brain radiotherapy . At least 4 week must elapse since systemic therapy prior start study medication , clinically significant toxicity ( hair loss ) must resolve , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Systemic disease may absent , present control present uncontrolled . If uncontrolled , systemic disease consider less lifethreatening cerebral disease . Patients may receive adjuvant chemotherapy may receive one chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Patients breast cancer progressive brain metastasis , stable systemic disease whilst hormonal therapy , may continue hormonal therapy , assume blood brain barrier prevent response agent central nervous system ( CNS ) . Bidimensionally measurable disease must document brain gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging ( GdMRI ) scan brain within 14 day prior enrollment study . In case patient receive prior radiotherapy , MRI scan finding must consistent progressive disease follow treatment . Subjects previous surgery stereotactic radiotherapy must lesions clearly measurable distinct surgical and/or radiation change induce prior local therapy . Subjects may treat steroid initiation protocol therapy eligible neurologically stable improve . Exclusion Criteria No recovery active toxicity prior therapy ( hair loss ) .
