	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Children With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose flavopiridol child relapse refractory solid tumor lymphomas . II . Determine toxic effect pharmacokinetics drug patient . III . Determine antitumor activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3 6 patient receive escalate dos flavopiridol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 30 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
