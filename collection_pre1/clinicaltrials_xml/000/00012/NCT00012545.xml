	<brief_summary>This study determine best way collect , process store umbilical cord blood baby sickle cell disease , sickle cell trait unaffected baby . Sickle cell disease abnormality hemoglobin red blood cell cause cell change shape clump together , prevent normal flow bloodstream . This impairs blood flow various organ , result oxygen deprivation cause organ damage . Cord blood rich stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature different type blood cell ) , may prove useful new sickle cell therapy . However , cord blood baby sickle cell trait , sickle cell disease normal baby may act differently laboratory condition , important learn best work blood three group baby future use possible treatment . Pregnant woman 18 45 year age risk infant sickle cell disease normal volunteer pregnant risk disease may eligible study . Potential participant counsel donate infant blood order make inform choice . All woman participate study provide medical history blood collect umbilical cord placenta ( afterbirth ) baby delivery . The blood test various infectious disease , process , frozen store research purpose . In addition , blood woman baby risk sickle cell disease test presence sickle cell gene , tissue type , use research follow : - Sickle cell disease If cord blood test show baby sickle cell disease , blood frozen indefinite period time possible use future treatment child . This treatment could include stem cell transplantation gene therapy , treatment currently consider routine sickle cell disease . - Sickle cell trait normal hemoglobin If cord blood test show baby sickle cell trait unaffected , blood process stored 3 year , time may possibly use treat currently live future sibling sickle cell disease . After 3 year , participant may agree either blood discard , give research move another facility continue storage participant expense , storage fee . Alternatively , anticipated future need collect blood , meet standard need future treatment , use NIH-approved research study . Participants family doctor baby pediatrician contact twice year information change baby health . Participants may also ask permission perform new test develop researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Storage Umbilical Cord Stem Cells Treatment Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood source hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) transplantation gene therapy . Our goal procure umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) newborns risk sickle cell disease , sickle cell trait , related disorder well normal newborn , control , order develop method process cryopreservation umbilical cord blood HSCs use future clinical transplantation gene therapy . In order carry method development research umbilical cord blood unit collect indefinite number subject 30 cord blood unit newborn sickle cell disease cryopreserved . These unit store future gene therapy . Maternal subject identify risk infant sickle cell disease , age 18 45 , meet specify medical history criterion . The cord blood unit test transfusion transmissible virus , infectious disease marker , Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) typing , Hemoglobin genotyping , enumeration progenitor cell . The umbilical cord blood unit use developmental research processing/cryopreservation method , process store , may also identify future clinical use basic translational research NIH investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant woman risk infant sickle cell anemia ( HbSS ) , well woman risk wish serve control subject , identify refer health care provider selfreferred . Maternal subject must 18 45 year old , may first subsequent pregnancy , must able provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The maternal subject eligible study know positive one follow disease transmissible blood : HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HTLV ; unable give inform consent ; know fetus significant congenital anomaly . Subjects may exclude time delivery attend physician collection staff , due unanticipated obstetrical complication , deem cord blood collection inadvisable .</criteria>
