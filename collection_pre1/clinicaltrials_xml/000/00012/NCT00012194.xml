	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness combine UCN-01 cisplatin treat patient advance solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . UCN-01 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth may help cisplatin kill cancer cell make tumor cell sensitive drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cisplatin combination UCN-01 patient advanced malignancy . II . To assess toxicity observe potential antitumor activity UCN-01 plus cisplatin advanced malignancy dose level study . III . To determine pharmacokinetics UCN-01 cisplatin treatment schedule . IV . To perform laboratory correlative study investigate intermediate molecular marker activity UCN-01 cisplatin cellular level . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cisplatin . Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 UCN-01 IV continuously 36-72 hour day 2 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos cisplatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 2-3 month least 1 year .</detailed_description>
