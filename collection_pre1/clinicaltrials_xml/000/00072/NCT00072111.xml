	<brief_title>Anakinra Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer Expressing Interleukin-1 Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity anakinra patient metastatic cancer express interleukin-1 gene . - Determine steady state pharmacokinetics drug patient . Secondary - Determine antitumor efficacy drug patient . - Determine gene expression change tumor biopsy circulate leukocyte cytokine level patient treatment drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously 1-3 time daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos anakinra maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 6 patient treat dose . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-24 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
