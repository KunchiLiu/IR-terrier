	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide lomustine , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Combining temozolomide thalidomide lomustine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine temozolomide thalidomide lomustine treat patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide , Thalidomide , Lomustine Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity temozolomide , thalidomide , lomustine , term objective response rate , patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma . Secondary - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine duration response overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral temozolomide day 1-42 , oral thalidomide day 1-56 , oral lomustine day 1 29 . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-35 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
