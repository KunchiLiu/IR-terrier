	<brief_summary>This study examine action sensory trick occurrence know surround inhibition disorder muscle tone affect single body part isolation . Surround inhibition refers situation suppress unwanted movement , know dystonia , surround muscle voluntary action . There tricks-various actions-that people use temporarily stop unwanted movement . Such trick include touch affect body part , place object mouth , pull hair , others . Often trick beneficial early illness become less effective progress . This study guide hypothesis sensory trick restore surround inhibition another hypothesis application trick , simply sensory input , effective restoring . Emphasis cervical dystonia , involuntary action affect neck , trick commonly involve cheek chin . The technique use study transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Patients age 18 old cervical dystonia least one effective trick patient effective trick may eligible study . There also control group healthy participant . Participants ask show sensory trick may ask videotaped . During TMS procedure , seat comfortable chair , hand place pillow lap . Small electrodes-soft strip stick skin-will place skin record electrical activity muscle neck activate stimulation TMS . In TMS , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Patients hear click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may muscle twitch face , arm , leg . In addition , patient may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action coil position appropriately . Patients sometimes ask bite tap teeth slightly 1-1/2 minute time . They ask show sensory trick . The stimulation usually painful , although sometimes strong contraction scalp muscle cause discomfort headache . Patients ask procedure discontinue time . The test session take 2 hour , do outpatient basis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate mechanism sensory trick surround inhibition motor cortex focal dystonia . Sensory trick Geste antagoniste , various manoeuvre use dystonic patient transiently diminish spasm . Many manoeuvre involve motor well sensory input use term 'tricks ' refer phenomenon . Little known unique feature evidence abnormality sensorimotor integration focal dystonia . The relief dystonic symptom application trick suggest potential clue understand yet unclear mechanism dystonia . There evidence surround inhibition , cortical phenomenon function suppress unwanted movement surround muscle voluntary action , impaired dystonia . Since trick transiently relieve dystonic symptom , hypothesize mechanism trick normalization surround inhibition defective dystonia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Nineteen patient age 18 cervical dystonia minimal one effective trick , 15 patient age 18 cervical dystonia effective trick recruit study . For patient , selection criterion presence cervical dystonia minimal one sensory trick patient trick group , trick patient without trick group . The interview dystonic patient focus medical history , neurologic examination effectiveness patient 's trick access measure degree head rotation trick application . The diagnosis dystonia rely review medical record , history , clinical evaluation . For patient receive botulinum toxin injection , evaluation do 3 month last injection . Their gender , age , ethnic origin provide bias inclusion study . There evidence high prevalence dystonia particular race , thus race ethnicity subject recruit study approximate general population . Fifteen normal subject age 18 recruit control group . The control dystonia neurological condition . All subject sign inform consent prior participation trial , trial approve NINDS IRB committee . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion trial cover normal control dystonia group include ; 1 . Any concurrent medical surgical condition well neurological psychiatric illness . 2 . Any individual medication potential influence nervous system function ( antidepressant , antianxiolytics , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic , antiparkinsonian , hypnotic , stimulant ) . 3 . Patients receive Botulinum toxin injection within 3 month start protocol . 4 . Individual pacemaker , implant medical pump , metal plate medical object skull eye ( example , brain surgery ) 5 . Individual history seizure .</criteria>
