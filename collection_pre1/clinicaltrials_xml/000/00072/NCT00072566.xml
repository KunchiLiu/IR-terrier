	<brief_summary>This phase II trial see combine bevacizumab low-dose cyclophosphamide work treat patient ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer come back spread part body . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bevacizumab cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Low-Dose Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine time progression patient recurrent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer treat bevacizumab low-dose cyclophosphamide . Secondary I . Determine response rate patient treat regimen . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Determine molecular correlate response outcomes patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 first course day 1 15 subsequent course . Patients also receive low-dose oral cyclophosphamide day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 23-55 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
