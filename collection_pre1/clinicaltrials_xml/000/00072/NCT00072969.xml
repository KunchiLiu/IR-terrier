	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new immunosupressive therapy , Daclizumab , compare antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) treat cytopenia , , deficiency cellular element blood , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Daclizumab anti-interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2 ) antibody . MDS , also know myelodysplasia , disorder cause anemia , spontaneous bleeding , great risk infection . Although bone marrow still produce blood cell , reach bloodstream . The cause MDS know , although behavior . Many patient need transfusion red blood cell . They may also develop leukemia , often quite resistant treatment chemotherapy . However , progression disorder leukemia usually slow , take many year . Patients 18 year age old MDS may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Collection blood test include blood count , liver kidney function , antibody common virus . - Chest x-ray . - Electrocardiogram . - Bone marrow sample confirm diagnosis . Participants randomly receive either ATG Daclizumab . If group receive ATG , admit inpatient undergo first 10 14 day treatment . If already catheter one large vein neck , chest , arm , one place . ATG give catheter . Blood count blood analysis monitor daily patient treat . After 10 day , release , care refer physician . Those participant group receive Daclizumab receive total five dos , one every 2 week , 8 week , give vein 15-minute infusion . The first , third , fifth dose give outpatient clinic . The second fourth dos give either clinic patient ' primary hematologist . All patient follow outpatient 3-month interval first year , every 6 month next 3 year . Afterward , follow-up yearly . A small sample blood drawn visit . Also , bone marrow examination request 6-month interval first 3 year treatment . If treatment patient assigned work , 6 month , eligible receive treatment-provided comply required blood test visit clinic required ass patient ' safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Recombinant Humanized Anti-IL-2 Receptor Antibody ( Daclizumab ) Versus Antithymocyte Globulin ( ATG ) Treat Cytopenia Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many bone marrow failure syndrome human recognize result immunological mechanism . These disease include aplastic anemia , pure red cell aplasia , type myelodysplasia . Patients condition , may suffer variable degree anemia , leukocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , alone combination , show respond wide variety immunosuppressive agent , range corticosteroid cyclosporine ( CSA ) antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , however , nonresponse relapse continue problem . Why patient respond initially others respond relapse unclear . Autoreactive T cell may resistant effect ATG/CsA ( nonresponders ) , others residual autoreactive T cell expand post-treatment leading hematopoietic stem cell destruction recurrent pancytopenia ( relapse ) . Therefore , novel , less toxic immunosuppressive regimen increase response rate hematologic recovery decrease relapse rate need . One novel therapy , Daclizumab , humanize anti-interleukin-2 receptor ( lL-2R ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , act activate lymphocyte , thus share important mechanism action ATG . The mAb much less toxic ATG may administer outpatient relatively infrequent interval ( every 2 week ) . Treatments ATG alone CsA alone demonstrate vary degree success alleviate cytopenia MDS . Our experience suggest ATG rather CSA effective agent induce hematological response susceptible MDS patient certain variable include patient 's age , whether HLA DR15 , day red cell transfusion dependence prior treatment predictive response . We therefore propose randomized phase II study evaluate compare new immunosuppressive therapy , Daclizumab , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) treat cytopenia MDS population subject intermediate high predict probability response .</detailed_description>
