	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study immunization use two different gp100 protein vaccine compare well work treat patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunization With gp100 Protein Vaccine Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare clinical response patient metastatic melanoma immunize recombinant gp100 protein ( 184V ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 without gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide . Secondary - Compare toxicity profile immunization patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients assign 1 2 cohort accord HLA-A2*0201 status . Patients assign cohort 1 randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Cohort 1 ( HLA-A2*0201-positive patient ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive immunization comprise recombinant gp100 protein ( 184V ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 ( 1 course ) . - Arm II : Patients receive immunization comprise recombinant gp100 protein ( 184V ) gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 SC day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 ( 1 course ) . - Cohort 2 ( HLA-A2*0201-negative patient ) : Patients receive immunization cohort 1 , arm I . In cohort , treatment continue absence rapid disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In cohort , patient evaluate 3-4 week fourth immunization . Patients achieve stable disease partial response receive retreatment accord assign cohort . Patients progressive disease eligible interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receive retreatment accord assign cohort AND high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute 3 time daily day 2-5 , 23-26 , 44-47 , 65-68 ( 1 course ) . Patients receive 3 retreatment course . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 1 retreatment course beyond CR . Patients progressive disease ineligible IL-2 administration remove study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45-75 patient ( 30-50 cohort 1 [ 15-25 per treatment arm ] 15-25 cohort 2 ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
