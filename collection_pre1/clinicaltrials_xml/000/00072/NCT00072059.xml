	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare hemoglobin dose response anemic patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer receive antineoplastic therapy treat 6 different regimen Ro 50-3821 . Secondary - Compare safety profile regimens patient . - Compare pharmacokinetic profile regimens patient . - Determine additional pharmacodynamic characteristic regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , parallel , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 6 treatment arm . In arm , patient begin study therapy first day course antineoplastic therapy . - Arm I : Patients receive low dose Ro 50-3821 subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly . - Arm II : Patients receive medium dose Ro 50-3821 SC weekly . - Arm III : Patients receive high dose Ro 50-3821 SC weekly . - Arm IV : Patients receive low dose Ro 50-3821 SC every 3 week . - Arm V : Patients receive medium dose Ro 50-3821 SC every 3 week . - Arm VI : Patients receive high dose Ro 50-3821 SC every 3 week . In arm , treatment continue 12 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 210 patient ( 35 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
