	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , interferon alfa-2b , may interfere growth tumor cell . Bevacizumab may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether interferon alfa-2b effective without bevacizumab treat advanced renal cell carcinoma ( kidney cancer ) . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study interferon alfa-2b bevacizumab see well work compare interferon alfa-2b alone treat patient advance renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa-2b With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma ( Kidney Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient advance renal cell carcinoma treat interferon alfa-2b alone interferon alfa-2b bevacizumab . Secondary - Compare time disease progression objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity interferon alfa-2b combination bevacizumab patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior nephrectomy ( yes v ) number risk factor disease progression ( 0 vs 1-2 v 3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) three time week . - Arm II : Patients receive interferon alfa-2b arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year annually 10 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 700 patient ( 350 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
