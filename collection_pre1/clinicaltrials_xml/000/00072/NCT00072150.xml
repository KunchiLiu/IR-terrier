	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Of PS-341 ( Bortezomib ) In Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Urothelial Tract Transitional Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy PS-341 patient measurable advanced urothelial transitional cell carcinoma respond , relapse one prior conventional chemotherapy . II . To determine safety toxicity PS-341 administer group patient . III . To estimate duration objective response , progression-free survival overall survival group patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients solitary site disease ( i.e. , lung nodal metastasis ) partial response ( PR ) may consider surgical resection . Patients PR residual disease salvage surgery eligible continue study therapy . Patients achieve complete response , either resection bortezomib therapy , receive 2 additional course study therapy . Patients follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-40 patient accrue study within 13-17 month .</detailed_description>
