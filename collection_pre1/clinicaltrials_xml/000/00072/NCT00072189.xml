	<brief_title>A Phase II Study UCN-01 Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity UCN-01 ( 7-hydroxystaurosporine ) metastatic melanoma , determine response rate . II . To assess clinical laboratory toxicity UCN-01 . III . To study effect UCN-01 administration potential marker specific G1-phase cell cycle regulator . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive UCN-01 IV 3 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-33 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
