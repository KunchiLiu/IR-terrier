Reliable information effectiveness low calorie diet differ macronutrient composition clearly need paramount importance inform choice weight reduction diet . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study test effectiveness weight loss weight maintenance four diet differ macronutrient composition : moderate fat ( 40 % energy ) two different protein level ( 15 % 25 % ) , low fat ( 20 % energy ) , also 15 % 25 % protein level . The moderate-fat diet pattern Mediterranean diet . All four dietary approach low saturate fat , involve reduction total energy intake . Each diet deem practical suitable public health recommendation , would expect favorable effect cardiovascular disease risk factor .

Other outcomes psychological factor ( diet satisfaction , satiety , food craving , dietary restraint , disinhibition hunger , quality life ) ; major cardiovascular risk factor ( blood pressure , low density lipoprotein [ LDL ] cholesterol , high density lipoprotein [ HDL ] cholesterol , triglyceride ) ; prevalence metabolic syndrome ; blood glucose , insulin , hemoglobin A1C ; emerge cardiovascular risk factor ( apolipoprotein B , VLDL LDL particles apolipoprotein C-III , lipoprotein [ ] ) ; microalbuminuria ; bone mineral content . The primary result straightforwardly applicable public health clinical guideline obesity increase understand biology obesity weight loss .
