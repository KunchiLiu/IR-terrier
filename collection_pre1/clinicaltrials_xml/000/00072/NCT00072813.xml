	<brief_summary>This study examine possible structural functional abnormality patient inherited form epilepsy . It use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Uncontrolled epilepsy serious neurological problem major harmful medical , social , psychological effect , well great mortality compare general population . The cost per year United States least $ 12.5 billion . There advance diagnose disease , cause determine many case . Recently , several seizure syndrome find family describe . One syndrome particular interest involve lateral temporal lobe brain often include auditory feature . Patients kind syndrome may hear monotonous unformed sound , sometimes may hear complex sound , song . Patients eligible study specific form familial epilepsy study Columbia University New York . Family member without seizure eligible well . All patient study evaluate Columbia participate . Healthy volunteer age 18 55 also may eligible study . Participants undergo medical history physical examination . During study , may three four session MRI . During MRI , patient lie still table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . Patients may ask lie still 60 minute time . As scanner take picture , loud knocking noise , patient wear earplugs muffle sound . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan may ask move machine time . Some scan may do 3 Tesla scanner . It late advance MRI , strong magnetic field common 1.5 Tesla scanner . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) do patient perform task , move limb speaking . Patients opportunity practice task enter scanner . The fMRI take 1 hour .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients family member kindred ADPEAF evaluate Dr. Ruth Ottman CPMC : 14 patient seizures LGl1 mutation . 14 family member mutation seizure . 14 Nonaffected family member , carrier LGl1 mutation . 30 normal control select NIH , screen CES outpatient clinic physical neurological examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects unable unwilling undergo MRI , EEG , MEG . Women pregnant . Subjects 18 . Subjects medical condition ADPEAF may affect brain function . Subjects take medication neuroactive substance may affect brain function . Healthy volunteer must age 55 , reduce chance vascular chnages could affect MRI .</criteria>
