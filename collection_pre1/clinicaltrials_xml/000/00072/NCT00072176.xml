	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Advanced Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( response rate &amp; duration stable disease ) CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) give intravenously ( IV ) weekly patient metastatic and/or locally advance recurrent carcinoma endometrium . II . To assess adverse event , time progression response duration CCI-779 give IV weekly patient metastatic and/or locally advance recurrent carcinoma endometrium . III . To correlate objective tumor response phosphatase tensin homolog gene ( PTEN ) expression tumor tissue obtain diagnosis ( primary tumor ) . IV . To explore relationship objective tumor response molecular measure diagnostic tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month .</detailed_description>
