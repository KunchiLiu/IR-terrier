	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study S-1 Cisplatin Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S-1 oral fluoropyrimidine combine tegafur ( 5-FU prodrug ) two class modulators : - inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) - block phosphorylation 5-FU gastrointestinal tissue . S-1 design enhance clinical utility oral fluoropyrimidine ameliorate disadvantage gastrointestinal toxicity . 5-Fu cisplatin use standard treatment gastric cancer preliminary data indicate S-1 plus cisplatin may result superior tolerability efficacy advance gastric cancer . S-1 currently approve Japan treatment gastric cancer head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
