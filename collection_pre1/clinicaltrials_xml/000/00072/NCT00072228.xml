	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , soblidotin gemcitabine , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose soblidotin gemcitabine treat patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soblidotin Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose soblidotin gemcitabine patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . - Determine dose-limiting toxic effect regimen patient . Secondary - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute soblidotin IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos soblidotin gemcitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow survival every 3 month completion study therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 35 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
