	<brief_summary>This study , conduct National Institutes Health Children 's National Medical Center , evaluate well different physician agree classify cerebral palsy subtypes base patient examination . Cerebral palsy divide several subtypes , accord primary underlying muscle abnormality distribution severity . Classification subtypes important conduct rehabilitation research study patient type abnormality . However , doctor always classify cerebral palsy type way . This study examine method improve agreement among doctor classification cerebral palsy subtypes . Children 6 18 year age cerebral palsy voluntarily move arm leg may eligible study . Participants examine least three doctor therapist . The examination take 30-60 minute . For examination , doctor therapist following : - Observe patient rest - Gently move patient 's arm leg patient move arm leg - Check patient 's reflex - Observe patient walking , patient able walk Patients ask remain clinic 3 hour researcher discuss examination may ask repeat part study examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The movement posture abnormalities characteristic cerebral palsy associate underlying abnormality muscle tone , include dystonia , spasticity , rigidity . The subtypes cerebral palsy define accord predominant muscle tone abnormality , distribution severity . There widespread agreement CP subtypes divide follow group . Spastic subtypes ( hemiplegia : unilateral asymmetric spasticity ; diplegia : bilateral symmetric spasticity , low limb affect upper limb ; quadriplegia : bilateral symmetric spasticity , upper low limb affect equally ) , dystonic athetotic type ; miscellaneous type : hypotonic , mixed type , etc . These descriptive definition useful form homogeneous cohort CP subtypes rehabilitation research study . Even precede train session establishes precise criterion subtype base definition use `` four limb '' approach ( define dominant muscle tone abnormality severity limb ) interobserver agreement classification CP subtypes remain poor . This may widely accept definition common muscle tone abnormalities cerebral palsy ( spasticity , rigidity , dystonia ) examination method vary widely . Recently , interdisciplinary group clinician publish consensus document set forth clear definition disorder muscle tone recommendation examine . Since CP subtypes define accord dominant muscle tone abnormality , hypothesize may possible achieve acceptable interobserver agreement classification CP subtypes definition standard examination technique incorporate precede training session accept element . To test hypothesis train clinician three different area expertise : child neurology , physiatry , physical therapy classify subtypes CP use accept method ( establish precise criterion subtypes use four limb approach ) also train identify muscle tone abnormality use definition standard examination technique consensus document . Following training , ask clinician classify subtypes cerebral palsy group CP child . We measure interobserver agreement classification CP use kappa statistic . Achieving acceptable interobserver agreement classification CP subtypes may facilitate formation homogeneous cohort research study .</detailed_description>
