	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Screening test ultrasound mammography may help doctor detect cancer cell early plan effective treatment breast cancer . It yet know whether ultrasound effective mammography detect breast cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study breast ultrasound see well work compare mammography detect cancer woman high risk breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Ultrasound Mammography Screening Women High Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine diagnostic yield whole breast bilateral screen ultrasound mammography detection breast cancer woman high risk breast cancer . - Determine cancer detection yield single contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examination 3 round annual screen ultrasound mammography participant . ( MRI component study ) Secondary - Determine independent sensitivity specificity screen method participant . - Correlate performance screen method select participant characteristic ( e.g. , breast density heterogeneity parenchyma ) . - Validate sonographic classification lesion `` probably benign '' estimate rate malignancy participant screen method . - Determine cost effectiveness associate screen breast ultrasound , term radiologist resource time perform exam induce cost screening ultrasound ( e.g. , follow-up biopsy ) . - Determine reproducibility lesion identification , measurement lesion diameter , volume record lesion location ultrasound participant . - Determine size , type , grade , nodal status cancer see MRI participant . ( MRI component study ) - Estimate rate benign biopsy short interval follow-up induce MRI participant . ( MRI component study ) - Determine cost effectiveness MRI , include induced cost unnecessary biopsy follow-up . ( MRI component study ) - Compare agreement among multiple examiner sonographic , mammographic , MRI feature analysis ( use term BI-RADS® lexicon ) final assessment ( e.g. , estimate probability malignancy and/or recommendation biopsy ) enrich set diagnostic training case consensus histopathologic reference standard . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Participants randomize 1 2 screening arm . - Arm I : Participants undergo physician-performed bilateral whole breast ultrasound ( US ) follow mammogram within 2 week . - Arm II : Participants undergo mammogram follow physician-performed bilateral whole breast US within 2 week . In arm , participant negative benign finding rescreened accord screen arm 1 2 year . Participants `` probably benign '' finding rescreened 6-month follow-up visit . Participants find suspicious highly suggestive malignancy recommend biopsy . A subset participants* arm undergo contrast-enhanced breast MRI within 4 week completion 2-year screen US mammogram . Participants `` probably benign '' finding see MRI may undergo additional breast MRI 6-month follow-up visit . Participants additional suspicious lesion see MRI undergo second-look target US biopsy guidance MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy completion biopsy additional view prompt 2-year screening US mammogram visit . NOTE : *No diagnosis metastatic cancer type since enter clinical trial . Participants follow annually 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,808 participant accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
