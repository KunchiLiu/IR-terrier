	<brief_summary>This study examine use rituximab patient Wegener 's granulomatosis ( WG ) experience relapse disease standard therapy . Rituximab antibody direct human protein call CD20 , find surface normal abnormal B lymphocyte . Rituximab decrease number B lymphocytes . This study examine safety rituximab WG rituximab 's ability reduce level circulate antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ) , antibodies react substance find white blood cell . ANCA find strongly associate WG . The study also explore whether rituximab reduce occurrence disease relapse . WG disease mark inflammation blood vessel . It involve many different part body , include sinus , lung , kidney , brain , nerve , eye , intestinal tract , skin , joint , heart , others . Before use cytotoxic drug therapy , WG almost always fatal untreated , mortality rate 93 % within 2 year . Patients 18 75 year age history least one relapse disease despite standard treatment , active WG within previous 12 month remission , receive either methotrexate azathioprine remission maintenance , circulate ANCA , may eligible study . A minimum 22 visit clinic require complete entire study . Patients undergo comprehensive medical evaluation , laboratory study x-ray . There may also consultations possible biopsy affect organ medically indicate diagnosis treatment disease . In 4-week period patient receive rituximab infusion , methotrexate azathioprine continue dosage unless side effect requite medication temporarily stop dosage reduce . Patients receive four dos rituximab , 375 mg per meter square body surface area , week . It infuse vein , intravenous catheter . For first dose , patient admit inpatient least 24 hour , monitor infusion reaction associate . The second , third , fourth rituximab infusion may give either inpatient outpatient basis decide patient tolerates first infusion . Following four infusion , blood test monitor safety medication status disease , do home every week 4 week . Results send researcher fax . Patients ask return clinic 1 month fourth infusion every 1 3 month afterward . If side effect relapse disease , methotrexate azathioprine continue 2 year past remission . If disease remain remission , dose either medication gradually decrease eventually stop . The usual schedule reduce methotrexate 2.5 mg per month reduce azathioprine 25 mg per month . If point sign active disease , patient ' illness consider continued remission treatment necessary . If relapse occur , treatment would different previously . In case , treatment would involve prednisone cyclophosphamide methotrexate If ANCA find negative rituximab treatment become positive , evidence return B lymphocyte , patient may receive second course four rituximab infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Pilot Study Examining Use Rituximab Patients With Wegener 's Granulomatosis Who Have Experienced Disease Relapse Standard Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study seek investigate use rituximab patient Wegener 's granulomatosis experience disease relapse standard therapy . Rituximab chimeric monoclonal antibody direct CD20 , induce B cell death result rapid sustained depletion circulate tissue-based B cell . The objective protocol establish safety rituximab Wegener 's granulomatosis , examine ability rituximab reduce level circulate antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ) , preliminarily explore whether rituximab able prevent disease relapse . This prospective standardize open label trial enroll 10 patient well-documented history disease relapse receive immunosuppressive therapy give accord publish regimen ANCA positive remission induction . Patients enrol achieve remission recent relapse receive either methotrexate azathioprine remission maintenance . All patient receive rituximab 375 mg/M ( 2 ) week 4 week . During follow rituximab treatment period , patient remain remission maintenance agent methotrexate azathioprine . Patients enrol prednisone continue taper dosage discontinuation medically permit . Following 4 weekly infusion rituximab , patient follow prospectively evidence effective B cell depletion , feature drug toxicity , level circulate ANCA , clinical disease status . Patients whose ANCA level become undetectable following infusion rituximab may retreat second 4 week course rituximab ANCA titer become positive ( great equal 1:40 ) return B cell peripheral blood . Methotrexate azathioprine continue two year past remission , time , taper discontinue . Patients continue monitor two year immunosuppressive therapy disease relapse occur , minimum 12 month last rituximab infusion .</detailed_description>
