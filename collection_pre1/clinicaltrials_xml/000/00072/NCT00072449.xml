	<brief_title>Rituximab Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine radiographic response proportion patient refractory recurrent primary CNS lymphoma treat rituximab . Secondary - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive additional course rituximab study discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-25 patient accrue study within 5-9 month .</detailed_description>
