	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate may delay prevent formation bone metastases . It yet know whether chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy effective without zoledronate preventing cancer recurrence bone metastases woman breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy together zoledronate see well work compare chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy alone prevent cancer recurrence bone metastases woman stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and/or Hormone Therapy With Without Zoledronate Treating Women With Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival woman stage II III breast cancer high risk relapse treat neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy v without zoledronate . Secondary - Compare time bone metastasis , first recurrence , patient treat regimen . - Compare time bone metastasis , per se , patient treat regimen . - Compare time distant metastasis patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare reduction skeletal-related event ( fracture , spinal cord compression , radiotherapy bone , surgery bone , hypercalcemia ) development bone metastases patient treat regimen . - Determine safety toxicity zoledronate patient treat regimen . - Correlate prognostic factor , estrogen-receptor progesterone-receptor status , TNM stage , tumor grade , HER2/neu status , menopausal status treatment outcome patient treat regimen . - Determine specific prognostic indicator development bone metastases factor able predict specific benefit bisphosphonate treatment use proteomics , tissue micro-array , modern technique patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , parallel-group , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy . Patients also receive concurrent zoledronate IV 15 minute every 3-4 week 6 dos , every 3 month 8 dos , every 6 month 5 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy alone . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3,300 patient ( 1,650 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
