	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give temozolomide together thalidomide work treat patient brain metastasis secondary melanoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Combining temozolomide thalidomide may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine objective response rate patient brain metastasis secondary melanoma treat temozolomide thalidomide . Secondary I . Determine toxic effect tolerance regimen patient . II . Determine objective response rate extracranial metastases patient treated regimen . III . Determine time first disease progression ( intra- extracranial ) patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-42 oral thalidomide daily day 1-56 . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course therapy beyond CR . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-50 patient accrue study within 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
