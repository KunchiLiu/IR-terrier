	<brief_summary>The purpose HARMONY study ass safety efficacy investigational drug call HuZAF , patient moderate severe Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . HuZAF humanize anti-Interferon-gamma ( anti-IFN-γ ) monoclonal antibody , bind block IFN-γ , protein immune system involve inflammation . Antibodies proteins normally produce immune system help fight foreign substance . Scientists able make therapeutic humanize monoclonal antibody , similar antibody body , target disease .</brief_summary>
