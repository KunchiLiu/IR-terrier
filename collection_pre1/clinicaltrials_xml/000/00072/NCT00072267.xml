	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . UCN-01 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Combining UCN-01 topotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine UCN-01 topotecan treating patient recurrent , persistent , progressive advance ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 Topotecan Treating Patients With Recurrent , Persistent , Progressive Advanced Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity UCN-01 topotecan , term complete partial objective response rate , patient recurrent , persistent , progressive advance ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . Secondary - Determine antitumor activity regimen , term stable disease rate duration response , patient . - Determine progression-free , median , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine relationship clinical pharmacodynamic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive UCN-01 IV 3 hour day 1 topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-33 patient accrue study within 5-11 month .</detailed_description>
