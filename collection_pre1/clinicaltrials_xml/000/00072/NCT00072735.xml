	<brief_summary>This study examine role amphetamine improve effect electrical nerve stimulation brain flexibility associate motor training patient experience stroke 1 year . Chronic stroke main cause long-term disability among adult . Previous study show electrical stimulation give skin may improve patient ' recovery motor function . Furthermore , know amphetamine improve effect sensory stimulation touch . Use dependent plasticity refers process performance simple , repetitive finger movement lead encode detail action primary motor cortex brain . Plasticity sense refers capacity change brain . Patients 18 year age old stroke , history neurological psychiatric illness , able contrite perform simple attentional task task may eligible study . There also healthy participant control group . Participants electrocardiogram . They also go practice session 3 hour become familiar different task require study : motor training , pinch force , Jebsen-Taylor Test-which require fast possible action include write , lift small common object , turn page , lift light heavy object . Then study , patient involve variety session : - Motor train alone 3 hour . - Motor training , amphetamine ( placebo ) , electrical stimulation 6 hour . - Motor training , amphetamine , electrical stimulation 6 hour . A magnetic resonance imagining ( MRI ) scan do . Patients lie still table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . Patients may ask lie still 60 minute time . As scanner take picture , loud knocking noise , patient wear earplugs muffle sound . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan may ask move machine time . During another procedure call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Patients hear click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may muscle twitch face , arm , leg . Patients may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action coil position appropriately . The stimulation usually painful , although sometimes strong contraction scalp muscle cause discomfort headache . Patients ask procedure discontinue time . For electrical stimulation procedure , three pair electrodes placed skin . A quite brief pulse current pas electrode , create electrical field activate brain . Patients feel brief sting around electrode . Regarding amphetamine , patient take orally four different occasion . Usually take 10 mg Dexedrin testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : There universally accept strategy promote recovery motor function chronic stroke , main cause long-term disability among adult . It desirable develop strategy enhance motor train patient group . A recent study stroke patient healthy volunteer demonstrate somatosensory nerve stimulation prior motor training lead improvement use-dependent plasticity ( UDP ) , process think underlie recovery motor function brain injury ( Sawaki et al. , unpublished information ) . Interestingly , effect sensory input cortical plasticity enhance single dose amphetamine . The objective protocol enhance effect somatosensory nerve stimulation motor training mean pre-medication amphetamine . This effect motor training measure magnitude training-induced UDP . Our hypothesis amphetamine-enhanced effect somatosensory nerve stimulation increase magnitude training-induced UDP . STUDY POPULATION : We plan study 24 patient chronic stroke 24 healthy age- gender match normal volunteer . DESIGN : All subject participate 5 different randomize session separate day . The first session familiarization behavioral task . A second experiment consist training intervention obtain baseline UDP change . In another two session , subject premedicated blind manner amphetamine placebo administration somatosensory nerve stimulation follow motor training induce UDP . In last experiment , participant premedicated amphetamine expose sham somatosensory stimulation prior motor training induce UDP . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome measure magnitude UDP ( training-induced change transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked kinematic response ) . Secondary outcome measure pinch force ; functional measure activity daily life ( ADL ) : Jebsen-Tailor-Test . To good understand mechanism underlie propose behavioral gain , use TMS identify change corticomotor excitability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include patient thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric lesion least 12 month stroke . We choose patient initially severe motor paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) , subsequently recover point residual motor deficit perform require task . As control group , include age gender match normal volunteer match nondominant/dominant hand ( affected hand stroke patient ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one stroke middle cerebral artery territory . Patients bilateral motor impairment . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients receive alphaadrenergic antagonist agonist , major/minor tranquilizer , clonidine , prazosin , phonation , benzodiazepine , scopolamine , haloperidol , neuroleptic , barbiturate MAO inhibitor . Patients normal volunteer unable perform task ( wrist elbow flexion least MRC grade 2 ) . Patients normal volunteer history severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . Patients normal volunteer severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . hypertension , cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Patients normal volunteer increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Patients normal volunteer unstable cardiac arrhythmia . Patients normal volunteer history hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system . Patients normal volunteer moderate severe microangiopathy , polyneuropathy , diabetes mellitus , ischemic peripheral disease . Pregnancy . Patients normal volunteer less 18 year age . Lactating woman .</criteria>
