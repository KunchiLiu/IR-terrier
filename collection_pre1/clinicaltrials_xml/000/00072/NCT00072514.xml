	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study side effect well give gemcitabine hydrochloride , carboplatin , dexamethasone , rituximab together work treat patient previously treat lymphoid malignancy . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , carboplatin , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride , Carboplatin , Dexamethasone , Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Treated Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility safety Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Dexamethasone without Rituximab previously treat lymphoid malignancy ( rituximab evaluate CD20 positive malignancy ) . II . To determine efficacy regimen . III . To determine ability proceed blood stem peripheral blood collection follow regimen ( impact regimen stem cell reserve ) . IV . To determine remission duration . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP I : CD20-NEGATIVE LYMPHOMAS GROUP II : CD20-POSITIVE LYMPHOMAS After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-4 week every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
