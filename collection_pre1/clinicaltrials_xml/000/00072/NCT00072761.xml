	<brief_title>Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Multi-Center Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silent cerebral infarct ( stroke ) common cause severe cognitive impairment related neurological function child sickle cell anemia . Currently exist systemic strategy identify treat child silent stroke . The primary aim trial determine effectiveness blood transfusion therapy prevention silent stroke child sickle cell anemia . This trial also determine blood transfusion therapy prevent cerebral injury measure benefit therapy outweigh risk associate . Participants multi-center trial randomly assign one 2 groups-the blood transfusion group observation group . Those blood transfusion group receive least monthly blood transfusion therapy . All participant history physical examination every 3 month , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) begin entry study study exit . Advances understand treatment silent stroke likely lead decrease burden associate cerebral injury child sickle cell anemia change standard care child . Statistical Analyses : The original statistical analysis plan suggest simple difference proportion proportion individual endpoint transfusion group proportion individual endpoint usual care group use traditional chi square test . The data analyze accord intent treat principal . Because various logistical concern SIT , individual image within 36-month window ( 30-42 month ) . We propose use available information change primary analysis dichotomous ( yes/no ) endpoint traditional epidemiological endpoint incidence rate group randomize transfusion incidence rate group randomize usual care . We compute incidence ratio : ( a/ta ) / ( b/tb ) Where `` '' number endpoint transfusion group , `` ta '' sum individual time risk individual randomize transfusion group , `` b '' number endpoint observation group `` tb '' sum individual time risk individual randomize observation group . Since standard statistical test different 1.0 involves assumption Poisson distribution , compute `` exact '' 95 % confidence interval use bootstrap large number replication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION : Patient must sickle cell anemia ( hemoglobin SS ) sickle beta thalassemia ( hemoglobin SB ) confirm local institution . Participating institution must submit documentation diagnostic hemoglobin analysis Statistical Clinical Coordinating Centers confirm diagnosis sickle cell anemia prior randomization . Patient must 5 14 year age . Patient must cerebral infarct document MRI scan read neuroradiology panel . Informed consent assent accordance institutional policy ( institutional Institutional Review Board approval ) Federal guideline ( approve United States Department Health Human Services ) must sign patient 's legally authorize guardian acknowledge write consent join study . When suitable , patient request give assent join study . EXCLUSION : Patient history focal neurologic event last 24 hour medical documentation history prior overt stroke . Patients transcranial doppler ( TCD ) study timeaveraged mean velocity great 200 cm/sec verify study radiologist . Patients neurological problem , neurofibromatosis , lead poisoning , tuberous sclerosis . Patients HIV infection . Pregnancy . Patients receive treatment antisickling drug hydroxyurea within 3 month anticipate receive antisickling drug hydroxyurea course study . Abnormal kidney function ( creatinine &gt; 2x upper limit normal ) . Patients chronic blood transfusion therapy reason . Patients judge likely compliant his/her hematologist local nurse coordinator base previous compliance clinic appointment follow advice . Specifically , family miss least two appointment without notification within 12 month prior trial parent potential patient report medical education neglect eligible trial . Patients unable receive blood transfusion alloimmunization . Patients permanent semipermanent metallic ( brace teeth ) structure attach body . Such patient obtain MRI head ass presence silent cerebral infarct . Siblings randomize trial .</criteria>
