	<brief_summary>This study examine effect oral atorvastatin lining blood vessel patient sickle cell disease , plus agent 's effect blood marker inflammation blood vessel function . Sickle cell disease recessive genetic disorder common genetic disease affect African Americans . Inherited abnormal gene make hemoglobin , substance within red blood cell carry oxygen lung body . In disease , sickle hemoglobin lead rigidity hardness red cell , cause obstruction small blood vessel , inflammation , injury organ flow blood block . Some medication already prescribe disease , atorvastatin , use lower cholesterol level , improve blood flow . Patients 18 65 year age sickle cell disease , acute pain episode within previous week , pregnant lactating may eligible study . They undergo complete medical history ; physical examination ; baseline blood test ; echocardiogram , ultrasound wand place chest wall get image inside heart blood vessel . In addition , patient blood flow study . During procedure , lie adjustable recline chair 5 6 hour . There 20- 30-minute rest specific activity blood sample draw intermittently test . Small tube place artery forearm inside elbow . Normal saline infuse one tube . A small pressure cuff apply wrist large cuff upper arm . Both cuff attach inflation device . A device like rubber band , strain gauge , place around wide part forearm . When pressure cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch gauge proportion blood flow , information record . Then light reflect patient ' hand blood flow forearm measure . Activity gene white blood cell measure well . Small amount sodium nitroprusside , widely use reduce blood pressure people dangerously high blood pressure , inject blood flow measure . Later , small amount acetylcholine inject . It usually cause blood vessel expand . After , small amount L-NMMA injected . It usually decrease local blood flow block production nitric oxide cell line arm 's blood vessel . Then acetylcholine combine L-NMMA injected . After , oxypurinol , agent take many patient prevent gout , inject . The procedure repeat , oxypurinol give along agent , measurement blood flow forearm measure drug combination . Afterward , patient treat 4 week home oral atorvastatin . They ask visit Clinical Center every 2 week collection blood sample examination . After 4 week take atorvastatin orally , ask return repeat blood flow study , first half conduct . The part use oxypurinol need . Regarding blood sample collect study , examination gene find white blood cell . Specific attention go gene make protein cell-to-cell interaction inflammation , plus cause blood cell stick line blood vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Therapy Improve Endothelial Function Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 % African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 % sickle cell trait . Hemoglobin S polymerization lead red cell rigidity , microvascular obstruction , inflammation , end-organ ischemic injury . Our publish data indicate 50 % sickle cell patient endothelial dysfunction due impaired bioavailability endogenous nitric oxide . Our study indicate due large part scavenge nitric oxide cell-free hemoglobin , additional nitric oxide inactivation superoxide . This suggest therapy direct restore NO bioavailability might beneficial . In patient atherosclerotic vascular disease , statin family 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl ( HMG ) CoA reductase inhibitor significantly reduce stroke myocardial infarction restore endothelial-dependent relaxation conduct artery . Furthermore , statin therapy clearly show reduce C-reactive protein level clinical event patient coronary artery disease independent effect lipoproteins . The ability statins correct vascular inflammation endothelial dysfunction make class agent attractive attempt reverse feature sickle cell pathobiology . This trial aim 1 ) establish effect oral atorvastatin treatment endothelial-dependent relaxation patient sickle cell disease endothelial dysfunction ; 2 ) establish effect therapy peripheral blood marker inflammation vascular function , peripheral blood proteome transcriptome profile ; 3 ) investigate whether superoxide produce xanthine oxidase limit nitric oxide bioavailability patient sickle cell disease . In order control possibility advance age , gender ethnicity may influence vascular reactivity , also enroll age gender-matched African-American control baseline forearm blood flow portion study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY : All volunteer subject must least 18 year age provide informed , write consent participation study . Eligibility study determine prior enrollment basis follow inclusion exclusion criterion . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CONTROLS : For enrol study patient sickle cell disease , recruit AfricanAmerican healthy control subject gender , within 3 year age old young match patient . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SICKLE CELL COHORT : Males females 18 65 year age . Diagnosis sickle cell disease ( electrophoretic HPLC documentation hemoglobin S phenotype require ) . Hemoglobin must 69 g/dL absolute reticulocyte count great 95,000/microL , hemoglobin great 9 g/dL requirement reticulocyte count . Plasma soluble VCAM level median value sickle cell patient define assay perform laboratory blood sickle cell patient see program tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity ( determine Doppler echocardiography ) great 2.4 m/sec subnormal response LNMMA sodium nitroprusside infusion previous forearm blood flow study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SICKLE CELL COHORT : Clinically unstable sickle cell disease define acute pain crisis within last week . Current pregnancy lactation .
