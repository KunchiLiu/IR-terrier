	<detailed_description>Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) protective fluid fill empty space around brain spinal cord . CSF naturally produce absorb , age abnormal metabolism clearance amyloid beta protein lead accumulation protein , result plaque formation , lead contributor progression Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The shunt treatment design drain CSF toxic element skull allow replenishment normal CSF . This clinical study design determine device stop slow progression Alzheimer 's disease . The COGNIShunt® System proprietary device design increase flow cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) improve clearance putative neurotoxin CSF believe contribute progression Alzheimer 's disease symptom . This clinical study design determine device stop slow progression Alzheimer 's disease . The pivotal study prospective , randomized double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial evaluate effect flow-regulated ventriculoperitoneal CSF drainage COGNIShunt® system cognitive clinical function approximately 250 participant Alzheimer 's Disease ( NINDS/ADRDA criterion ) . Study participant permit continue anti-dementia drug therapy drug regime stable 3 month prior entry . This two-part study . In Part I , participant randomize receive either function COGNIShunt® System ( test/intervention group ) occlude shunt ( control/placebo group ) . The duration Part I nine month , follow extension phase additional 9 month , constitute Part II . During Part II , subject occluded shunt opportunity receive function COGNIShunt® , study participant may open device Part II . The total duration study 18 month . Visits site include : screening baseline ( may do one two visit ) ; surgery ; visit 1st , 3rd , 6th , 9th , 12th , 15th , 18th month surgery .</detailed_description>
