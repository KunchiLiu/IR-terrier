	<brief_summary>This study determine whether impaired hand function due stroke improved blocking nerve impulse unaffected arm . Following stroke , unaffected side brain might negatively influence affected side . Studies healthy volunteer show function one hand improve ischemic nerve block ( inflating pressure cuff block nerve impulse ) apply forearm hand . This study examine whether similar improvement also occur affected hand patient chronic impairment stroke . Stroke patient sensory ( numbness ) motor impairment ( weakness ) hand persist least 12 month stroke may eligible study . Patients one stroke , whose stroke affect side body , history deep vein thrombosis ( blood clotting ) , receive anticoagulant ( blood-thinning ) treatment time study enrol . Participants physical neurological examination undergo follow procedure : Session 1 - Magnetic resonance imaging ( one do within previous 6 month ) : MRI us magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 45 90 minute , patient lie still minute time . - Mini Mental State Examination - Patients take short test ass cognitive function . Sessions 2 ( possibly 3 4 ) - Motor task practice : Patients practice motor task several time achieve optimal performance . The task rhythmic , repetitive pinch grip maximal strength frequency one grip every 10 second . If technical difficulty arise session , procedure repeat session 3 4 . Sessions 5 ( possibly 6 ) - Pinch grip ischemic nerve block ( INB ) : Patients perform pinch grip task several time INB apply . For INB , blood pressure cuff inflate around arm level elbow 35 50 minute . The procedure cause temporary numbness , tingle , loss muscle strength , discoloration forearm hand . Patients repeat pinch grip task INB 20 minute INB release . If technical difficulty arise session , procedure repeat session 6 . Session 7 This session identical session 5 , except INB apply immediately ankle instead forearm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There therapeutic option treatment disability result chronic stroke . We recently find transient deafferentation one hand healthy subject enhance performance corticomotor excitability tactile discriminative task , target muscle opposite non-deafferented hand . The purpose protocol test hypothesis transient deafferentation intact hand chronic stroke patient improve function paretic hand . We plan study patient chronic stroke date back least one year , either predominantly motor somatosensory deficit . Primary outcome measure ( ) patient predominantly somatosensory deficit , deafferentation-induced improvement tactile discrimination task ( grate orientation task GOT ( b ) patient predominantly motor deficit , deafferentation-induced improvement pinch muscle strength . Modified primary outcome measure decrease interhemispheric inhibition target paretic hand deafferentation healthy hand ( chronic stroke patient , motor deficit group ) . Secondary outcome measure decrease interhemispheric inhibition target non-deafferented hand healthy control subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include patient thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric lesion hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion ( subcortical corticospinal tract , cortical motor somatosensory representation , document CT MRI ) least 12 month stroke . In addition , TMS measurement include 17 age gendermatched control subject . For GOT task , choose subject initially severe sensory paresis ( sensory NIHSS 1 ) , subsequently recover point residual somatosensory deficit perform task . For motor performance , choose subject initially severe motor paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) , subsequently recover point residual motor deficit perform require task . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one stroke . Patients bilateral motor impairment . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients subject unable perform task ( wrist elbow flexion least MRC grade 2 , less 75 % performance grate orientation task grate 3.0 ) . Patients subject history severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . Patients subject severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Patients subject increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Patients subject unstable cardiac arrhythmia . Patients subject history hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system . Patients moderate severe microangiopathy , polyneuropathy , diabetes mellitus , ischemic peripheral disease . Patients history deep vein thrombosis . Patients receive anticoagulant treatment time propose study . Excessive callus palm finger . Pregnancy woman .</criteria>
