	<brief_summary>In developed country , Guillain-Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) common cause acute neuromuscular paralysis , afflict 5,000 person annually United States . Over 20 % GBS patient permanent residual motor deficit affect activity daily live . The goal study assess potential usefulness safety 4-aminopyridine ( 4-AP ) patient suffer chronic functional deficit GBS.This medication potassium channel blocker potential improve nerve conduction , particularly across partially demyelinate axon . It felt increase nerve conduction improve motor performance walk activity daily live , well decreased fatiguability . This medication demonstrate potential usefulness central demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis.Because peripheral nervous system much accessible systemic medication delivery felt medication may improve functional status patient suffer residual side effect medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Chronic Guillain-Barre Syndrome Improvement With Use 4-aminopyridine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective.- To determine safety efficacy orally deliver 4-aminopyridine motor weakness due Guillain-Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) FDA approve protocol ( IND No : 58,029 ) . Setting.- Tertiary care outpatient rehabilitation center directly attach university hospital . Subjects.- Subjects unable ambulate 200 foot without assistive device residual nonprogressive motor weakness due GBS one year initial episode . Design.- Subjects randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over design , two eight-week treatment arm three-week washout . The average dosage 4 week 30 milligram ( mg ) per day . Patients demonstrate improvement continue medication additional three month . Assessments perform every two week randomize trial every month continue three month medication .</detailed_description>
