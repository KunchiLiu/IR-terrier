PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness celecoxib prevent breast cancer premenopausal woman risk develop cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Preventing Breast Cancer At-Risk Premenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine change proliferation benign breast epithelial cell measure Ki-67/MIB-1 premenopausal woman high risk estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer treat celecoxib . - Determine feasibility regimen dropout rate patient 12 month treatment compliance . - Determine proportion woman likely express cyclooxygenase-2 protein ( COX-2 ) least 10 % benign ductal epithelial cell . - Compare success rate obtain adequate ductal epithelial cell random periareolar fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) ductal lavage patient vs 12 month prevention intervention . - Assess pain associate FNA ductal lavage woman . - Correlate , possible , serum proteomics pattern cytologic assessment mammographic density baseline 12 month patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily . Treatment continue 12 month absence clinical evidence cancer confirm biopsy unacceptable toxicity . Patients assess baseline 12 month mammographic breast density , serum hormone level , serum IGF-1/IGFBP-3 . Patients undergo ductal lavage fine needle aspiration assessment supernatant proteomics breast biomarkers . Patients follow 2 week annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 110 patient accrue study within 10-14 month .</detailed_description>
