	<brief_summary>This study develop new technique optimize resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) high magnetic field 7 Tesla . MRI diagnostic tool generates high-quality image body without use x-ray . It also provide information brain chemistry physiology . The test routinely do magnetic field strengths 1.5 4 Tesla . This study use investigational device operate high magnetic field 7 Tesla . Except increase magnetic field , aspect image lower magnetic field . This study use technique conjunction higher magnetic field may improve diagnostic imaging . The MRI monitor brain high resolution see structural feature , measure brain chemical , determine much fast blood flow brain region response simple task . Healthy normal volunteer 18 year age old may participate study . Candidates screen medical history , neurological examination , questionnaire . Participants standard 1.5 3 Tesla MRI 7 Tesla scan , add 5 minute procedure . The procedure scan . The subject lie table move scanner . Because machine make loud sound image , earplug provide help reduce noise . An insulated wire coil may place around subject 's head obtain good image . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , examination last 45 90 minute . During scan , subject may ask perform simple task , listen tone , tap finger , move hand , watch movie screen , smell pleasant odor . More complex task may require think tone picture respond press button . Following test , subject complete brief questionnaire comfort level unusual sensation may experience test . Participants undergo repeat MRIs evaluation new technique standard 1.5 3 Tesla MRI brain study year participate research protocol . A radiologist NIH read MRIs , abnormality discover , individual refer private physician consult service NIH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Techniques Use MRI With Magnetic Field 7 Tesla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal protocol optimize new technology enable Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) static magnetic field strength 7 Tesla ( 7T ) . Techniques develop anatomical , functional , spectroscopic MRI take advantage high field . Routine clinical MRI perform 1.5T twenty year past ten year MRI 3-4T demonstrate large increase sensitivity begin find widespread application functional imaging brain clinical research . Since late 1990 's possible produce magnet field strengths 7-9T large enough human use . Indeed presently two site 7T one 8T MRI begin produce excite image . These initial result confirm MRI perform safely high field strength whole range MRI experiment perform . We take delivery first 7T MRI system produce General Electric , lead producer MRI equipment , sometime late 2002/early 2003 . Compared 3-4T , 7T scanner expect improve sensitivity factor two improve contrast noise functional imaging spectroscopy factor two - four . However , realize goal routine practice whole brain coverage require technical development integrate development optimize data acquisition processing strategy . Therefore , plan extend parallel imaging strategy , currently become available 3T MRI , 7T order realize full gain sensitivity apply technique obtain high resolution anatomical MRI , generate high temporal spatial resolution perfusion image use arterial spin label technique , generate high-temporal spatial resolution functional image brain use blood oxygenation ( BOLD ) perfusion base technique , test usefulness 7T spectroscopic study metabolites brain . All development perform normal , healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Only neurologically psychiatrically normal , male female , healthy volunteer 18 year old used study . Subjects must capable understanding procedure requirement study . Subjects must willing sign inform consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject exclude he/she contraindication MR scan follow : pregnancy , aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving insulin pump ) , dental work crown bridge indeterminate metal , preexist eye condition , preexist hearing problem . Subjects underwent brain surgery , neurological lesion , psychiatric history history migraine also exclude study . The contraindication MRI 7T identical 1.5T 3T .</criteria>
