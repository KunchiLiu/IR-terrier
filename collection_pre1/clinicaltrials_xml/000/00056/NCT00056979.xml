	<brief_summary>This study treat patient inherited disease prevents body make specific protein enzyme need body 's metabolism . Lack enzyme cause accumulation harmful toxic substance body , lead deterioration failure organs brain heart . This disease fatal . Some patient inherit metabolic storage disease may benefit allogeneic stem cell transplant ( 'allogeneic ' mean stem cell come another person ) . Stem cell create bone marrow . They mature different type blood cell need include red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Stem cell , transplant , make new blood system . Donor stem cell make protein enzyme patient disease cell . The donor cell may prevent accumulation toxic substance . It hop donor cell prevent stop disease progressing . This research study use new pre-treatment combination two drug , Anti-CD45 CAMPATH-1H . Anti-CD45 CAMPATH-1H antibody certain type blood cell . CAMPATH-1H particularly important stay active body long time infusion , mean may work long prevent GVHD symptom . In addition antibody , patient receive Fludarabine , chemotherapy drug . Fludarabine kill bone marrow cell give reduce bone marrow cell donor stem cell may 'take . '</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fludarabine give daily IV ( intravenous , vein ) infusion total 5 day . CAMPATH-1H give daily 4-hour IV ( intravenous , vein ) infusion three day . Anti-CD45 give daily 6-hour IV infusion next 4 day . Then patient one-day rest period receive stem cell transplant . To help prevent body reject transplant , patient also receive drug FK506 , start two day transplant continue three month . If GVHD , amount FK506 patient take reduced 20 % every 2 week medication stop .</detailed_description>
