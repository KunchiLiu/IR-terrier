	<brief_summary>This study explore genes-units heredity-may influence severity ankylose spondylitis . It examine whether gene may cause people ankylose spondylitis rapid fusion bone spine , difficulty perform daily activity , likely need joint surgery . Patients develop ankylose spondylitis age 16 disease 20 year may eligible study . The onset disease date first appearance symptom inflammatory low back pain restrict spinal motion . Patients spondyloarthropathy AS may enroll . Participants complete brief medical history physical exam . They fill 30-minute questionnaire include question demographic ( age , ethnicity , marital status , etc . ) , medication history , work history , hip surgery , assessment functional disability . Fifty milliliter ( 3-1/3 tablespoon ) blood draw gene test , X-rays take pelvis , low back , neck , recent X-rays ( within 1 year ) available . Women childbearing age urine pregnancy test X-rays .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Determinants Ankylosing Spondylitis Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The susceptibility ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) largely genetically determine . Recent study suggest severity AS also influence large extent genetic factor . The goal study identify gene influence severity AS . We hypothesize genetic marker susceptibility , include human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) polymorphism , among gene also influence severity AS . Other gene could potentially influence severity AS include affect severity joint inflammation influence bone formation . In cross-sectional study , test association HLA marker polymorphisms several gene involve regulation inflammation bone formation severity AS . Approximately 500 patient enrol . Each patient AS least 20 year . Measures AS severity extent spinal fusion measure radiographically , functional disability , time permanent work disability , need total hip arthroplasty . Identifying genetic marker associate difference severity AS greatly enhance understand pathogenesis disease suggest mechanisms pathway involve development long-term damage . In separate relate protocol , assess genetic marker associate persistent active inflammation patient AS .</detailed_description>
