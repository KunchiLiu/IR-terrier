	<brief_summary>This study examine whether measurement connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) cell proteins identify kidney transplant recipient likely develop chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) , disease transplant kidney . CAN may occur month year transplant . The kidney become progressively scar eventually lose function , dialysis another transplant need . A good understanding CTGF proteins involve development CAN may provide new target treat disease . Patients schedule receive kidney combine kidney-pancreas transplant receive transplant recently ( within 6 month ) may eligible study . Participants enrol transplant , possible , transplant , undergo follow test procedure : - Physical examination screen visit , 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month , yearly . - Blood sample collection screen visit , 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month yearly . - Urine sample collection screen visit , 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month yearly . - Kidney biopsy begin study , 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month , year research purpose . Participants may refuse research biopsy time study . Also , patient kidney biopsy another reason time point second biopsy . The biopsy procedure take 15 minute do hospital . The patient lie back skin transplant kidney clean alcohol iodine . The area numb injection anesthetic , biopsy needle place kin . The biopsy may repeat three time get enough tissue test CAN . Patients lie flat 4 hour procedure reduce risk bleeding , observe another 2 hour possible complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Connective Tissue Growth Factor Development Kidney Disease After Organ Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following transplantation , recipient organ allograft place immunosuppression indefinitely . Despite dramatic improvement acute rejection rate short-term graft survival , long term graft survival change appreciably past 20 year . In kidney transplantation , lead cause late graft loss chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) . This disorder clinically characterize progressive decline kidney function , associate characteristic histologic feature interstitial fibrosis inflammation , arteriosclerosis , glomerulosclerosis , tubular atrophy . Both immunologic non-immunologic factor implicate development CAN . However , etiology disorder clearly define specific therapy treating CAN . Implicated development CAN rodent human transform growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) , pleiotropic cytokine elevate CAN recipient , stimulates matrix deposition within graft . A downstream effector TGF-b connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) , recently associate fibrotic renal disease . In preliminary study mouse model CAN , CTGF gene expression increase kidney transplant CAN . However , role human CAN unknown . The aim investigation identify whether CTGF may play role pathogenesis CAN human . Our long-term objective determine whether CTGF cytokine mediator may novel target therapy CAN . Our goal : 1 . Determine level CTGF express urine serum CTGF recipients kidney transplant ; 2 . Identify whether urinary serum CTGF might marker CAN utilized predictor risk develop disease ; 3 . Identify molecular message protein may identify development CAN , potential future target treatment . In prospective study , serial urine serum sample obtain recipient , , , transplantation kidney allograft . The graft monitor context standard measure renal function , include serum creatinine creatinine clearance . These result correlate clinically descriptive information regard recipient transplant .</detailed_description>
