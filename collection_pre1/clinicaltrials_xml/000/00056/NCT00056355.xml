	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) control Crohn 's disease symptoms patient taper corticosteroid dose . Crohn 's disease chronic inflammatory bowel disease . Patients commonly chronic diarrhea abdominal pain , loss appetite weight loss . Acute disease flare treat large dos corticosteroid , long-term use drug harmful side effect . ECP ( describe ) , approve treat skin symptom associate type cancer call cutaneous T-cell lymphoma use experimentally condition involve abnormal inflammation . Patients 18 year age old Crohn 's disease least 6 month , corticosteroid-dependent , whose symptom control well enough Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) less 220 , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history review medical record , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential , questionnaire Crohn 's disease affect life activity . Patients CDAI score less 150 begin ECP treatment soon possible . Those score 150 219 corticosteroid dose increase enough bring CDAI score 150 begin ECP . Patients achieve CDAI le 150 4 6 week increase corticosteroid exclude study . Participants ECP treatment 2 consecutive day every 2 week 24 week , total 26 treatment . For ECP , patient undergo leukapheresis , method collect large number white blood cell , leukocytes-cells may responsible many medical problem Crohn 's disease . Whole blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate unit blood . The blood flow machine separate component spin . The white cell remove collected plastic bag , red blood cell plasma return patient 's bloodstream needle . The collected white cell mixed drug call UVADEXÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) , expose ultraviolet ( UVA ) light , return patient ' bloodstream . ( The UVADEX allow blood cell absorb UVA . ) The UVA change cell way , back body , cause change cell like . Each ECP treatment take 3 4 hour . On first day 2-day treatment , patient undergo review symptom , check vital sign , blood draw . They complete CDAI diary 7 day first two ECP treatment questionnaire life activity 4-week interval . During ECP treatment period , corticosteroid slowly reduce long disease symptom worsen . Patients whose disease remain control cessation steroid may begin maintenance ECP , 2 day row every 4 week additional 20 week ( another 10 treatment ) , follow-up described , full physical examination 4 week final treatment . Patients able reduce , stop , steroid treatment may consider maintenance therapy think continue treatment may enable reduction steroid . Patients whose disease symptoms worsen ECP able decrease steroid dose eligible maintenance therapy participation study end .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extracorporeal Photopheresis Maintain Symptoms Remission During Steroid Withdrawal Patients With Steroid-Dependent Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol aim measure safety effectiveness extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) therapy maintain remission symptom withdrawal corticosteroids patient steroid-dependent Crohn 's disease . Potential subject asymptomatic low level symptom respond increase steroid dose ; furthermore potential subject dependent steroid control symptoms history fail immunosuppressive drug control symptom . This unblinded , single-arm study ECP Crohn 's disease . This trial use ECP twice week every two week 24 week time dose corticosteroid taper . If corticosteroid able withdrawn without increase symptom , subject may eligible ECP ( twice week every four week 24 week ) maintenance regimen . Outcome parameter include rate complete partial steroid taper maintain remission , rate adverse event , secondary clinical outcome duration response , rate time relapse , change symptom index score . In addition , NIH perform substudy include serial colonoscopy measure cytokine cell population change mononuclear cell extracted biopsy . The long-term goal study test safety efficacy ECP steroid-sparing remittive therapy Crohn 's disease , determine immune response effect gut mucosa , identify factor associated responder versus non-responders ECP .</detailed_description>
