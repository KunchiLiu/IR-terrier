	<brief_title>VITAL - VITamins Slow ALzheimer 's Disease ( Homocysteine Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood level homocysteine elevate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute disease pathophysiology vascular direct neurotoxic mechanism . Homocysteine level reduce administration high dose supplement folate ( folic acid ) vitamins B6 B12 . The propose study multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial determine whether reduction homocysteine level high-dose folate/B6/B12 supplementation slow rate cognitive decline subject AD . This parallel design study , include two group unequal size : 60 % subject receive daily high-dose supplement ( folate 5mg , vitamin B6 25mg , vitamin B12 1 mg ) , 40 % receive identical look placebo . The duration treatment 18 month , participant make eight visit assign study site safety efficacy assessment medication . The primary outcome measure longitudinal decline ADAScog , psychometric instrument evaluate memory , attention , reason , language , orientation praxis ( Rosen et al 1984 ) . To power trial detect 25 % reduction rate ADAScog decline ( 80 % power , alpha=0.05 , drop-out estimate 20 % , drop-in estimate 10 % ) , enroll total 400 participant . Persons minority racial group also recruit , although participant must able speak either English Spanish .</detailed_description>
