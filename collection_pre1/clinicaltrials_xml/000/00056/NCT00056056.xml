	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Ultraviolet light therapy use light drug make cancer cell sensitive light kill tumor cell . It yet know whether ultraviolet light therapy effective without bexarotene treat mycosis fungoides . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness ultraviolet light therapy use methoxsalen without bexarotene treat patient mycosis fungoides .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultraviolet Light Therapy Using Methoxsalen With Without Bexarotene Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine ultraviolet A light therapy methoxsalen ( PUVA ) without bexarotene yield significantly high overall response rate patient mycosis fungoides . - Compare overall response rate ( CCR partial response ) patient treat regimen . - Compare duration CCR time relapse patient treat regimen . - Compare number PUVA session necessary achieve CCR patient . - Determine percentage dropouts patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , age ( 60 vs 60 ) , stage disease ( IB v IIA ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive PUVA comprise oral methoxsalen give 2 hour whole body ultraviolet A therapy . PUVA give 3 time per week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral bexarotene daily PUVA arm I . In arm , treatment repeat 16 week absence complete clinical response , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week first document progression relapse . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 145 patient accrue study within 25 month .</detailed_description>
