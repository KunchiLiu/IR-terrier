	<brief_summary>This study test ability experimental drug EYE001 reduce retinal thickening improve vision patient Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome ( VHL ) . Angiomas ( blood vessel tumor ) commonly develop back eye retina optic nerve patient VHL . Although tumor cancerous , may cause significant vision loss . Current treatment , include laser therapy , cryotherapy , vitrectomy , may successful possible patient . EYE001 decrease production VEGF , growth factor important formation new blood vessel elevate VHL . Preliminary finding study retinal disease suggest EYE001 reduce retinal thickening improve vision . Patients 18 year age old retinal angioma due VHL one eye central vision loss 20/40 worse may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . - Eye examination , include eye pressure measurement dilation pupil examine retina . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . For test , yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture reveal dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Optical coherence tomography measure retinal thickness . The eye examine machine produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measure repeat study determine change , , retinal thickening . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) measure electrical response generate within retina . For test , patient sits dark room 30 minute eyes patch . Then , small silver disk electrode tap forehead , eye patch remove , surface eye numb eye drop , contact lens place eye . The patient look inside open white globe emits series light flash 20 minute . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash . - Stereoscopic color fundus photography examine back eye . The pupil dilate eye drop examine photograph back eye . - EYE001 injection treat ocular angioma . Patients receive EYE001 injection needle eye 's vitreous ( gel-like substance fill inside eye ) . Six injection give 30-week period . Before injection , surface eye numb anesthetic eye drop . This follow injection another anesthetic low portion eye clear tissue surround white eye . After minute , EYE001 inject vitreous . Patients receive EYE001 injection first visit ( enrollment ) 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 week first injection . At injection visit , participant repeat test describe evaluate response treatment return week later another eye examination . After last injection , patient whose vision improve may receive three treatment visit 36 , 42 , 48 . All participant return examination week 54 2 month final injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EYE001 Treat Retinal Tumors Patients With Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) autosomal dominant heritable disorder multiple benign malignant neoplasms cyst specific histopathologies develop kidney , adrenal gland , pancreas , brain , spinal cord , eye , inner ear , epididymis , broad ligament . Retinal angioma may one early manifestation VHL disease may lead significant decrease visual acuity affect individual . These tumor rarely regress spontaneously . The main cause vision loss retinal edema , specifically macular edema secondary enlargement peripheral retinal angioma angioma find around optic disk . Treatment retinal angioma depend location size lesion typically consist photocoagulation cryotherapy . However , proven effective therapy treatment VHL ocular lesion surround optic nerve lesion peripheral retina large respond traditional therapy . The genetic mutation find VHL disease up-regulates production vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Immunochemical study VHL ocular lesion , well others find elsewhere body show marked increase VEGF . This open-label study pilot use anti-VEGF therapy ( EYE001 ) 5 patient investigate potential efficacy treatment retinal angioma associate VHL . Patients receive 6 intravitreal injection study drug 30-week period , return follow-up visit 1 year initiating injection . The primary outcome improvement best correct visual acuity 15 letter 1 year , reduction retinal thickening leakage one year , change ERG amplitude implicit time , adverse event include local systemic toxicity .</detailed_description>
