	<brief_summary>This study explore gene may influence severity ankylose spondylitis , form arthritis affect spine . Patients inflammation joint spine , may cause bone spine fuse , result difficulty perform daily activity . Patients develop ankylose spondylitis age 16 may eligible study . The onset disease date first appearance symptom inflammatory low back pain restrict spinal motion . Patients spondyloarthropathy AS may participate . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , review medical record . They also complete questionnaire disease symptoms medical history . Those enrolled study return NIH Clinical Center 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 , 60 month screen examination joint , measurement flexibility spine , blood test . They also complete symptom assessment cop questionnaire . At first study visit ( screen visit ) , x-rays take pelvis , low back , neck , recent X-rays ( within 1 year ) available . These x-ray study repeat patient every two year study ( 24 48 month screen ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Determinants Ankylosing Spondylitis Severity - Longitudinal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The susceptibility ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) largely genetically determine . Recent study suggest severity AS also influence genetic factor . The goal study identify gene influence severity AS . We hypothesize genetic marker susceptibility , include human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) polymorphism , gene regulate inflammation bone formation , influence severity AS . In prospective longitudinal study , test association several genetic marker severity AS . Approximately 700 patient include . Measures AS severity patient-reported pain stiffness , functional disability , patient physician global assessment , joint count , number tender entheses , spinal mobility , laboratory measure inflammation . These measure assess every 6 month 5 year . We also evaluate new laboratory test measure activity AS . Identifying genetic marker associate difference severity active inflammation AS enhance understanding pathogenesis disease suggest mechanisms pathway involve development long-term damage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants : 1. diagnose AS modify New York criterion . 2. able read English Spanish Potential participant exclude : 1. spondyloarthropathy AS . 2. unable provide inform consent . 3. anticipate available able comply schedule study visit . Study entry limit sex ethnic origin . Children necessarily exclude spondyloarthropathy develop age 16 consider form juvenile idiopathic arthritis , different ageappropriate measure functional disability pain would need . Participants recruit physician referral selfreferral . Information study mail local rheumatologist post NIH website . Notices also send local chapter Arthritis Foundation Spondylitis Association America . Former participant AS protocol notify study letter . Study firstdegree relative : Participants : 1 . Parent , sibling , child ( age 18 old ) enrol subject . 2 . Able provide inform consent . Family member may asymptomatic sign symptom AS condition spondyloarthropathy family . There requirement minimum number member per family eligible participation . The accrual ceiling unlimited . Approximately 700 patient enrol study site . Approximately 150 patient recruit NIH . Other site participate study CedarsSinai Medical Center , Los Angeles , CA ; University CaliforniaSan Francisco University TexasHouston Health Sciences Center . To ensure sufficient sample patient active inflammation , enrollment study monitor least 80 patient include ESR 40 mm/hr high screen visit visit 1 , elevate serum Creactive protein level visit 1 .</criteria>
