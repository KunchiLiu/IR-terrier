	<brief_summary>This study explore clinical hereditary ( genetic ) feature inherit cataract . A cataract clouding eye lens , focus light back eye . When lens becomes cloudy let light , vision impair . Cataracts may associate vision problem alone , problem , change facial appearance skin problem . A good understanding genetic condition may help development well diagnostic test . Patients inherited cataract family member may eligible study . Participants drawn patient enrolled study inherit cataract NEI collaborate clinic . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical surgical history ; - Verification diagnosis ; - Construction family tree regard familial vision problem ; - Complete eye examination , include dilation pupil photography lens , test color vision field vision , ability see dark ; - Blood sample collection ( 20 ml , 4 teaspoon ) genetic study hereditary cataract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project , Clinical Molecular Studies Families Congenital Hereditary Cataracts study inheritance genetic cataract , Mendelian complex age relate cataract , family many nationality ethnic background order identify gene , mutate , cause cataract pathophysiology act . Study Population : Families many nationality ethnic background . We study maximum 5,000 patient family member . Design : The study consist ascertain individual , especially family multiple individual , affect congenital age relate cataract . These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmological examination characterize cataract determine affectation status . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA individual lymphoblastoid transformation establish renewable source DNA . Linkage analysis , physical mapping , mutational screening carry identify specific gene mutation associate cataract family . If necessary , gene product characterize biochemically . The study enroll subject NEI collaborate institution , Centre Excellence Molecular Biology , Lahore , Pakistan , Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center , Guangzhou , China , Aravind Eye Hospital , Madurai , India , University Parma , Italy All India Institute Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) . Outcome Measures : Linkage determine use lod score method mutation specific gene assess use combination residue conservation , blosum score , molecular modeling . Biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect individualize specific assay .</detailed_description>
