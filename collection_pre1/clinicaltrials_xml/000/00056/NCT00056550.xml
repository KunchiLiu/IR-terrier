	<brief_summary>Patients hereditary antithrombin ( AT ) deficiency increase risk venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism , particularly certain high risk procedure . The trial focus patient confirm hereditary antithrombin deficiency undergo surgical procedure induced/spontaneous labor delivery . The study test safety efficacy recombinant human antithrombin ( rhAT ) infusing rhAT prior , follow period risk surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess Incidence Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) Following Administration Recombinant Human Antithrombin ( rhAT ) Hereditary Antithrombin ( AT ) Deficient Patients High Risk Situations .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Assess safety recombinant antithrombin ( rhAT ) hereditary antithrombin ( AT ) deficient patient . 2 . Assess incidence acute deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) alone patient hereditary antithrombin ( AT ) deficiency situation usually associate high risk thromboembolic event increase target functional AT activity &gt; 80 % &lt; 120 % normal prophylactic IV administration rhAT . 3 . Clinically assess determine relevance thromboembolic event acute DVT rhAT administration .</detailed_description>
