	<detailed_description>The goal vaccination study evaluate safety immunogenicity Therion Biologic Corporation ( Cambridge , MA ) TBC-3B vaccine . TBC-3B consist live , recombinant vaccinia virus express env gag/pol gene HIV-1 strain IIIB . TBC-3B administer subcutaneous injection groin deltoid region , aim determine site well induce mucosal immune response . Because groin area drain inguinal lymph node , vaccine give may stimulate local immunologic activity drain rectal mucosa well systemic immunologic activity blood . Volunteers follow 20 month . The first 2 month study evaluation volunteer ' normal immune function . Volunteers randomly select receive TBC-3B experimental HIV vaccine either groin area deltoid region . Neither volunteer study personnel know group volunteer day first immunization . All volunteer receive TBC-3B . During 20 month study , volunteer ask donate blood 14 time , undergo seven flexible sigmoidoscopy biopsy , receive three pair vaccine injection . For 36 day experimental vaccination , volunteer ask abstain activity might spread virus vaccine put others risk . Volunteers receive specific instruction avoid risk .
