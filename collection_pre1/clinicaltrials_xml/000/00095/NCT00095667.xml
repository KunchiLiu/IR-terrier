	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity GW572016 hormone na√Øve , recurrent and/or metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer use PSA response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective tumor response patient measurable disease . II . To determine duration PSA response , rate duration stable disease , progression-free , median overall survival rate GW572016 recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer . III . To document safety tolerability GW572016 patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate difference baseline level EGFR and/or erbB2 expression , receptor phosphorylation status tumor specimens predict outcome therapy . II . To investigate inhibitory effect GW572016 EGFR and/or erbB2 pathway activation tumor specimens correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-41 patient accrue study within 11.7 month .</detailed_description>
