	<brief_summary>This study examine way nitric oxide ( NO ) , important molecule control blood flow body 's vessel , might restore compound call sodium nitrite . It hop result reverse effect decrease flow blood due sickled cells-that , cell change shape crescent sickle . Sickle cell disease common genetic disease affect African Americans . About 8 % population sickle cell trait . The changed cell become attached blood vessel , decrease blood flow vital organ . There loss need protein , include hemoglobin , deliver oxygen throughout body . Adults least 18 year age SS form sickle cell disease S-beta-thalassemia , either steady state crisis , give inform write consent participation , negative pregnancy test may eligible study . Adults disease put risk reduce circulation eligible . Women breastfeed eligible . Participants undergo medical history , include family medical history , detailed physical evaluation , take 1 hour . There collection blood ; echocardiogram , involve take picture heart four chamber ; measurement exhale carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide , NO . A procedure call orthogonal polarization spectral imaging perform . A small object size Popsicle stick place tongue fingertip . This procedure present picture blood flow red blood cell appear circulate blood vessel . The study conduct Vascular Laboratory/Cardiovascular Floor Intensive Care last 4 hour . During study , patient lie adjustable recline bed chair . Small tube place artery vein forearm inside elbow . A small pressure cuff apply wrist large one upper arm . Both cuff inflate air . A strain gauge , resemble rubber band , go around wide part forearm . When pressure cuff fill air , blood flow arm , information strain gauge record . Between administration medicine , 30-minute rest . Normal saline put small tube artery . Measurements blood flow forearm take , small blood sample take measure blood count , protein , natural body chemical . Then medicine call sodium nitroprusside , cause blood vessel expand increase blood flow , place forearm . It give three different dos 3 minute , measurement record dose . Then medicine call L-NMMA place forearm . L-NMMA generally decrease local blood flow prevent nitric oxide produce cell line blood vessel . It give two different dos 5 minute , blood flow measure dose . Next , nitrite place forearm three different dos 5 minute . Before nitrite give , researcher measure amount NO , carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide patient breathe . Then procedure administer normal saline , sodium nitroprusside , L-NMMA repeat , blood test . This study direct benefit participant . However , hop information gain study help develop treatment option patient sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 % African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 % sickle cell trait . Hemoglobin S polymerization lead red cell rigidity , microvascular obstruction , inflammation , end-organ ischemia-reperfusion injury infarction . Our publish data indicate 50 % sickle cell patient endothelial dysfunction due impaired bioavailability endogenous nitric oxide due large part scavenge nitric oxide cell-free plasma hemoglobin . These data suggest therapy direct restore NO bioavailability might prove beneficial . We recently discover nitrite anion , available currently human use component cyanide antidote kit , vasodilator vivo generate nitric oxide ( NO ) tissue low oxygen tension pH . The mechanism involve novel physiological function human hemoglobin oxygen- pH dependent nitrite reductase . To date observe nitrite infusion animal model significantly reduce liver cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury infarction mouse model , prevent cerebral vasospasm subarachnoid hemorrhage primate , decrease pulmonary hypertension newborn hypoxic sheep . The current protocol design phase I/II trial address hypothesis nitrite infusion vasodilate circulation patient sickle cell disease rest vaso-occlusive pain crisis , inactivate circulate cell-free plasma hemoglobin , reduce pulmonary artery pressure reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury ( measure circulate marker oxidant stress ) .</detailed_description>
