	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate MTD describe DLT oral lapatinib ( GW572016 ) administer twice daily 28 day child recurrent refractory malignant brain tumor receive steroid ( Stratum 1 ) describe toxicity receive steroid ( Stratum 2 ) . II . To test ability lapatinib ( GW572016 ) inhibit ERBB receptor signal recurrent refractory : medulloblastoma/PNET , high-grade glioma ependymomas . III . To estimate sustained objective response rate ( CR plus PR sustain 8 week ) lapatinib ( GW572016 ) administer continuously MTD ( 900 mg/m2/dose bid ) child recurrent refractory : medulloblastoma/PNET , high-grade glioma ependymoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize plasma pharmacokinetics lapatinib ( GW572016 ) tumor tissue lapatinib ( GW572016 ) concentration child . II . To assess effect steroid pharmacokinetics lapatinib ( GW572016 ) . III . To explore pharmacogenetic polymorphism lapatinib ( GW572016 ) metabolize enzymes relate polymorphism drug pharmacokinetics . IV . To estimate incidence ERBB1 , ERBB2 , ERBB3 ERBB4 expression pathway activation recurrent refractory CNS tumor childhood , include ependymoma , medulloblastoma/PNET glioma . V. To identify additional gene within outside canonical ERBB pathway might act determinant response lapatinib ( GW572016 ) . VI . To explore change PET correlative magnetic resonance image child receive lapatinib . Imaging study may combine across similar PBTC protocol increase power detect correlation among scans association outcome . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor vs high-grade glioma v ependymoma ) . Molecular Biology Phase : Patients randomize receive lapatinib prior surgery receive oral lapatinib twice daily 7-14 day . Surgery perform 7-14 day lapatinib treatment . For patient randomize receive lapatinib , surgery perform within 3 week registration . After surgical resection , molecular biology participant start lapatinib treatment within 10 day post-surgery . The first dose lapatinib post-surgery initiate course 1 . Patients receive oral lapatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course ( 2 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Lapatinib Continuation/Phase II : Patients receive oral lapatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course ( 2 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
