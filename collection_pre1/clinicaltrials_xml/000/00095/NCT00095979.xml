	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient recurrent persistent endometrial adenocarcinoma treat ixabepilone . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
