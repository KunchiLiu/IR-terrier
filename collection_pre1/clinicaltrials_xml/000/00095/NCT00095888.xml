	<brief_title>3-AP Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine antitumor activity 3-AP ( Triapine® ) gemcitabine measure tumor size patient refractory metastatic breast cancer . Secondary I . Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . II . Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . III . Determine effect multidrug resistance polymorphism pharmacokinetics toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 3-AP ( Triapine® ) IV 2 hour follow gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year registration . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-75 patient accrue study within 24 month .</detailed_description>
