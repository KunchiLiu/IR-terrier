	<brief_summary>This study examine whether lithium carbonate , give alone divalproex , increase amount brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) spinal fluid patient Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , hereditary disorder central nervous system . Patients fatal degenerative disease lower amount substance brain spinal fluid call trophic growth factor . One factor BDNF . A possible treatment HD may increase level BDNF . Lithium carbonate , drug use treat bipolar disorder , divalproex , drug use treat mood disorder seizure disorder , show increase amount BDNF protein laboratory study . Patients 18 70 year old DNA-confirmed diagnosis Huntington 's disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , neurological evaluation , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Participants take lithium carbonate without divalproex . They also receive placebo ( inactive substance ) portion study . On first day study , patient give supply pill instruction take . Blood pressure pulse measure , blood urine test may do . Patients evaluate standardized test scale assessment various aspect HD . Patients return clinic week follow-up evaluation , include blood urine test , physical examination , disease assessment , review medication side effect . Each week , receive new supply medication instruction take . At end sixth week , finish take medication . During study , patient undergo three lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) - week 2 , 4 , 6 - measure BDNF various brain chemical . For test , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . The procedure generally take 5 20 minute . Patients return clinic 2 week complete study medication final evaluation , include physical examination blood urine test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Lithium Divalproex ` Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Huntington 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall objective study examine acute effect lithium alone and/ combination divalproex marker neuroprotective activity patient Huntington 's disease ( HD ) . It hypothesize safe tolerable dos drug enhance deplete level brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , neurotrophin necessary survival striatal neuron . Study population : Patients suffer Huntington 's disease study participant . Design : The acute effect lithium divalproex surrogate measure neuroprotective activity evaluate 24 HD patient . The study , last approximately 6 week , conduct outpatient basis . Outcome measure : In proof-of-principle study , efficacy restore BDNF concentration assess cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) measurement . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test .</detailed_description>
