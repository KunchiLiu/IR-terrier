	<brief_summary>This study examine change move NIH 's Building 10 Clinical Center ( CC ) Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) may amount activity person engage daily , register pedometer , measure horizontal vertical step . The investigator study hope good understand impact move one group employee compare impact group . Moving new work location may require physical activity different employee currently experience job . In new location , may walk long short distance ; may also climb few stair . In addition , may need walk quickly accomplish task . It important understand move CC CRC influence employee ' health , well-being , overall function . Physical measure , blood pressure , examine . So well employee adjust new location-for example , information work-related injury . Clinical Center employee able walk , whose move date allow 10 day Clinical Center move , wish participate study able wear pedometer , whose work requirement include sufficient amount walking may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure move CRC 1 month move . Each evaluation take 30 minute : - Brief history age , medical problem , current medication . - Measurements heart rate , blood pressure , height , weight . - Completing brief questionnaire history injury , back pain , tendonitis , bursitis . In addition , participant complete questionnaire daily life leisure activity , consist 94 question , take 20 minute complete . There also measurement distance participant walk 2 minute . A pedometer provide participant remain property person . Participants receive daily log record number step walk distance register pedometer . About 5 minute day need record information . The information participant provide cod . They personally identify , information discuss people , include supervisor co-worker . Information collect analyzed change activity pattern analyze group staff . For example , investigator may wish compare activity nurse move compare information information collect food service worker , personnel serve messenger escort . Participants may find information gather useful individual . That , may learn activity increase result move new location . They may benefit lose weight lower blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project attempt answer three question employee Magnuson Clinical Center . It design study effect move CRC amount activity individual performs daily term unit measure waist mount pedometer ( horizontal vertical step ) . The hypothesis : 1 . There increase amount activity CRC compare CC ( horizontal distance travel , up/down activity include stair chair ) . 2 . There increase walk velocity move CRC . This implies increase level aerobic capacity . There increase musculoskeletal symptom , especially low extremity low back move CRC . This imply overuse low extremity increase activity .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any CC employee ambulatory , whose move date allow 10 day CC prior move , wish participate study whose work requirement include sufficient amount walk primarily confine one office module . 1. inability wear pedometer ; record pedometer data 2. musculoskeletal impairment significantly limit ambulation , e.g . recent fracture , tendinitis</criteria>
