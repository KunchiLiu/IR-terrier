	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy SB-715992 , term response rate , patient previously untreated metastatic recurrent malignant melanoma . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . - Determine early progression rate response duration patient treat drug . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Correlate pharmacokinetics safety efficacy endpoint drug patient . - Correlate β-tubulin kinesin spindle protein expression tumor tissue clinical outcome patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient follow 4 week completion protocol therapy . Patients ongoing complete response , partial response , stable disease follow every 3 month thereafter relapse . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-25 patient accrue study within 12-14 month .</detailed_description>
