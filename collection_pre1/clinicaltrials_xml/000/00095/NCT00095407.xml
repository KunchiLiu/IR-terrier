	<brief_summary>This study identify region brain involve personality trait knowledge-that , person know aspects personality `` generous , '' `` honest , '' others . It also examine brain area relate person 's knowledge likeable personality trait , familiar trait , degree associate trait one 's self . There previous study , modern image technique , location brain concept personality trait . Patients age 21 65 good health , right hand , native speaker English may eligible study . Pregnant woman eligible . There 200 participant involve pencil-and-paper computer task . Also , three functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) experiment 32 participant . Patients may participate three fMRI experiment . Patients recruit NIH 's Normal Control Database . They would need neuroexamination conduct NIH doctor within last year . Patients interview medical , neurological , psychological condition would make difficult read fMRI result . Depending study patient take part , different questionnaire complete . They may also perform computerized test measure word association . These test take 1 2 hour . The technique MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During initial MRI scan , patient lie still table slide enclose tunnel scanner . They scanner long 2 hour . During procedure , may ask lie still possible 1 hour time . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask move machine time . Then functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan involve take picture brain patient perform task . All task explain , patient chance practice enter scanner . For activity , patient ask make decision see task present . They decide `` yes '' `` '' pressing leave right button . This scan take 1 hour . Afterward , patient may ask fill write questionnaire perform reaction time task use computer . This study direct benefit participant . However , hop information gain enhance researcher ' understand area brain necessary perform certain task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Functional Anatomy Personality Trait Knowledge : An fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective . The purpose protocol identify brain region involve personality trait knowledge , associate affective valence person-trait association . We propose use parametric event-related fMRI addition classical reaction time measure , answer question whether specialized neural system involve semantic processing personality trait concept . We apply method use previous investigation identify category-specific semantic ( mean ) system live non-living object . Study Population . Healthy , normal adult , right-handed volunteer study functional neuroimaging behavioral pre-tests . Design . Behavioral pre-tests ( N=200 subject ) use obtain psycholinguistic stimulus parameter use fMRI experiment . Three parametric event-related functional MRI experiment ( total 104 subject ) use personality trait concept word main input stimuli conduct . Outcome Measures . The data collect consist questionnaire result , behavioral measure cognitive performance correspond fMRI image . The result gain protocol value advance neuroscience person perception social cognition .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , subject consist healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( Oldfield , 1971 ) . Subjects range age 21 65 year old include regardless race gender . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude mention , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 21 old 65 exclude . A urine pregnancy test employ woman childbearing age 24 hour prior MRI . The result must negative order proceed MRI . Participants follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , e.g . metal shaving ; permanent eyeliner ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body . Participants take central nervous system active medication exclude .</criteria>
