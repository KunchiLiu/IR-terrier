	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well decitabine work treat patient myelofibrosis , cancer blood system associate fibrosis ( scar tissue ) bone marrow advance standard therapy . Decitabine may block action proteins responsible turn certain gene various cancer include myelofibrosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete partial response hematological improvement ) decitabine patient myelofibrosis . II . To determine safety decitabine patient myelofibrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect decitabine specific epigenetic change include methylation status specific target gene gene re-expression . II . To determine effect decitabine hemoglobin F level absolute number circulate cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ progenitor cell investigate potential utility marker surrogate biologic activity decitabine myeloid metaplasia myelofibrosis ( MMM ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive decitabine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
