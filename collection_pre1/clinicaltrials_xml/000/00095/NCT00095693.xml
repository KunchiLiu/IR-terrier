	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Metastatic , Locally Recurrent Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient locally advance , metastatic , locally recurrent differentiate thyroid cancer treat sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . II . Correlate thyroglobulin level tumor response patient treated drug . III . Correlate fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography result tumor response patient treated drug . IV . Correlate tumor permeability vascularity , determined dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI , tumor response patient treated drug . V. Determine pharmacodynamics drug patient . VI . Correlate presence type B-raf , N-ras , RET/PTC gene mutation clinical response patient treated drug . VII . Correlate degree Ras-MAPK signaling inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor expression clinical response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( papillary thyroid cancer chemo-na√Øve v others ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive 8 additional week therapy beyond CR . Patients follow within 2-4 week completion study treatment .</detailed_description>
