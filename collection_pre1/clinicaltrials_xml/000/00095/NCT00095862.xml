	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Interferon alfa may interfere growth tumor cell . Combining vaccine therapy cyclophosphamide interferon alfa may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy interferon alfa cyclophosphamide treat patient stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety , tolerability , feasibility vaccine therapy comprise allogeneic ( non-self ) tumor cell line transfected sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) gene combine low-dose interferon alfa low-dose cyclophosphamide patient stage IV breast cancer solid tumor . - Determine clinical response , time progression , survival patient treat regimen . - Correlate clinical response immunological response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV 2-3 day tumor vaccine . Patients receive tumor vaccine comprise HER2/neu-positive allogeneic ( non-self ) breast cancer cell transfected sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) gene intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Patients also receive low-dose interferon alfa ID approximately 48 96 hour tumor vaccine . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 vaccination monthly 3 vaccination absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 2 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 9-24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
