	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity SB-715992 recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck use objective response rate ( partial complete response ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration objective response , rate duration stable disease , progression-free , median overall survival rate SB-715992 recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . II . To document safety tolerability SB-715992 recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . III . To characterize population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter SB-715992 include assessment significant covariates SB-715992 PK assessment potential relationship pharmacokinetics SB-715992 relevant safety efficacy endpoint . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
