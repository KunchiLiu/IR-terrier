	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Cancer Other Salivary Gland Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity GW572016 recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma salivary gland use objective response rate ( partial complete response ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration objective response , rate duration stable disease , progression-free , median overall survival rate GW572016 recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma salivary gland . II . To estimate antitumor activity GW572016 epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) - and/or erbB2-overexpressing malignant tumor salivary gland use objective response rate ( partial complete response ) . III . To document safety tolerability GW572016 patient population TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate difference baseline level EGFR and/or erbB2 expression , receptor phosphorylation status tumor specimens predict outcome therapy . II . To investigate inhibitory effect GW572016 EGFR and/or erbB2 pathway activation tumor specimens correlate clinical outcome . III . To determine steady state level GW572016 achieve , correlation clinical laboratory correlative endpoint . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow survival</detailed_description>
