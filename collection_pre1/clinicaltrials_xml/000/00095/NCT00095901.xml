	<brief_title>Capecitabine Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Nasopharygeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient previously treat recurrent locoregional metastatic carcinoma nasopharynx treat capecitabine . Secondary - Determine median progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine median overall survival patient treated drug . - Correlate tissue thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) level response drug patient . - Correlate Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) status patient response drug . - Correlate survival EBV status patient treat drug . - Correlate TP level EBV status patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 39 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
