	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving capecitabine surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well capecitabine work treat patient undergone surgery locally recurrent persistenthead neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0225 Capecitabine Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Locally Recurrent Persistent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 2-year disease-free survival patient treat surgical salvage follow adjuvant low-dose capecitabine locally recurrent persistent squamous cell carcinoma head neck . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . - Determine 2-year overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine pattern disease relapse patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine daily 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 70 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
