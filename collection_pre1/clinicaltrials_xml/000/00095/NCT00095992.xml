	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , SB-715992 , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well SB-715992 work treat patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Recurrent , Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy SB-715992 , term response rate stable disease rate , patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine early progression rate response duration patient treat drug . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Correlate pharmacokinetics safety efficacy drug patient . - Correlate tumor expression β-tubulin kinesin spindle protein clinical outcome patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient follow 4 week . Patients ongoing stable respond disease follow every 3 month relapse . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 12-14 month .</detailed_description>
