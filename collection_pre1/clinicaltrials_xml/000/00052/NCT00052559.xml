	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose bevacizumab give together fluorouracil external-beam radiation therapy treat patient stage II stage III rectal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Fluorouracil , External-Beam Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) neutralize antibody , bevacizumab , administer concurrently 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) patient clinical stage T3 T4 rectal cancer prior surgery . II . To obtain preliminary data pathological response rate preoperative therapy . III . To obtain preliminary data regard progression free survival , local control , overall survival . IV . To obtain preliminary data change angiogenic profile rectal cancer induce therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study bevacizumab . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 ( course 1-4 ) . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-14 undergo external beam radiotherapy day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 7 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 20 additional patient treat MTD . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
