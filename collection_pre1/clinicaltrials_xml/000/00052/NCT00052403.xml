	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin patient advance solid tumor . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Determine potential anti-tumor activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin IV 30 minute weekly . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient treat dose level . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27-33 patient accrue study within 9-11 month .</detailed_description>
