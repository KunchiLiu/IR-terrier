	<brief_title>Bortezomib Plus Gemcitabine Carboplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility combine bortezomib gemcitabine carboplatin patient advanced recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose bortezomib administer combination gemcitabine carboplatin patient . III . Correlate result laboratory study patient tissue serum specimens potential predictor response patient treat regimen . IV . Determine , preliminarily , response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study bortezomib . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 , carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 , follow 1 hour later bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients clinical radiographic response may continue receive bortezomib beyond 6 course . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , least 10 additional patient chemotherapy-naive disease receive treatment MTD bortezomib . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
