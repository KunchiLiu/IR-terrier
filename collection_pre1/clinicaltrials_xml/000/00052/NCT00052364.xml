	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate progression free survival patient hepatocellular cancer treat oxaliplatin . II . To assess toxicity tolerance oxaliplatin patient hepatocellular cancer . III . To evaluate mRNA expression enzyme tumor patient enter study may important cytotoxicity oxaliplatin ( ERCC1 , mismatch repair , ribonucleotide reductase , bcl-2 , bax , p53 ) . An attempt make obtain tumor biopsy patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord presence fibrolamellar variant hepatocellular cancer ( yes v ) . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-32 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
