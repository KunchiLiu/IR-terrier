	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Treating Fatigue Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Who Are Not Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy epoetin alfa treat fatigue patient advance solid tumor receive chemotherapy . - Determine efficacy drug functional status overall quality life patient . - Correlate self-reported level energy commonly occur symptom ( e.g. , pain , depression , anxiety , dyspnea , appetite disturbance , sleep disturbance ) patient . - Correlate anemia common symptoms patient . - Determine internal consistency fatigue self-report use three single-item measure symptom responsiveness item change time patient . OUTLINE : This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2-3 ) , hemoglobin prior study ( 10 mg/dL less vs great than10 mg/dL ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 6 week . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo SC weekly 6 week . Patients either arm respond therapy may receive additional 6 week open-label epoetin alfa SC weekly . In arm , quality life fatigue assess baseline 3 6 week . If patient receive additional 6 week therapy , quality life fatigue also assess 9 12 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 128 patient ( 64 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
