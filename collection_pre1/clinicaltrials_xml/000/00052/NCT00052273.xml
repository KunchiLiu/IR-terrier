	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : LY317615 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes necessary cancer cell growth stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining LY317615 capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine LY317615 capecitabine treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LY317615 Plus Capecitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose LY317615 capecitabine patient advance solid tumor . - Determine safety profile regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . - Determine effect LY317615 potential angiogenic surrogate marker patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral LY317615 daily day 1-14 ( course 1 ) . Beginning course 2 , patient receive oral LY317615 daily day 1-21 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos LY317615 capecitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient treat recommended phase II dose . Patients follow 30 day last dose study drug . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
