	<brief_title>SGN-00101 Preventing Anal Cancer Patients With HIV Who Have Anal Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety maximum tolerate dose SGN-00101 HIV-positive patient high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial lesion . II . Determine clinical response histologic/cytologic regression patient treat drug . III . Determine immune response patient treated drug . IV . Determine effect drug HIV viral load CD4 level patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously week 0 , 4 , 8 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 5-6 patient receive escalate dos SGN-00101 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 1 , 4 , 10 month .</detailed_description>
