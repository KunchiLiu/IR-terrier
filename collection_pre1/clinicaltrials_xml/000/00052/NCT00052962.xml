	<brief_summary>This study determine two follow treatment regimen provide great benefit patient peritoneal carcinomatosis ( gastrointestinal cancer spread throughout abdomen ) : - Surgical removal tumor plus heated chemotherapy surgery , follow one dose chemotherapy 7 12 day surgery , follow 3 week later 4 month chemotherapy ; - Surgical removal tumor follow 4 month chemotherapy , start 1 month surgery . Patients 18 year age old peritoneal carcinomatosis may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test ; chest X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan ; review pathology slide ; electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , bone scan , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , need ; laparotomy . Laparatomy surgical procedure incision make abdomen look amount location tumor abdominal cavity . Patients whose surgery reveal tumor remove take study . Those eligible study tumor remove screen laparotomy part study procedure , follow : All participant undergo laparotomy removal much tumor possible , described . Patients randomly assign one two treatment group : - Group 1 - During laparotomy , tumor removal , patient receive continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( CHPP ) anti-cancer drug cisplatin . For CHPP , cisplatin solution heat delivered abdomen catheter ( plastic tube ) , wash abdomen 90 minute , drain body another catheter . At close surgery , small catheter , call Tenckhoff catheter , leave abdomen brought skin . Between day 7 12 surgery , one dose fluorouracil paclitaxel chemotherapy deliver catheter . The catheter remove follow complete recovery surgery patient discharge hospital . Four 6 week surgery , patient CT scan chest , pelvis , abdomen , begin intravenous ( IV , vein ) chemotherapy oxaliplatin , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin . The chemotherapy give 4-week course follow : oxaliplatin day 1 , infuse 2 hour vein arm neck ; leucovorin day 1 2 , infuse 2 hour , follow 5-fluorouracil 22 hour ; leucovorin 5-FU repeat two week later day 15 16 . This regimen repeat two week later . Between week chemotherapy week break . A course chemotherapy consist 28 day ( two week chemotherapy two 1-week break ) . Patients may receive four course ( total 16 week ) unless disease progress tolerate dos . Doses chemotherapy reduce side effect severe . - Group 2 - Patients follow procedure Group 1 laparotomy , CT imaging , IV chemotherapy oxaliplatin , 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin . They receive CHPP chemotherapy abdomen . All patient undergo repeat imaging test six week surgery conclusion intravenous ( IV ) chemotherapy . They return physical examination CT scan every three month first year , every four month next two year , every six month five year treatment . They also ask complete quality life questionnaires surgery , completion chemotherapy , every follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Debulking Chemotherapy With Without Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Treat Peritoneal Carcinomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients low-grade gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma peritoneal carcinomatosis undergo laparotomy tumor debulking . Patients randomized completion tumor debulking receive continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( HIPEC , formerly CHPP ) 250 mg/m^2 cisplatin intraperitoneal dwell 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m^2 paclitaxel 125 mg/m^2 postoperative day 7 12 . All patient receive systemic oxaliplatin , leucovorin infusional 5-FU , every week every four week start 4 6 week operation continue four cycle . The major endpoint time intraperitoneal tumor progression survival patient stratify base history previous treatment systemic chemotherapy ( yes vs. ) , history prior debulking surgery ; ability optimally vs. suboptimally debulk intraperitoneal tumor burden .</detailed_description>
