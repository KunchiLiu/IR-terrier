	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Bevacizumab may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Combining doxorubicin bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine doxorubicin bevacizumab treat patient locally recurrent metastatic soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate ( partial complete ) patient locally recurrent metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treat doxorubicin bevacizumab . - Determine tolerability regimen patient . - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine whether pre-treatment plasma vascular endothelial growth factor level microvessel density tumor sample patient predicts response regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive doxorubicin IV 5-10 minute follow bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease reach maximum dose doxorubicin may continue bevacizumab alone . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-37 patient accrue study within 13.3 month .</detailed_description>
