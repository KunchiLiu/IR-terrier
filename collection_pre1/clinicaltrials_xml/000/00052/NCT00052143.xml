Investigators hope study help answer important question HD , : 1 . ) What early sign HD start ? 2 . ) How accurate measure physician use detect onset HD ? 3 . ) What factor influence age person carry HD gene develop illness ? 4 . ) In group people risk HD , many develop sign illness minimum three-year period observation ? Participants study evaluate every 9 month ( 5 year ) use Unified Huntington 's Disease Rating Scale ( UHDRS ) -- clinical tool look movement , psychological behavioral function . The participant also ask complete survey mood , life event , attitude beliefs risk HD . A blood sample , take beginning study , confidentially test determine participant abnormal gene HD . Neither participant PHAROS physicians coordinator learn result individual gene test . The scientist hope study provide essential information future trial experimental drug HD .</detailed_description>
