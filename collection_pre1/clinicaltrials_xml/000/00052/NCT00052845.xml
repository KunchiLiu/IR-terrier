	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Estramustine may fight prostate cancer reduce production androgen . Exisulind may stop growth prostate cancer stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine estramustine exisulind docetaxel treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Estramustine , Exisulind Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine time objective biochemical progression response proportion ( objective post-therapy change PSA ) patient hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer treat docetaxel , estramustine , exisulind . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral estramustine 3 time daily day 1-5 , docetaxel IV 1 hour day 2 , oral exisulind twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
