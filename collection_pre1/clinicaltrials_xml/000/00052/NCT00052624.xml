	<brief_title>Immunotoxin Therapy Treating Children With Progressive Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme Anaplastic Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose intratumoral transferrin-CRM107 pediatric patient progressive recurrent glioblastoma multiforme anaplastic astrocytoma . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine efficacy drug patient . - Compare efficacy drug patient different histological type tumor , degrees transferrin receptor expression , serum antidiphtheria antibody titer level . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , open-label , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group age ( 5-9 v 10-18 ) . All patient undergo stereotactic radiosurgery tumor biopsy placement 2 intratumoral silastic infusion catheter pre-loaded transferrin-CRM107 ( Tf-CRM107 ) . - Group 1 ( age 5-9 ) : Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 3-7 day via catheter . Treatment repeat 6-10 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Three cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos Tf-CRM107 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . - Group 2 ( age 10-18 ) : Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 group 1 . Two cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos Tf-CRM107 MTD determine . The MTD group define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow monthly 6 month every 3 month 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
