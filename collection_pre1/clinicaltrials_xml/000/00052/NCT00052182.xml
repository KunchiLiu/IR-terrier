	<brief_summary>HIV-1-infected patient treat anti-HIV drug long time may weaken immune response HIV . The DNA-based vaccine study design boost immune system 's response many HIV-1 protein . The main purpose study test safety HIV vaccine ( EP HIV-1090 ) test whether vaccine stimulate immune system responses people HIV-1 infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune System Response HIV Vaccine ( EP HIV-1090 ) HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant data support hypothesis HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses contribute control potential clearance virus . Vaccines design specifically induce CTL response likely well suit treatment HIV infection . The conceptual basis EP HIV-1090 vaccine use highly define CTL epitope vaccine immunogen . The vaccine formulate water-soluble polymer stabilize protects DNA facilitates uptake cell . Preclinical study show vaccine induces strong CTL response animal model . This study evaluate safety tolerability vaccine immune response vaccine HIV-1-infected individual treat highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) CD4 count 350 cells/mm3 fully suppress viral replication stable HAART . Each patient receive total four immunization give Day 0 Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 . Participants randomly assign receive either vaccine placebo . Ten patient assign dose group ; eight receive active vaccine two receive placebo . The injection deliver intramuscularly deltoid muscle . In addition undergo standard safety exam , patient blood draw use evaluate immunogenicity vaccine . The treatment duration 16 week patient follow safety immune responses additional 24 week complete vaccination ; total study estimate take 18 month .</detailed_description>
