	<brief_summary>Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness bortezomib without gemcitabine treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bortezomib gemcitabine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Without Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare objective response rate previously untreated patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat bortezomib without gemcitabine . II . Compare toxicity regimens patient . III . Compare progression-free , 6-month , overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Compare change overall quality life ( QOL ) subcomponents QOL patient treatment 2 consecutive course regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1of 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Patients progressive disease crossover arm II . ARM II : Patients receive bortezomib arm I gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses arm repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life ( QOL ) assess baseline course 2 4 . Patients crossover arm II arm I complete QOL questionnaire first 2 course arm II therapy . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
