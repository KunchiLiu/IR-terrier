	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate ( complete partial ) patient mycosis fungoides treat interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) . II . Determine frequency refractory disease patient treat drug . III . Determine toxic effect drug patient . IV . Determine feasibility dose-limiting toxic effect ( DLT ) interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) administer IL-12 patient show disease progression 12 week IL-12 show disease progression 12 week IL-12 . V. Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend dose IL-2 administer IL-12 patient . VI . Determine immune cytokine response time patient treated regimen . VII . Determine frequency improve clinical response patient treat regimen . VIII . Determine biologic correlate response , include level interferon gamma production , natural killer cell activity , infiltration skin lesion CD8-positive cell , lymphocyte IL-12 receptor expression , signal transducer activator transcription protein level IL-12 signal transduction , induction apoptosis tumor cell skin patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Patients receive interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) twice weekly 24 week . Disease assess 13 week . Patients progressive disease also receive IL-2 SC 3 consecutive day week week 13-24 . Patients progressive disease week 13 receive IL-2 SC fix dose week 13-24 . Patients respond disease week 24 may continue receive IL-2 IL-12 another 12 week . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos IL-2 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . The recommend dose ( RD ) dose precede MTD . Additional patient treat RD . Patients follow 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-46 patient accrue study within 28 month .</detailed_description>
