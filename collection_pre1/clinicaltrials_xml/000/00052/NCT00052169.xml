	<brief_title>Therapy With Docetaxel ZD1839 Patients Who Have Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients advance breast cancer continue extremely poor prognosis average life expectancy approximately 2 year . Novel treatment design exploit biologic property tumor urgently require mean improve outcome large number patient relapse receive optimal chemotherapy treatment . Overexpresssion EGFR and/or TGF-alpha frequent human breast cancer correlate many case poor prognostic feature . Inhibition EGFR pathway propose potential therapeutic modality advance breast cancer . The antiproliferative activity ZD 1839 combination cytotoxic drug , docetaxel evaluate breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 MCF-10A ra coexpress EGFR TGF-alpha . Combination treatment demonstrate dose dependent supra-additive growth inhibition markedly enhance apoptotic cell death . Although taxanes bind microtubular network cell essential mitotic interphase cellular function , mechanism agent induce cell death entirely clear . Docetaxel also show dose-dependent anti-angiogenic activity . Thus , mechanism ( ) anti-tumor activity docetaxel remain unclear combination signal transduction pathway inhibition and/or anti-angiogenesis may provide potentiation concurrent ZD 1839 docetaxel therapy . This phase 2 trial design prospectively investigate efficacy safetey combination therapy ZD 1839 docetaxel patient metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
