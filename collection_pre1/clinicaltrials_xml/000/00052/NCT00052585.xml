	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine gefitinib fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan treating patient advance recurrent colorectal cancer . Biological therapy gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining gefitinib fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety gefitinib , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan patient advance recurrent colorectal cancer . II . Determine major side effect regimen patient . III . Determine response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Correlate response measure outcome epidermal growth factor receptor expression expression gene impact upon pathway fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , multi-center study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily begin day 1 , irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 15 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV 3-5 second follow 22-hour infusion day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
