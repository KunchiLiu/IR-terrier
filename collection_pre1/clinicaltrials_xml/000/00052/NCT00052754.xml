	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine therapeutic activity gefitinib , term progression-free rate , patient locally advance metastatic synovial sarcoma express HER1 . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine objective response , term time onset duration response , patient treat drug . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib twice daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-44 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
