	<brief_title>Gefitinib Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum tolerate dose ZD 1839 ( gefitinib ) give concurrently cranial radiotherapy . II . To determine ZD 1839 , give orally daily basis start time conventional radiation therapy ( RT ) , may improve overall survival adult newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme , compare historical control , stratify epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) status . III . To determine , multi-institutional setting , feasibility toxicity prescribe ZD 1839 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Whether ZD 1839 also improve progression-free survival patient . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study gefitinib follow phase II study . Patients receive gefitinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 7 week . Beginning 1 week initiation gefitinib , patient undergo radiation therapy QD 5 day week 6 week . Treatment gefitinib continue 18 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
