	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effectiveness low-dose v high-dose modafinil treatment fatigue neurobehavioral dysfunction patient primary brain tumor . - Determine safety drug patient . - Compare quality life patient treat 2 different dos drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , parallel-group study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Randomized phase : - Arm I : Patients receive oral high-dose modafinil twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral low-dose modafinil twice daily . In arm , treatment phase continue 3 week follow 1-week washout period . - Extended treatment phase : After 1-week washout period , patient receive oral low-dose modafinil daily day 1-3 . The dose titrate optimal level administer divided dos . Fatigue , neurobehavioral dysfunction , quality life assess randomized phase baseline day 7 21 extended treatment phase baseline day 28 56 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
