	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate , time progression , overall survival patient recurrent small cell lung cancer treat imatinib mesylate . II . Correlate presence c-Kit mutation tumor tissue treatment response patient treated drug . III . Correlate individual patient variation clinical ( toxicity and/or activity ) , pharmacologic ( pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter ) , and/or biologic ( correlative laboratory study result ) responses drug genetic difference proteins involved drug response ( transport , metabolism , and/or mechanism action ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord length prior therapy ( le 3 month v least 3 month ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily 28 day . Courses continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . *Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year registration . NOTE : *Patients develop CNS metastasis site disease progression receive therapeutic whole-brain radiotherapy resume study therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 41 patient stratum I accrue within 21 month 50 patient stratum II accrue within 25 month study .</detailed_description>
