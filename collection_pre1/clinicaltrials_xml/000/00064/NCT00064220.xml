	<brief_title>Soblidotin Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective tumor response rate patient advance metastatic soft tissue sarcoma prior exposure anthracycline-based chemotherapy treat soblidotin . - Determine duration response patient treated drug . - Determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - Determine median survival time 12-month survival rate patient treat drug . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive soblidotin IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
