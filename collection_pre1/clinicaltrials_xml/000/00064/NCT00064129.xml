	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give sargramostim treat patient metastatic prostate cancer . Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Colony-stimulating factor , sargramostim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help person 's immune system kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) ( ipilimumab ) administer sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . ( Phase I ) II . Determine safety regimen patient . ( Phase I ) III . Evaluate efficacy measure reduction PSA associate combine GM-CSF CTLA-4 blockade ipilimumab dosage 3 mg/kg give monthly x 6 dos ( d1 course 1-6 ) . ( Cohort Expansion ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine T-cell immunity T-cell response patient treat regimen . ( Phase I ) II . Determine pharmacokinetics MDX-010 patient . ( Phase I ) III . Determine prostate-specific antigen and/or objective response patient treat regimen . ( Phase I ) IV . Determine percentage activate , naive , memory T-cells . ( Cohort Expansion ) V. Determine measurement T-cell response describe epitope prostate antigen include PSA , PSMA , PAP . ( Cohort Expansion ) VI . Quantitate T-cell response antigens patient relevant HLA allele use HLA*0201 tetramers . ( Cohort Expansion ) VII . Evaluate toxicity regimen patient . ( Cohort Expansion ) VIII . Determine initial efficacy measure reduction PSA associate combine GM-CSF CTLA-4 blockade ipilimumab dosage 3 mg/kg give monthly x 6 dos ( d1 course 1-6 ) . ( Cohort Expansion ) IX . Determine objective response post-therapy measurable disease change use RECIST criterion . ( Cohort Expansion ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study ipilimumab . Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-6 course . GM-CSF continue beyond 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos ipilimumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Some patient undergo blood sample collection periodically laboratory pharmacokinetic study . Samples analyze human anti-human antibody , IgG antibodies ipilimumab semi-quantitative ELISA assay , plasma concentration ipilimumab via quantitative ELISA assay . Patients follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
