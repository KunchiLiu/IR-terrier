	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The collaborative research project address major problem genetic epidemiology , namely development strategy rationally identify select site combination sit genotype-phenotype study relevant predict understanding role gene physiological phenotype . Knowledge could advance specific general term . The project focus genetic architecture 62 gene either know hypothesized role cholesterol transport . The data conclusion generate project enrich understand extant genetic variation gene functional causative relationship variation phenotype measure variety organizational scale ( pathway , systemic clinical outcome ) . The additional focus environmental interaction term enhance understand specific gene x environment interaction cholesterol transport system . The project involve three collaborate grant : R01HL72810 Eric A. Boerwinkle University Texas School Public Health ; R01HL72905 Charles F. Sing University Michigan Ann Arbor ; R01HL72904 Andrew Clark Cornell University Ithaca , New York . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This Collaborative Research Project model DNA diversity Reverse Cholesterol Transport ( RCT ) explore genetic basis underlie pathway contribution atherosclerosis risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Given progress Human Genome Project development laboratory analytic resource , delineation gene 's complete genetic architecture contribution individual difference within population becomes ( theoretically ) feasible . This study explore variation 8 62 candidate gene screen use battery single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) . The eight gene ( 6-10 SNPs within ) chosen base upon association surrogate quantitative trait ( use cholesterol efflux assay ) . The gene exhaustively characterize analysis DNA sequence variation , linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) , haplotypes sample community-based CARDIA study . Genotype-phenotype relationship determine use analytic method take advantage population/evolutionary history , underlie complexity , innovative approach . Component 1 Collaborative Research Project Eric Boerwinkle generate large amount new data complex pattern variation substantial number gene . A major objective develop method analyze data find etiologically relevant aspect variation . For 62 candidate gene , initial responsibility Component 2 Andrew Clark analyze distribution single DNA site haplotype variation term population process responsible variation . The investigator develop systematic method identify subset sit fully capture haplotypic structure data thereby reduce dimensionality variation . These method apply haplotype genotype variation population-based sample 2007 African-Americans 2139 European-Americans CARDIA study . Single nucleotide polymorphism frequency spectrum , linkage disequilibrium block-wise structure haplotype quantify related expectation population genetic theory . Novel approach genotype-phenotype association pursue , close collaboration Component 3 , test fit neutral site frequency spectrum data stratify phenotypic measure .</detailed_description>
