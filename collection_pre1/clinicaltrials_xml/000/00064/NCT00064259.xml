	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy cisplatin fluorouracil use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen may increase effectiveness chemotherapy make tumor cell sensitive drug . This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose oblimersen give cisplatin fluorouracil see well work treat patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic cancer esophagus , gastroesophageal junction , stomach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Oblimersen Plus Cisplatin Fluorouracil Gastric &amp; Esophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The escalation portion study determine MTD G3139/Cisplatin help determine toxicity combination . II . Once MTD determine , additional 12 patient enrolled order obtain set tumor biopsy microarray analysis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The collection additional toxicity data combination OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter , dose-escalation study oblimersen . Phase I : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 , fluorouracil IV continuously day 4-8 , cisplatin IV day 4 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos oblimersen maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 12 patient treated MTD . Phase II : Patients receive treatment phase I oblimersen MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 37-97 patient ( 3-36 phase I 34-67 phase II ) accrue study within 15-18 month .</detailed_description>
