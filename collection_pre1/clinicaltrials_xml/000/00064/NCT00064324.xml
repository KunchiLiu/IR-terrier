	<brief_title>Perifosine Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 6-month progression-free rate patient treat perifosine advanced soft tissue sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate survival time progression . II . To evaluate objective tumor response status duration . III . To evaluate adverse event rate . IV . To evaluate pattern treatment failure . V. To evaluate pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive load dose oral perifosine every 6 hour total 4 dos day 1 daily day 2-28 course 1 . For subsequent course , patient receive oral perifosine daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-46 patient accrue study within 9-12 month .</detailed_description>
