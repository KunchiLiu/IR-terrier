	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over last three decade sustain marked decline death rate coronary heart disease ( CHD ) occur major demographic group US population . Recently , however , decline proceed less rapidly black white , woman men . These trend focus attention possible heterogeneity risk factor pattern among demographic sub-groups . As well recognize , knowledge CHD risk factor statistical model use predict personal risk CHD base study among white population . In epidemiological study sample black population , large variation effect specific factor note . Given small sample black investigation , however , low statistical power exist many black-white comparison . The fundamental obstacle progress area remain absence cohort sufficient size representative four major group . Hence , strong rationale exists undertake `` pool project '' clarify set important unanswered question cardiovascular disease epidemiology . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Person-level meta-analysis conduct pool 9 large United States epidemiologic study black white sample : First National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES I ) Epidemiological Follow-up Study , NHANES II Mortality Follow-up Study , Charleston Heart Study , Evans County Heart Study , Chicago Heart Association Detection Project Industry , Atherosclerosis Risk Communities Study ( ARIC ) , Follow-up Study screenees Multiple Risk Factors Intervention Trial ( MRFIT ) , Follow-up Study participant MRFIT , Follow-up Study participant Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program ( HDFP ) . Black-white comparison perform CHD incidence mortality , exposure-outcome relationship , pattern co-morbidity ( coexistence risk factor ) population attributable risk . Multivariate risk function also examine black white three context : ordering risk , magnitude relative risk , estimation absolute risk .</detailed_description>
