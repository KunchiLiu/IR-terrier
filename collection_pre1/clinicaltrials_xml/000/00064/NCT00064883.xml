	<brief_summary>This study : 1 ) provide standard non-experimental radiation therapy child form cancer similar disease process scientific interest , importance , educational value ; 2 ) determine effect radiation childhood cancer ; 3 ) allow education nurse , medical student , resident , clinical fellow , physician management care specialize group cancer patient . Patients study receive experimental therapy , give standard medical care . Patients eligible study include : 1 ) child cancer precancer syndrome , aplastic anemia myelodysplastic syndrome , 6 month 21 year age whose disease treat treated radiation therapy NCI 's Radiation Oncology Branch ( ROB ) ; 2 ) patient cancer precancer syndrome disease manifestation special interest ROB investigator ; 3 ) patient cancer precancer syndrome offer important educational benefit radiation oncology trainee staff . Participants undergo medical history , physical examination , blood test , radiation therapy . Before begin treatment , medical information pathology report , laboratory result , diagnosis treatment history , scan result , forth , obtain patient 's medical record . Additional procedure may need do include scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , lung function test , arteriogram , tumor biopsy . Participants ( simulation ) treatment plan session radiation therapy measurement take , CT image take , marking place body help determine treatment area . The radiation deliver body machine call linear accelerator , produce x-ray . Radiation therapy generally give twice day 5 day week . Each treatment take 10 minute . When course treatment complete , patient return Radiation Oncology clinic follow-up visit include blood test , physical examination , review symptom , . Visits keep minimum , continue prolonged period watch late effect treatment may occur period decade .</brief_summary>
