	<brief_title>Serum Sex Hormone Levels Subclinical Atherosclerosis - Ancillary MESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Throughout lifetime , men high risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) woman , however , menopause difference attenuate . This observation suggest endogenous sex hormone could associate CHD risk . There evidence indicate effect sex hormone CHD risk could mediate , part , alteration lipid level CHD risk factor . However , evidence support independent relationship circulate hormone level CHD risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study , ancillary MESA , examine association serum sex hormone concentration presence progression subclinical atherosclerosis 3,259 male 2,802 postmenopausal female participant Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . Subclinical atherosclerosis identify use coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) carotid intimal-medial wall thickness ( IMT ) . Progression identify change CAC 3.5 year . Circulating concentration total ( free ) testosterone ( T ) , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) store serum sample collect MESA baseline exam assess . Laboratory result merge exist demographic , anthropometric , lifestyle , CHD risk factor , subclinical disease data collect MESA . Cross-sectional prospective method statistical analysis use ass propose association . MESA particularly well suit disentangle effect hormonal factor CHD risk factor subclinical atherosclerosis availability high-quality data , serum sample , CAC IMT measurement large multi-ethnic population men woman .</detailed_description>
