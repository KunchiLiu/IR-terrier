	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy dexamethasone use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Lenalidomide may stop growth multiple myeloma stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether dexamethasone effective without lenalidomide treat multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study dexamethasone lenalidomide see well work compare dexamethasone alone treat patient previously untreated stage I , stage II , stage III multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0232 Dexamethasone With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare progression-free survival patient previously untreated stage I , II , III multiple myeloma treat dexamethasone without lenalidomide . - Compare overall response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare major response rate ( indicate great 75 % decrease M-protein ) patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival time best response patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity profile regimen , include thrombotic complication , patient . - Compare effect regimens gene expression proteomic analysis patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , crossover , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage International Staging System ( I vs II v III ) Zubrod performance status ( 0-1 v 2-3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I - Induction therapy : Patients receive oral dexamethasone ( DM ) day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 oral lenalidomide day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive oral DM day 1-4 15-18 oral lenalidomide day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II - Induction therapy : Patients receive DM arm I induction oral placebo day 1-28 . Treatment repeat arm I induction . Patients respond stable disease proceed maintenance therapy . Patients disease progression induction therapy cross receive unblinded treatment DM lenalidomide arm I induction . Patients respond stable disease unblinded induction therapy receive unblinded maintenance therapy DM lenalidomide arm I maintenance . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive oral DM arm I maintenance oral placebo day 1-21 . Courses repeat arm I maintenance . Patients disease progression maintenance therapy cross receive unblinded treatment DM lenalidomide arm I induction . Patients respond stable disease unblinded induction therapy proceed unblinded maintenance therapy DM lenalidomide arm I maintenance . Patients follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 500 patient ( 250 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
