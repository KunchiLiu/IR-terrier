	<brief_summary>The goal study develop advance cardiovascular diagnostic treatment method use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , test use strong magnetic field radio wave show anatomic detail . For scan , patient lie table cylinder contain magnetic field . He communicate staff member time procedure . Patients 18 year age old require 1 ) catheterization leg arteries diagnosis treatment block artery , 2 ) heart catheterization diagnosis treatment coronary artery disease heart problem may eligible study . Participants undergo one follow procedure : Blood Flow Measurement Using Standard Techniques MRI For patient blockage leg artery , blood flow measure successful catheter-based treatment ( angioplasty stenting ) use standard venous occlusion plethysmography new MRI technique . ( Patients whose treatment successful undergo follow-up blood flow measurement study . ) For venous occlusion plethysmography , large pressure cuff place around upper low leg . Thin elastic band call strain gauge place around calf measure blood blow leg . The pressure cuff inflate 5 minute , prevent blood flow leg , deflate , allow blood rush leg . A small cuff inflate low pressure , strain gauge measure maximum blood flow legs 1 2 minute . For new MRI technique , blood flow measure patient MRI scanner . Flow first measure patient rest . Then , large pressure cuff inflate 5 minute . The cuff deflate additional image take . Before cuff deflate , dye call gadolinium contrast injected arm vein brighten image . Patients may undergo six eight cuff inflation four six different day . Fusion X-Ray MRI Images Peripheral Arteries For patient blockage leg artery Participants undergo catheterization MRI leg . Special plastic bead tap leg ( ) help compare MRI x-ray picture . For catheterization procedure , x-rays blood vessel take guide placement catheter . Contrast dye inject brighten image blood vessel . These injection work well normal partly blocked artery , artery completely block . For study , patient first MRI scan leg . During scan , gadolinium contrast dye inject arm vein . Then , catheterization procedure , computer aligns MRI picture x-ray picture see combine image allow doctor well see place catheter . Fusion X-ray MRI Images Heart For patient undergoing heart catheterization undergo MRI heart catheterization . Special plastic bead tap chest help compare MRI x-ray picture . Patients first MRI scan heart . During scan , gadolinium contrast dye inject arm vein . Then , catheterization procedure , computer aligns MRI picture x-ray picture see combine image allow doctor learn pattern heart disease . Heart rhythm , blood pressure , heart function , breathe monitor MRIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular interventional procedure minimally-invasive , catheter-based treatment coronary artery angioplasty stenting . These procedure generally conduct awake patient complication , develop alternative conventional open surgery . Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedure conduct physician manipulate medical device inside patient guidance fluoroscopic x-ray . We develop minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedure use real-time magnetic resonance imaging , also know MR Fluoroscopy . These procedure advantage excellent image without surgery without radiation exposure toxic contrast agent ( dye ) . Moreover , MR Fluoroscopy produce excellent image soft tissue , blood , three-dimensional structure , may possible guide minimally-invasive procedure possible even invasive surgery . The goal protocol develop test incremental technical advance patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL ARMS OF THE PROTOCOL : Subjects know suspected cardiovascular disease eligible participation protocol . The subject eligible follow condition : Subject 's age great 18 year age . Expected undergo , undergone , clinicallyindicated diagnostic therapeutic catheterization procedure MRI angiogram procedure . Additional Inclusion Criteria Section # 4 : Magnetic Resonance Imaging Peripheral Arterial Atherosclerosis Known suspect peripheral artery occlusion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL ARMS OF THE PROTOCOL : Subjects absolute contraindication MRI scan exclude . These contraindication include subject follow device : Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator Central nervous system aneurysm clip Implanted neural stimulator Cochlear implant Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) Insulin pump Metal shrapnel bullet . When subject provide evidence implanted device label compatible MRI , exception exclusion make recorded note . Furthermore , FOLLOWING SUBJECT GROUPS WILL BE EXCLUDED administration MRI CONTRAST AGENTS : Pregnant woman ( Subjects uncertain whether pregnant require screening urine blood pregnancy test ) Lactating Women . Subjects hemoglobinopathies Subjects renal disease ( eGFR [ R ] le 30 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ) Glomerular filtration rate estimate use MDRD 2005 revise study formula : eGFR ( mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ) equal 175 x ( standardized Scr ) ( 1.154 ) x ( age ) ( 0.203 ) x 0.742 ( subject female ) x 1.212 ( subject black ) However , eGFR less 30 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) gadolinium contrast exposure think likely reduce overall risk medically necessary interventional procedure Specific Aim number 2 , inform consent concurrence attend physician , patient may enrol study . This would document medical record , IRB would notified . Additional Exclusion Criteria Section # 2 : Lower Extremity Perfusion Measures A patent autologous prosthetic bypass graft would require compression arterial occlusion induce reactive hyperemia . This exclusion intend avoid graft injury possible thrombosis . If old graft know nonfunctional , radiocontrast MRI angiography , exclusion apply . A patent intravascular stent territory would compress arterial occlusion induce reactive hyperemia . This exclusion intend avoid theoretical stent crush fracture . If stented vessel know completely occlude , radiocontrast MRI angiography , exclusion apply . However , occlusive cuff may place stent device avoid theoretical complication . Active deep vein thrombosis low extremity base clinical finding .</criteria>
