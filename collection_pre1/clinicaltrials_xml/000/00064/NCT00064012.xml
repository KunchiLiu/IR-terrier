	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy docetaxel use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes necessary cancer cell growth . It yet know whether bortezomib effective without docetaxel treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness bortezomib without docetaxel treat patient relapsed refractory stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Without Docetaxel Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare tumor response rate ( complete partial response ) patient relapse refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer treat bortezomib v without docetaxel . Secondary - Compare time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare overall 1-year survival patient treat regimen . - Compare safety tolerability regimens patient . - Compare pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 bortezomib IV arm I . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond confirmation CR . Quality life assess day 1 treatment course ( drug administration ) 30 day completion study treatment . Patients follow 30 day every 3 month survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 155 patient ( 75 arm I 80 arm II ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
