	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While cigarette smoke well-established potent risk factor atherosclerotic vascular disease , individual susceptibility smoking varies considerably , suggest modifier genomic variation . Several key enzyme involve activation detoxification mutagenic tobacco smoke compound , oxidative stress , DNA damage express tissue heart vasculature represent mechanistic pathway tobacco-induced pathology . Many enzyme common polymorphism ( great equal 10 % prevalence population ) know functional effect . Although restrict enzyme hamper shortcoming design , small number study suggest enzymatic activation detoxification tobacco smoke modifies risk certain cardiovascular outcome associate cigarette smoking . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The genetic epidemiology study evaluate common genetic polymorphism , combination exposure tobacco smoke , may modify risk atherosclerosis clinical sequela . An average six polymorphism , select basis prevalence functional significance , expression relevant tissue , evaluation previous study biologic plausibility , within 19 gene involve activation , detoxification , oxidative stress , DNA repair pathway evaluate ancillary study Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) study . In well-characterized , bi-ethnic cohort 15,792 men woman active follow-up since 1987-89 ( completeness follow-up 96 % ) , five endpoint quantify subclinical atherosclerosis validate clinical atherosclerotic event study case-cohort/case-control mode : incident coronary heart disease , carotid atherosclerosis , peripheral arterial disease , incident stroke , MRI-detected cerebral infarct . The study well design study DNA sequence polymorphism promote inhibit atherogenic effect smoke risk clinical event , contribute new knowledge role genetic variation response environmental insults toxicant . A case-cohort case-control approach take , use data Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) study . Approximately 20 polymorphism examine relation five cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) endpoint . The polymorphism examine classified variant either ) Phase I ( activation ) enzymes , b ) Phase II ( detoxification ) enzymes , c ) oxidative stress enzyme , ) DNA repair enzyme . The CVD endpoint include incident coronary heart disease ( CHD ) case ( n=1,101 ) , incident stroke case ( n=323 ) , prevalent peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) ( n=237 case ) , carotid atherosclerosis determine MRI ( n=504 case ) , cerebral infarct ( n=237cases ) . Controls consist 1,062 control select visit 1 , 237 visit-3 control cerebral infarct case . The statistical approach base proportional hazard regression incident CHD stroke endpoint , logistic regression CVD outcomes . Both additive multiplicative form interaction test .</detailed_description>
