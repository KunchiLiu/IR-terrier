	<detailed_description>Acquired disorder read ( acquire dyslexia ) common patient aphasia subsequent left hemisphere stroke . Even language function recover sufficiently enable patient return work , continue dyslexia often interfere significantly job performance . This study evaluate cognitive therapy treatment acquire dyslexia . Each therapy base upon cognitive neuropsychological model reading ; therapy target specific type read deficit stem question re-learning versus re-organization function . The therapy focus dyslexic disorder stem follow underlying deficit : 1 ) impair access orthographic word form visual modality ( pure alexia ) ; 2 ) impair orthographic/phonologic connection ( phonologic/deep dyslexia ) ; 3 ) decrease ability hold phonologic code memory ( phonologic text alexia ) . Participants study undergo comprehensive detail battery read reading-related test determine underlie impairment cause read deficit . Based upon result test , patient 's dyslexic disorder characterize , appropriate , patient assign one treatment program devise specifically type deficit . Treatment program evaluate efficacy compare accuracy speed read pre- post-treatment .</detailed_description>
