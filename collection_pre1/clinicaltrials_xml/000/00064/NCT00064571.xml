	<brief_summary>Unilateral vocal fold paralysis ( UVFP ) cause injury nerve affect vocal fold . The injury vocal fold make affect person 's voice sound `` breathy '' . Voice therapy usually try first , , unsuccessful , surgical treatment consider . The standard surgical treatment call vocal fold medialization aim bring injured cord midline . An alternative surgical treatment , vocal fold reinnervation , aim bring new nerve supply injured vocal fold . The reinnervation operation , potential advantage medialization operation also require several month final result gain . The goal multicenter , randomize clinical trial see two surgical treatment produce good outcome . In order participate study patient UVFP must meet entry criterion must release voice therapy speech-language pathologist . Information collect study ( pre-surgery , 6 12 month surgery ) include voice recording , movie make vocal fold function , airflow pressure measurement voicebox , outcomes questionnaire .</brief_summary>

Patients UVFP may significant impairment vocal fold function , include breathy paralytic dysphonia . There several available approach treatment condition . Vocal fold medialization currently use otolaryngologists probably standard care treat UVFP . An alternative approach laryngeal reinnervation , number potential advantage medialization require several month final result achieve . The primary goal multicenter , randomize clinical trial determine approach produce good outcome . Patients UVFP meeting inclusion criterion release therapy speech-language pathologist randomize either medialization arm reinnervation arm . The data collection protocol consist voice recording , aerodynamic measurement , electroglottography , videostroboscopy , clinical outcome questionnaire collect pre-treatment 6 12 month post-treatment .</detailed_description>
