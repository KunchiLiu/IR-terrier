	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine compare change blood flow blood volume brain normal volunteer patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Patients MS-an inflammatory disease attack brain spine-may new blood vessel formation ( call angiogenesis ) within brain may may contribute disease help repair brain . It know new vessel behave way naturally occur vessel . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave generate brain image provide information brain chemistry , function , blood flow . The result study may lead good understand MS . Healthy normal volunteer patient multiple sclerosis 18 year age old may eligible study . Normal volunteer must history sign symptoms central nervous system disease . Patients MS recruit NIH Neuroimmunology MS clinic . All participant undergo MRI . For procedure , subject lie still table slide narrow metal cylinder ( MRI scanner ) . Scanning varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . During scan , subject wear earplugs muffle loud knocking noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit . The subject communicate MRI staff time procedure . During scan , subject wear mask breathes room air air contain 6 % carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . ( Room air contain approximately 0.04 % CO2 , 150 time less 6 % CO2 . Air normally breathe contains 5 % CO2 . ) Breathing 6 % CO2 increase amount blood flow brain measure use MRI . The total duration single 6 percent CO2 inhalation exceed 10 minute . A catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place vein subject 's arm enters scanner . At point scan , contrast agent call gadolinium DTPA inject vein catheter . This agent enable clear image brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MR Perfusion Imaging Hypercapnia ( Increased Carbon Dioxide ) Study New Blood Vessel Formation Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances MR perfusion image provide clinical researcher opportunity quantify regional cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . Recently , new vessel proliferation formation ( angiogenesis ) observe autopsy biopsy specimens patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Newly form MS lesion , show strikingly increase number new vessel similar pattern observe around old lesion , area remyelination ( new myelin formation axon , shadow plaque ) normal-appearing brain tissue . The purpose study compare CBF MS patient , age- gender-matched healthy control . CBF measure subject inhale room air increase CBF inhaling mixture room air know concentration carbon dioxide ( hypercapnia ) compare . If significant new vessel growth occur brain MS patient new vessel formation ( neovascularization ) may reflect change CBF . Comparing CBF response hypercapnia determine newly form vasculature include properly functioning blood vessel . Normal cerebral blood vessel exquisitely sensitive carbon dioxide arterial blood increase carbon dioxide cause CBF increase dilatation relaxation muscle surround blood vessel . In future , change hypercapnia-induced CBF response MS patient control may help monitor treatment disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ( NORMAL VOLUNTEERS ) Any healthy volunteer age 18 capable give informed consent recruit self refer NIH Volunteer office eligible study . All healthy normal volunteer require fill questionnaire Appendix B . Normal volunteer include long record document sign symptom CNS disease , contraindication MRI 'normal ageappropriate ' MRI brain . Only patient see Neuroimmunology MS clinic confirm diagnosis Multiple Sclerosis base upon previous history two clinical neurological attack separate time spatial location combination Clinical MRI finding single enhance lesion brain spine along multiple T2 hyperintensities juxtacortical , periventricular infratentorial white matter accord McDonald criterion include study . Relapsingremitting secondary progressive MS one relapse within 18 month precede study enrollment recruit MS 7th floor clinic NINDS NIH . MS patient EDSS score 1.0 6.5 , inclusive . Give write informed consent prior test protocol , include screening/pretreatment test evaluation consider part patient 's routine care . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Controls MS patient exclude contraindication MR scanning , follow : 1. pacemaker 2. brain stimulators 3. dental implant 4. aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) 5. metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , 6. permanent eyeliner 7. implanted delivery pump 8. shrapnel fragment 9 . Welders metal worker also risk injury possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . You screen condition prior study , condition , receive MRI scan . If question metal object present body , inform physician . Healthy control MS patient exclude study follow : 1 . History panic disorder 2 . History migraine ( possible complication CO2 inhalation ) . 3 . Subjects history reaction MR contrast agent specifically gadopentetate dimeglumine exclude participate contrast agent administration part protocol . 4 . Subjects also exclude study presently take indomethacin acetazolamide effect carbonic anhydrase system endothelial cell brain make unresponsive CO2 inhalation . 5 . Subjects exclude previous history panic attack . 6 . Healthy control MS patient exclude history alcohol drug abuse . 7 . Healthy control MS patient exclude concurrent , clinically significant ( determined investigator ) cardiac , immunologic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal , and/or major disease . 8 . Healthy control excluded previous know abnormality brain MRI examination 9 . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study . MS patient also exclude study entry follow exclusion criterion exist time enrollment : 1 ) Diagnosis primary progressive MS , define gradual progression disability onset without relapse .</criteria>
