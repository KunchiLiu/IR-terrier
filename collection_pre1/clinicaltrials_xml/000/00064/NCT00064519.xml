	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) lead cause death Western world . Numerous epidemiological study demonstrate impact various risk factor , arterial hypertension , hypercholesterolemia diabetes mellitus . While risk factor partly genetic control , positive family history remain additional independent predictor CAD , suggest presence yet unidentified susceptibility locus . Given enormous public health burden CAD , significant interest identify specific genetic foundation . As intensive experimental investigation continue , inflammatory component disease process lead atherosclerosis evolves key aspect disease process . Recent evidence demonstrate systemic marker inflammation C reactive protein ( CRP ) predict high risk coronary event . CRP emerge much attention diagnostic marker therapeutic target serum level determine significant extent genetic factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To elucidate genetic basis inflammatory component myocardial infarction regulation C reactive protein , gene function orient evaluation candidate gene conduct . Therefore specific aim follow , 1 . Identify positional candidate gene within region identify MI CRP functionally related inflammation inflammatory process . Sequence variation select candidate gene identify . 2 . Evaluate effect variant regard MI CRP two different ethnic population : family set European Caucasians population-based , Hispanic family dataset . The role CRP evaluate predictor cardiovascular event study population . Since clinical follow data available study population , extent CRP contribute increase risk cardiovascular event analyze .</detailed_description>
