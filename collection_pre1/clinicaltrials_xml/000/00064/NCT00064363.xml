	<brief_title>Talampanel Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy talampanel , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent high-grade glioma . - Determine , preliminarily , toxic effect drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , quality life patient treated drug . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient receive enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord type glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma v glioblastoma multiforme ) . Patients stratum assign 1 3 treatment group accord concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug use ( yes , , valproic acid ) . Patients group receive different dos oral talampanel 3 time daily day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 week first course , every 6 week subsequent course , within 2 week study completion . Patients follow within 2 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 91 patient ( 50 anaplastic astrocytoma 41 glioblastoma multiforme ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
