	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , number one cause death industrialized country today complex disease multifactorial etiology involve many genetic environmental factor . Public health prevention program design reduce risk occurrence CVD commonly focus modifiable environment behavior diet physical activity , varied result among individual . This heterogeneity response CVD intervention least part genetic origin . Although number candidate gene identify appear influence development CVD , little know genetic effect may vary within demographic ( e.g. , race gender ) environmental ( e.g. , diet exercise ) context ; thus , utmost importance determine gene environment interact produce CVD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The purpose study characterize environment-dependent effect 87 biologic positional candidate gene population-based sample 11,625 African-American Caucasian men woman Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) study . Candidate locus select base confirmed functional significance , consistent association CVD risk factor , identify positional candidate genome-wide linkage scan . Environmental contexts focus dietary measure ( e.g. , total kcals , Keys score , alcohol intake ) , obesity , measure physical activity ( sport , leisure , work index ) , smoke , menopause status/hormone use ( woman ) . Outcome variable include measure quantitative risk factor ( e.g. , total cholesterol , BMI , blood pressure ) , subclinical disease ( carotid wall thickness ) , clinical disease ( incident coronary heart disease ( CHD ) stroke ) . Existing DNA sample use genotyping candidate locus , contact study participant necessary . The ARIC cohort , large size wealth environmental physiological measure , provide ideal , timely , efficient opportunity evaluate effect modifiable environment genetic variation may influence CVD risk disease outcomes ultimate goal establish efficacious program treatment prevention CVD .</detailed_description>
