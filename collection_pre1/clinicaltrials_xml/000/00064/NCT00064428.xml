	<brief_title>OASIS-6 : The Safety Efficacy Fondaparinux Versus Control Therapy Patients With ST Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind , control , parallel group , multi-center , multinational study fondaparinux vs. control patient STEMI randomize within 24 hour onset symptom . Patients confirm STEMI assign one follow stratum , base local preference : Stratum 1 : No indication UFH ; generally accept patient receive streptokinase receive thrombolytic agent assign stratum . Stratum 2 : Indication UFH ; generally accept patient receive fibrin-specific agent ( alteplase , reteplase tenecteplase ) undergo primary PCI assign stratum . Patients ineligible fibrinolysis ( e.g . late presentation absolute contra-indication reperfusion therapy ) may fall either stratum 1 stratum 2 investigator 's discretion . Following allocation one stratum , patient randomize fondaparinux control treatment . Control treatment dependent whether patient assign stratum 1 stratum 2 : Stratum 1 : fondaparinux sc* versus fondaparinux-placebo sc 8 day hospital discharge , whichever early . Stratum 2 : fondaparinux sc* 8 day hospital discharge , whichever early UFH-placebo 24 48 hr ( single bolus injection immediately prior procedure case primary PCI ) versus UFH 24 48 hr ( single bolus injection immediately prior procedure case primary PCI ) fondaparinux-placebo 8 day hospital discharge , whichever early . ( *First dose intravenous bolus ) Patients follow 6 month</detailed_description>
