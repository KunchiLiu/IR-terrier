	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prevalence severity essential hypertension ( EH ) great among Black Americans ethnic group U.S . Blacks increase risk target organ damage elevate blood pressure , include heart disease , stroke , endstage renal failure . There significant ethnic difference cardiovascular reactivity ( CVR ) stress , risk factor elevate blood pressure . Studies show CVR stress stable time , heritable , predictive future elevation blood pressure development essential hypertension . These property make measure CVR valuable intermediate genetic study hypertensive risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The genetic epidemiology study test hypothesis individual difference CVR acute stress Black youth associate well define polymorphisms candidate gene relate blood pressure include : 1 ) alpha- beta-adrenergic receptor gene ; 2 ) gene involve catecholamine metabolism ; 3 ) gene involve endocrine function ; 4 ) gene involve renin angiotensin system . By focus normotensive youth risk develop essential hypertension , investigator hope identify gene associate onset , rather sequela , hypertension . Moreover , give CVR acute stress define change cardiovascular function evoke environmental manipulation stress , research inherently study gene-environment interaction . A total 500 unrelated Black adolescent young adult ( equal number male female ) , 15-21 year age study . Buccal cell sample collect DNA extraction subject genetic association analysis . Impedance cardiography blood pressure monitoring use assess component CVR stress video game , mental arithmetic , cold pressor , whole body cold exposure task , utilized develop laboratory . Various method use evaluate genetic association CVR acute stress , include analysis single nucleotide polymorphisms haplotype . Supplementary analysis evaluate potential gene-gene interaction additional gene-environment interaction involve chronic environmental stress .</detailed_description>
