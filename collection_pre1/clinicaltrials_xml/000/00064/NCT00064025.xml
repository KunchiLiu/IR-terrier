	<brief_title>Medroxyprogesterone Treating Patients With Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma Uterine Corpus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare efficacy medroxyprogesterone , term induction histologic response , patient progesterone receptor-positive v progesterone receptor-negative endometrioid adenocarcinoma uterine corpus . II . Determine early late change gene expression 72 hour 21 day patient treated drug . III . Examine mechanisms surround dynamic change endometrial tumor cell determine possible correlation among histologic response , steroid receptor status , immunohistochemical measure growth apoptosis , gene expression profile patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive medroxyprogesterone intramuscularly approximately 3 week surgical hysterectomy . A subset 15 patient tissue collect pipelle biopsy curettage baseline , 72 hour medroxyprogesterone therapy , surgery gene expression array . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
