	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Preventing Cancer Patients With Premalignant Carcinoma Oral Cavity Pharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine acute toxic effect Ad5CMV-p53 gene administer oral rinse intramucosal injection patient diffuse premalignant carcinoma oral cavity oral pharynx . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . III . Determine topical transduction efficiency adenoviral-mediated wild type p53 gene transfer patient treated drug . IV . Determine efficacy drug reverse histology oral premalignancies patient . V. Determine distribution transgenic protein within area premalignant lesion patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study Ad5CMV-p53 gene administer oral rinse . Phase I : Patients receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene intramucosal injection area lesion follow least 2 hour later Ad5CMV-p53 gene oral rinse day 1 . Patients receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene oral rinse twice daily day 2-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos Ad5CMV-p53 gene oral rinse maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : Patients receive treatment intramucosal Ad5CMV-p53 gene phase I Ad5CMV-p53 gene oral rinse MTD . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 3 year . Patients receive long-term follow-up annually additional 10 year .</detailed_description>
