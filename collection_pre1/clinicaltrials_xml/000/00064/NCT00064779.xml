	<brief_summary>The experimental anti-cancer drug IL13-PE38QQR , develop treatment malignant brain tumor , compose part two protein : immune system cytokine IL13 toxin bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The IL13 part drug bind another protein , IL13 receptor , receptor display outside surface cell . Cells drug bound IL13 receptor take drug , toxin part drug kill cell . Since brain tumor cell display IL13 receptor , potential target may kill drug . This pilot study visualize distribution IL13-PE38QQR infuse around brain tumor tissue surgical removal tumor adult patient recurrent malignant glioma . Stored tumor tissue test presence receptor protein , require study entry . Eligible patient undergo biopsy confirm diagnosis recurrent malignant glioma . IL13-PE38QQR infuse 96 hour around tumor tissue catheter place surgically . For first 48 hour drug mixed radioactive tracer , distribution drug follow type scanning call SPECT . Surgery remove tumor perform approximately 15 day end infusion . Catheters place surgically , IL13-PE38QQR infuse second time 96 hour . Radioactive tracer include infusion first 48 hour . For infusion , SPECT scan take 6 , 24 , 48 hour start infusion . MRI scan take within 90 minute 24 48 hour SPECT scan . Patients follow closely scans laboratory test completion study approximately 58 day completion second infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess distribution IL13-PE38QQR follow continuous infusion via catheter ( ) recurrent malignant glioma prior surgical resection continuous infusion via catheter ( ) brain tissue adjacent tumor resection site surgical resection . 123I-HSA tracer use surrogate study drug distribution . - Determine toxicity associate administration IL13-PE38QQR describe . - Assess effect distribution IL13-PE38QQR varying catheter type ( 3 ) flow rate per catheter , keep total flow rate constant , pre- post-resection infusion . OUTLINE : This pilot study assess distribution IL13-PE38QQR deliver intratumoral infusion prior surgical resection interstitial infusion tissue surround resection site ( peritumoral ) surgical resection . Prior resection , catheter place region solid contrast-enhancing tumor component . The volume infusion , duration infusion , concentration IL13-PE38QQR infusate fix . For post-resection infusion , catheter place peritumorally area great risk residual infiltrating tumor . The post-resection volume infusion , duration infusion , concentration IL13-PE38QQR infusate fix . For first 48 hour infusion , IL13-PE38QQR prepare 123I-HSA tracer surrogate distribution study drug . The type number catheter utilized deliver pre- post-surgery infusion vary . To maintain fixed total volume infusate 96 hour , rate infusion vary depend upon number catheter utilize . Up three different catheter type test . However , , single type catheter utilized pre- post-resection infusion give patient . To allow assessment distribution infuse material , first 48 hour pre- post-resection infusion utilize 123I-HSA infusate . For last 48 hour infusion , 123I-HSA replace non-labeled HSA . The distribution 123I-HSA tracer measure Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) scan . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 18 patient enrol single site .</detailed_description>
