	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand role motor part brain recovery motor function stroke . The motor deficit follow stroke compensate several month . It propose ipsilateral motor cortex mediate recovery process . The result study provide fundamental information role ipsilateral M1 recovery motor function chronic stroke . A general patient evaluation determine location lesion site assess degree impairment motor global cognitive functioning . An assessment motor function also perform . Patients divide two group : well poorly recover . An MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan may also do one perform past 6 month . Two main procedure perform : transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) test motor performance . In first procedure , metal coil surround plastic mold place head electrical current pulse . The electrical muscle activity record electrode computer . The second procedure involve reaction time test . The task consist react visual stimulus perform voluntary movement . TMS pulse give movement . This do determine whether type stimulation interfere reaction time , would indicate interferes brain center execute reaction visual Go-signal . Patients single ischemic hemispheric lesion least 12 month stroke initially severe paralysis arm recruit study . Healthy normal volunteer also include study . A special effort make increase participation woman diverse racial group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It propose recovery motor function paretic arm follow stroke mediate ipsilateral ( intact ) motor cortex ( M1 ) . This proposal conclusively test experimentally represent important question stroke rehabilitation . In protocol , study behavioral consequence transient inactivation ipsilateral M1 motor performance affect arm chronic stroke patient complete incomplete motor recovery . The result study provide fundamental information role ipsilateral M1 recovery motor function chronic stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients single ischemic hemispheric lesion least 12 month stroke severe paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) affect arm initially . An anatomical MRI scan acquire NIH recent one ( within 6 month ) available . Normal volunteer willing able perform task include study . Healthy normal volunteer recruit study receive neurological physical exam ensure healthy condition . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one stroke . Patients bilateral motor impairment . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients subject unable perform task ( wrist elbow flexion least MRC grade 2 ) . Patients subject history severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 20 less ) . Patients subject severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Patients subject metal cranium except mouth . Patients subject dental brace , metal fragment occupational exposure surgical clip near brain . Patients subject eye , blood vessel , cochlear eye implant . Patients subject increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Patients cardiac neural pacemaker , intracardiac line and/or implant medication pump . Patients subject history loss consciousness epilepsy . Patients subject unstable cardiac dysrhythmia . Patients subject h/o hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system .</criteria>
