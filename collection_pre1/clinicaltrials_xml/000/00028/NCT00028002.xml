	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Adjuvant Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Primary Recurrent Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient primary recurrent potentially resectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor treat neoadjuvant adjuvant imatinib mesylate . II . Determine objective response rate patient treat drug . III . Determine safety drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily . Treatment continue 8 week absence disease progression . Patients disease progression consider immediate surgical resection . Otherwise , 8 week , patient undergo surgical resection debulk gross tumor . Two four week surgery , patient receive oral imatinib mesylate daily 2 year . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
