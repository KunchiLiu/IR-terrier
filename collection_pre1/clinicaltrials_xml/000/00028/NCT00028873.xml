	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Some tumor become resistant chemotherapy drug . Combining R101933 paclitaxel docetaxel may reduce resistance drug allow tumor cell kill . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine R101933 either paclitaxel docetaxel treat patient metastatic breast cancer respond previous chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R101933 Combined With Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine activity R101933 combination paclitaxel docetaxel term response treatment level clinical benefit patient taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine acute side effect patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive R101933 IV 1 hour immediately follow paclitaxel IV 3 hour docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression 7 course may continue treatment investigator 's discretion . Patients follow every 6 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
