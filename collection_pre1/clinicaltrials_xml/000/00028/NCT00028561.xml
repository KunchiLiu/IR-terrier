	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Plus Carboplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose BMS-247550 give combination carboplatin patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . Determine dose-limiting toxicity safety regimen patient . III . Determine plasma pharmacokinetics regimen patient . IV . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . V. Correlate protein expression survivin expression apoptotic regulator , apoptotic index , response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study BMS-247550 . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 follow carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course achieve CR total 6 course . The first two cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-247550 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) .The third fourth cohort 10 patient receive escalate dos BMS-247550 MTD determine . The MTD define dose precede least 3 10 patient experience DLT . Once MTD determine third fourth cohort , 15 additional patient treat MTD . Patients follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
