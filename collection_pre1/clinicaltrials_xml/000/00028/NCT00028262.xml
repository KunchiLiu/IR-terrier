	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness drug call Cystagon treat infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( INCL ) , progressive neurological disease affect child . At around 11 13 month age , patient develop slow head growth , mild brain atrophy ( waste ) , electroencephalographic ( EEG ) change retinal deterioration , symptom worsen time . The disease result enzyme deficiency cause fatty compound call ceroid accumulate cell . In laboratory experiment , Cystagon help remove ceroid cell patient INCL . Children INCL 6 month 3 year age may eligible study . Participants take Cystagon daily mouth every 6 hour . They admit NIH Clinical Center 4- 5-day period every 6 month follow test evaluation : - Review medical history , include detailed record seizure , physical examination , blood test clinical photograph . For initial baseline study , examination may also schedule pediatric neurology , ophthalmology anesthesia service . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain MRI use powerful magnet , radio wave , computer provide detailed image brain without use X-rays . The patient lie table slide inside donut-shaped machine contain magnetic field . The child require general anesthesia procedure . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) measure function retina , light-sensitive tissue back eye . To record flash ERG , special contact lens place eye surface eye stimulate flash light . Infants young child require general anesthesia procedure . - Visual evoked potential ( VEP ) measure function visual pathway eye brain . To record VEP , five electrode place scalp eye stimulate flash light . Infants young child must anesthetize procedure . - Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) measure brain electrical activity , use electrode place scalp . The test useful defining seizure . The child may need sedated keep still test . - Skin biopsy A small piece skin remove ( usually upper arm shoulder ) local anesthetic grow cell laboratory . This procedure do start study repeat 1 year therapy result promise . Children condition may improve , stabilize worsen study . Life may prolong without significant improvement quality . The information gain study may help scientist develop potent drug treat INCL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystagon Treat Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ( NCLs ) , commonly know Batten disease , represent group common ( 1 12,500 ) heritable neurodegenerative storage disorder childhood . Mutations least 8 different gene responsible various form NCL . The infantile form NCL INCL severe disease . It cause mutation palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 ( PPT1 ) gene . PPT1 lysosomal enzyme cleaves thioester linkage S-acylated protein deficiency lead abnormal lysosomal accumulation fattyacylated- protein ( ceroids ) lead INCL pathogenesis . Since thioester linkage labile , drug nucleophilic property likely mimic PPT1 may therapeutic potential INCL . We previously report cysteamine , phosphocysteamine , cysteamine bitartrate ( cystagon ) N-acetylcysteine disrupt thioester linkage model PPT1-substrate , C ( 14 ) palmitoyl-CoA , release C ( 14 ) palmitic acid . The result laboratory study show cysteamine mediates depletion intracellular ceroid deposit prevents reaccumulation . For last 9 year , conduct clinical trial determine whether combination Cystagon ( Cysteamine bitartrate ) N-acetylcysteine ( mucomyst ) beneficial INCL patient . In parallel study , use animal model INCL find combination therapy reduce oxidative stress cause high level reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) brain mouse lack PPT1 enzyme . To date , admit total 10 patient ( 5 female 5 male ) protocol ; however , one male patient lose follow-up . Thus , treat 9 patient ( 5 female 4 male ) patient show adverse reaction drug except one patient initially mild gastrointestinal discomfort go away cystagon stop restart low dose mild adverse effect recur . Compared publish natural history INCL , preliminary result show although several parameter disease progression slow due treatment completely arrest neurodegenerative process . We currently analyze data gather far manuscript describe result prepared submission peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Only patient 6 month 3 year age admit study . Parents caregiver patient recruit study provide copy protocol consent form review prior come NIH . They encourage call either Dr. Levin Dr. Mukherjee discuss question may concern protocol prior enrollment study . The propose age range ( 6 mo 3 yr ) choose child expect mild moderate neurological deficiency well enough care home family . Therefore , patient require extensive medical nursing care stay Clinical Center . Moreover , patient locally cared neurologist pediatrician regular basis , care continue patient return home . The rigid age exclusion criterion use majority INCL patient frequent seizure , complete retinal blindness significant cerebral atrophy beyond 3 year age . Dr. Santavuori ( one consultant decease ) , extensive experience patient , believe neurological degeneration age 2 might reversible . While Dr. Santavuori speculation well take , feel since date effective treatment slow progression neuronal death INCL , since preliminary result show Cystagon slow progression neurodegeneration , feel combination Cystagon plus NAc antiapoptotic neuroprotective effect may show added benefit Cystagon therapy alone . In initial protocol restrict admission patient carry two lethal mutation PPT1 gene . The purpose include patient carry specific PPT1 mutation ( L10X , R151X , R164X , W296X , R122W , c.169insA E184K ) establish beneficial effect combination therapy patient two mutation manifest severe disease phenotype . Because uniform manifestation disease easy determine beneficial effect combination drug therapy . Subsequently , protocol approve treatment INCL patient two mutation PPT1 gene . Our protocol previously amend include INCL patient regardless PPT1 mutation carry . Patients intractable seizure control two few antiepileptic medication accept study . Patients take nourishment orally vegetative state enrol study even 6 month 3 year age criterion meet . Both male female patient eligible enrollment study .</criteria>
