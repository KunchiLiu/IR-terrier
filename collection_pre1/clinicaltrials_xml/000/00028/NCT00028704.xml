	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Breast-conserving treatment radiation therapy limit surgery less invasive mastectomy may improve quality life . It yet know breast-conserving treatment effective mastectomy follow radiation therapy treat locally advance breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness breast-conserving therapy mastectomy follow radiation therapy treat woman locally advance breast cancer previously treat chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast-Conserving Therapy Compared With Mastectomy Followed By Radiation Therapy Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival time loco-regional failure woman locally advance breast cancer treat breast-conserving local therapy v mastectomy follow radiotherapy receive prior induction chemotherapy . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , initial stage ( T0 , T1 , T2 , T3 , Tx v T4 ) , response prior induction chemotherapy ( complete response ( CR ) v ) , menopausal status ( premenopausal v postmenopausal ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo mastectomy follow radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive breast-conserving treatment comprise 1 3 follow therapeutic option : - Regimen A : Patients receive radiotherapy alone . - Regimen B : Patients partial response ( PR ) prior induction chemotherapy undergo limit surgery follow radiotherapy . Patients CR prior induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy alone . - Regimen C : Patients partial response ( PR ) CR prior induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy alone . Patients CR radiotherapy receive treatment . Patients PR radiotherapy undergo limit surgery . Quality life assess baseline , end therapy , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . Patients follow within 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,300 patient ( 650 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 5 year .</detailed_description>
