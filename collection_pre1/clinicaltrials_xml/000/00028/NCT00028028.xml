	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study progression-free survival patient receive low high dose CCI-779 , cytostatic agent follow cytoreductive chemotherapy extensive SCLC . II . To determine toxicity two treatment regimen involve low high dose CCI-779 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify effect CCI-779 treatment p70S6 phosphorylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient small cell lung cancer treat CCI-779 . II . To measure effect mTOR activation signal plasma patient treat CCI-779 . III . To determine relationship CCI-779 dose pharmacodynamic parameter . IV . To correlate inhibition p70S6 index patient outcome . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord brain metastasis ( yes v ) , prior induction chemotherapy regimen ( platinum etoposide vs platinum irinotecan ) , response prior induction chemotherapy ( complete partial response v stable disease ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive low-dose CCI-779 IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive high-dose CCI-779 arm I . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
