	<brief_title>XK469 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose , dose-limiting toxicity , recommend phase II dose XK469 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , anti-tumor activity drug patient . - Determine drug metabolism , drug interaction potential , molecular cellular predictor efficacy toxicity , clinical confirmation molecular response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive XK469 IV 20 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos XK469 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 first 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 15 patient treat dose . Patients expand MTD cohort also receive oral NovaSoyÂ® soybean extract twice daily study duration . Patients follow every 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 25-40 patient accrue study within 12-15 month .</detailed_description>
