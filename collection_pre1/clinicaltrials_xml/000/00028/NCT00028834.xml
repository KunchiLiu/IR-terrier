	<brief_summary>This phase II trial see combine gemcitabine bevacizumab work treat patient advanced pancreatic cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate patient advance pancreatic cancer treat gemcitabine plus bevacizumab . II . To determine toxicity experienced patient advance pancreatic cancer treat gemcitabine plus bevacizumab . III . To determine median overall survival patient advance pancreatic cancer treat gemcitabine plus bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure plasma VEGF serum VCAM-1 level , , therapy predictor outcome . II . To collect store serum sample possible future assessment antiangiogenic inhibition marker . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
