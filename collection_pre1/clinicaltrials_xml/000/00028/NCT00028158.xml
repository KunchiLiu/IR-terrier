	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study safety effectiveness engineer herpes virus , G207 , administer directly brain patient recurrent brain cancer . G207 modify herpes virus cause cold sore ( call herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV-1 ) . G207 design kill tumor cell , harm normal brain cell . G207 show safe animal test complete date previous study patient brain tumor . This phase Ib/II study . In phase Ib portion study , patient receive G207 dose high test previous human study . Patients initially receive 15 % assign dose inject directly brain tumor . Approximately two day later , much tumor possible surgically remove , G207 inject brain tumor bed . Patients monitor , medical test do specific study timepoints . The phase II portion begin safety concern phase Ib portion . The goal phase II portion study determine safety G207 study patient survival six month G207 dose . In phase II portion study , patient receive single dose G207 high dose determine safe phase Ib portion study . The tumor remove , G207 inject remain tumor tissue brain tumor bed . Patients closely monitor , medical test perform specific study visit , survival evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Study G207 , Tumor-Killing Virus , Patients With Recurrent Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol NG1-003 open-label , phase Ib/II study safety efficacy G207 , genetically engineer herpes simplex type-1 virus . Up 21 patient enrolled phase Ib portion receive dos G207 high test previous trial . The high G207 dose test previous phase I trial ( NG1-001 ) 3E9 plaque form unit ( pfu ) . G207 generally well tolerated safe NG1-001 , dose-limiting toxicity . Patients ' death due progressive cancer disease except one ( due radiation necrosis ) , two patient remain alive today . Patients phase Ib portion NG1-003 receive G207 divide dos . Initially , 15 % assign dose injected tumor . Two day later , tumor remove , assign dose G207 inject tumor bed time resection . The assigned dos follow : 1E9 , 3E9 , 1E10 pfu . Patient status follow MRI , Karnofsky performance , neurologic examination presence G207 virus body , addition medical test do specific study visit . The phase II portion protocol NG1-003 two-stage study . The phase II portion begin safety concern phase Ib portion . The goal determine safety G207 survival six month . Enrollment 14 patient plan stage one . Additional patient enrol ( 30 additional patient 44 overall ) stage II least 6 14 patient stage 1 survive 6 month longer . Participants phase II receive single dose G207 high dose determine safe phase Ib . G207 inject tumor bed time resection . Again , patient status follow previously describe survival evaluate .</detailed_description>
