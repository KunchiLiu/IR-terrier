	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) investigate brain control voluntary movement trigger external stimulus self-initiated . Registered HCMS healthy normal volunteer may participate . They complete questionnaire medical history brief physical examination . The study consist two part : 1 ) body movement train 2 ) magnetic resonance imaging , follow : Part 1 - Body movement training Participants train three different body movement involve hand foot . The movement either self-initiated response stimulus , visual auditory trigger . Part 2 - Magnetic resonance image Participants one trained movement , without trigger stimulus , MRI scan . MRI diagnostic procedure use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain structure activity . For procedure , subject lie stretcher move scanner-a cylinder contain strong magnet . Earplugs worn protect ear loud thump noise occur electrical switching radio frequency circuit . Scanning time varies 20 minute 2 hour , examination last 1 1-1/2 hour . The subject communicate staff person conduct test time scan . A device compatible magnetic resonance use record participant 's body movement . The participant may ask push button device task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Externally Self-Initiated Movements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voluntary movement divide two category , one externally triggered movement self-initiated movement . The underlying neural mechanism movement investigate , fully understood . The present study aim understand neural mechanism , especially aim find commonly devote brain area categorize movement . By obtain functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) signal trigger movement task design 3 input trigger different modality ( visual , auditory , somatosensory ) 3 output movement different body part ( right hand , leave hand , right foot ) , determine brain region specially devote input output , commonly devote triggered movement . By obtain fMRI signal spontaneous voluntary movement task design 3 output movement body part , determine brain region specially devote specific execution commonly devote voluntarily choose movement .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal volunteer include . Normal volunteer recruit people register HMCS Normal Volunteers . All subject participate MR study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We scan pregnant woman safety high magnetic field fetus establish . Therefore , administer urine pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential prior functional MRI scan . If result urine pregnancy test available reason , medical doctor judge base proper information prior scanning .</criteria>
