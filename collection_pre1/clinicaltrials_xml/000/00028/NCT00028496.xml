	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy without sargramostim treat patient advanced metastatic cancer . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Combining vaccine therapy sargramostim may make tumor cell sensitive vaccine may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity recombinant fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine without sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) recombinant fowlpox-GM-CSF patient advance metastatic CEA-expressing adenocarcinoma . II . Determine CEA-specific T-cell precursor frequency patient treat regimen . III . Assess immunogenicity GM-CSF patient treat regimen . IV . Determine inflammatory response cytokine expression vaccination site patient 48 hour vaccination . V. Correlate telomere length leukocytes prior cytotoxic therapy immunologic response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . The first three cohort 3-12 patient receive escalate dos recombinant fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine ( fCEA-TRI ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient 3 12 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . fCEA-TRI administer intradermally every 2 week 4 dos every 2 month thereafter ( begin day 56 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The fourth fifth cohort 6 patient receive fCEA-TRI MTD manner first three cohort combine escalate dos sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . GM-CSF administer subcutaneously daily begin day vaccination continue total 4 day . The sixth eighth cohort 6 patient receive fCEA-TRI MTD manner first three cohort combine escalate dos recombinant fowlpox-GM-CSF ( rF-GM-CSF ) . rF-GM-CSF administered manner GM-CSF . Patients follow every month 4 month .</detailed_description>
