	<brief_title>2-Methoxyestradiol Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine optimal biologic dose and/or maximum tolerate dose 2-methoxyestradiol patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics metabolism drug patient . IV . Determine biologic change within tumor patient treat drug . V. Correlate pharmacokinetics toxicity drug patient . VI . Evaluate biologic evidence angiogenesis inhibition patient receive drug . VII . Correlate genetic polymorphism cytochrome P450 sulfotransferases isoforms pharmacokinetics drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral 2-methoxyestradiol ( 2-ME ) daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 2-ME maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient treat MTD . Patients follow 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42-60 patient accrue study within 19 month .</detailed_description>
