The vast majority breast cancer originate single layer epithelial cell line ductal/lobular system breast milk duct . The premalignant change occur transformed epithelium well understood , however several cytologic histologic change identify associate increase risk breast cancer , include ductal lobular hyperplasia , hyperplasia atypia , lobular ductal carcinoma situ . The identification cytological histological abnormality breast epithelial cell important component risk assessment . Objectives : The primary objective : To determine incidence nature cytologic change ductal epithelial cell high risk breast , specimen collect breast duct lavage , determine cytologic finding different normal woman increase risk breast cancer . To characterize breast duct endoscopy , high risk breast ductal epithelium architecture , correlate finding cytologic finding . To determine global gene expression pattern high risk breast epithelial cell high risk breast , differ breast epithelial cell normal woman increase risk breast cancer . The gene expression profile determine cDNA microarray validate RT-PCR . Eligibility : Eligibility high risk individual include : - Women age unilateral invasive noninvasive ( DCIS ) breast cancer epithelial origin . - Women without breast cancer , Gail Index great 1.67 % , cumulative lifetime risk great equal double age- race-matched general population risk . - Women know BRCA1/2 hereditary gene mutation carrier . - Women cytologic histologic evidence ductal hyperplasia , atypical ductal hyperplasia , lobular carcinoma situ . - Women may either premenopausal postmenopausal . Postmenopausal define absence menstrual period least 12 month . - Postmenopausal woman previously undergone hysterectomy without oophorectomy must serum FSH level &gt; 40 IU/ml , serum estradiol level less than40 pg/ml document postmenopausal status . Eligibility normal volunteer include : - Women premenopausal postmenopausal Gail model risk index le 1.67 % , without cumulative lifetime risk great equal double age- racematched general population risk . - Women previously undergone hysterectomy without oophorectomy must serum FSH level &gt; 40 IU/ml , serum estradiol level le 40 pg/ml document postmenopausal status . - Both breast must free suspicious area physical examination , woman 30 year age mammogram .
