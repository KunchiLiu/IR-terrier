	<brief_title>SarCNU Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy SarCNU patient recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity drug patient . - Determine time progression survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral SarCNU day 1 , 5 , 9 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond documentation CR . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) receive 4 additional course beyond documentation PR . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 6-8 month .</detailed_description>
