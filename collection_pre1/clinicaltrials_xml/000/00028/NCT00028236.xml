	<brief_summary>This clinical trial gene therapy X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) , genetic disease cause defect protein call common gamma chain , normally surface immune cell call lymphocyte . XSCID patient make T lymphocyte , B lymphocytes fail make essential antibody fight infection . Without T B lymphocytes patient develop fatal infection infancy unless rescue bone marrow transplant healthy donor . However , even transplant patient may achieve partial immune recovery still suffer many infection , auto-immunity and/or poor growth . A recent , successful trial France use gene therapy instead bone marrow transplantation infant XSCID . This experience indicate gene therapy provide clinical benefit XSCID patient . We enroll eight old XSCID patient ( 1.5-20 years-old ) , previously receive least one bone marrow transplant , still poor T B lymphocyte function compromise quality life . Before enrollment , subject blood-forming stem cell harvest frozen blood bank . These cell defective gene , correct copy gene inserted cell grow sterile condition outside patient 's body . To , cell unfreeze expose four day row growth factor particles retrovirus construct test call `` GALV MFGS-gc . '' Retrovirus particles attach patient cell introduce correct copy common gamma chain gene cell capable grow type blood cell , include T B lymphocytes . XSCID patient enrol study receive single dose cell modify GALV MFGS-gc treatment also give another drug call palifermin help prevent side effect chemotherapy possibly try improve development T cell . After , patient monitor find treatment safe see immune function improves . Study endpoint ( 1 ) efficient safe clinical-scale transduction HSC post-BMT XSCID subject ; ( 2 ) administration nonmyeloablative condition regimen old patient improve engraftment ; ( 3 ) administration transduce HSC eight subject ; ( 4 ) administration KGF improve thymic function post transplant improve T cell development ; ( 5 ) appropriate follow-up treated subject monitor vector sequence distribution , gc expression hematopoietic lineage , lymphoctye number function well general health immune status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Gene Therapy Treat X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency ( XSCID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) gene therapy X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) . XSCID result defect IL2RG gene encode common gamma chain ( gc ) share receptor Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , IL-15 IL-21 . XSCID patient generally lack T-lymphocytes NK cell , B-lymphocytes fail make essential antibody . XSCID fatal infancy without immune reconstitution , allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . However , many transplant patient achieve partial immune reconstitution , consequently recurrent infection , autoimmunity and/or poor growth . Recent successful retroviral gene therapy instead BMT infant XSCID indicate ex vivo gene therapy provide clinical benefit XSCID patient . We enroll eight old XSCID patient ( 1.5-20 years-old ; great equal 12 kg body weight ) , attempt BMT , persistent T-lymphocyte B-lymphocyte impairment compromise quality life . Prior enrollment , subject autologous CD34+ HSC mobilize treatment granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) , collect peripheral blood apheresis , immune select cryopreserved sufficient number achieve entry criterion ( great equal 1.0 x 10 ( 6 ) CD34+ HSC/kg body weight ) . HSC procurement conduct separate , approve active NIH protocol , 94-I-0073 , 'Recruitment peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor granulocyte colony stimulate factor [ G-CSF ] ' . Autologous CD34+ HSC transduce ex vivo gibbon ape leukemia virus ( GALV ) envelope-pseudotyped , replication-defective , murine onco-retrovirus vector , MFGS-gc encode common gamma chain . Transductions occur flexible gas-permeable plastic container use serum-free medium supplement 1 % human serum albumin five recombinant growth factor ( 50 ng/mL Flt3-L , 50 ng/mL SCF , 50 ng/mL TPO , 25 ng/mL IL-6 , 5 ng/mL IL-3 ) . Subjects old age 3 give condition regimen consist Fludarabine Busulfan receive single infusion transduce HSC . Prior chemotherapy , follow infusion cell , patient also give Keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) , also know palifermin . Subjects monitor safety efficacy ; latter evidence new development autologous transduce lymphocyte functional gc . Study endpoint ( 1 ) efficient safe clinical-scale transduction HSC post-BMT XSCID subject ; ( 2 ) administration nonmyeloablative condition regimen improve engraftment ; ( 3 ) administration transduce HSC eight subject ; ( 4 ) administration KGF improve thymic function post transplant improve T cell development ; ( 5 ) appropriate follow treat subject monitor vector sequence distribution , gc expression hematopoietic lineage , lymphocyte number function ; well general health immune status .</detailed_description>
