	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness two different regimen combine chemotherapy radiation therapy treat patient undergo surgery locally advance pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare percentage margin-free resection patient locally advance , potentially resectable adenocarcinoma pancreas treat gemcitabine radiotherapy v gemcitabine , fluorouracil , cisplatin follow radiotherapy fluorouracil . - Compare efficacy regimen , measure CT scan response , patient . - Compare posttreatment fibrosis resect specimens patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare duration objective response patient treat regimen . - Compare disease-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare effect regimens disease recurrence CA 19-9 value patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord superior mesenteric vein ( SMV ) /portal vein ( PV ) occlusion ( yes v ) , SMV/PV/superior mesenteric artery/hepatic artery abutment narrowing ( yes v ) , prior exploration ( yes v ) , whether deem require preoperative therapy due factor ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 50 minute weekly 6 week radiotherapy . Patients undergo surgical resection 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Maintenance therapy ( 4-8 week completion surgery ) : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 100 minute weekly 2 week . Treatment repeat every 3 week 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 5 , 29 , 33 ; cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1-5 29-33 ; fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-4 29-32 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 6-15 34-43 epoetin alfa SC weekly week 1-9 . After completion chemotherapy , patient undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week . Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously daily radiotherapy . Patients undergo surgical resection 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Maintenance therapy ( 4-8 week completion surgery ) : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 100 minute weekly 2 week . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80-160 patient ( 40-80 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
