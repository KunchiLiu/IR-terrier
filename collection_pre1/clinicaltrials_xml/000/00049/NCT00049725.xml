	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness drug daclizumab treat patient chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , disease immune system destroy platelet ( blood cell involve clot process ) . Patients ITP abnormal bruising bleeding ; severe disease life-threatening . For many patient , standard drug treatment effective , many drug use may significant side effect long-term use . Daclizumab genetically engineer antibody suppresses immune system use primarily prevent rejection patient organ transplant . Daclizumab few side effect immune suppressant drug . Patients ITP 18 year age old platelet count less 30,000/microliter respond prednisone treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants 15-minute infusion daclizumab every 2 week five dos . They see physician least every 2 week receive drug week 12 , 20 , 32 study . Blood drawn 4- 8-week visit treatment diagnostic test , follow-up visit treatment assess response therapy . Patients respond well treatment pre-study immunosuppressive medicine taper gradually one time start 1-month follow-up visit . If platelet count fall pre-treatment level time tapering , dose reduction stop pre-study medication re-started , necessary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) acquire blood disease individual 's immune system destroy platelet , blood cell responsible clotting . A number standard treatment exist decrease destruction platelet , include drug steroid hormone prednisone , removal spleen . Over third adult patient maintain adequate platelet count treatment . Alternative treatment may indicate due bleeding symptom baseline platelet count less 20,000/ul , level spontaneous serious bleed occur . Therapy chronic ITP generally effective less 30-50 % patient , however , agent significant toxicity long-term use , expensive , administration interferes daily activity . Daclizumab humanize anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody work target impair activate T lymphocyte , subset white blood cell think involve development maintenance ITP . Daclizumab well-tolerated time-limited therapy , easily administer outpatient basis . The purpose study test efficacy daclizumab either sole agent treatment chronic , symptomatic ITP , treatment might allow decrease discontinuation medication prednisone .</detailed_description>
