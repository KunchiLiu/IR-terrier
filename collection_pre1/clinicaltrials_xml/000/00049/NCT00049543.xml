	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well gefitinib work treat patient stage IB , II , IIIA non-small cell lung cancer completely remove surgery . Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know gefitinib may effective treatment prevent tumor return remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Stage IB , II , IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Was Completely Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess , comparison placebo , impact adjuvant therapy two year daily oral ZD1839 ( IRESSA ) ( gefitinib ) overall survival patient completely resect ( T1N1-2 , T2N0-2 , T3N0-2 ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare disease-free survival placebo arm ZD1839 ( IRESSA ) arm . II . To confirm prognostic significance epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression , phosphorylation mutation present primary tumor . III . To assess ability EGFR expression , phosphorylation mutation primary tumor predict relative impact ZD1839 ( IRESSA ) survival . IV . To establish comprehensive tumour bank link clinical database study molecular marker resect NSCLC . V. To evaluate toxicity relate ZD1839 ( IRESSA ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gefitinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
