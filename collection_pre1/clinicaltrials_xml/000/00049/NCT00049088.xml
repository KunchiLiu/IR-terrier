	<brief_title>Bortezomib Docetaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose bortezomib docetaxel patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine toxicity tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine biologic correlate proteasome inhibition bortezomib determine effect inhibition pharmacokinetics docetaxel patient . IV . Determine antitumor efficacy regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . For course 1 , patient receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 8 bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 9 12 . Patients receive 1 week rest . For course 2 subsequent course , patient receive docetaxel day 1 8 bortezomib day 2 , 5 , 9 , 12 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 2-6 patient receive escalate dos bortezomib docetaxel maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
