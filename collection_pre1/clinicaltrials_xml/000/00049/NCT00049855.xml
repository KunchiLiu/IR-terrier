	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension affect 50 million Americans single great risk factor contribute disease brain , heart , kidney . There strong evidence hypertension genetic basis . The study develop novel approach well understand genetic mechanism contribute measure blood pressure ( BP ) level , diagnostic category ( hypertension versus normotension ) correlate trait . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This genetic epidemiology study develop novel approach well understand genetic mechanism contribute measure blood pressure ( BP ) level , diagnostic category ( hypertension versus normotension ) correlate trait . The first aim localize gene influence measure blood pressure level , diagnostic category correlate . This do apply genome-wide multivariate linkage analysis base variance component approach utilize cluster trait correlate measure blood pressure and/or diagnostics category . The second aim develop exploratory diagnostic tool linkage analysis complex trait enhance ability localize gene influence measure blood pressure , diagnostic category correlate . This do extending diagnostic tool use regression analysis variance component approach use linkage analysis quantitative trait . In study example , use identify outlier family since previous study show family outlier value yield false-positive result . Tree-structure model also extend pedigree data . Tree-based model exploratory technique uncovering structure data . The use tree-structure model advantageous assumption necessary explore data structure derive parsimonious model . These model accurate classifier ( binary outcome ) predictor ( quantitative outcome ) . All tool incorporate S-Plus software function . S-Plus select due capability flexibility analyze large data set .</detailed_description>
