	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Anastrozole may fight breast cancer block production estrogen tumor cell . Biological therapy ZD 1839 may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth advance solid tumor . Combining anastrozole ZD 1839 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine anastrozole ZD 1839 treat postmenopausal woman metastatic breast cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anastrozole ZD 1839 Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity anastrozole ZD 1839 , measure objective response ( partial complete ) stable disease 6 month , post-menopausal woman estrogen receptor-positive , hormone refractory , metastatic breast cancer . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Correlate molecular marker clinical benefit patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior objective response endocrine therapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral anastrozole daily alone 2 week . Patients receive oral anastrozole oral ZD 1839 daily 28 day . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 month monthly thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36-78 patient ( 18-39 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
