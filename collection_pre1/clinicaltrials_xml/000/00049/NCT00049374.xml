	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Thalidomide may slow growth cancer cell . Oblimersen may increase effectiveness thalidomide dexamethasone making cancer cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine thalidomide dexamethasone oblimersen treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oblimersen , Thalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical efficacy oblimersen , thalidomide , dexamethasone , term complete partial response rate , patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . - Determine time progression duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Correlate disease response ( clinical outcome ) change Bcl-2 level patient treat regimen . - Determine disease-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive induction therapy comprise oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 , 22-28 , 43-49 , oral dexamethasone day 4-7 , 25-28 , 46-49 , oral thalidomide daily begin day 4 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprise oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 , oral dexamethasone day 4-7 , oral thalidomide daily . Courses repeat every 35 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-46 patient accrue study within 10 month .</detailed_description>
