	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness combine erlotinib radiation therapy without cisplatin treat patient advance mouth throat cancer . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining erlotinib radiation therapy without cisplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Radiation Therapy With Without Cisplatin Treating Patients With Mouth Throat Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination daily oral OSI-774 standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy patient oral cavity ( OC ) oropharyngeal ( OP ) squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , stage II III . II . Determination MTD daily oral OSI-774 , low dose daily cisplatin 6 mg/m^2/day standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy patient oral cavity oropharyngeal SCC stage III IV . III . Determination safety chronic oral dose OSI-774 radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination biological marker activity OSI-774 tumor biopsy specimens patient SCC OC OP pre post therapy . II . Determination ability ( 18F ) -FDG-PET scan demonstrate biological activity OSI-774 previously untreated patient SCC OC OP predict clinical response . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study erlotinib . Patients assign 1 2 regimen accord disease stage . Regimen A ( patient stage II [ T2 , N0 ] III [ T1-2 , N1 ] disease ) : Patients receive oral erlotinib daily . Beginning day 15 , patient also undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily 5 day week 7 week . Regimen B ( patient stage III [ T3 , N0-1 ] IV [ T1-4 , N2-3 , M0 T4 , N0-1 , M0 ] disease ) : Patients receive oral erlotinib undergo IMRT regimen A . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 20 minute day radiotherapy . Patients regimens continue receive erlotinib last day IMRT ( patient already maintenance phase study 5/11/04 continue receive erlotinib daily 2 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In regimen , cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-48 patient ( 12-24 per regimen ) accrue study within 6-24 month .</detailed_description>
