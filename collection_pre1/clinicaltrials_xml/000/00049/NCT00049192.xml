	<brief_title>Oblimersen Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate cytogenetic response rate patient CML less complete hematologic response less major cytogenetic response imatinib mesylate treat two cycle imatinib mesylate + G3139 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate hematologic , cytogenetic molecular response rate duration patient diagnose CML treat two four cycle imatinib mesylate + G3139 . II . To estimate toxicity two drug give combination cooperative group set . OUTLINE : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-10 oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without hematologic response 2 course go study . Patients complete partial response 4 course may continue receive oral imatinib mesylate daily . Patients cohort 2 receive escalate dose oblimersen ; well tolerate , subsequent cohort receive oblimersen high dose original dose imatinib mesylate . If oblimersen well tolerate cohort 2 , subsequent cohort receive original dose oblimersen escalate dose imatinib mesylate . The first 6 patient accrue continue receive original dose ( dose take prior study ) imatinib mesylate throughout study . Patients follow monthly 3 month every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
