	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although clinical manifestation cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) typically appear acutely , deleterious effect CVD brain structure function likely begin presymptomatic fashion young age clinical stroke . In effort characterize prevalence , risk factor , cognitive correlate subclinical CVD , Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) Study fund National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute perform cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cognitive assessment large , bi-racial sample middle-aged young-elderly adult . Results ARIC MRI baseline study reveal remarkably high prevalence subclinical CVD include silent cerebral infarction , white matter hyperintensities , brain atrophy . Moreover , subclinical abnormality find associated reduced cognitive functioning clinical CVD outcome incident stroke . Surprisingly little known risk factor related incidence progression subclinical CVD progression marker may relate clinical outcome stroke neurocognitive decline . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This follow-up study ARIC MRI cohort , repeat semiquantitative MR image cognitive assessment . The study also take advantage recent advance MR image obtain volumetric measurement select brain region expand upon baseline cognitive assessment characterize neurocognitive functioning . The longitudinal design propose study fill salient gap current understanding subclinical CVD . Moreover , conduct study within ARIC take advantage ARIC 's baseline MRI data , unique African American population , extensive vascular risk factor data ( include new genetic biochemical factor well subclinical marker large small vessel disease ) , make efficient study provide new insight incidence , progression , outcomes associated subclinical CVD .</detailed_description>
