	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum tolerate dose imatinib ( imatinib mesylate ) patient recurrent oligodendroglioma mixed oligoastrocytoma currently enzyme induce anticonvulsant therapy . ( Study 1 ) II . To assess efficacy imatinib patient recurrent oligodendrogliomas mixed oligoastrocytomas ( pathologic evidence oligodendrogliomatous component ) measure progression-free survival , response , overall survival . ( Study 2 ) III . To acquire pilot data patient group traditionally eligible recurrent oligodendroglioma mixed oligoastrocytoma clinical trial ( &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens 2 prior chemotherapy regimen recurrent/progressive disease ) . ( Study 3 ) IV . To examine toxicity safety imatinib patient recurrent oligodendrogliomas mixed oligoastrocytomas ( pathologic evidence oligodendrogliomatous component ) . ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 ) V. To perform preliminary correlative study 1p/19q alteration , alpha platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDFGR ) gene amplification level relate downstream signal element tumor tissue , clinical study endpoint . ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 ) VI . To perform descriptive correlative analysis steady state pharmacokinetic data regard imatinib active metabolite study endpoint . ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II pilot study . PILOT STUDY ( Study 3 , Arms D [ EIACs ] E [ Non-EIACs ] ) : Patients stratify assigned treatment group phase II . Patients receive imatinib mesylate PO phase II . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month death .</detailed_description>
