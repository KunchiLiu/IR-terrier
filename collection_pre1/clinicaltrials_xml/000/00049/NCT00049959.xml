	<brief_title>Two Studies Determine Verteporfin PDT Effective &amp; Safe Treating Multiple Basal Cell Carcinoma Skin .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) skin common type cancer treat various therapy include surgical removal . A number factor lead development multiple BCC skin , include genetic disorder ( e.g. , nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ) . Treatment multiple BCC becomes much challenge . In trial , experimental therapy : verteporfin PDT compare placebo PDT . PDT photodynamic therapy study combination photoactive drug verteporfin ( give intravenously ) red light exposure skin tumor . The primary objective ass whether verteporfin PDT completely eliminate multiple BCCs . Eligible subject least 3 BCCs . Study subject wo n't know treatment assign - do randomly ( like flip coin ) . After study treatment , BCCs subject closely observe toward end study surgically remove examined verify response study treatment . Safety assess test blood sample study treatment , analyze adverse event skin reaction study treatment .</detailed_description>
