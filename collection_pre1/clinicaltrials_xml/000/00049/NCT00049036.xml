	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together rituximab work treat patient HIV-associated stage I , stage II , stage III , stage IV non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Rituximab Treating Patients With HIV-Associated Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response rate treatment EPOCH give either concurrently sequentially rituximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity EPOCH give either concurrently sequentially rituximab . II . To evaluate effect EPOCH give either concurrently sequentially rituximab immune function ( CD4 , CD8 lymphocyte count ) two cycle EPOCH , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month completion EPOCH . III . To evaluate effect EPOCH give either concurrently sequentially rituximab HIV EBV viral load two cycle EPOCH , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month completion EPOCH . IV . To evaluate relationship EBV viral load EBV CD8 cytotoxic T cell peripheral blood presence EBV lymphoma tumor cell . V. To determine whether rituximab concurrent use antiretroviral therapy significantly alters steady state concentration etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine first cycle therapy . VI . To determine whether steady state concentration etoposide doxorubicin correlate nadir neutrophil platelet count first cycle therapy . VII . To determine time progression overall survival patient treat EPOCH give either concurrently sequentially rituximab . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord CD4 count ( le 100/mm^3 v least 100/mm^3 ) , age-adjusted International Prognostic Index adverse risk factor ( 0 1 v 2 3 ) , concurrent antiretroviral therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) 2-4 hour prior course chemotherapy . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4-6 course . Patients achieve complete response 4 course chemotherapy rituximab receive additional rituximab alone weekly 2 week . ARM II : Patients receive rituximab concurrently chemotherapy . Beginning 4 week completion chemotherapy , patient receive rituximab IV 2-4 hour weekly 6 week . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
