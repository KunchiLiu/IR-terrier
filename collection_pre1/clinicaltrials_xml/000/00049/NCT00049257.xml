	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate time PSA progression patient metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat paclitaxel carboplatin . - Determine objective response rate , time measurable evaluable disease progression , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive paclitaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 4 week 12 week every 2 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
