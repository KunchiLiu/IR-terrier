	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Mild-to-moderate chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI ) reach epidemic proportion United States . Studies relate mild-to-moderate chronic renal insufficiency cardiovascular risk limit inconsistent . Although much learn natural history adverse outcomes associate end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , little specific information regard risk factor development progression renal disease . The study initiate response Request Applications entitle `` NHLBI Innovative Research Grant Program '' release July , 2001 . The purpose initiative support new approach heart , lung , blood disease sleep disorder use exist data set exist biological specimen collection whether obtain National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The population-based study use data ethnically diverse large cohort male female health plan enrollees extended follow-up . The study evaluate : ) whether baseline decline renal function time independent predictor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , stroke , heart failure peripheral vascular disease ; b ) effect modifier relationship , include baseline hypertension diabetes status . The study determine whether baseline increase time blood pressure level ( well prevalent incident hypertension ) predictive subsequent risk ESRD adjust diabetes baseline serum creatinine , proteinuria hematuria . The study also examine potential predictor ESRD include demographic factor ( race/ethnicity , level education ) total cholesterol level , family history renal disease , body mass index , sagittal abdominal diameter , cigarette ( well cigar pipe ) smoking , coffee intake , alcohol consumption , family history renal disease self-reported occupational exposure . The study use exist longitudinal data resource Northern California Kaiser Permanente Division Research available patient-level cross-linkage US Renal Data System end-stage renal disease registry obtain comprehensive renal cardiovascular outcome . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
