	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining erlotinib docetaxel may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . Phase I trial study maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combine erlotinib docetaxel radiation therapy treat patient locally advanced head neck cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine MTD toxicity combination EGFR inhibitor ( OSI-774 ) , docetaxel , radiation . II . Pharmacokinetic profile OSI-774 alone combination docetaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall complete response rate combination . II . Determine overall , disease free , progression free survival combination . - EGFR expression phosphorylation status - Serum marker angiogenic activity VEGF , sVEGFR-2 , sKIT , ICAM , PDGF - Fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) EGFR , ERBB2 , PDGFR-Î² gene amplification - DNA-sequencing EGFR ERBB2 gene DNA extract pretreatment biopsy material mutation screen - Gene expression profile pre-treatment biopsy material identify predictor response treatment - Apoptosis ( TUNEL assay ) - Ki67 ( nuclear proliferation antigen ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study erlotinib docetaxel . Patients receive oral erlotinib alone daily week 1 2 . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily begin day 1 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 3 week 3-9 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week week 3-9 . Patients continue erlotinib 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients N2 great cervical lymph node involvement baseline residual neck adenopathy chemoradiotherapy undergo neck dissection 6-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Erlotinib hold 1 week plan surgery heal complete . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib docetaxel MTD determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 16 week 1 year completion erlotinib , every 24 week 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
