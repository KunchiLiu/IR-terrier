	<brief_title>PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine ability low-dose PEG-interferon alfa-2b suppress plasma basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) level normal patient metastatic melanoma over-expressing b-FGF . - Determine antitumor effect drug , term progression-free overall survival tumor response , patient . - Correlate tumor activity drug b-FGF vascular endothelial growth factor level plasma urine patient . - Determine safety profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly . Treatment continue basic fibroblast growth factor level suppress normal maximum weekly dose reach . If disease progression , patient discontinue treatment . If disease progression , patient receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC weekly 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
