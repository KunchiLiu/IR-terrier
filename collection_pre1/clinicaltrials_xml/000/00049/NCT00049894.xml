	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There urgent need design effective stroke prevention strategy . Previous prevention strategy include blood pressure control anti-platelet therapy result 43 % reduction stroke risk multi-center study , PROGRESS . Other propose potentially modifiable mechanism mediate endothelial cell injury activation lead accelerated atherosclerosis include dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) activation candidate strategy . Plasma marker various propose mechanism study see predicted recurrent stroke . Since stroke kill 5 million people year , least one third 15 million others sustain non-fatal stroke suffer permanent disability , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) also likely recurrent event , identify potentially modifiable risk factor would significantly reduce morbidity mortality due stroke worldwide . The study base plasma sample take enrollment subset 6,105 subject Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study ( PROGRESS ) . The PROGRESS international , randomize , double-blind control study perindopril-based blood pressure lower regimen among individual stroke transient ischemic attack within previous five year . Coordination monitoring PROGRESS maintain two international coordinating center , one Sydney , Australia Auckland seven regional coordinate center Beijing , Glasgow , Melbourne , Milan , Osaka , Paris Uppsala . There 172 local clinical center distribute 10 country : Australia , Belgium , China , France , Ireland , Italy , Japan , New Zealand , Sweden United Kingdom . The study response Request Applications entitle `` NHLBI Innovative Research Grant Program '' release July , 2001 . The purpose initiative support new approach heart , lung , blood disease sleep disorder use exist data set exist biological specimen collection whether obtain National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This nested case-control study . Plasma sample obtain 6,105 subject enrol PROGRESS study , The nested case-control study include 1773 patient : 591 case ( 83 hemorrhagic stroke , 472 ischemic stroke , 36 unknown type ) , 1182 control subsequently become case . Controls satisfy match criterion find 572 case ; 19 incompletely match . After addition case act matched control case take account control act &gt; 1 case , 33 case 1 , 213 2 , 345 3 matched control . Altogether , 89 case serve control 1 case . The data relate clinical marker cardiovascular risk enrollment . The study design determine plasma marker provide independent measure risk recurrent stroke . In addition , study determine plasma marker provide independent measure reduction risk recurrent stroke perindopril-based antihypertensive therapy , thereby provide mean identify subject likely benefit therapy , conversely , subject alternative preventative strategy require . In addition , plasma marker predict risk recurrent stroke may indicate novel therapy prevent condition . Specific aim include identify whether nuclear magnetic resonance-determined lipoprotein profile , plasma level homocysteine , protein carbonyl , chlorotyrosine , soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule ( sVCAM-1 ) , C-reactive peptide ( CRP ) , active renin , amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) predict recurrent stroke PROGRESS study participant whether measure predict benefit perindopril-based antihypertensive therapy . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
