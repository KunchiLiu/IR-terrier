	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose tipifarnib give together temozolomide radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . Tipifarnib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining tipifarnib , temozolomide , radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish MTD R115777 combination Temozolomide radiation patient EIAEDs . II . To define safety R115777 combination Temozolomide radiation patient population . III . To assess evidence antitumor activity patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study tipifarnib . Patients stratify accord concurrent use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( yes [ close accrual 3/15/05 ] v ) . COMBINATION THERAPY : Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 5-9 day begin tipifarnib , patient receive oral temozolomide daily 6 week concurrently undergo partial brain radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week . After completion radiotherapy , patient proceed adjuvant therapy . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tipifarnib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 10 patient treated MTD . ADJUVANT THERAPY : Patients continue receive tipifarnib . With initiation next planned course tipifarnib , patient receive oral temozolomide day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course OR 1 year ( whichever long ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient progressive disease follow 10 week every 4 month . Patients complete therapy follow every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter disease progression .</detailed_description>
