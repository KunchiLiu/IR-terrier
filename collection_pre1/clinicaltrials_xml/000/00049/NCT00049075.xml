	<brief_title>Fludarabine Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate ( complete partial ) patient previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treat oral fludarabine . - Determine molecular complete response rate patient achieve clinical immunophenotypic complete response treat drug . - Determine progression-free treatment-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine baseline incidence define genetic abnormality patient treated drug . - Determine prognostic predictive significance define genetic abnormality patient respect response treatment drug . - Determine prognostic predictive significance immunophenotypic profile patient respect response treatment drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral fludarabine day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6-8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete remission 6 course receive study therapy . Patients follow 2 month every 4 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
