	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining radiation therapy sargramostim may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give radiation therapy together sargramostim see well work treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Sargramostim Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety contrast-enhanced high-dose radiotherapy administer sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient advance solid malignancy . - Determine immune response patient treat regimen . - Determine tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior therapy ( biopsy simple surgery vs radical surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy ) . Patients receive contrast agent intratumorally follow single fraction kilovoltage radiotherapy . Beginning 24 hour radiotherapy , patient receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) intratumorally continuously 1 week subcutaneously 2 week . Patients lung tumor receive GM-CSF inhalation twice daily 1 week every week total 3 week drug treatment . Treatment may repeat several week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 47 patient ( 12 phase I 35 phase II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
