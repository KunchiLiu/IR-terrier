	<brief_summary>This study examine activity brain observation touch . Studies animal show mirror neuron , nerve cell , active observation performance action . The researcher study hypothesize similar system pertain observe experience touch . Patients age 18 75 year old good health , right hand , able perform simple task require attention may eligible study . Pregnant woman eligible . Patients health screen NIH undergo clinical neurological exam . Women childbearing potential also pregnancy test . The screen take 2 3 hour . A diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan perform patient undergone one previous 12 month . During procedure , patient lie still table slide enclose tunnel scanner . They ask lie still possible minute time . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask move machine time . This scan take 2 hour . Two session involve study . The first one intend familiarize patient procedure . During , learn hand stimulus , watch video show index finger hand touch stick repeatedly . Then activity repeat , time , researcher also touch patient 's index finger watch video . This session take 1 hour . The second session consist functional MRI scan , fMRI . During , picture brain take patient perform task . All task explain advance , patient opportunity practice enter scanner . The fMRI scan take 1 2 hour . The researcher discuss result test participant . There direct benefit take part study . However , hop result information enhance researcher ' understand brain process observed information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : There grow evidence mirror system action observation exist . Neurons monkey premotor cortex discharge performance goal direct action also observation another individual perform similar action . This mirror neuron system action observation seem important recognition understanding action . Recently , bimodal neuron , sensitive tactile stimulation visual stimulus , find parietal cortex . This suggest idea might similar mirror neuron system observe receive ( experience ) tactile stimulation . The neuronal correlate observe tactile stimulation mainly unknown . The purpose protocol determine pattern brain activation relate observation tactile stimulate hand . Study Population : We test hypothesis mean functional MRI ( fMRI ) experiment group healthy subject . Design : We hypothesize observation touch rely activation cortical network different form observation non-touch part overlap cortical structure active real tactile stimulation ( i.e. , somatosensory cortex ) . Further , hypothesize observation touch enhances activation somatosensory cortex real tactile stimulation . Outcome Measures : Our outcome measure increase number activate voxels somatosensory cortex touch observation ( hypothesis ) . This would give important hint mirror system observe received touch . A mirror neuron system observe touch may become important tool rehabilitative treatment patient somatosensory impairment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Only healthy righthanded volunteer age 18 75 year fulfill inclusion criterion include protocol . Subjects able sustain attention task 10 minute . All volunteer history neurological psychiatric illness . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers history severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . Volunteers severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Volunteers increase intracranial pressure ( evaluated clinical examination ) . Volunteers unstable cardiac arrhythmia . Volunteers history hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system . Volunteers moderate severe microangiopathy ( assessed multiple periventricular T2 hyperintensity preexperimental anatomical MRI ) , polyneuropathy ( assessed clinical examination ) , diabetes mellitus ( medical record ) , ischemic peripheral disease ( assessed clinical examination ) . Volunteers medication potential influence nervous system function , history surgery metallic implant know history metallic particle eye , cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , neural stimulators , cochlear implant . Volunteers pregnant . Volunteers significant visual loss/deficits . Volunteers MRI contraindication . Volunteers impaired sensation neuropathy hand .</criteria>
