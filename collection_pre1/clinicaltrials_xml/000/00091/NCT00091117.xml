	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose bortezomib patient advanced malignancy vary degree liver dysfunction . II . Determine safety tolerability drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient mild , moderate , severe liver insufficiency . IV . Examine dietary influence bortezomib disposition efficacy . V. Examine influence proteasome inhibition CYP 450 activity . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients stratify accord hepatic function ( normal v mild dysfunction v moderate dysfunction v severe dysfunction ) . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient per stratum receive escalate dos bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . [ Note : Patients normal hepatic function receive escalate dos bortezomib . ]</detailed_description>
