	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate child recurrent refractory solid tumor treat oxaliplatin . II . Determine cumulative toxicity drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . IV . Determine time progression overall survival patient treated drug . V. Correlate extent oxaliplatin exposure response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease type . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
