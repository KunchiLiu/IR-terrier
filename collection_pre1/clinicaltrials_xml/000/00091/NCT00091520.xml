	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Follow-up Serial Infusions Natrecor ( Nesiritide ) Management Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart Failure ( HF ) inability heart pump efficiently heart perform necessary circulation blood body . This result symptom like shortness breath rest minimal activity . Advanced heart failure one leading cause hospitalization death United States . This prospective randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group , multicenter study effectiveness Nesiritide administer serial infusion outpatient set . Patients enrol study receive nesiritide placebo 12 week . Patients follow additional 12 week . During first 17 week study patient multiple laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) assess , complete quality life questionnaire . During last week study patient contact inquire . The study hypothesis compare placebo plus standard care , Nesiritide plus standard reduce time death first occurrence hospitalization due heart kidney problem . Safety assess collection adverse event , clinical laboratory test vital sign various time point throughout study . The patient assign nesiritide group receive single 2.0mcg/kg bolus ( one time injection ) follow serial IV infusion ( 4 6 hour ) standard flow rate 0.010 mcg/kg/min twice per week 12 week . The patient assign placebo group receive match placebo .</detailed_description>
