	<brief_title>Genetic Studies Difficult Treat Asthma : TENOR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The TENOR ( The Epidemiology Natural History Asthma : Outcomes Treatment Regimens ) study ongoing three-year multi-center observational cohort study 4756 severe difficult-to-treat patient asthma age 6 old . Of group asthmatic , 44.6 % meet National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute National Asthma Education Prevention Program guideline severe persistent asthma , 27.5 % moderate persistent asthma , 27.8 % mild persistent asthma . All subject evaluate initially comprehensive questionnaire laboratory testing , see every 6 month remain 3 year study . Phenotypic information collect include information asthma exacerbation , medication use , urgent care visit , quality life , pulmonary function test ( spirometry reversibility ) , total serum IgE level , history allergy . If access , termination TENOR study , population represent one large population phenotypically characterize difficult-to-treat severe asthmatic potentially available genomic pharmacogenetic study . TENOR finish end 2004 , thus short time window obtain DNA sample genetic study termination study . Isolation storage DNA well characterize , longitudinal population serve resource study grant also future genomics pharmacogenetic study asthma . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study investigate genetic factor affect asthma severity TENOR subject . The study test hypothesis factor produce difficult-to-treat severe asthma produce altered inflammatory response relate , least part , sequence variant ( polymorphism ) gene regulate inflammation , allergic responsiveness , and/or affect structural component airway . The study also test hypothesis patient develop severe asthma genetic difference modulate response pharmacologic agent . To test hypothesis , follow specific aim carry : 1 ) Obtain DNA sample least 4,000 asthmatic currently enrol ongoing TENOR study ; 2 ) Determine whether sequence variant ( polymorphism ) gene regulate inflammation , cellular response , and/or tissue injury repair frequently associate asthma severity use baseline data ; 3 ) Determine importance genetic polymorphism gene may important IgE regulation population difficult-to-treat patient asthma ; 4 ) Evaluate pharmacogenetic relationship polymorphisms a2 adrenergic receptor ( a2AR ) subject long-acting beta-2-agonists determine effect asthma severity ; 5 ) Evaluate pharmacologic mechanism investigate whether polymorphisms gene regulate response asthma therapy frequent severe disease .</detailed_description>
