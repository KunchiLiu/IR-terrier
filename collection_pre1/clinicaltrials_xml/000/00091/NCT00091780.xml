	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study hypothesis breast arterial calcification ( BAC ) see mammogram identify woman increase risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Annual mammogram routinely obtain nearly 70 % woman forty year age . The nearly 40 million examination perform every year could use evaluate BAC without additional cost change current mammographic technique . Identification woman BAC potential substantially decrease rate heart attack sudden death due CAD asymptomatic woman . Before BAC use clinical setting , age-specific prevalence BAC need fully define use state art mammographic technique . BAC need compare well understood CAD risk factor measure coronary atherosclerosis . While could accomplish prospective study , goal attain use data already acquire Epidemiology Coronary Calcification ( ECAC ) Study . The study use exist data 612 non-high risk , non-referred woman participant community-based ECAC Study fund NIH 1991-2006 . This database include traditional new coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk factor result electron beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) examination CAC baseline examination . Most woman also risk factor CAC measure follow-up examination , average , five year baseline examination . The woman ECAC Study , history myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke , represent full age range routinely evaluate mammogram . Almost woman usual care , include annual mammogram , Rochester , Minnesota . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The ECAC study instrumental establish distribution presence quantity CAC well predictor CAC . The database include clinical laboratory assessment CAD risk factor , result EBCTs , find physical examination . It ultimately include information adverse clinical event . There 612 female participant one mammograms 12-year history study . Many woman 10 mammogram . The study evaluate mammogram BAC compare finding information already database . The combination newly acquire data mammogram exist data allows comprehensive study still complete two-year time period . The finding use help design future study prospectively evaluate impact institute preventive early therapeutic measure CAD asymptomatic woman appropriate feature BAC mammography .</detailed_description>
