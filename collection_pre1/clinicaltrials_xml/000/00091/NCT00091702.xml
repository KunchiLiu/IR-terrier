	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Two Influenza Vaccines HIV Infected Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza virus infection common among child , particularly winter season . The infection often mild , serious case cause number complication , include respiratory illness bacterial infection . HIV infect child may increase risk develop influenza-related bacterial complication , influenza infection among population may lead rapid disease progression . The current standard care HIV infect child vaccination inactivate influenza vaccine ( IAIV ) . However , IAIV limit ability stimulate immune system HIV infect child advanced disease . FluMist , cold-adapted live attenuate influenza vaccine , immunogenic effective HIV infect child ; unfortunately , FluMist associate viral shedding , period time influenza virus use produce vaccine may transmit people . This study compare safety immunogenicity IAIV FluMist HIV infect child adolescent . This study also determine prevalence duration FluMist viral shed HIV infected child adolescent receive vaccination . Participants study randomly assign one two arm . Arm A participant receive FluMist ; Arm B participant receive IAIV . A single immunization occur Day 0 study . Arm A participant study visit Days 3 , 14 , 28 home visit Days 3 14 . Participants Arm B study visit Day 28 . A physical exam perform initial study visit ; blood collect study start visit thereafter . Phone call make participant throughout study .
