	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety immunogenicity adjuvant vaccine comprise ovarian cancer synthetic peptide , tetanus toxoid helper peptide , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 patient previously treat ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive vaccine comprise ovarian cancer synthetic peptide , tetanus toxoid helper peptide , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously intradermally 2 different site day 1 , 8 , 15 . On day 22 , patient undergo removal lymph node drain vaccination site determine whether immune system respond vaccine . Patients receive additional vaccine primary vaccination site day 29 , 36 , 43 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week , 1 month , every 3 month 9 month , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 9 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
