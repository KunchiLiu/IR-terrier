	<brief_title>Effectiveness Depression Treatment Following Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality important health issue . Depression emerge risk factor increase morbidity mortality patient coronary heart disease . CABG surgical procedure specifically direct improvement quality life patient severe coronary artery disease , though impact mortality questionable . Patients depression CABG find demonstrate sufficient improvement quality life , result significantly high level healthcare cost . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In randomize study , 300 patient show elevated level depressive symptom 3 5 day follow CABG 2 week hospital discharge recruit . They randomize receive either 1 ) physician 's `` usual care '' depression , 2 ) step collaborative care program involve telephone-based nurse care manager . The nurse care manager contact patient regular interval assess treatment preference depression ( e.g. , counsel , self-management workbook , pharmacotherapy , specialty referral ) , promote adherence care , monitor therapeutic response concert patient 's primary care physician supervision study clinician . One hundred fifty nondepressed post-CABG patient randomly select serve control cohort facilitate comparison depress patient various baseline follow-up measure , good understand benefit derive depression treatment ( total N=450 ) . Blinded telephone assessment conduct 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 month post CABG every 6 month last patient completes his/her 8-month assessment ( range : 8-44 month follow-up ) . Intent-to-treat analysis use test primary hypothesis intervention produce least clinically meaningful 0.5 effect size improvement health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) 8 month post CABG , measure SF-36 Mental Component Summary score , compare patient receive primary care physician 's `` usual care '' depression . The secondary hypothesis compare `` usual care '' patient , intervention patient 1 ) experience high level functional status , low level depressive symptom , risk future cardiovascular event , health service cost , 2 ) report similar level HRQoL nondepressed post-CABG patient . Providing evidence-based , step , collaborative care treatment post-CABG depression may ideal method organize health care delivery system improve outcomes . The focus HRQoL health service cost facilitate comparison benefit derive intervention establish treatment cardiovascular risk factor care chronic condition .</detailed_description>
