	<brief_title>Genetic Environmental Characteristics Primary Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : PPH progressive disease cause obstruction small artery lung , often lead heart failure . It threaten live thousand individual . PPH affect gender age , although female affect twice often male . In recent important advance , mutation BMPR2 associate familial sporadic PPH . Because 20 % people BMPR2 mutation ever develop PPH , gene modify biologic event must contribute clinical development disease . PPH recently rename Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Familial Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study utilize database specimen bank develop 100 family affect PPH across United States . In family genetic mutation yet identify , change BMPR2 gene study , include promoter intronic region , chance recombination event could confirm another locus near 2q33 examine . New method look modifier gene large family know mutation ; examine kindred mitochondrial DNA haplotype ; test candidate gene , include NOS-1 , NOS-3 , serotonin transporter . This study determine functional mechanism variation find BMPR2 allele alter BMP signal transduction define biochemical effect mutant protein signal pathway . In addition , study examine perceive risk benefit clinical genetic test counseling individual family high risk PPH determine new information might helpful individual family .</detailed_description>
