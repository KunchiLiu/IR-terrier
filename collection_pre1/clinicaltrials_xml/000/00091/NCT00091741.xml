	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Etanercept ( Enbrel ) Response Rate HIV-infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Background Rationale : The great challenge face HIV-treating clinician today management virologic failure metabolic complication anti-HIV treatment . Treatment failure occur non-compliance , drug discontinuation , lack drug potency , inadequate drug plasma concentration drug resistance . Of , drug resistance remain single important reason virological failure rapidly limit treatment option . Virus resistance three major antiretroviral drug class report even primary seroconverters . Although highly-active antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy ( HAART ) lead sharp decline AIDS-related morbidity mortality , treatment failure common , significant problem many 50 % patient detectable plasma HIV RNA despite combination ARV therapy . Salvage therapy term commonly use define approach take previous anti-HIV treatment fail achieve desire goal , include : 1 ) undetectable viral load ; 2 ) CD4 cell level 200 cells/mm3 ; , 3 ) prevention HIV disease progression . It one difficult situation face patient , one problematic challenge health-care provider . Although state treatment failure sometimes euphemistically refer `` management treatment-experienced patient , '' many HIV positive patient , already exhaust benefit least drug combination , think next regimen salvage `` rescue '' therapy . Some physician argue due cross-resistance among different drug within class , people HIV infection one good shot treating , treatment regimen beyond first therefore salvage therapy . Others see salvage therapy literally end line -- individual 's HIV develop extensive resistance currently available treatment . But provider consider salvage therapy somewhere extremes . Data salvage therapy mostly come anecdotal report retrospective cohort study . With paucity clinical trial data , clinician often force prescribe unproven regimen base anticipated cross-resistance drug interaction . It important , therefore , new agent new approach continue develop increase number patient practice exhaust treatment option . The rationale study base upon exist literature indicate many manifestation subsequent clinical deterioration HIV-infected individual relate immune dysfunction see HIV disease , many cause overproduction proinflammatory cytokine , notable excessive production TNF-α . It postulate removal TNF-α commercially available TNF-α-binding medication [ ENBREL ( etanercept ) ] may provide therapeutic benefit HIV-infected patient fail respond standard antiretroviral therapy . II . Goal Objectives : The purpose project assess safety profile efficacy soluble p75 tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor : Fc fusion protein ( Enbrel ; Amgen , ( etanercept ) Thousand Oaks , CA ) [ i.e . anti TNF-α ] response rate `` salvage patient '' virologic failure fail respond standard antiretroviral therapy . The protocol evaluate : 1 . Changes CD4 T-cell enumeration , viral load , soluble immune activation marker HIV-infected patient baseline week 24 follow treatment anti-TNF-α . 2 . Safety tolerability anti-TNF-α respect treatment-limiting symptom laboratory adverse event week 24 .</detailed_description>
