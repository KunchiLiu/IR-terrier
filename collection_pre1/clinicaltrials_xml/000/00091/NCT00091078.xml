	<brief_title>Oblimersen Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy G3139 ( bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide ) plus imatinib mesylate GIST patient limit generalized progression therapy imatinib . II . To assess safety G3139 plus imatinib mesylate GIST patient limit generalized progression therapy imatinib . III . To determine whether expression BCL-2 correlate survival , time progression response rate patient GIST treat G3139 plus imatinib . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord extent disease progression ( limited v generalize ) . Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-14 . Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 96 patient ( 48 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
