	<brief_summary>This study test whether rituximab ( RITUXAN ( Trademark ) ) relieve symptom stiff person syndrome ( SPS ) , progressive disease cause stiffness muscle muscle spasm induce unexpected noise , touch , stressful event . People SPS may certain protein blood call anti-GAD antibody may cause symptom disease . Rituximab , drug approve treat lymphoma , target certain white blood cell produce antibody . This study see rituximab also effective patient SPS high anti-GAD antibody . Patients 25 80 year age SPS may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Rituximab placebo treatment : Patients randomly assign receive two infusion vein either rituximab placebo ( look-alike solution active ingredient ) 2 week apart . The infusion last 3 4 hour , may take long 16 hour rate must slow reason . Patients follow monthly 6 month every 2 month 1 year treatment . - Medical history interview , physical neurological examination : Patients questioned vaccination history , medical , surgical , psychiatric history , exposure environmental toxin virus , family social history , include habit employment . - Blood drawing : Blood sample collect two infusion follow-up visit . - Apheresis : For procedure , use collect white blood cell , blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood flow vein catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The white cell remove rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) return body second needle arm . The procedure take 60 90 minute . - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) : Lumbar puncture do sample small amount cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF , fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) , analysis . For procedure , patient give local anesthetic needle insert space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid withdrawn needle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine safety , tolerability , efficacy humanize monoclonal antibody Rituximab induce clinical serological remission patient Stiff Person Syndrome ( SPS ) associate high anti-GAD antibody . Rituximab monoclonal antibody specific common B cell antigen CD20 . Its administration deplete pre-B mature B lymphocytes without alter neutrophil hematopoietic stem cell . In human indolent B cell lymphoma , Rituximab safely administer , well tolerate , promote selective B cell depletion lower serum IgG IgM level . Preliminary experience non-malignant antibody-mediated disorder show Rituximab beneficial improve patient ' symptom reduce antibody level . SPS antibody-mediated autoimmune disease affect GABA-ergic transmission result incapacitate stiffness spasm . The anti-GAD antibody also produce intrathecally believe responsible reduction GABA level serum CSF . Although removal modulation serum antibody plasmapheresis IVIg result clinical improvement , number patient respond response modest short-lived , remain significant disability . The need effective therapy prompt u conduct present study examine randomize trial Rituximab effective patient GAD-antibody-positive SPS . Twenty-four patient randomize , double blind fashion , receive placebo Rituximab give fix dose 1 GM Day 1and 1 GM day 15 ( plus minus 2 day ) . The primary outcome base measurement stiffness use Distribution Stiffness Index . Secondary outcomes measure Heightened-Sensitivity Scales . The serum CSF anti-GAD antibody titer , include intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis , monitor treatment . Clearance GAD-reactive T cell also examine serum CSF use T cell clone establish PBL CSF . It anticipate study : ) provide new , immune-based target-oriented therapy patient Stiff Person Syndrome b ) examine pathogenetic role anti-GAD antibody cause disease .</detailed_description>
