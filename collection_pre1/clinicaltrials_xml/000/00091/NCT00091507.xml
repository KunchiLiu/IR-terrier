	<brief_title>IMMEDIATE Trial - Out Hospital Administration Glucose , Insulin Potassium .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Basic clinical research suggest intravenous GIK metabolic myocardial support reduces ischemia-induced arrhythmia , progression unstable angina pectoris ( UAP ) acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) size , mortality . Also , ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) , GIK may prolong time benefit coronary reperfusion . These effect reduce short- long-term mortality ACS , include AMI UAP , propensity heart failure ( HF ) . These benefit relate earliness ACS , risk opportunity save live high . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , multicenter clinical trial IMMEDIATE GIK early possible ACS prehospital emergency medical service ( EMS ) set . Distinct prior ongoing GIK trial , test GIK ACS rather AMI STEMI prehospital EMS . The primary hypothesis early GIK prevent reduce size acute myocardial infarction . Major secondary hypothesis posit GIK reduce mortality ( 30 day 1 year ) , reduce pre- in-hospital cardiac arrest propensity heart failure . Other hypothesis address mechanisms effect .</detailed_description>
