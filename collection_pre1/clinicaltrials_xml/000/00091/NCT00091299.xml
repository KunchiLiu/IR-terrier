	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vatalanib may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Warfarin may effective prevent formation blood clot patient undergo treatment advance solid tumor . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study well give warfarin together vatalanib work treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Warfarin Vatalanib Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine acute chronic change INR patient advance solid tumor treat low-dose warfarin vatalanib . Secondary - Determine steady-state pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . - Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) phase : Patients receive oral low-dose warfarin daily day 1-14 oral vatalanib daily , 1 hour warfarin administration , day 2-14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Continuation phase : Patients experience drug interaction PK phase continue receive oral vatalanib oral low-dose warfarin daily . Patients experience drug interaction ( INR &gt; 2.0 ) PK phase receive oral vatalanib alone daily . Continuation therapy continue indefinitely absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
