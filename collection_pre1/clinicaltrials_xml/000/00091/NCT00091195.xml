	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well depsipeptide ( romidepsin ) work treat patient recurrent ovarian epithelial peritoneal cavity cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , depsipeptide ( romidepsin ) , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Depsipeptide ( romidepsin ) may also stop growth ovarian epithelial peritoneal cavity cancer stop blood flow tumor block enzyme necessary growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depsipeptide ( Romidepsin ) Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate recurrent , platinum-sensitive adenocarcinoma ovarian peritoneal depsipeptide ( romidepsin ) . II . To determine toxicity depsipeptide patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive depsipeptide ( romidepsin ) intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
