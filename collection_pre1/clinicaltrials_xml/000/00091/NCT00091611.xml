	<brief_summary>Background : - Some patient advance kidney cancer immune cell recognize kill cancer , cell active enough numerous enough accomplish . - In recent study patient advance melanoma , patient give special tumor-fighting cell ( cell take patient 's tumor cell grown laboratory ) show anti-tumor response . Objectives : -To determine whether special tumor-fighting cell take patient 's blood tumor grown laboratory cause tumor patient kidney cancer shrink give back patient along interleukin-2 . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old advanced kidney cancer . Design : - Up 29 patient treat study . - Patients undergo tumor biopsy collect tumor cell create special tumor-fighting cell later infusion . - Patients undergo apheresis collect stem cell later re-infusion . For apheresis , whole blood collect needle arm vein circulate cell-separating machine stem cell extract . The rest blood return needle needle arm . - Before receive treat white cell , patient give two drug suppress immune system treat cell work without interference immune system cell . They give cyclophosphamide 2 day catheter ( plastic tube insert vein arm neck ) fludarabine catheter 15-30 minute next 5 day . - The day last dose fludarabine , tumor-fighting cell infuse vein 10-20 minute . - Following cell infusion , patient start treatment high-dose interleukin-2 every 8 hour maximum 12 dos . - Patients evaluate x-ray study 1 month receive cell interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) look tumor response treatment . Those show significant improvement continue receive treatment treat cell use patient longer benefit develop unacceptable side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : One area therapeutic advancement immunotherapy identify autologous tumor-reactive T-cells expand vitro , administer adoptive transfer back patient . These T-cells obtain either tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) appear enrich tumor-reactive T-cells vitro stimulation peripheral blood T-cells cancer patient . Recent success patient melanoma large part due T-cell expansion protocol describe Riddell et al . use anti-CD3 ( cluster differentiation 3 ) irradiate allogeneic feeder cell use condition chemotherapy prior cell transfer . This current study use result Surgery Branch adoptive cell therapy trial study potential patient metastatic renal cell cancer . Objectives : The primary objective determine whether adoptive lymphocyte transfer conjunction preparative lympho-depletion chemotherapy interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) may result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic renal cancer . Eligibility : Patients metastatic renal cell cancer fail conventional therapy interleukin-2 , tumor-reactive lymphocyte ( either peripheral blood , lymph node tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ) obtain expand vitro . Patients must meet specific safety laboratory criterion , able tolerate interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , concurrent major medical illness symptomatic brain metastasis . Design : All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day intravenous ( IV ) ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day intravenous ( IV ) ) day -5 -1 . On day 0 patient receive infusion tumor-reactive T cell grown vitro ( great equal 5x10^8 cell cycle ) begin high-dose IL-2 ( 720,000 IU/kg intravenous ( IV ) every 8 hour 15 dos ) . Clinical Immunologic response evaluate 3 5 week treatment regimen . This trial conduct phase II trial use two-stage MinMax design try determine whether intravenous ( IV ) cell administration produce modest response rate target great equal 35 % ( p1=0.35 ) oppose undesirably low response rate le 15 % ( p0=0.15 ) . If least 3 patient 15 objective response ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) accrual proceed 28 patient , project accrual three year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : CELL HARVEST : Patients must metastatic renal cell cancer . age great equal 18 year . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 entry trial . Life expectancy great three month . Seronegative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible 's toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen . Seropositive EpsteinBarr Virus ( EBV ) . Patients electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormality , symptom cardiac ischemia arrythmias age great 50 year must normal stress cardiac test ( stress thallium , stress multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) , dobutamine echocardiogram stress test ) . Patients recent prolonged history cigarette smoking symptom respiratory dysfunction must pulmonary function test forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV ( 1 ) ) great 60 % predict . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : CELL HARVEST : Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , contraindication receive interleukin2 ( IL2 ) major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system . INCLUSION CRITERIA : CELL INFUSION : Patients must measurable metastatic renal cell cancer tumor progression therapy interleukin2 ( IL2 ) . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 entry treatment phase trial . Platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less three time upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl . Total bilirubin less equal 1.6 mg/dl direct bilirubin less equal 0.5 mg/dl . Life expectancy great three month . At time Tcell transfer , patient must Tcell population meet attached Certificate Analysis tumor recognition safety test . Any patient receiving interleukin2 ( IL2 ) must sign durable power attorney . Male Female patient must willing practice contraception treatment phase study.. Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis may consider eligible . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : CELL INFUSION : Potentially effective therapy renal cell cancer ( RCC ) within four week time patient receives Tcell transfer ( exception local irradiation nonevaluated site ) . Requirement steroid therapy . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , contraindication receive interleukin2 ( IL2 ) major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system . Pregnant patient nurse mother exclude unknown effect therapy fetus nursing infant .</criteria>
