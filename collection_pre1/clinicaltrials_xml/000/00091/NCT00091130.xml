	<brief_title>SGN-00101 Vaccine Treating Human Papillomavirus Patients Who Have Abnormal Cervical Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare effectiveness SGN-00101 vaccine v placebo reduce human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -16 viral load patient atypical squamous cell undetermined significance ( ASCUS ) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) cervix persistent HPV-16 infection increase risk develop high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion invasive cervical cancer . II . Compare natural history HPV-16 viral load patient treat regimen . III . Compare effect HPV-16 variant viral load response patient treat regimen . IV . Compare relative effectiveness regimens regression cervical cellular atypias ( base Pap test result ) , term regression cytologic finding LSIL ASCUS normal finding resolution regression colposcopically define cervicovaginal lesion , patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive SGN-00101 vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 week 1 , 4 , 8 maximum 3 injection absence unacceptable toxicity development invasive malignancy serious illness . ARM II : Patients receive placebo vaccine SC day 1 week 1 , 4 , 8 maximum 3 injection absence unacceptable toxicity development invasive malignancy serious illness . Patients follow 12 , 24 , 52 week last vaccination .</detailed_description>
