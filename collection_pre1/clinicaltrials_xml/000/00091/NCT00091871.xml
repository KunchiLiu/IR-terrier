	<brief_summary>Eosinophils type white blood cell . Elevated eosinophil level damage heart , nerve , organ , syndrome know hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . Some individual hereditary form HES know familial eosinophilia ( FE ) . More research causation mechanism HES need order design effective less toxic therapy . This study investigate FE genetic cause , damage mechanism , disease marker ( blood test abnormality ) . It enroll approximately 20 individual ( adult child ) previously study family FE . This long-term study indefinite duration . Participants undergo yearly clinical examination include medical history , physical examination , bloodwork , EKG , echocardiogram , pulmonary function test , additional frequent examination test require . In addition , participant donate blood tissue research purpose . Both adult child participant donate blood . At initial evaluation , adult participant donate bone marrow . During study , adult participant also undergo limited number leukaopheresis session , blood donate one arm , blood separate red blood cell component , red blood cell return donor 's arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Familial Hypereosinophilia ( FE ) : Natural History Markers Disease Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Affected member family familial hypereosinophilia ( FE ) admit protocol . A thorough clinical evaluation perform biyearly emphasis potential sequela eosinophil-mediated tissue damage . Blood cell , bone marrow and/or serum also collect provide reagent ( DNA , RNA , specific antibody ) use laboratory address issue relate genetic immunologic basis FE well pathogenesis . It anticipate patient undergo extensive evaluation generally available specimen collect prove valuable reagent laboratory study relate eosinophilia , eosinophil activation function . While study design address question therapy FE , patient medical therapy indicate ( either hypereosinophilia sequela ) , appropriate treatment institute clinical service patient ' local physician . No experimental chemotherapy involve protocol .</detailed_description>
