	<detailed_description>In study amount drug frequency dose investigation . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) give subcutaneous injection ( small needle prick place underneath skin ) . The maximum number injection patient may receive 3 . The total expected length time patient participation study 140 day ( 5months ) . This study consist screen period , treatment period post treatment period . The study doctor determine whether patient suitable study . Safety evaluation perform specify interval throughout study consist laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure ) , physical examination occurrence severity adverse event well study specific procedure . Eligible patient assign chance ( like flip coin ) one two treatment group ; 40,000 unit EPO Placebo . Unless need arises , neither patient study staff , know treatment patient receives . The patient receive injection study drug Study Days 1 , 8 15 long remain hospital hemoglobin ( Hb ) level less 12g/dL . If patient 's hemoglobin level great 12g/dL scheduled medication day , study medication give . However patient remain study re-assessment do next dosing time point . The patient also receive iron therapy ( least 150 mg ) Study Day 1 ( tolerate ) Study Day 29 patient discharge hospital withdraws study ( whichever come first ) . Treatment study drug stop patient become pregnant , study doctor feel patient 's best interest . If treatment stop Study Day 15 , patient require return schedule study assessment Study Day 140 . The purpose post-treatment period monitor patient 's health status . Whether patient remains hospitalize , patient two visit monitor health ( Study Day 42 140 ) . In addition , study doctor nurse contact patient caregiver phone monthly follow Study Day 29 visit Study Day 140 . Weekly subcutaneous injection ( skin ) 40,000 unit EPO placebo day 1 , 8 15 .</detailed_description>
