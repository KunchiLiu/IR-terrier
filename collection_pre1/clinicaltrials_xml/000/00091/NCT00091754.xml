	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study draw upon exist ARIC cohort 15,792 member age 45-64 year baseline 1987-1989 complete four clinic exam three year apart last exam 1998 . The longitudinal ARIC cohort study focus new cardiovascular disease [ CVD ] risk factor subclinical measure atherosclerosis B-mode ultrasound carotid artery . The current study collect new novel risk factor perform carotid magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examination stratify random sample 1,200 ARIC participant high ( &gt; 85th percentile ) carotid intimal-medial thickness [ IMT ] ultrasound 800 participant &lt; 85th percentile IMT . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine informative subset bi-ethnic Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) cohort identify cellular , metabolic genomic correlate atherosclerotic plaque characteristic early change vascular wall . The longitudinal follow-up store DNA ARIC allow test ability genomic correlate plaque characteristic predict incident coronary heart disease stroke . One thousand two hundred individual high ( &gt; 85th percentile ) carotid artery wall thickness document B-mode ultrasound 800 individual sample remainder carotid artery wall thickness distribution ( &lt; 85th percentile ) receive contrast-enhanced carotid MRI examination . Standardized MRI measure include carotid artery wall thickness , T2 signal intensity change percent contrast enhancement indicative endothelial dysfunction , plaque , fibrous cap thickness , lipid core volume , calcification . Novel cellular , metabolic genomic measure collect related MRI-measurable plaque characteristic . In particular , flow cytometry use measure monocyte platelet presentation cytokine , growth factor adhesion molecule , cell-cell aggregation . High throughput genotyping method use measure 5 7 polymorphic site 150 positional , expressional biologic candidate gene , permit multilocus haplotype genomic analysis . The depth breadth exist risk factor lifestyle data , extensive follow-up since 1986-89 , accumulation clinical outcome , include coronary heart disease , stroke arteriosclerosis , contribute additional strength laboratory MRI investigation . Inferences make cross-sectionally longitudinally , special emphasis genotype plus environment interaction . The ARIC cohort ideal age range research frequent document occurrence plaque spectrum clinically relevant stage plaque initiation mature fibrosis , calcification even erosion near-rupture .</detailed_description>
