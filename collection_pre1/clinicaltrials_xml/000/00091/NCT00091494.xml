	<brief_title>Socioeconomic Patterning Inflammation Hemostasis - Ancillary MESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In epidemiologic study , association cardiovascular risk individual neighborhood socioeconomic characteristic tend persist adjustment establish cardiovascular risk factor suggest mediator may involve . However , evidence regard mediator may largely absent . Elucidating reason persistent socioeconomic difference may enhance ability reduce differential contribute understanding cause cardiovascular disease generally . Two biological process , inflammation hemostasis , recently emerge potentially important development atherosclerosis precipitation clinical cardiovascular event . Both process also recently link psychosocial factor stress . However , study investigate social gradient inflammation hemostasis remain rare . In addition , relation psychosocial factor biological marker stress response inflammation hemostasis examine large population-based study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study ancillary ongoing epidemiologic study atherosclerosis , Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . The project collect data stress hormone follow- measure inflammation hemostasis part exist MESA protocol subsample cohort . The study also collect additional data neighborhood source stress subsample . The new data link exist MESA data . Using newly collect data link MESA , study investigate ( 1 ) association neighborhood individual-level socioeconomic indicator marker inflammation hemostasis ; ( 2 ) association individual-level psychosocial factor source chronic stress ( individual neighborhood level ) inflammatory marker hemostasis ; ( 3 ) relationship biological marker stress response ( cortisol adrenaline/noradrenaline ) inflammation hemostasis ) . Project aim achieve link MESA data newly-collected data neighborhood characteristic biomarkers inflammation , hemostasis stress response MESA participant . The project innovative span link three level : social/environmental level ( neighborhood characteristic social position ) , behavioral/psychological level ( behavioral psychosocial factor ) , biological level ( inflammation , hemostasis , stress hormone ) . The study provide unique opportunity elucidate link socioeconomic factor , stress , inflammation hemostasis large diverse population-based sample .</detailed_description>
