	<brief_summary>The objective Spectacle Phase : - In previously untreated pure anisometropic patient ( i.e . patient use spectacle last year strabismus ) , determine 1. incidence resolution amblyopia spectacle correction alone 2. time course visual acuity improvement spectacle correction alone . - In patient , achieve maximal improvement spectacle correction prior enter randomize trial . The objective Randomized Trial : - To determine whether 5 week patch treatment ( 2 hour patch per day sound eye combine least one concurrent hour near activity ) , compare control group ( use spectacle correction ) , improve visual acuity patient moderate severe amblyopia ( 20/40 20/400 ) . - To determine maximal improvement time course improvement patch treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate 2 Hours Daily Patching Amblyopia Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There data improvement occur spectacle correction alone case anisometropic amblyopia . The publish study aware Moseley , et al , find 8 12 patient prescribed spectacle first time improve 3 line amblyopic eye . Therefore , Spectacle Phase current study provide important information related management patient anisometropic amblyopia . Additionally , despite clinical experience strongly indicate amblyopia improve treatment , claim benefit treatment unproven . Although improvement amblyopia therapy show prospective trial , conclusive data publish randomized trial evaluate effect amblyopia treatment compare control group . Therefore , design randomized trial definitively address issue . In trial , effect amblyopic eye acuity five week 2 hour prescribe daily patching ( combine least one hour concurrent near activity ) compare control group use spectacle correction . In study conduct Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group , 2-hour daily patch treatment regimen improve moderate amblyopia ( 20/40 20/80 ) amount similar improvement see 6 hour daily patch . At end five week , patient whose amblyopic eye improve baseline continue follow , use assign treatment , amblyopic eye acuity stop improve amblyopia resolve . This provide data maximum improvement achievable treatment regimen time course reach maximal improvement . There know harm defer treatment amblyopia five week age range include trial ( 3 &lt; 7 year old ) . Standard care patient amblyopia include prescribe spectacle correction patient return 4 6 week measurement visual acuity . Spectacles alone continue long acuity amblyopic eye improve . Once acuity stop improve , occlusion active treatment initiate . The maximum delay active treatment control group beyond standard care 5 week . In prior Amblyopia Treatment Study protocols patient age range , find indication response patch treatment related age . Therefore , highly unlikely delay initiate treatment week even month could harmful . This study address issue relate treatment amblyopia child 3 &lt; 7 year old visual acuity 20/40 20/400 . The study consist two phase : 1. Spectacle Phase patient prescribe spectacle follow maximal improvement visual acuity occur 2. Randomized Trial compare group use patch treatment ( addition spectacle correction ) control group use spectacle correction . The sample size primary analysis randomize trial estimate 134 patient . Patients enrol Spectacle Phase recruitment goal Randomized Trial reach .</detailed_description>
