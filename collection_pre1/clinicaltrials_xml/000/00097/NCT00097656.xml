	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : The intervention design multi-center , randomize , control , clinical trial determine effect periodontal therapy rate preterm birth . Study participant assign one two study arm . All pregnant woman present designated Obstetrical ( OB ) clinic potential subject study . A total 1800 patient enrol 3 performance site , enrol 600 subject site rate 171 subjects/year site , randomly assign subject one 2 treatment arm . Randomization perform use computer-generated assignment scheme design perform masked manner data coordinate center . Each performance site enroll 300 subject treatment group use intent-to-treat principle , obtain follow-up subject . In treatment Group 1 participant assigned standard localize periodontal therapy scale root planning subgingival polish three six month gestation . Group 2 receive local periodontal therapy immediately follow delivery . MASKING : The dental examiner aware randomization treatment assignment participant complete baseline periodontal examination conduct . The study protocol allow dental examiner know treatment assignment participant knowledge affect assessment primary obstetric outcome study . OB personnel individual collect OB data mask dental treatment . At delivery second dental exam make without examiner know pregnancy outcome . PRIMARY/SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome preterm delivery le 37 week gestational age , determine ultrasound date . Secondary outcome include ( 1 ) preterm delivery le 35 week , ( 2 ) weight gestational age , ( 3 ) neonatal morbidity/mortality . It central hypothesis mother periodontitis receive periodontal treatment second trim pregnancy experience lower rate preterm delivery &lt; 37 week secondarily &lt; 35 week ; periodontal treatment pregnant mother result increase weight gestational age delivery occur less 37 week gestational age reduce neonatal morbidity mortality . We determine effect periodontal therapy rate preterm birth GA &lt; 37 week principal outcome mean birth weight among neonate GA &lt; 35 week , secondary outcome adjust race , gender gestational age . POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS AND COVARIATES : There many potential risk factor relate preterm birth growth restriction need consider investigation . There also exposures , effect modifier covariates influence periodontal disease status preterm birth . Data collect major variable interest include race , age , smoking , previous preterm delivery , first birth , bacterial vaginosis , chorioamnionitis , sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) , antibiotic usage , socioeconomic status ( SES ) substance abuse . In addition measure fetal fibronectin collect vaginal smear examine potential subclinical vaginosis . Detailed information collect potential factor use assure randomization effectively balance risk treatment arm permit post-hoc assessment . PLAN FOR MONITORING : There administrative Steering committee consist Obstetric Periodontal Principal Investigator ( PI ) clinical site , NIDCR co-investigators Data Statistical Coordinating Center ( DSCC ) investigator . The Steering committee meet twice first year year thereafter . Study coordinator also attend one two annual meeting . Data collect dental , obstetric neonatal outcome data &amp; statistical coordinating center , monitor weekly adverse event . The DSCC collate adverse event safety data centrally provide safety assessment report DSMB . The DSMB monitor outcomes adverse event assure maternal infant safety provide feedback NIDCR every 6 month need . ADVERSE EVENTS : The dental examiner conduct comprehensive oral soft tissue ( cancer screen ) periodontal examination baseline post partum . Following enrollment mother follow , OB surveillance parturition , post-delivery dental follow-up neonatal surveillance include chart review discharge . All provide opportunity detect monitor adverse event . All report observed serious adverse event document adverse event case report form describe onset , duration , severity , assessment causality relationship treatment intervention . This follow resolution . A member investigative team review subject 's OB chart weekly basis note adverse event treatment provide ( outside routine ) . In addition neonatal discharge summary finding collect monitor adverse neonatal morbidity neonatal sepsis necrotizing enterocolitis . Any dental treatment note subject 's clinical record review dental examiner . PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS : The detail analysis plan appear body protocol , summarize . The incidence preterm birth principal outcome evaluate use chi-square test . Approximately 240 case expect gestational age ( GA ) &lt; 35 week . Success randomization possible confounders evaluate logistic regression model . Significance indicate alpha level 0.05 . Mean birth weight among preterm baby analyze correlation significant difference study arm use non-parametric test ( Kruskal-Wallis test ) Parametric ( regression ) model use adjust gestational age factors. ] . Analyses conduct use intent treat philosophy . Data collect series potential risk factor , covariates , confounders effect modifier may influence primary secondary outcome periodontal status . Any unbalanced distribution risk exposure include regression model analysis . Adverse event data report regularly . Interim analysis efficacy conduct 600 1200 complete pregnancy .</detailed_description>
