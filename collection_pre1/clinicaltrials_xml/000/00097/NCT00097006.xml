	<brief_title>Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II ( REDS-II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : REDS-I establish address important blood safety issue involve human retrovirus . On July 17 , 1989 NHLBI award contract five major blood center coordinate center develop major multicenter epidemiologic study human retroviruses HIV-1 , HIV-2 , HTLV-I , HTLV-II volunteer U.S. blood donor . The original mission REDS-I initiate facilitate investigation human retrovirus volunteer blood donor area country vary risk HIV . During course project , NHLBI expand original REDS-I mission investigate critical question pose blood banking transfusion medicine community essential ensure adequate blood supply without compromise blood safety . The overall REDS-I program include epidemiologic , laboratory , clinical investigation , provide comprehensive framework monitor U.S. blood donation , recently transfusion recipient , infectious disease marker . The operational database structure REDS-I , specifically design study U.S. blood safety availability , also provide framework rapid analytical response research question significant importance safety blood supply . Since inception , investigator make major contribution assess : risk contract transfusion-transmitted infectious agent ; HIV HCV test screening ; donor characteristic behavior ; way reduce HIV risk transfusion . REDS-I investigator work closely Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Office Secretary , Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) provide data analysis important policy decision . Liaisons test manufacturer enable rapid study test procedure critical importance blood safety availability . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The objective Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II ( REDS-II ) conduct epidemiological , laboratory , survey research volunteer blood donor within United States ensure safety availability United States ' blood supply . This include monitor know blood-borne infectious agent , rapidly evaluate impact emerge pathogen , assess safety implication change laboratory and/or blood donor screening protocol examine blood supply availability issue . Addressing issue concern safety availability United States ' blood supply cornerstone National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute 's Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study . These issue include : ) risk transfusion-transmissible infection trend time -- include infectious agent currently undergo laboratory screen well new emerge agent West Nile Virus ( WNV ) screen U.S. experimental protocol ; b ) way reduce risk transfusion-transmissible infection ; c ) HIV , HTLV , HCV , HBV test screening methodology ; ) donor characteristic , behavior , donation return pattern U.S. blood donor ; e ) effectiveness safety various strategy implement increase U.S. blood supply .</detailed_description>
