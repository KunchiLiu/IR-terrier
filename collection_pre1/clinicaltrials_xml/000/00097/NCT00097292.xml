	<brief_summary>RATIONALE The accrual data laboratory epidemiologic prevention trial improve understanding etiology pathogenesis type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . Genetic immunologic factor play key role development T1DM , characterization early metabolic abnormality T1DM steadily increase . However , information regard natural history T1DM remain incomplete . The TrialNet Natural History Study Development T1DM ( Pathway Prevention Study ) design clarify picture , , contribute development implementation study aim prevention early treatment T1DM . Purpose : TrialNet international network dedicate study , prevention , early treatment type 1 diabetes . TrialNet site locate throughout United States , Canada , Finland , United Kingdom , Italy , Germany , Sweden , Australia , New Zealand . TrialNet dedicate test new approach prevention early intervention type 1 diabetes . The goal TrialNet Natural History Study Development Type 1 Diabetes enhance understand demographic , immunologic , metabolic characteristic individual risk develop type 1 diabetes . The Natural History Study screen relative people type 1 diabetes identify risk develop disease . Relatives people type 1 diabetes 5 % percent chance positive antibody associate diabetes . TrialNet identify adult child risk develop diabetes test presence antibody blood . A positive antibody test early indication damage insulin-secreting cell may begin . If test positive , additional testing offer determine likelihood person may develop diabetes . Individuals antibody offer opportunity test determine risk develop diabetes next 5 year receive close monitoring development diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Pathway Prevention Study conduct two part : - Screening - Monitoring ( annual semi-annual depend risk ) In Screening , simple blood test do screen presence diabetes-related biochemical autoantibody ( GAD , IA-2A , mIAA ) . Islet cell autoantibody ( ICA ) ZnT8A also measure individual positive one biochemical autoantibody . Participants go TrialNet Clinical Center , Affiliate , request screen kit blood drawn local physician laboratory . Participants provide screen result within 4-6 week . If autoantibody present initially confirm repeat testing , participant invite additional testing baseline monitoring visit determine average risk develop diabetes next 5 year . The baseline monitoring visit include Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) , re-testing biochemical islet cell autoantibody need , measurement HbA1c , HLA ( genetic ) typing . Individuals less 3 % average risk ask come follow-up annual basis ; individual great average 32 % risk ask come follow-up visit semi-annual basis . Participants monitor possible progression towards type 1 diabetes may offer opportunity enter prevention study ( e.g. , Oral Insulin prevention study ) early treatment study diagnose type 1 diabetes participate Natural History Study .</detailed_description>
