	<brief_summary>This study examine safety drug interferon beta 1a patient acute ischemic stroke determine high dose patient tolerate without serious side effect determine best way give medication . Ischemic stroke cause blood clot block flow blood brain tissue , cause loss impairment bodily function govern affected part brain . Interferon beta 1a approve use patient multiple sclerosis prevent brain injury cause inflammation ; drug may also help prevent brain injury patient acute stroke . Patients 18 85 year age stroke begin take study drug within 24 hour onset stroke symptom may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination neurological examination , blood test , electrocardiogram , brain imaging magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Participants randomly assign receive either interferon beta 1a placebo ( inactive substance ) . For every five patient enrol , four receive study drug one receive placebo . The dose interferon beta 1a increase successive group patient , first group enter study receive 11 microgram ( mcg ) drug , next receive 22 mcg , 44 mcg , 66 mcg , 88 mcg . All patient receive first dose intravenously ( vein ) ; additional dos give subcutaneously ( skin ) . During hospital stay participant receive standard medical care stroke , neurological check every 6 hour , continuous heart monitoring . To prevent fever , receive medication , Tylenol , dose interferon beta 1a placebo every 6 hour need take study drug . Routine blood test do 3 7 day first dose study drug ( discharge patient leave hospital 7 day ) 14 , 21 , 28 day . Neurological examination do 24 hour start study medication , every day 14 day , day 28 . After discharge hospital , patient see nurse every day foan 14 day first medication dose . They contact phone day 17 21 . On day 28 return hospital outpatient neurological assessment blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Recombinant human interferon beta-1a ( IFN-Beta1a ) FDA approve treatment patient relapse remit multiple sclerosis , safety profile well characterize . The action IFN-Beta1a inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine prevent blood brain barrier disruption suggest therapeutic potential ischemic stroke , recent experimental evidence support effect . This study first clinical trial exposure patient acute stroke IFN-Beta1a . The purpose study investigate safety IFN-Beta1a ( Rebif ( Registered Trademark ) ) patient acute ischemic stroke . Study Population : Patients age 18-85 year probable definite acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome within 24 hour onset study . Design : This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled sequential dose escalation , phase 1 trial . Five dose cohort 5 patient ( 4:1 active : placebo ) study 11 mcg , 22 mcg , 44 mcg , 66 mcg 88 mcg administer daily 7 day . The first dose administer intravenously subsequent dos administer subcutaneously . Patients pre-medicated prevent fever , common complication interferon treatment , since fever may worsen stroke outcome . Patients monitor adverse event neurological outcome 28 day onset treatment . Data review ongoing fashion data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) . Dose escalation continuous unless drug-related toxicity reach predetermine level one dose-limiting adverse event ( 1 4 treat ) within dose cohort , case second cohort 5 patient ( 4:1 ) treat dose . The study terminate dose level 2 4 3 8 patient active treatment severe dose limit toxicity plan dose cohort complete . Outcome Measures : Expected , common toxicity IFN-Beta1a treatment flu-like symptom ( e.g. , fever , myalgia , headache , fatigue ) injection site reaction . With long term administration liver function abnormality leukopenia may occur also monitor . Toxicity grade accord NCI criterion well study specific criterion define section 7a . Dose limit toxicity consider serious adverse event grade 3 toxicity judge probably definitely relate study medication grade 4 5 toxicity judge possibly , probably definitely relate study medication predefined study specific criterion . Serum level IFN-Beta1a serum marker IFN-Beta1a activity measure characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics IFN-Beta 1a acute stroke patient .</detailed_description>
