	<brief_title>Carboplatin Plus Cetuximab Treatment Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer second common cancer diagnose gender United States . Approximately 173,770 new case estimate 2004 . It lead cause cancer death men woman , approximately 160,440 death estimate 2004 . Prognosis many poor diagnose early stage , therapy advance disease limit . The study test carboplatin combination newly approve drug call cetuximab , continue tested colorectal cancer cancer . Cetuximab monoclonal antibody , believe work attach epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tumor cell thereby block tumor cell reproduce . It antibody EGFR . Fifty percent lung cancer overexpress EGFR . Rationale : The present study build upon data describe study , incorporate cetuximab regimen single-agent carboplatin . Previous data suggest single agent carboplatin active NSCLC . The addition biologic therapy anti-EGFR agent cetuximab carboplatin presumably maximize therapeutic index keep toxicity minimum patient Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC . Research Hypothesis : The population study trial subject previously untreated Stage IIIB IV NSCLC . The research hypothesis subject achieve response ( base RECIST criterion ) therapy combination carboplatin cetuximab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible study , subject must fulfill follow criterion . Subjects must sign approve informed consent . Subjects histologically cytologically document stage IIIB ( supraclavicular lymph node , high neck node , pleural effusion involvement ) IV NSCLC . Disease must newly diagnose recurrent least 1 year post adjuvant therapy . Subjects measurable disease . Subjects ECOG performance status 01 . If diagnostic tissue slide available subject , must submit test EGFR status . Subjects asymptomatic brain metastasis eligible ; however , must complete radiotherapy/radiosurgery least 2 week prior enrollment . Radiotherapy must complete &gt; 2 week prior enrollment subject must recover adverse effect prior radiotherapy . No previous irradiation area measurable disease . New lesion develop previously irradiate area allow . Subjects ≥18 year age . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 4 week study manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal [ define amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive month ; woman hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35mIU/mL ] . Even woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) , consider child bear potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start study medication . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Subjects adequate hematologic function define : ANC ≥1,500/mm 3 ; WBC ≥3,000/mm 3 ; platelet ≥100,000/mm 3 ; hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL . Subjects adequate hepatic function define : total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ≤2.5 x ULN . Subjects adequate renal function define serum creatinine level ≤1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/minute . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any following criterion make subject ineligible participate study : WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 4 week study . Subjects men must also agree use effective contraception . WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method . Women pregnant breastfeed Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration . Subjects prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer subject diseasefree 5 year . Subjects significant history cardiac disease , i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction , myocardial infarction within past year , cardiac ventricular arrythmias require medication . Subjects uncontrolled seizure disorder , active neurological disease . Subjects symptomatic brain metastasis . Prohibited Therapies and/or Medications Subjects receive prior systemic chemotherapy . Subjects one prior adjuvant regimen initially diagnose disease eligible study . Subjects history prior cetuximab therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . Subject prior severe reaction monoclonal antibody . Subjects prior erythropoietin ( i.e. , Epogen , Procrit ) treatment Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness must enrol study .</criteria>
