	<brief_summary>This study determine safety effectiveness drug Replagal treat people Fabry disease , inherit metabolic disorder . In disease , enzyme call alpha-galactosidase A , normally break lipid ( fatty substance ) know ceramidetrihexoside , miss function properly . As result , lipid accumulates body , cause problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . This study examine whether replace miss alpha-galactosidase A genetically engineer form enzyme call Replagal reverse illness . Patients Fabry disease 18 year age older complete 10 week Replagal therapy participant protocol TKT027 may eligible 6-month study extension . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Intravenous ( IV ) infusion Replagal every week 25 week total 13 infusion , close monitoring infusion . - Brief safety evaluation time infusion , include check vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature ) , review side effect , review medication . - Comprehensive evaluation baseline ( start Replagal therapy ) , 13 25 week therapy , 30 day complete therapy . These include medical history physical examination , symptom pain questionnaire , blood urine test , check vital sign , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , 2-hour Holter monitor , sweat test ( QSART ) .</brief_summary>
