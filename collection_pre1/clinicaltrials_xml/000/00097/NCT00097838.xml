	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response HIV-1 Subtype C Vaccine ( AVX101 ) HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-1 subtype C prevail subtype HIV find sub-Saharan Africa primarily responsible HIV/AIDS epidemic southern Africa . Thus , development preventive subtype C vaccine critically important control spread HIV part world . This study determine safety immunogenicity alphavirus replicon HIV-1 subtype C gag vaccine , AVX101 , HIV uninfected adult . This vaccine utilize propagation-defective replicon vector system derive attenuated strain Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis ( VEE ) virus . The vaccine replicon express gag gene South African subtype C isolate HIV-1 . Participants recruit United States , South Africa , Botswana . The study last 1 year . Participants enrol sequentially , low high dose vaccine , one four group . Groups begin enrollment follow safety review previous group . Participants randomly assign receive active vaccine placebo . During study , participant receive either 3 injection one four possible dos vaccine 3 injection placebo . Injections give study entry Days 28 84 . At screen , participant undergo medical history assessment , complete physical , HIV test counseling , blood urine collection ; also interview ask complete questionnaire . After screen , 8 study visit ; visit occur Days 14 , 28 , 42 , 84 , 98 , 168 , 273 , 364 . Participants interview ask fill questionnaire study visit ; participant undergo physical , additional HIV test counseling , blood urine collection select visit .</detailed_description>
