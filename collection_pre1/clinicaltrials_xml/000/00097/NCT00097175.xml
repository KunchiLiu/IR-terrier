	<brief_summary>This study investigate brain process emotion healthy people patient major depression order well understand cause depression . It examine happen brain person respond word relate different emotion brain 's ability manufacture chemical call serotonin reduce . Serotonin regulate function emotion , anxiety sleep , stress hormone cortisol . In study , participant ' serotonin level reduce deplete tryptophan , amino acid main building block serotonin . Healthy volunteer patient major depression remission least 3 month may eligible study . Candidates must 18 50 year age right-handed . They interview medical psychiatric history , current emotional state sleep pattern , family history psychiatric disorder . Screening also include psychiatric interview rating scale , neuropsychological test , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood , urine , saliva test . Women menstrual phase determine blood test home urine ovulation test kit . The study involve two clinic visit participant undergo tryptophan depletion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Subjects arrive NIH Clinical Center morning fast overnight . They fill questionnaire blood sample drawn , take 74 capsule contain mixture amino acid find diet . At one visit give capsule contain balanced mixture amino acid one would normally eat day ; visit , capsule contain lactose instead tryptophan , cause tryptophan depletion . At 2 p.m. participant fill questionnaire complete begin day another blood sample drawn . Then computerized test MRI scanner . MRI use magnet radio wave obtain picture brain . For test , subject lie narrow bed slide cylindrical MRI scanner . They ask press button response word associate different emotion appear screen . Arterial spin label - test use magnetism measure blood flow different area brain-is also do procedure . After scan , subject eat meal return home . DNA participant ' blood sample also examine try good understand genetic cause depression . Some white cell sample may also grow laboratory additional study do later .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Tryptophan Depletion Brain Processing Emotions Patients With Mood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) associate abnormally reduce function central serotonergic system various type evidence . One instructive paradigm investigate relationship serotonergic function , cognition depression involve mood response tryptophan depletion ( TD ) , achieve oral load essential amino acid except 5-HT precursor , tryptophan . Subjects depress show altered behavioral neural response affectively valenced stimulus , similar see TD . More , specifically , increase response latency happy word note depressed patient healthy control follow TD use Affective Go/No go ( AGNG ) test , subject require either respond inhibit response series emotionally valenced word . The first round study employ fMRI image BOLD response arterial spin label investigate response affectively valenced word TD two group , remit MDD ( rMDD ) patient healthy control family history depression . We thus far examined effect TD depletion healthy control group . We find emotional information process indeed alter 5-HT depletion . A behavioral bias toward positive stimulus attenuate follow depletion , accompany increased hemodynamic response process emotional word several subcortical structure , include ventral striatum , hippocampal cortex , anterior insula , superior temporal gyrus posterior cingulate . Further , inter-individual difference tryptophan depletion-elicited anxiety correlate positively caudate bias toward negative stimulus . On basis data , suggest bias towards positive stimulus might represent normal suppression attention negative stimulus ; process abrogate condition , depression , characterize serotonergic dysfunction . In second round study , examine whether bias also occur beneath level conscious awareness . One weaknesses data patient consciously aware verbal stimulus present likely posse learn , individualized association verbal stimuli question . We develop condition task obviates problem presentation emotionally-valenced visual stimulus threshold conscious awareness . Since embark first two phase study , new paradigm develop may provide insight affective behavioral bias . The Split Reversals task pavlovian reversal-learning task allow assessment response expect unexpected punishment reward cue . Previous research task demonstrate reduction serotonin healthy individual remove disproportionate inability predict punishment baseline . In word , serotonin reduction remove positive bias task . . This consistent observe removal positive bias AGNG follow TD . However , split reversal task positive bias reveal inability process negative stimulus baseline , improve , rather bias towards positive stimulus diminish , TD . As , new task provide different direction consider emotional bias observe affective disorder . We suggest bias new task reflect serotonin-mediated suppression response negative stimulus healthy individual , turn , promote resilience affective disorder . Serotonin reduction via TD hence remove bias . That task may therefore sensitive cognitive bias result resilience mechanism . Similarly , fear potentiate startle show sensitive symptom anxiety show reduced elevation 5-HT via two week citalopram treatment . This consistent reduce process negative information follow 5-HT increase ( Grillon et al 2009 ) . We predict reduce 5-HT via TD opposite effect increase duration fear potentiate startle processing . This would provide indirect link reduce 5-HT anxiety disorder . As , include task new phase protocol . In addition behavioural TD finding , task neuroimaged ( fMRI ) healthy individual . As predicted , striatum show involved reward processing , whilst amygdala show involved punishment processing . A subproject study therefore attempt extend prior finding split reversal task ( reconcile AGNG finding ) examine healthy individual complete task whilst undergo serotonin manipulation ( TD ) fMRI . This subproject initially restrict healthy individual provide u insight neural substrate involve serotonergic inhibition aversive processing highlight first phase study . This also provide basis consider potential future study task MDD subject undergoing TD . There may well genetic basis phenomenon . It known functional variant promoter region serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTTLPR ) partly responsible determine individual respond TD . In fact , recently report carrier short 5-HTTLPR allele show impaired recognition fearful face follow TD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers Righthanded subject ( age 1850 ) select meet criterion major psychiatric disorder , know firstdegree relative mood disorder , current score Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 17 item ) depress range ( 7 ) . Control subject match depressed subject relatives age , gender , education . MDD Samples Righthanded subject ( age 1850 ) select past history MDD DSMIV criterion . Healthy Relatives Healthy , righthanded , firstdegree relative patient MDD recruit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must take antidepressant drug least 3 month ( 4 month fluoxetine ) prior fMRI study medication likely alter monoamine neurochemistry cerebrovascular cardiovascular function least 3 week prior image . However , effective medication discontinue purpose study . Subjects also exclude : 1 . Psychosis 2 . Medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy , i.e . hypertension , cardiovascular disorder 3 . A history drug ( include benzodiazepine ( BZD ) ) abuse within 1 year lifetime history drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) 4 . A history alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) 5 . Current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test screening day challenge study ) 6 . Current breast feeding 7 . Are smoker 8 . Serious suicidal ideation behavior . In study , small risk transient depressive symptom occur ingest amino acid mixture . Therefore , volunteer manifest evidence serious suicidal ideation behavior , exclude participating . Criteria meeting suicidal ideation include limit : 1 ) thought suicide within past 3 month accompany intent harm oneself , serious consideration mean plan attempt suicide , evidence arrange suicide attempt ( e.g . give away prize possession update ) , clear desire commit suicide , 2 ) severity past suicide event , applicable 3 ) current plan harm . All assessment conduct experienced , NIMH credentialed health professional , psychiatrist psychiatric nurse use expert knowledge experience determine authenticity participant information handle situation accordingly . 9 . General MRI exclusion criterion Subjects must exhibit moderate alcohol use . Subjects current previous regular use ( great 4 week ) BZDs excessive use alcohol ( great 8 ounces/day men great 6 ounces/day woman ) past present ineligible participation , drug use may confound result . Smokers ( regular use within last 3 month ) ineligible evidence interaction nicotine depression , possibility withdrawal symptom may affect behavioral neural response TD . Subjects beyond age 50 exclude address biological heterogeneity encompass MDD criterion , since depressive whose ageatonset later 50 far great likelihood MRI correlate cerebrovascular disease agematched healthy control agematched earlyonset depressive . Subjects whose first major depressive episode arise temporally medical psychiatric condition also exclude , since functional imaging result generally differ report primary MDD .</criteria>
