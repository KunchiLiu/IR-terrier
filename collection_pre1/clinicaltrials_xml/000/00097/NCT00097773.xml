	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) chronic disease significantly affect individual 's lung function . Antibiotic medication proven effective reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) infection , one main cause death individual CF . The purpose study compare effectiveness treatment base quarterly culture result versus consistent quarterly antibiotic treatment reduce PA infection child CF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Treatment Regimens Reduce PA Infection Children With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CF inherit disease cause mucus build lung digestive tract , cause lung infection digestive problem . It common type chronic lung disease child young adult may result early death . There cure disease . The primary cause death individual CF progressive obstructive pulmonary disease associate chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) infection . PA infection occur early life become highly resistant antibiotic . Once individual diagnose chronic PA infection , almost impossible manage effectively . The need exist effective treatment control eliminate PA infection . Past research show PA infection treat early , great likelihood may eliminate completely . This study examine two treatment regimen compare effective eliminate PA infection . In first regimen , participant receive antibiotic treatment various time throughout study , base finding PA respiratory culture obtain quarterly basis . In second regimen , participant receive antibiotic medication consistent , quarterly cycle throughout study . The antibiotic medication use study ciprofloxacin inhale tobramycin , administer nebulizer . Both medication prove effective treat bacterial lung infection . The overall purpose study compare effectiveness culture-based treatment versus consistent treatment reduce PA infection child CF . This 18-month study enroll child CF . For first 28 day study , participant receive inhale tobramycin . For initial 14 day 28-day period , half participant also receive either ciprofloxacin placebo . If respiratory culture three week treatment confirm presence PA , participant receive tobramycin additional 28 day . Participants randomly assign one four treatment option : tobramycin placebo six consecutive quarterly cycle ; tobramycin ciprofloxacin six consecutive quarterly cycle ; tobramycin placebo PA find quarterly respiratory culture ; tobramycin ciprofloxacin PA find quarterly respiratory culture . At first study visit , participant undergo physical examination , chest x-ray , review medical history . Lung function measure via spirometry ( child great four year age able perform spirometry ) , hear ability measure via audiometry ( select site ) . Blood drawn laboratory test , specimen obtain respiratory culture . Subsequent study visit take place Day 21 , Weeks 10 , 22 , 34 , 46 , 58 , 70 . At visit , participant undergo physical examination spirometry test ( appropriate ) , respiratory specimen PA culture blood collect . Participants require maintain medication diary throughout study , contact visit review medication adherence test result .</detailed_description>
