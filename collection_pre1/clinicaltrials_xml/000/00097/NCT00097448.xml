	<brief_summary>This trial aim compare efficacy oral prednisone vs. methylprednisolone inject middle ear treatment moderate-to-severe , sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( inner ear hearing loss affect one ear occur less 72 hour ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sudden Deafness Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden deafness believe affect 1:5000 people yearly . The cause unknown . Spontaneous improvement see approximately 20 % subject . Improvement see approximately 60 % subject treat promptly oral corticosteroid . Anecdotal case report uncontrolled case series suggest intratympanic corticosteroid may work well well oral treatment . The risk oral prednisone well-known . In theory , intratympanic treatment achieve high drug concentration target ( inner ear ) less risk systemic side effect . This study head-to-head comparison oral prednisone vs. intratympanic methylprednisolone primary treatment idiopathic sudden deafness . The study design non-inferiority trial test hypothesis intratympanic methylprednisolone inferior oral prednisone treatment . Subjects assign oral treatment arm receive 14 day high dose prednisone ( 60mg/day ) follow 5-day taper . Subjects assign intratympanic treatment arm receive 4 dos methylprednisolone inject middle twice weekly two week . The primary outcome measure hearing measure pure tone audiometry . Secondary outcome include word recognition hearing level safety issue local vs. systemic steroid side-effects pain .</detailed_description>
