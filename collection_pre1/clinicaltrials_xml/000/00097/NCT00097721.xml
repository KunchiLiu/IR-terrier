	<brief_title>A Study E7389 Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine response rate ( RR ) E7389 monotherapy administer IV bolus 1.4 mg/m^2 Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-Day cycle Days 1 8 21-day cycle patient advanced/metastatic breast cancer treat chemotherapy include anthracycline taxane , previously document progression within six month follow last dose prior chemotherapy . The secondary objective evaluate : - The safety tolerability E7389 monotherapy patient population ; - The antitumor activity E7389 determine duration response , time progression , overall survival ; - Quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast ( FACT-B ) questionnaire/tumor-related symptom improvement worsen measure pain intensity visual analog scale ( VAS ) , analgesics consumption , weight change performance status ( PS ) ; - Tumor pharmacogenetics possible relationship response ( assessment beta-tubulin isotype mRNA biopsy sample ) patient sign separate consent form</detailed_description>

If single lesion identify target lesion , cytological histological confirmation breast carcinoma require . Patients must prior treatment anthracycline taxane ( either sequential combination ) may prior treatment agent well . Patients must progress within six month last dose chemotherapy , experience disease progression receive chemotherapy advanced/metastatic disease .
