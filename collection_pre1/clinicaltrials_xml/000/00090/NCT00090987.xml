	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response patient HIV-related Kaposi 's sarcoma treat imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Determine inhibition platelet-derived growth factor receptor , determine immunohistochemistry , patient treat drug . - Determine cytokine profile treatment drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug antiretrovirals patient . - Determine mechanism primary secondary resistance drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily . Treatment continue 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
