	<brief_summary>Regular exercise reduces risk heart problem , part improve work endothelium ( cell line blood vessel ) . Exercise appear release precursor cell bone marrow later become endothelial cell . A molecule call nitric oxide ( NO ) appear involved release . However , heart patient improve endothelial function despite regular exercise . The researcher believe heart disease patient may interfere normal relationship exercise endothelial function . This study design test whether give patient nitroglycerin ( convert NO bloodstream ) increase release endothelial precursor cell bone marrow . If study succeed , may lead improved healing artery heart disease patient . Adults may eligible study coronary artery disease take nitroglycerin nitroglycerin-like medication daily basis . Volunteers admit Clinical Center 2 separate night least 1 week apart . On morning admission , volunteer blood draw arm vein laboratory test , walk treadmill fatigue discomfort prevents exercise , ask stop . On one admission , volunteer receive 1 tablet nitroglycerin tongue shortly treadmill test . Volunteers monitor EKGs blood pressure test treadmill test , blood drawn 15 minute 24 hour treadmill test . Researchers examine level endothelial precursor cell nitric oxide blood sample take exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise training long recommend mean improve cardiac function reduce morbidity mortality patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . One mechanism benefit may improve endothelial function enhance nitric oxide ( NO ) bioactivity , may improve blood flow exercise skeletal muscle myocardium . We recently determine collaborative study Suburban Hospital , however , many CAD patient show improved endothelial function despite compliant participation three month cardiac rehabilitation program exercise three time weekly . The initial data study suggest improvement endothelial function may dependent release endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) bone marrow circulation response stimulus repetitive exercise , potential repair damage endothelium improve endothelial function NO release . Thus , patient poor EPC mobilization response exercise may limit capacity improve endothelial function time , conversely , patient higher EPC mobilization response exercise may show improved endothelial function result vascular repair . Animal model indicate NO necessary EPC mobilization exercise , likely nitrosation reaction key signal protein within bone marrow . In many CAD patient , NO release endothelium transport blood bone marrow may compromise atherosclerotic vascular disease , thus limit EPC mobilization vascular repair . We hypothesize exogenous administration NO CAD patient may enhance EPC mobilization bone marrow response exercise . If successful , administration NO donor ( nitroglycerin ) prior exercise may extend benefit exercise endothelial function-and thus cardiovascular risk-in large segment CAD patient participate cardiac rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
