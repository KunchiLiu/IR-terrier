	<brief_summary>This study examine role serotonin function brain . Serotonin , one brain 's natural chemical , connects receptor brain cell regulate emotion , anxiety , sleep , stress hormone , body function disturb various mood anxiety disorder . Also , research look function particular brain area , involve regulating emotion , serotonin involve regulation function . The procedure entail tryptophan depletion magnetic resonance imagining ( MRI ) . Also , researcher ' understanding genetic cause mood anxiety disorder increase examination participant ' DNA . Adults good health , age 20 50 , may eligible study . Among eligible female pregnant breast feeding , patient psychiatric central nervous system disease , take medication would interfere study result . At first visit , patient ask general mood , degree nervousness , think skill , behavior . The session last 1.5 2.0 hour . A blood sample 2 tablespoon draw , DNA study . Participants undergo follow procedure test : - Physical examination . - Test vital sign , lie stand . - Electrocardiogram . - Collection blood chemistry hematology . - Urinalysis . - HIV , urine drug , hepatitis screening . - Psychiatric screening . - ( SqrRoot ) -HCG pregnancy test , applicable . At second visit , patient receive either tryptophan depletion placebo , 5 hour later , study begin , last 2 additional hour . Patients ask periodically emotional state change well-being . The MRI system create image brain 's blood flow measure glucose metabolism measure brain activity . During MRI scan , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask move machine time . The MRI session last 1.5 hour . Results medical test information provide participant , research may need result meaningful . But meaningful information develop study may important participant 's health , notify becomes available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Role Serotonin Emotional Processing Through Use Tryptophan Depletion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The goal protocol use target serotonergic manipulation [ acute tryptophan depletion ( ATD ) ] specific neurocognitive neuroimaging paradigm consider role serotonin ( 5-HT ) emotional processing . In particular , wish evaluate claim serotonin role effective processing aversive signal . Additionally , wish examine whether tryptophan depletion attenuate neural response aversive material . Study population Healthy human adult volunteer , age 20-50 year old , DSM-IV-defined Axis I mental disease fulfill remainder inclusion/exclusion criterion . Design This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose , outpatient study eligible , healthy volunteer . Participants randomly assign 1:1 ratio single dos drug ( ATD ) placebo . The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center Pharmacy facilitate randomization supply randomization code Clinical Center Metabolic Nutrition Department ( see ) . All subject monitor adverse event . Participants give write , informed consent prior assessment procedure cover protocol . The study conduct NIH Clinical Center 5SW Day Hospital NMRF center ( image arm study ) . Subjects arrive morning test day complete baseline measurement ( i.e. , mood anxiety rating serum tryptophan level ) . Participants receive oral dose ATD capsule placebo . Participants consume two meal study day ; placebo group ( control subject ) give high-tryptophan meal tryptophan-depleted subject receive low-tryptophan meal . Meals design supply NIH Clinical Center Metabolic Nutrition Department . At specified time , subject complete primary measure [ either neurocognitive neuroimaging ( fMRI ) paradigm ] secondary measure ( mood anxiety rating serum level tryptophan ) detail protocol . Adverse event monitor throughout study day . A post-study evaluation occur prior discharge participant verify he/she physically mentally well fit leave Clinical Center . Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures : - Neurocognitive Paradigms : Behavioral measure include reaction time accuracy - Neuroimaging Paradigms : Blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) response Secondary Outcome Measurements : - Serum tryptophan level - Mood Anxiety Rating Scales</detailed_description>
