	<brief_summary>This study screen patient eligibility study sponsor Craniofacial Genetics Section ( HCGS ) , Clinical Research Core ( CRC ) , branch locate within National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research ( NIDCR ) . It also evaluate patient disease abnormality oral cavity craniofacial complex , , future protocol development . HCGS CRC study natural history oral disease systemic disease manifest maxillofacial region-the upper jaw face . Among disease lichen planus , systemic lupus erythematosus , premalignant oral leukoplakia . Researchers also study certain acquired disease genetic disease . Because many disease maxillofacial region poorly define , evaluation characterization patient diseases goal investigation . Patients age , gender , racial ethnic group oral disease systemic disease upper jaw face may eligible study . Women childbearing potential , pregnant lactating , may eligible ; would undergo procedure test receive medication pose minimal risk fetus child . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Complete medical history physical examination , include thorough examination head neck ; detail examination teeth gum may may necessary . - Tests blood , urine , stool ; test pregnancy HIV need ; test culture , fungi , bacteria , parasite . - Sampling blood oral tissue diagnosis , treatment response , disease progression . - Electrocardiogram , x-ray , imaging procedure , include image face . Biopsies may perform needed diagnosis guide therapy . The type , number , location , frequency biopsy depend several factor , include nature disease evaluate . Local anesthesia typically use unless contraindication . Some biopsy do disposable , 2 3 mm , round , sharp metal punch . Larger excision use appropriate blade may necessary proper evaluation patient 's condition complete removal something abnormal . The risk discomfort associate intervention include mild pain , bleeding , infection ; may temporary facial paralysis , bruising , allergic reaction . Supportive care give need , accord patient 's diagnosis , treatment , clinical information . Disease-related drug-related complication , , manage collaboration patient 's refer physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Research Core Dental Screening Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical research protocol twofold : 1 ) screen patient protocol eligibility sponsor primarily Craniofacial Genetics Section , Clinical Research Core Branches locate within National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research ( NIDCR ) appropriate 2 ) evaluate patient diseases abnormality oral cavity and/or craniofacial complex future protocol development . Patients enrol protocol evaluate treat accord standard procedure therapeutic modality . No procedure do research . Standard experimental biochemical , genetic proteomic test may conduct tissue blood sample collect diagnosis . Eligible patient refer appropriate NIDCR clinical research protocols protocol-driven diagnostic workup therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients age , gender , racial/ethnic group oral disease systemic disease maxillofacial manifestation mission relevant Craniofacial Genetics Section , Clinical Research Core branch locate within NIDCR . Women childbearing potential , pregnant lactate undergo test procedure , and/or receive medication data exists prove minimal risk fetus and/or child . Only diagnosis without radiograph perform . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients significant cognitive impairment . Pregnant patient lactate patient , status precludes propose diagnostic procedure therapy know untoward effect mother and/or child .</criteria>
