	<brief_title>Nine Month Course Anti-HIV Medications People Recently Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy result significantly decrease morbidity mortality , incidence opportunistic infection , hospitalization HIV infect people . However , long-term toxicity associate long-term use antiretrovirals persistence virus latent reservoir , unclear best initiate therapy recently infect individual . This study compare virologic outcome adult recently infect HIV receive emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) , coformulated Truvada , lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) , coformulated Kaletra [ immediate treatment ( IT arm ) ] , receive treatment [ defer treatment ( DT arm ) ] . The original study last 96 week . Participants randomly assign one two group ( IT arm vs. DT arm ) . For first 36 week study , IT arm participant receive FTC/TDF daily LPV/RTV twice daily . Some IT arm participant receive different ART regimen determine participant study staff , appropriate . DT arm participant receive treatment duration study . At Week 37 , participant arm offer treatment continuation initiation Week 96 high viral load , low CD4 count , experience HIV-related symptom ( Step 2 ) . Study visit occur screening , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 40 , every 4 week thereafter . Clinical assessment blood collection occur visit . Urine test occur select visit . Participants ask complete adherence questionnaire Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 . Per recommendation DSMB review June 2009 , protocol terminate originally write exception participant IT arm middle first 36 week treatment . Those participant continue treatment end 36 week . At point treatment decision make best practice guideline . In addition , study duration extend include 5 year follow participant initiate long-term antiretroviral therapy ( Step 3 ) . The study review SMC December 8 , 2010 . The SMC recommend study close long term follow-up participant enrol portion study . All result except CD4 analysis time treatment initiation death base database frozen July 2 , 2009 . The result CD4 analysis time treatment initiation death base database frozen January 30 , 2012 .</detailed_description>
