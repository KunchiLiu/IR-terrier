	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pulmonary rehabilitation education exercise training may improve physical function quality life patient receive treatment lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study pulmonary rehabilitation education exercise training see well work compare exercise train alone improve physical function quality life patient undergo chemotherapy radiation therapy locally advanced lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0229 , Pulmonary Rehabilitation Education w/wo Exercise Training Improving Physical Function Patients Who Are Undergoing Chemo &amp; RT Locally Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare improvement physiologic function , term exercise tolerance , patient inoperable locally advanced lung cancer undergo chemoradiotherapy randomize pulmonary rehabilitation comprise education v without supervised exercise training . - Compare health-related quality life , term multidimensional functioning patient perception respiratory difficulty , patient undergo pulmonary rehabilitation intervention . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Zubrod performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) ; FEV_1 ( ≥ 70 % predict vs &lt; 70 % predict ) ; smoke status* ( never smoke former smoker v current smoker ) . Approximately 20 week treatment SWOG-S0023 , patient randomize 1 2 intervention arm . NOTE : * Never smoke define &lt; 100 cigarette lifetime former smoker define smoke ≥ 1 year . - Arm I : Patients participate supervise structured exercise program ( i.e. , walk treadmill OR use stationary exercise bicycle ) 3 time week 12 week . Patients also receive educational material improve breathe conserve energy . - Arm II : Patients receive educational material arm I . In arm , patient undergo exercise test use 6-minute walk measure exercise tolerance initial evaluation ( randomization prior intervention ) , 12 week , 6 9 month . In arm , intervention continue absence disease progression development medical condition would preclude study participation . Quality life assess baseline , 12 week , 6 9 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 164 patient ( 82 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
