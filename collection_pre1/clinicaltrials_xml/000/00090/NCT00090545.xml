	<brief_summary>BAY 43-9006 ( Sorafenib ) experimental cancer drug produce Bayer Health Care Corporation . It represent new class anticancer agent know bi-aryl urea . This study investigate effect prostate cancer side effect . Researchers expect enroll maximum 46 men prostate cancer study . The duration study depend result . Before begin take drug , patient admit hospital 2 day , medical examination give blood sample , tumor bone marrow biopsy . On first day study , patient begin take drug 2 tablet twice daily , morning evening . Blood take throughout day determine drug 's level bloodstream . Patients discharge hospital second day , continue take drug twice daily instruct stop . During first 4 week , patient require blood pressure check . At end first 4 week , patient physical examination blood test , well second tumor bone marrow biopsy . After first 4 week , patient continue drug regimen . At end 4-week cycle , patient physical examination blood test . Patients also x-Rays , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRIs ) every 4-week examination require . Patients ask keep diary recording time amount medication study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study BAY 43-9006 ( Sorafenib ) Metastatic , Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BAY 43-9006 ( Sorafenib ) potent inhibitor wild-type mutant b-Raf c-Raf kinase isoforms vitro . In addition , agent also inhibit p38 , c-kit , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFR-beta ) affect tumor growth well possibly promote apoptosis event downstream c-Raf . At time , 500 patient treated drug tolerable side effect . The primary objective study determine BAY 43-9006 ( Sorafenib ) associate 50 % 4 month probability progression free survival patient metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) determine clinical , radiographic , prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) criterion . The secondary objective study demonstration biologic effect drug patient tumor ( possible ) . Correlative study conduct serially obtain tissue biopsy , bone marrow biopsy , white blood cell collection . These laboratory correlate include elucidation activation component Raf-extracellular-signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) -methyl ethyl ketone ( MEK ) angiogenesis pathway use protein microarray technology develop National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) /Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clinical proteomics program . Per Amendment D , secondary objective study also determine time progression measure clinical radiographic criterion . The 22 patient treat first stage protocol retrospectively evaluate respect secondary endpoint possible . Please refer statistic section detail . The combination correlate clinical laboratory endpoint emphasis molecular signal provide new information anti-tumor effect help characterize role treatment androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must histopathological confirmation prostate cancer Laboratory Pathology National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Pathology Department National Naval Medical Center prior enter study . Patients whose pathology specimens longer available may enrol trial patient clinical course consistent prostate cancer available documentation outside pathology laboratory diagnosis . In case original tissue block archival biopsy material available , effort make material forward research team use correlative study . Patients must metastatic progressive androgenindependent prostate cancer . There must radiographic evidence disease primary treatment either surgery radiotherapy continue progress despite hormonal agent . Progression require measurable lesion expand , new lesion appear , and/or prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) continue rise successive measurement . Patients flutamide must disease progression least 4 week withdrawal . Patients bicalutamide nilutamide must progression least 6 week withdrawal . Patients may 1 previous cytoxic chemotherapeutic line . Because dose adverse event data currently available use BAY 439006 ( Sorafenib ) patient le 18 year age , child exclude study . Patients must life expectancy 3 month . Patients must performance status 0 2 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) criterion . Patient must adequate organ function define : Leukocytes great equal 3,000/microL Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR : Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity less equal grade 1 return baseline . Hormonal profile : patient undergone bilateral surgical castration must continue suppression testosterone production appropriate usage gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist . Patients must invasive malignancy ( within past two year exception nonmelanoma skin cancer noninvasive bladder cancer ) . Patients must able understand sign inform consent form . Concurrent use bisphosphonates allow patient know bone metastasis Patients require hematopoietic growth factor support ( e.g . epogen , darbepoetin ) , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , maintenance medication prior study entry allow continue supportive therapy . The effect BAY 439006 ( Sorafenib ) develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason Rafkinase inhibitor know teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence ; hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy ( include radioisotope ) within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , great 3 month suramin ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition BAY 439006 ( Sorafenib ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Hypertension define systolic blood pressure excess 170 mmHg diastolic pressure excess 100 mmHg . Patients history hypertension well control medication exclude . Patients may either verapamil diltiazem study . Use calcium channel blocker discourage . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction BAY 439006 ( Sorafenib ) . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History bleed diathesis Patients therapeutic anticoagulation increase risk bleed BAY 439006 ( Sorafenib ) . Prophylactic anticoagulation ( i.e . low dose warfarin ) venous arterial access device allow provided requirement prothrombin time ( PT ) , International normalize ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) meet : PT le 1.1 x institutional upper limit normal ; INR le 1.1 ; PTT within institutional limit normal . These requirement make upon patient warfarin . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES Men race ethnic group eligible trial . Women exclude nature disease .</criteria>
