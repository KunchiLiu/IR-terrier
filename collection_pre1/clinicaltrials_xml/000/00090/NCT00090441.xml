	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In recent year , number candidate genetic variant ( e.g. , single nucleotide polymorphism , SNPs ) report associated coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . However , association study suffer variability failure replication . This may result part selection marker SNPs linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) true disease-related SNPs effect-modulating genetic variant . Other issue include play chance sample limit size , population stratification artifact , small effect size single SNPs . A recent discovery genome organize largely invariant DNA fragment population level characterize infrequent recombination event intersperse `` hotspot '' recombination designate `` haplotype block '' . These haplotype block determine create dense map SNPs across gene interest analyze population level LD . A SNPs chosen designate ( `` tag '' ) haplotype block use comprehensively assess disease association across entire gene . Applying approach multiple gene pathways critical vascular health assess combination gene likely increase power discover genetic association CHD risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study establish high density SNP map across exon , splice region , 5 ' 3 ' regulatory region 6 gene play key role lipoprotein transport metabolism ( ABCA1 , CETP , LCAT , HL , LPL , SRB1 ) ; intron examine 2 gene ( CETP , LPL ) . By analyze combination haplotype-tagging ( ht ) SNPs , `` genetic burden '' score correlate CHD risk 4 level : 1 ) biomarker ( lipid/lipoprotein level ) , 2 ) anatomic ( angiographic ) CHD , 3 ) clinical outcome ( death/MI ) , 4 ) ( exploratory ) response lipid-lowering . Testing perform 3 large , distinct , complementary Utah population primary secondary risk premature CHD . Testing occur 2 stage establish reproducibility : initial screen phase follow confirmation phase ( genetic marker combination show promise ) large , independent sample . The study employ novel method combine high-throughput SNP discovery genotyping capability genetic epidemiological method identify haplotype block within surround gene interest , identify htSNPs , assess disease association individual combination htSNPs ( `` genetic burden '' ) . To , study brings large , well characterized database , assemble follow 9 year , expand current project .</detailed_description>
