	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease major cause death disability westernize society , grow importance country emerge economy . Inflammation endothelial dysfunction recognize important contributor coronary artery disease . However , genetic basis specific gene involve expression hyperinflammatory phenotype yet well-understood . Identification characterization variation candidate locus associate coronary artery disease would contribute understanding genetic basis underlie acute myocardial infarction , may provide novel pathway prevention treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This case-control study determine whether variability several gene influence inflammation endothelial dysfunction relate odds myocardial infarction ( MI ) among 700 men 229 postmenopausal woman Western New York Health Study . The study perform follow : 1 ) To test hypothesis case acute MI high frequency specific haplotypes C-reactive protein locus compose allele associate high level CRP production ( -732G/A ) , 1059G/C , +1444C/T ) match control . MI case great frequency haplotype compose allele associate high level interleukin ( IL ) production , specifically IL-6 production ( -597G/A , -572G/C , -174G/C ) control , low frequency specific haplotype IL1A/IL1 BILL1RN gene region ; 2 ) case higher frequency allele haplotypes specific functional polymorphism E-selectin gene ( 128R G98T ) control ; 3 ) utilize DNA pool strategy rapid screen large number single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) 29 candidate gene relevant biological pathway test select locus association risk acute MI ; 4 ) locus evidence association , identify haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphism ( htSNPs ) capture variation locus test association SNPs haplotypes risk MI . Secondary aim ) explore association among men premature MI ( 55 year age less ) b ) explore gene- gene gene- environment interaction . MI case subject identify hospital record review Erie Niagara county ( 95 % eligible case , ICD9 410-410.9 ) average 4 month post MI . They interview examine 1996-2001 . Control subject randomly select county ( 59.5 % response rate ) contemporaneous clinical exam . Controls individually match case age , sex , ethnicity .</detailed_description>
