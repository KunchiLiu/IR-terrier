	<brief_title>Second-Line Treatment Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective The primary objective study compare progression-free survival two treatment regimen : Taxotere® 30 mg/m2 IV Days 1 8 , combine carboplatin AUC 6 IV Day 1 , repeat every 21 day 6 cycle disease progression . ( A patient complete 6 cycle treatment achieve partial response stable disease may either continue stop treatment investigator 's discretion . ) Versus Taxotere® 30 mg/m2 IV Days 1 8 , repeat every 21 day 6 cycle disease progression . Followed carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) IV every 21 day patient achieve complete response disease progression Taxotere® . A patient achieve complete response Taxotere® follow subsequent recurrence time receive single-agent carboplatin . Carboplatin treatment discontinue patient complete 6 cycle treatment achieve complete response disease progression . ( A patient complete 6 cycle carboplatin treatment achieve partial response stable disease may either continue stop treatment investigator 's discretion . ) Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study compare objective response rate ( define complete response plus partial response ) , duration tumor response , median survival , QOL safety patient treat two regimen describe .</detailed_description>
