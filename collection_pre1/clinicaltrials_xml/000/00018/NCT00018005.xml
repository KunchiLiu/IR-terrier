	<brief_title>A Self-Management Intervention Mild Moderate Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart failure major disable disease American adult , affect estimate 4.9 million individual . Heart failure associate enormous health care expenditures . This progressive chronic condition characterize disable symptom limit independence result multiple hospitalization referral long-term care . The emergence heart failure major public health problem relate unintended result age population success reduce mortality cardiovascular disease . Non-adherence medication key problem treatment heart failure , adherence rate range 20 % 90 % . There clear need , therefore , develop intervention improve adherence patient heart failure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This single-site , partially blind , randomized clinical trial 900 patient systolic diastolic dysfunction , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class II III . Patients recruit period 2 year seven hospital . Patients randomly assign either SM intervention attention control . The SM group meet 18 time 2 hour 1 year . These group session teach patient use five basic self-management skill ( self-monitoring , environmental restructuring , social support , cognitive restructuring , relaxation response ) help build self-efficacy maintain treatment discontinue . The attention control arm consist educational intervention include 18 mailing American Heart Association Tip Sheets course first year , plus telephone follow-up patient mail check receipt comprehension Tip Sheet , address question Tip Sheet . Treatment effect evaluate use primary outcome hospitalization heart failure death , secondary outcome progression heart failure , quality life , health care cost . Potential mediator effectiveness include improved adherence improve psychosocial function .</detailed_description>
