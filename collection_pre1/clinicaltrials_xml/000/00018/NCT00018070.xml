	<brief_summary>This study try identify treat feeder vessel age-related macular degeneration . The macula part retina back eye determine central best vision . In macular degeneration , leak blood vessel macula lead loss central vision . These vessel branch tree-like one feeder vessel . Instead treat abnormal branching vessel , study try find close feeder vessel , thereby deprive abnormal vessel nutrition . The vessel close laser beam treatment . People 50 year age old macular degeneration visual acuity bad 20/50 study eye good vision eye may eligible study . Candidates undergo fluorescein angiography try locate feeder vessel . For procedure , yellow dye inject arm vein . The dye travel blood vessel eye , picture retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . Before laser treatment , participant complete eye examination , include measurement visual acuity , evaluation front part eye slit lamp microscope , examination retina ophthalmoscope , measurement eye pressure use tonometer . During laser treatment phase study , participant indocyanine green angiography-a procedure similar fluorescein angiography , use green dye-to photograph retina identify feeder vessel . If feeder vessel locate , laser beam treatment begin . For procedure , eye anesthetize numbing drop . A special contact lens place eye laser treatment . The number treatment depend well individual patient responds , usually two eight treatment require . The indocyanine green angiogram repeat laser beam treatment determine feeder vessel successfully close . If vessel remain partially open , repeat application do , follow another indocyanine green angiogram check result . Patients check clinic 1 week see additional treatment need . If , re-treatment do week . If re-treatment require , follow-up visit schedule 2 , 3 , 6 week treatment , 3 6 month treatment , every 6 month 2 year evaluate treatment result . The evaluation include fluorescein angiograms examination do start treatment . If abnormal vessel still present grow , repeat treatment apply following procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) represent common cause blindness patient age 60 . Most vision loss disease result sequelae choroidal neovascular membrane ( CNVM ) formation . CNVM usually compose well-formed neovascularization occult ( less well-formed ) neovascularization . While clinical trial show patient , mostly well-formed CNVM , may benefit laser photocoagulation photodynamic therapy , present treatment patient combine CNVM lesion ( well-formed occult ) whose area occult neovascularization great 50 % presentation CNVM pigment-epithelial detachment neovascular fibrosis . Retinal histopathology patient choroidal neovascularization reveal area CNVM usually feed small choroidal feeder vessel originate choroid choriocapillaris . Therefore , hypothesized closure feeder vessel would infarct large CNVM complex . Until recently , identification feeder vessel difficult new high speed indocyanine image choroid ( Phi-motion ) indocyanine green angiography ( ICG ) allow precise detection vessel . We test hypothesis utilize Phi-motion ICG identify choroidal feeder vessel patient CNVM amenable approve treatment . If feeder vessel identify , pulse-diode laser photocoagulation use attempt closure vessel . The study design provide information feasibility standardize procedure estimate potential efficacy . The primary outcome great 50 % reduction area leakage neovascular component determine fluorescein angiogram . Secondary outcome include complete resolution leakage measure fluorescein angiography , number repetitive laser treatment undergone , number patient eligible fluorescein angiogram without identifiable feeder vessel , number patient vision loss , baseline , 15 letter , 30 letter , reduce less 5 letter read . All adverse event regardless severity relatedness therapy collect summarize . Assessment outcomes make 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month post laser treatment , 24 month enrollment . This study give investigator insight technology feasibility treatment patient various form neovascular AMD . In addition , result study provide foundation large study therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . To participate study , patient must understand sign protocol inform consent . 2 . Age great equal 50 year . 3 . In least one eye , diagnosis AMD define presence drusen large 63 microm presence choroidal neovascularization fovea determine Principal Investigator define one follow fluorescein angiographic feature : 1 . Early stipple hyperfluorescence flat retinal pigment epithelium illdefined boundary little mild leakage late frame fluorescein . 2 . Irregular elevation retinal pigment epithelium exhibit discrete bright hyperfluorescence early transit phase angiogram . Stippled hyperfluorescence may present . Late frame may show persistent fluorescein stain leakage within sensory retinal detachment overlie area . 3 . Early welldefined lacy hyperfluorescence late frame show persistent fluorescein stain leakage . 4 . Early filling fluorescein beneath retinal pigment epithelium progressive filling study persistent leakage/staining space . This may associate `` notch '' border , area localize leakage edge irregular fill area discrete area blockage . 5 . Early hyperfluorescence late frame show progressive staining leakage surround tissue . The eligible eye consider study eye . If eye eligible , eye bad visual acuity consider study eye . 4 . Patient must least one potential feeder vessel study eye identify use Phimotion ICG . 5 . First 5 patient : visual acuity 20/200 worse study eye . Remaining 15 patient : visual acuity 20/50 worse study eye . 6 . The fellow eye must visual acuity well study eye . 7 . Ineligible clinically proven laser photocoagulation photodynamic therapy protocol . 8 .
