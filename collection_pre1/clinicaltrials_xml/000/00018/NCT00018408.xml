	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) among important chronic disease adult . It fourth lead cause death U.S. affect 10 % U.S. population age 55 . COPD account 25,000 discharge annually VA medical center . Cigarette smoke important know modifiable cause COPD , yet 15-20 % cigarette smoker develop clinically significant COPD . We therefore hypothesize genetic mechanism determine susceptibility development COPD . The genetic abnormality know cause COPD deficiency serine protease inhibitor 1-protease inhibitor , cause premature development emphysema , although implicate few 2 % COPD case . Several genetic variant propose candidate cause COPD ; however , identify basis association study unrelated subject , considerable risk ascertainment bias . In present study , sub-pair linkage approach utilized COPD patient smoke sibling identify gene determine risk develop COPD . The following short-term objective study : 1 . Recruit cohort 400 probands smoking-related COPD smoking sibling , whether affected COPD . Affected subject extensively characterize specific COPD phenotype , use spirometry , compute tomography , questionnaire data . 2 . Test association know genetic variant candidate gene presence COPD . 3 . For proposed candidate gene without know candidate polymorphism , use sib-pair linkage analysis test polymorphic marker loci close proximity candidate gene evidence linkage COPD . 4 . Test heterogeneity linkage among different COPD phenotype : predominant emphysema versus predominant airway disease . The long-term objective research identification specific genetic variant confer risk development COPD smoker . This achieve mean fine map locus identify objectives 3-4 , subsequent genome scan involve 400 sibling pair ; identification novel genetic variant locus ; assessment functional significance variant relation COPD independent sample subject . Recruitment subject project begin April , 1999 . At time , total 22 subject ( 11 COPD patient 11 first-degree relative ) recruit test . No adverse event occur . A computerized methodology quantitation emphysema CT scan develop demonstrated adequate DNA extraction blood sample . Genotyping deferred pending recruitment 50 subject .</detailed_description>
