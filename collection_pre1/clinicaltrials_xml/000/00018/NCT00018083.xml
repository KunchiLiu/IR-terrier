	<brief_summary>The primary objective multi-center sub-study USPHS Study 23 : `` Intensive Pharmacokinetic Study Intermittent Rifabutin Isoniazid Daily Efavirenz Combination Two Nucleoside Analogs Treatment HIV Tuberculosis Co-infections , '' compare pharmacokinetics rifabutin 600 mg twice week combination efavirenz 600 mg daily pharmacokinetics rifabutin 300 mg twice week without efavirenz . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) To describe pharmacokinetics rifabutin efavirenz combination regimen , ( 2 ) To evaluate safety concomitant efavirenz rifabutin , ( 3 ) To assess effect absolute neutrophil count change rifabutin dose add efavirenz regimen , ( 4 ) To develop model optimal sample time rifabutin dosed twice week , ( 5 ) To describe pharmacokinetics isoniazid combination efavirenz daily two NRTIs , ( 6 ) To compare pharmacokinetics isoniazid without efavirenz .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Pharmacokinetics Nelfinavir-Rifabutin Interaction Patients With HIV-Related Tuberculosis Treated With Rifabutin-Based Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There two concern regard rifabutin INH pharmacokinetics population : 1 ) Malabsorption anti-TB medication frequent population 2 ) Many antiretrovirals drug frequently use management HIV-infected individual inhibitor cytochrome p450 3A4 isoform result increase level rifabutin . Correlation pharmacokinetic clinical outcome set interaction essential . METHODS : The study do General Clinical Research Center Duke University Medical Center , inpatient basis ( depend patient life ) . No one suspect infectious infectious TB enrol GCRC . After informed consent obtain , subject admit GCRC twice ; first admission occur least four twice weekly dos intermittent rifabutin prior begin antiretroviral therapy second admission occur two six week follow institution antiretroviral regimen include efavirenz . During Admission # 1 , blood drawn 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 21 hour post dose INH rifabutin . During Admission # 2 , blood drawn 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 hour . Efavirenz give time point 0 24 hour post sample . TB drug give 3 hour ( sample time subsequent INH/rifabutin dose correspond Admission # 1 ) . Patients interview regard concomitant medication , gastrointestinal symptom meal relative study drug dosing . Sixty day follow last dose PK study medicine , follow-up visit phone call ( include review medical record ) identify adverse event . DATA ANALYSIS : Frequency distribution include plot data , distribution curve test normality , parametric non-parametric measure central tendency dispersion , well Shapiro-Wilk W test normality . Means report + standard deviation ( SD ) . The percent coefficient variation ( CV ) calculate ( SD/mean ) multiply 100 % . Correlation analysis ( JMP ) perform across subject outcome variable use non-parametric technique ( Spearman Rho , continuous data ) . The dependence outcome variable ( pharmacokinetic parameter ) upon subject characteristic ( demographic data age , weight , CD4 count , etc . ) determine use Y X analyse , one parameter time ( continuous nominal data ) . Subsequently , model multiple X variable construct use forward addition backward deletion . Correlations parameter covariates consider statistically significant p 3/4 0.05 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Eligible subject enrol Study 23 HIVinfected patient culture confirm suspected tuberculosis . Subjects must currently receive tuberculosis therapy include twice weekly isoniazid rifabutin currently receive antiretroviral therapy . Subjects must willing begin antiretrovial regimen contain efavirenz two NRTIs ( combination define protocol ) requisite dose . Exclusion criterion include hematocrit le 25 % , pregnant lactate woman , prior use NNRTI , use protease inhibitor select medication define protocol . Women childbearing potential must agree practice adequate ( barrier ) method birth control submit serum pregnancy test 14 day enrollment .</criteria>
