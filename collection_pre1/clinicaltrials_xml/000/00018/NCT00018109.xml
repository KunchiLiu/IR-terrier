	<brief_summary>To establish collaborative group clinical trial center , standardized equipment protocol , able conduct drug gene therapy trial DMD . To evaluate therapeutic effect glutamine creatine monohydrate muscle strength child DMD . To validate use QMT ( quantitative muscle strength test ) gait analysis child DMD reliable tool quantify muscle strength , monitor disease progression assess therapeutic response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Study Assess Efficacy Safety Glutamine Creatine Monohydrate Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) common lethal inherit disorder worldwide . Despite exponential increase understand disorder since discovery characterization causative gene product dystrophin 1987 , current therapeutic management remain largely supportive . Awaiting final genetic cure available future , investment develop good drug therapy DMD remain important . Not uniform use prednisone ( drug proven beneficial ) hamper potential adverse effect , also may well case ultimately combination gene drug therapy need cure Duchenne child . Here , test two compound show promise 45-drug screen mdx mouse model Duchenne dystrophy . The effect glutamine ( 0.6/kg/day ) creatine monohydrate ( 5g/day ) muscle strength evaluate multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 3-arm study . Ambulant child age 5-10 year establish DMD diagnosis study . Patients undergo 2 screen evaluation within 2 week . Patients randomized treatment group second screen visit , follow 6-month treatment period . During treatment period , patient evaluate monthly interval . The primary endpoint percentage change average muscle strength score QMT performance specific muscle group . Secondary endpoint include timed function test , functional grade arm leg , pulmonary function test .</detailed_description>
