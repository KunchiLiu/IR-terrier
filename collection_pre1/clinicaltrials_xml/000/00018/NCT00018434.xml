	<brief_title>The Epidemiology Infection With Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nosocomial infection often cause antimicrobial-resistant pathogen vancomycin resistant enterococci ( VRE ) major cause increase morbidity , mortality cost hospitalize patient . Nosocomial bloodstream infection ( BSI ) add 7 21 day length stay cost institution $ 3,061 $ 40,000 . The average cost treating patient VRE BSI estimate 30 % vancomycin sensitive enterococcal BSI . In addition , attributable mortality VRE BSI estimate 37 % . Preventing VRE infection VRE transmission clearly important understanding risk factor necessary first step . The goal three year study identify potentially effective intervention prevention VRE infection colonization Before test intervention , need identify risk factor VRE infection allow u ( 1 ) identify potentially effective intervention ( 2 ) focus patient high risk VRE infection . We study effect antibiotic use , particularly vancomycin , impair host defense VRE infection large cohort study VRE colonize patient . The goal develop statistical model , allow u identify alterable risk factor , could reduce risk VRE infection . Many case-control study perform study VRE colonization infection ; however , study small insufficient sample size multivariate model . Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( VRE ) transmit patient patient . We propose model ecological relationship rate VRE transmission pre-existing prevalence VRE ICU determine whether relationship linear exponential . The objective determine point rate transmission increase significantly specific intervention occur ( e.g . reverse isolation patient , close unit new admission ) . Controlling health care cost important part health care today particularly important capitated reimbursement system VHA adopt . Potential intervention prevent VRE infection VRE transmission must cost-effective healthcare system justify adoption . The current study quantify operational cost associate VRE colonization infection hospitalize patient compare non-colonized counterpart . Patients intensive care unit without VRE colonization covaried severity illness stratify Major Diagnostic Category ( primary ICD-9 code ) marginal health care cost compare . This estimate use examine potential cost-effectiveness identified intervention , justify system-wide cost implement intervention .</detailed_description>
