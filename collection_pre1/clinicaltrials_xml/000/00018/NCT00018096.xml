	<brief_summary>In project , hypothesize polymorphism gene express airway epithelia asthmatic follow specific airway challenge predispose individual development asthma . To test hypothesis , identify gene differentially express airway epithelial cell follow challenge stimulus induce acquire ( house dust mite ) innate ( LPS ) immune response , determine whether polymorphism gene associate development asthma separate , well characterize , familial cohort asthmatic . This powerful approach design identify novel gene associate asthma pathogenesis ( differentially express exposure-response study ) asthma susceptibility ( genetically associate asthma linkage/association study ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal project identify gene involve development airflow obstruction airway inflammation asthmatic , determine whether polymorphism differentially express gene predispose individual develop asthma . Asthma complex genetic disorder cause number unique gene-gene gene-environment interaction . The search asthma susceptibility gene complicate broad clinical phenotype asthma , polygenic inheritance pattern disease , substantial role environmental exposure development progression asthma . Inhaled environmental agent induce several biologic response asthmatic ; include induction acquire innate immunity lead acute chronic form airway inflammation airway remodel . Acquired immune response protein antigen , house dust mite allergen , often induce type 2 T lymphocyte-driven response ( Th2 ) appear important atopic asthma . Recent study group others demonstrate innate immunity , initiate inhalation bacterial viral pathogen , organic dust , endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , air pollution particulate matter , ozone , also cause acute chronic form airflow obstruction , airway inflammation , even airway remodel . Emerging evidence indicates acquire innate immune response lung may influence polymorphic gene . For instance , functional polymorphism IL-4 receptor gene think preferentially stimulate acquire Th2 immune response inhale allergen , recently show common co-segregating mutation TLR4 ( transmembrane receptor LPS ) associate diminished airway responsiveness inhale LPS . These observation suggest environmental challenge use narrow phenotype asthma investigate genetic susceptibility biologically specific form asthma .</detailed_description>
