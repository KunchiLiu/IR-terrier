	<brief_title>Lung Volume Reductions Surgery ( LVRS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease major cause mortality morbidity US . Although medical therapy may delay disability death , definitive therapy improve pulmonary function patient . The resection emphysematous lung parenchyma , lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , report uncontrolled study highly select emphysema patient substantially improve parameter pulmonary function , dyspnea , quality life . Numerous case series report significant short-term benefit . Current LVRS data regard outcome limited study design lack parallel control group lack long term data . The main objective proposal : 1 ) To study effect LVRS addition maximal medical therapy compare maximal medical therapy alone term improvement physiology quality life . 2 ) To good define preoperative selection criterion determine patient would benefit surgical intervention . To accomplish objective , patient meet clinical criterion complete pulmonary rehabilitation-program randomize 2 group : 1 ) Continuing optimal medical care 2 ) bilateral LVRS via median sternotomy addition medical therapy . The Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center currently perform LVRS protocol support Merit Review funding ( 1996-200O , Effects lung volume reduction surgery treatment severe emphysema ) select patient severe emphysema . This control study design determine patient selection criterion , well , short long term benefit operate non-operated patient severe emphysema receive maximal medical therapy . Given strict selection criterion unexpectedly high survival treatment group date , unlikely study size survival difference detect . In 1997 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute Health Care Financing Administration organize national registry control , multicenter clinical trial compare bilateral LVRS maximal medical treatment ( NETT , National Emphysema Treatment Trial ) . Both on-going LVRS study NETT hinder underestimation difficulty recruit patient qualify invasive study . Both study evaluated/recruited date approximately 50 % project number subject require achieve statistical power draw significant clinical conclusion . In fact , NIH invest additional fund national `` marketing '' NETT LVRS . We believe national marketing effort , well change enhancement local recruiting strategy allow u enroll adequate patient study completion . This control clinical trial provide data address crucial clinical potential economic implication surgical intervention patient severe emphysema .</detailed_description>
