	<brief_summary>This grant study patient receive kidney transplant AND Islet Cell transplant discover transplant functioning . We seek several patient kidney transplant NOT either type diabetes . These patient serve `` control group '' since also immunosuppressive medication affect abnormal blood sugar . This allow investigator develop understand immunosuppressive medication affect glucose metabolism ( blood sugar level ) insulin utilization ( body use insulin ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If Islet Cell transplant become reasonable treatment alternative patient type 1 diabetes , must knowledge islet cell function transplant { islet cell responsible make insulin body need order control blood sugar ) . This knowledge would allow improvement islet cell transplant procedure , well possible alteration immunosuppressive medication ( drug prevent rejection ) prescribed . There two basic kind diabetes , type 1 ( formally know Insulin Dependent Juvenile diabetes ) type 2 ( formally know Adult-Onset Non-insulin dependent ) diabetes . The patient study affect type 1 diabetes . After transplant , hop long need insulin injection . It possible patient may need take pioglitazone and/or metformin , however , prescribe Project 1 , need . The medication use study include : C-peptide . This synthetic product ( human animal source ) man-made identical C-peptide make body . C-peptide make time insulin , one molecule insulin equal one molecule C-peptide . By give C-peptide synthetic , researcher measure C-peptide break body , could relate insulin break body . Somatostatin also use test C-peptide . While receive Somatostatin , production insulin patient stop . This medication give 4 hour blood sugar monitor entire procedure . Insulin &amp; Glucose also give IV certain test regulate blood sugar . Blood sugar maintain within certain level achieve administration insulin and/or glucose . The patient 's blood sugar monitor frequent interval throughout various procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 1 diabetic receive kidney transplant well ( Project 1 ) Islet Cell Transplant . A control group 8 kidney transplant recipient diabetes also seek . Age range group expect fall 2550 year/old range base upon statistical data , although age 18 65 may also qualify .</criteria>
