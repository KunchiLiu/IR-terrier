	<brief_summary>This study examine symptom , course disease treatment non-tuberculous mycobacterial ( NTM ) infection , well genetics involve infection . Patients NTM recurrent lung infection sometimes infection skin organ well . They may also curvature spine , barrel chest , heart valve weakness . The study compare feature NTM Job syndrome cystic fibrosis , diseases involve recurrent infection lungs possibly organ . Patients diagnose suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection , cystic fibrosis Job syndrome may eligible study . All participant medical family history , blood urine test , image study may include X-rays , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , DNA genetic study . In addition , patient Job syndrome cystic fibrosis , patient NTM lung disease undergo follow procedure : - Scoliosis survey X-rays spine look curvature abnormalities spinal column - Echocardiography image test use sound wave examine heart chamber valves - Electrocardiogram measurement electrical activity heart - Pulmonary function test breathe test measure much air patient move lung - Body measurement measurement height , weight , arm span , finger length , etc . - Joint function assessment joint mobility use different maneuver test flexibility joint ligaments - Examination physical feature might associate NTM , high arch palate mouth , flat foot , certain skin feature - Dermatology ( skin ) examination reactive skin condition skin problem possibly skin biopsy ( surgical removal small skin tissue sample microscopic examination ) - Interview genetics specialist These test may require several day complete . Patients NTM also examine cystic fibrosis specialist may sweat test . In addition , NTM patient ask return NIH every year 5 year follow-up test , medically indicate , include CT chest , scoliosis survey examination specialist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) ubiquitous environmental organism foundin soil water rarely cause disease human . Since exposure organism universal disease rare , conclude normal host defense almost always sufficient prevent infection . It follow otherwise healthy individual develop disease must abnormal susceptibility immune defect permit infection nontubercuolous mycobacteria . The organisms commonly encounter clinical practice include Mycobacterium avium , M. intracellulare [ collectively know M. avium complex ( MAC ) ] , M. kansasii , M. fortuitum , M. abscessus , M. chelonae . These organism share significant structural biochemical similarity pathogenic relative , M. tuberculosis ( MTB ) . Recognition host factor predispose lead NTM infection may important implication pathogenesis therapeutic intervention , may applicable virulent MTB . Identification genetic acquire susceptibility factor may lead recognition endogenous pathway exploit therapeutically possible gene identification . Over last two decade , three important observation make regard pathogenesis nontuberculous mycobacterial infection . 1 ) In patient infected HIV , nontuberculous mycobacterial infection often occur CD4+ T-lymphocyte number fall 50/mm3 . This suggest specific T cell product activity require mycobacterial resistance . 2 ) An association note pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection particular body habitus , predominantly post-menopausal woman ( pectus excavatum , scoliosis , mitral valve prolapse ) . 3 ) Multiple defect find involve interferon gamma synthesis use pathways patient disseminate nontuberculous mycobacterial infection without HIV , suggest critical pathway host defense organism . We seek well characterize predisposition mycobacterial infection . This study specifically address several aspect immune function investigate propose link body morphotype relevant population . By collect information , hope provide insight disease association , infection susceptibility , genetic predisposition mycobacterial infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : This protocol study patient mycobacterial infection , include without previously identify predispose disease process well individual underlie malignancy . Patients nontuberculous mycobacterial infection particular interest , interested isolate characterize primary immune defect ( ) responsible infection susceptibility . Select patient acquire immunodeficiency tuberculosis may also study relevant host defect suspect . Patients must refer NIH diagnosis suspicion mycobacterial infection . Male female patient accept without limitation due age . Only patient nontuberculous mycobacterial infection without HIV infection consider longterm disease management . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVES : As part protocol , may obtain medical record , family member questionnaire , blood work , urine , saliva buccal swab blood relatives patient study , hope isolate characterize primary immune defect ( ) responsible mycobacterial infection susceptibilityand genetic link see within family . We hope identify family apparent genetic susceptibility respiratory diseases predominantly associate PNTM perform whole genome sequence within group identify genetic mutation accounting increase susceptibility . Male female patient accept without limitation due age . These relative receive treatment protocol procedures do unless become patient study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA :</criteria>
