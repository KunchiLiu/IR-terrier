	<brief_summary>This study examine effect long-term adherence low protein diet ( LPD ) 0.6 g/kg-1/d-1 without progressive resistance exercise training patient impaired renal function body composition , renal function ( glomerular filtration rate ) , nitrogen balance , muscle strength size , functional capacity . The hypothesis adherence LPD result reduction skeletal muscle mass reduce strength functional capacity patient adhere LPD exercise demonstrate similar preservation renal function great fat free mass , muscle mass strength . The intervention trial last 18 month patient moderate renal failure randomly assign one 4 intervention : standard care , standard care + exercise , LPD , LPD exercise . In way independent combined effect diet exercise progression renal disease body composition monitor . This study important implication treatment patient chronic renal failure . New strategy combine exercise recommendation low protein diet may slow progression renal disease improve strength functional capacity at-risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Management dietary protein intake CRF patient represent critical balance provide adequate protein meet nutritional requirement , limit protein intake hope slow abate progression CRF . A number study demonstrate reduced dietary protein intake slow progression chronic renal failure . Finding effective way increase nitrogen retention decrease urinary nitrogen excretion may help CRF patient maintain positive nitrogen balance lessen nitrogen load kidney give dietary protein intake . Our laboratory demonstrate old men woman , consequence adherence low protein diet accommodation result decrease muscle mass , strength , compromise immune function . We also demonstrate healthy , free living old men woman consume weight maintenance diet provide RDA protein 0.8 g/kg-1/day-1 15 week lose skeletal muscle mass . These data clearly indicate elderly people increase need dietary protein ( compare young people ) . Data also demonstrate progressive resistance exercise improve nitrogen balance old healthy individual well patient mild moderate chronic renal failure .</detailed_description>
