	<brief_summary>This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) learn brain function adolescent receive fluoxetine ( Prozac ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) interpersonal therapy ( IPT ) anxiety depression children/adolescents . All participant receive interview assess general , include general mood , degree nervousness behavior . Each participant one parent interview separately together . Those elect medication study also receive physical examination . Participants ask complete task involve problem-solving memory involve look picture , remember thing , test reaction time , make simple choice . Participants anxiety depression first meet psychiatrist psychologist two weekly session talk therapy . Those remain anxious depress 2 week 3 option base choice : 1 ) treatment fluoxetine daily 8 week 2 ) cognitive-behavioral therapy interpersonal therapy ( two kind talk therapy ) week 8 week 3 ) random assignment ( 50 % chance ) either placebo fluoxetine 8 week . In addition , subject also randomly blindly assign receive either active computer-based training task inactive computer-based training task , administer part , along medication talk -therapy treatment . The active training think help anxiety whereas inactive train thought effect . The purpose part study understand best way help child adolescent problem anxiety . However , research need find best way help child adolescent . During 8 week treatment , participant complete verbal write symptom rating . Blood sample draw laboratory test drug treatment end . Those improved end study offer treatment 1 3 month , clinician help find subsequent aftercare . Those improve treatment continue therapy NIH outside physician able assume responsibility monitoring medication .

	<detailed_description>Objective : This protocol use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine neuro-cognitive correlate pediatric adult mood anxiety disorder . The primary goal project document , pediatric anxiety disorder major depression , perturbation brain system mediate attention bias , fear conditioning , emotional memory , response various form motivational stimulus . As one secondary goal , project measure relationship factor treatment response either fluoxetine , specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , interpersonal psychotherapy ( IPT ) . Another secondary goal examines similar association adult . Study Population : A total 2530 child , adolescent , adult recruit . Most subject able complete procedure . We seek comprehensively study 150 juvenile current anxiety disorder , 60 juvenile current major depression , 150 juvenile psychiatric disorder , 100 adult major depression , 60 adult anxiety disorder , 150 adult psychiatric disorder . To achieve , recruit 2530 individual . Design : Subjects test use fMRI paradigm design examine brain region engage process motivationally salient stimulus , assessed attention , memory , social interaction , reward , fear-conditioning paradigm . After initial fMRI test , subject depression anxiety disorder receive treatment . Treatment comprise open treatment either fluoxetine CBT , augment computer-based attention retraining , deliver randomized-controlled design , random assignment either active placebo attentiontraining regimen . Adolescent subject re-tested eight-weeks use attention , memory , condition paradigm . Outcome Measures : Prior image study note task require attention modulation , emotional memory , social interchange , fear condition engage brain region previously implicate adult mood anxiety disorder . These region include consistently amygdala ventral prefrontal cortex . Moreover , image study reward function implicate striatum prefrontal cortex adult mood disorder . As result , hypothesize attention , memory , social interaction , reward , condition paradigms engage amygdala , ventral prefrontal cortex striatum psychiatrically healthy impaired subject . Moreover , hypothesize healthy psychiatrically impaired group differ degree engagement . Juvenile subject also treat eight-weeks , subset re-tested fMRI . We predict pre-treatment abnormality neural circuitry predict response treatment , increase amygdala prefrontal activation occur individual show strong response treatment . Moreover , hypothesize effective treatment normalize abnormality attention emotional memory , manifest fMRI .</detailed_description>
