	<brief_summary>More 10,000 people year United States `` fail back surgery syndrome '' cause scar form around out surface spinal cord . Such scarring , know peridural fibrosis , common back surgery known either lumbar discectomy laminectomy . Peridural fibrosis may cause recur low back pain leg pain surgery . Operating remove scar tissue often lead scar . Researchers previously study radiation way prevent peridural fibrosis . We test whether low-dose radiation give 24 hour surgery decrease amount peridural fibrosis reduction lead improve result surgery . Half participant receive radiation surgery half . We evaluate patient followup visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month surgery physical exam questionnaire . At 12 month , obtain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) low spine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Radiation Prevent Complications Back Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers long know low-dose radiation inhibits fibroblast osteoblast activity . Studies humans show perioperative radiation therapy useful way prevent keloid heterotopic bone formation . However , researcher previously study radiation mean inhibit peridural fibrosis . Our previous study rat dog model show significant reduction peridural fibrosis laminectomy use low-dose external beam radiation ( 700 cGy ) give 24 hour prior surgery . Based result animal study , test whether ( 1 ) low-dose radiation give 24 hour surgery decrease amount peridural fibrosis people ( 2 ) reduction peridural fibrosis lead improve result surgery . For study , enroll 46 patient fail back surgery syndrome believe secondary perineural fibrosis randomize , double-blinded , control clinical trial . We assign patient one two group surgery : preoperative radiation ( treatment group ) preoperative radiation ( control group ) . We treat half patient external beam radiation re-exploration decompression peridural fibrosis ( treatment group ) perform re-exploration decompression half without preoperative radiation ( control group ) . All patient undergo simulation radiation treatment planning know receive radiation . For patient randomize receive preoperative radiation , administer single dose 700 cGy 6.0-cm-wide field center spinal cord affect level , use 6 MV Varian 600C linear accelerator . We administer treatment two field angle 45 degree vertical plane skin surface propose incision irritate . This prevent wound heal problem . Only radiation oncologist research assistant know whether radiation administer . The patient surgeon mask treatment . The neurosurgeon co-investigators perform surgical procedure patient 24 hour radiation ( sham ) treatment . We give patient preoperative antibiotic . The surgeon reopen previous midline posterior lumbar skin incision dissect subcutaneous tissue away spinous process lamina . Once surgeon adequately expose previous surgical site , place self-retaining retractor . The surgeon decompress nerve remove scar tissue around nerve root thecal sac . The surgeon also remove intravertebral disc material think cause nerve root compression . On completion operation , surgeon stop bleeding electrocautery , irrigate wound antibiotic , close wound layer . In general , hospital stay surgery one night . The patient begin gradual ambulation even surgery . We administer North American Spine Society ( NASS ) Lumbar Spine Outcome Assessment patient treatment followup visit assess physical functioning . We also use NASS questionnaire collect demographic lifestyle information baseline ass patient expectation regard treatment level satisfaction treatment followup period . We physical examination administer patient-reported questionnaire prior surgery 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month surgery . We obtain magnetic resonance ( MR ) image lumbar spine 12 month treatment .</detailed_description>
