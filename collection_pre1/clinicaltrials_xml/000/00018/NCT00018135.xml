	<brief_summary>Patients hemodialysis tend chronic elevation level phosphorus blood secondary increase iPTH level . This chronic elevation iPTH adverse consequence , thus variety phosphate binder give attempt decrease absorption phosphorus present normal diet . Some preliminary study indicate iPTH level may change base amount phosphorus present meal prior significant absorption phosphorus . If true hemodialysis patient , time administration phosphate binder relation ingestion meal need consider</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parathyroid Hormone Levels Relation Phosphorus Content Meals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drugs use include three phosphate binder already approve commonly use . Calcium acetate , aluminum hydroxide , sevelamer ( Renagel ) give separate occasion conjunction high phosphorus meal . They give standard dos use treatment high phosphorus level hemodialysis patient . The population target included hemodialysis patient elevate iPTH phosphorus level . The patient receive five separate meal . Four high phosphorus content meal one low phosphorus content meal . On three occasion high phosphorus content meal patient ingest one three phosphate binder . The meal ingest twelve-hour overnight fast . Labs drawn prior meal ingestion 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 240-minute interval . The labs consist iPTH , phosphorus , calcium , glucose . A serum albumin level obtain initial specimen . The patient iPTH level least 200pg/ml serum phosphorus level least 4.0 mg/dl . The primary outcome change iPTH level relation phosphorus content meal . Secondary outcome include change iPTH level relation various phosphate binder use .</detailed_description>
