	<brief_title>Specific Interventions Agitation Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) common cause dementia , fourth lead cause death , enormous economic emotional cost caregiver patient . Most patient AD develop disruptive , agitated behavior point ailment common catalyst placement long-term care setting represent half resident . Disruptive behavior create stress staff patient long-term care setting , reduce patient quality life excess use physical restraint , drain financial resource facility . This study propose design specific intervention design decrease disruptive , agitate behavior patient AD reside long-term care facility . This 12-week study assess efficacy two pharmacological agent , atypical neuroleptic ( risperidone ) anticonvulsant mood stabilizer ( gabapentin ) identify moderator differential treatment response two drug . Specifically , study aim randomize 130 patient AD manifesting agitate disruptive behavior , two group 65 patient , one group receive risperidone gabapentin . There two main hypothesis : 1 ) Patients treatment group manifest different overall group decrease rating disruptive , agitate behavior ; 2 ) Measurable , clinical characteristic identify subgroups subject differential treatment response two medication . The two variable consider moderator follow : ) Patients high psychosis rating manifest great responsivity risperidone compare gabapentin , b ) Patients high level affective lability manifest great responsivity gabapentin compare risperidone .</detailed_description>
