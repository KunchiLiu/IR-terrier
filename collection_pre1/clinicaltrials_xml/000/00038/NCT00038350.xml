	<detailed_description>The overall goal propose research evaluate effect lingual resistance exercise swallow relate outcome frail elderly patient dysphagia . In addition , determine prognostic factor allow u predict intervention effective . For objective , frail , dysphagic patient randomize 2 treatment group : ) standard swallow treatment 8-week tongue exercise program , b ) standard swallow treatment 8-week hand exercise program , serve `` sham '' intervention . Objective 1 : To quantify effect exercise program bolus flow : ) direction measure Penetration Aspiration Scale ; b ) completeness ( residual rating scale 7 ) ; c ) duration msec . Objective 2 : To quantify effect exercise program oropharyngeal physiology include lingual pressure ( surrogate strength ) kinematics hyolaryngeal complex opening upper esophageal sphincter ( UES ) determine contribution measure bolus flow functional outcome include swallowing-specific quality life dietary intake . Objective 3 : To quantify underlying change lingual volume tissue composition result participation exercise program . Objective 4 : To determine effect 8-week lingual resistance exercise program swallowing function , quantify valid , reliable measure swallowing-related quality life ( QOL ) dietary intake . Objective 5 : To explore time course response examine outcome 4 8 week exercise . All objective pursue parallel across 3 year research . Milestones accomplish objective include : ( 1 ) Year 1 : implementing procedure , manual , instrumentation strength test train Month 4 ; enrol 24 subject Month 12 ; ( 2 ) Year 2 : enrol 40 subject Month 24 write preliminary manuscript ; ( 3 ) Year 3 : completing subject enrollment Month 30 , require 16 additional subject , complete statistical analysis regard intervention effect Month 34 , complete 2 comprehensive report result Month 36 .</detailed_description>
