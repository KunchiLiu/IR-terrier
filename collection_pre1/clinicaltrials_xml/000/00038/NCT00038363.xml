	<detailed_description>Although subacute transitional care think reduce cost much 60 percent hospital-based care cost ( DHHS , 1995 ) , systematic prospective study utilization cost service do . An important factor consider , particularly elderly patient , cost associate readmission . Some study suggest cost saving reduce readmission associate increased availability post-discharge service ( Ludke , MacDowell , Booth et . al. , 1990 ; Weinberger , Smith , Katz et al. , 1988 ) . If cost saving exist , transitional subacute care may important community-based resource patient return independent living . In addition demonstrate clinical efficacy subacute transitional care , propose study also assess long-term outcome , take account patient resource utilization incidence readmission . The current study determine subacute transitional care improve outcome important broad goal long term independent living enhance quality life . Variables assess focus physical family function , adjustment , resource utilization , skilled care placement , survival . When compare hospital-based rehabilitation , subacute rehabilitation expect demonstrate improvement physical ability , family function , adjustment , well , survival . b. Hypothesis . The primary hypothesis clinical outcome significantly well subacute care patient 3 12 month hospital-based control patient . Costs resource utilization hypothesize significantly less . c. Objectives project timeline . The objective study conduct randomize clinical trial examine effect subacute transitional care compare hospital-based rehabilitative care disabled patient . Specific objective : 1 ] evaluate type , magnitude duration rehabilitative care provide , 2 ] determine difference cost care provide two group , 3 ] compare clinical outcome two treatment assess magnitude change , 4 ] compare long-term outcome 12 month . Secondary objective describe diagnostic demographic subgroup may benefit great less extent others . Patients recruit study follow 1 year , measurement occur hospital admission , 3 month , 12 month . The time completion study project 3 year . Recruitment subject begin second quarter project continue 1.5 year . Follow-up measure continue additional year .</detailed_description>
