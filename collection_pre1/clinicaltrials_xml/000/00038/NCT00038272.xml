	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , efficacy , side effect beta-D-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane ( DAPD ) compare DAPD plus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) drug add anti-HIV treatment regimens people infected HIV . Some study show DAPD MMF help fight HIV . However , neither DAPD MMF approve Food Drug Administration treat HIV infection . This study help doctor decide DAPD MMF good drug treat HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study DAPD Alone Versus DAPD Plus MMF Treatment HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The antiretroviral potency DAPD vary among antiretroviral-experienced patient . In vitro study indicate potency DAPD markedly increase addition MMF . Preliminary data indicate MMF well tolerate patient advanced HIV-1 disease . However , currently clinical data activity DAPD combine MMF . This study first evaluate addition DAPD MMF patient 's current antiretroviral therapy . At study entry , patient randomly assign one two blind treatment arm . Arm A receives DAPD plus MMF placebo addition current regimen , Arm B receive DAPD plus MMF addition current regimen . All patient remain current antiretroviral regimen Week 2 . After Week 2 , patient virologically respond encouraged remain blind study treatment Week 24 . Patients virologically respond unblinded . After unblinding , patient receive MMF may add antiretroviral regimen . Response addition open-label MMF assess 2 week . Resistance antiretroviral agent , include DAPD , assess follow virologic failure occur Week 2 . All patient option optimize background antiretroviral regimen Week 2 , base result pre-entry resistance assay ; enfuvirtide make available background therapy optimization Week 48 . Patients still receive DAPD alone DAPD plus MMF Week 48 still respond virologically may choose continue study drug ( ) follow additional 48 week . Throughout study , HIV-1 RNA level , CD4 cell count , study drug level monitor regularly . Eye exams do several study visit . Only DAPD , MMF , MMF placebo supply study ; patient must obtain rest treatment regimen doctor . Patients discontinue treatment end study need come follow-up visit 4 week discontinuation may need attend future follow-up visit 8-week interval , determine investigator .</detailed_description>
