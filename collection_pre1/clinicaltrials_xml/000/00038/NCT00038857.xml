	<brief_summary>Donor : This clinical study evaluate feasibility purify CD34 peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) transplant patient hematological malignancy . The primary objective study evaluate recipient obtain donor derive neutrophil engraftment incidence acute graft versus host disease [ GvHD ] ( grade III-IV ) . Secondary objective include assessment recipient donor derive platelet engraftment , incidence graft failure chronic GvHD , overall disease free survival , clinical safety device performance CliniMACS CD34 selection device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Donor Description : Before take part study , donor evaluation standard bone marrow blood stem cell donor . These include standard blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest X-ray . Donors also give general health questionnaire give blood donor United States . It take 10 minute complete questionnaire . Donors study receive standard mobilization therapy daily G-CSF every 12 hour . The Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) give injection skin . The mobilization phase start first day donor receive G-CSF continue final day stem cell collection process ( leukapheresis ) . Donors study receive Neupogen ( white blood cell growth factor ) stimulate immature blood cell . They receive two injection , twice day four day . On fourth day , assume enough immature white blood cell , researcher start stem cell collection process ( leukapheresis ) . The stem cell collection go 1 4 day enough immature cell collect , do day donor 's platelet count fall 75,000 . The stem cell call CD34 ( + ) cell . These cell process cell-processing machine try purify immature fraction cell remove T-lymphocytes part fatal graft versus host disease . The T-cell call CD3 ( + ) cell . Leukapheresis , later CD34 ( + ) cell selection , start day circulate CD34 ( + ) count high enough level . Leukapheresis continue appropriate count reach . If CD3 ( + ) count high , adjustment make . For donor reach collection goal one series collection attempt , researcher wait donor recovers first stem cell collection try . If donor unable reach collection goal , another attempt make different donor . The blood thinner use procedure acid citrate dextrose ( ACD ) . Heparin may substitute clinically need . No additional blood thinner additives added beyond normally use leukapheresis . A unique identification label system shall use track leukapheresis product collection infusion . Samples take leukapheresis product pre- post-selection quality analysis . This investigational study . No 90 donor take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . Recipient Description : Before take part study , recipient standard evaluation determine stage disease . These may include bone marrow aspiration biopsy necessary , CT scan chest x-ray . All recipient go cardiopulmonary evaluation . The recipient allogeneic bone marrow transplant pre-treatment thiotepa , fludarabine , melphalan , antithymocyte globulin . This follow infusion peripheral blood progenitor cell . Recipients daily follow-up exam hospital . Recipients evaluate least one five time per week leave Day 100 . After , evaluation least every three month one year every six month . The CliniMACS device provide used investigational device exemption FDA . Without CliniMACS device , procedure would possible . This investigational study . A total 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
