	<brief_summary>In VA , achieve progress decrease amputation rate early identification multidisciplinary treatment patient risk limb loss . Despite accomplishment , however , clinical outcome post-amputation , especially PVD patient , change little patient ' poor cardiovascular condition complicate injurious consequence impose inactivity begin preoperative period continue convalescence . If aggressively manage throughout phase recovery , problem quickly render patient , already risk , incapable rigor rehabilitation well lead reamputation , rehabilitation failure , secondary complication . In research , try transform clinical scenario apply succeed cardiac rehabilitation service provide amputee . In series study , study incorporate secondary CV risk factor modification aggressive exercise intervention conventional amputation rehabilitation program name Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy ( Healthy H.A.R.T. ) . Our goal better : 1 ) increase aerobic capacity promote rehabilitation achievement quality life , 2 ) prevent postoperative complication curtail peripheral vascular deterioration intervention find successful cardiac rehabilitation . The basic assumption study cardiovascular status , thus , aerobic capacity critical factor rehabilitation success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal line investigation evaluate efficacy integrate cardiovascular amputation rehabilitation program ( Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy ( Healthy H.A.R.T . ) ) concentrate secondary CV risk factor modification utilizes aggressive exercise program : 1 ) increase aerobic capacity promote rehabilitation achievement quality life 2 ) prevent postoperative complication curtail peripheral vascular deterioration . Given recognize merit systematically build upon incremental research achievement develop comprehensive multi-faceted clinical program , study one step time , work wide-scale investigation benefit integrate Healthy H.A.R.T . program conceptualize . The following phase plan : Part 1 ( propose 3-year study ) : examine clinical effectiveness Healthy H.A.R.T . 's exercise component . Findings disseminate presentation publication immediately follow study completion . Part 2 : revising amputation rehabilitation P.A.C.T . program care algorithms indicate Phase 1 finding . Part 3 : investigating implement Healthy H.A.R.T . 's exercise component distance , off-site , home-based program . Part 4 : develop broad scale investigation additional component Healthy H.A.R.T . use physiologic patient care outcome measure , cost-benefit ratio , patient clinician satisfaction , service potential offset resource utilization expense report widespread application . Key Question/Hypothesis : In Healthy H.A.R.T . Part 1 , test hypothesis : Dysvascular amputee participate aggressive exercise program ( Healthy H.A.R.T . exercise ) conjunction amputation rehabilitation obtain great aerobic capacity exhibit well rehabilitation achievement quality life receive conventional amputation . Experimental Design : This study ( Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy ( Healthy HART ) - Part 1 ) involve intent-to-treat design randomized 2-group pre- post-intervention study examine conventional rehabilitation augment Healthy H.A.R.T . exercise : ) increase aerobic capacity , b ) promote rehabilitation achievement , c ) improve quality life . Last , cost estimate two therapy compare . Houston VAMC amputation patient progress standardized decision make regard surgery option level amputation follow conventional post-operative medical surgical care rehabilitation accord standard VA Amputee Care Algorithm schedule . Standard Decisions Surgery Amputation Level : Decisions elective amputation perform General Surgery service make jointly surgeon PM &amp; R consultation . Decisions regard amputation level make light surgeon-assessed clinical physiologic sign patient characteristic PM &amp; R assessments functionality patient characteristic cognitive function , comorbidity , rehabilitation potential .</detailed_description>
