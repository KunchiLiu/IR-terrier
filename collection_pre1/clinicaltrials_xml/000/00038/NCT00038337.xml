	<detailed_description>Objective two parallel component study develop intervention visual cognitive relate health literacy disability older veteran . The first component test two intervention improve functional health literacy performance ( enhance design health literacy material train read skill ) use 2 x 2 subject factorial design . The second component consist patient , family , provider focus group help determine apply disseminate intervention identify problematic source text-based health material . Finally , result component , improve health information design guideline train protocol develop rehabilitative intervention health literacy disability . Specific research question : 1 . Can lower functional health literacy performance veteran improve follow text design directives intend account age-related visual cognitive change ( enhanced version ) ? 2 . Does instruction skill strategy read yield improvement functional health literacy performance ? 3 . Does instruction read skill enhance text design improve functional health literacy great extent either intervention alone ? 4 . Are read gain maintain time ? 5 . What everyday source functional health literature problematic today 's veteran ? 6 . How visual , cognitive , descriptive factor contribute change functional health literacy score ? 7 . What functional health literacy old veteran utilize Atlanta VA health care ? Focus Groups : Three two-hour focus group compose 15 VA health professional , 15 outpatient veteran age 65 old low functional health literacy , 15 family member veteran low functional health literacy . These focus group identify source text-based health information find problematic respective perspective . These source , well recommendation application dissemination guideline directives improved health information design training protocol , compile use transcription analysis focus group session . Interventions : Community dwell veteran age 65 old recruit Geriatric Primary Care Clinic Veteran 's Learning Center . Ethnicity , education , health status , general literacy , descriptive information record . Visual baseline measure include assessment visual skill read visual function . Cognitive baseline measure include assessment word recognition , text comprehension ability , verbal work memory , perceptual speed vocabulary level . Functional health literacy , measure TOFHLA , main outcome measure . This objective standardized instrument measure ability adult read understand medical instructional health care information present prose passage passage contain numerical information . Two hundred forty participant demonstrate inadequate functional health literacy score ( screen instrument STOFHLA ) randomly assign one four group : control ( N=60 ) , enhance ( N=60 ) , read skill strategy instruction ( N=60 ) , enhance read skill strategy instruction ( N=60 ) . All participant receive vision cognition test participate two 2-hour session . Depending group assignment participant either 1 ) read standard health-related material ( control ) 2 ) read enhance health-related material ( enhance ) 3 ) receive read skill train ( train ) 4 ) receive read skill train enhanced material ( train enhance ) .</detailed_description>
