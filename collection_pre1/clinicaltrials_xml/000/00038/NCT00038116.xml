	<brief_title>Embryonic Dopamine Cell Implants Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease cause death small number nerve cell produce critical chemical call dopamine . The drug L-dopa partially make lack dopamine . As time go , however , patient notice drug work well . Oftentimes , patient develop great fluctuation motor control . Off drug move , drug excess , exaggerated movement . Research animal last 20 year show dopamine cell replace transplant new cell obtain fetal brain tissue . For past 14 year , several laboratory around world perform similar transplant human fetal brain tissue patient Parkinson 's disease . So far , impossible compare result different group two center perform transplant way . This study seek get around problem use control clinical trial compare embryonic dopamine cell implant surgery placebo treatment . A total 40 patient recruit -- half receive cell implant surgery , half receive placebo . After double-blind phase study , patient placebo group option receive tissue implant . Fourteen patient eventually transplant . At present , study provide long-term follow-up evaluation treatment subject .</detailed_description>
