	<brief_title>A Study Peer Education Prevent HIV Transmission Among Injection Drug Users Their HIV Risk Contacts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 20 year research implement intervention IDUs indicate HIV transmission among user prevent , slow , stop appropriate intervention . Intervening early multiple strategy prevent epidemic spread consequence . Even prevalence increase substantially , prevention intervention reduce spread HIV drug-using population transmission population . Although research result promising , unknown self-reported behavior change correlate reduce rate HIV transmission . This study determine efficacy peer-educator , network-oriented intervention prevent HIV transmission among substance user risk network member . IDUs recruit use street community outreach method Chiang Mai Chiang Rai , Thailand Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , USA . Individuals study clinic undergo screen survey HIV counseling testing ; return clinic receive HIV test result , post-test counseling , screen . Those HIV uninfected , meet preliminary eligibility requirement , willing participate enrol index participant . Each index participant ask identify attempt recruit least two people ( potential network member ) he/she sex take drug 3 month prior screen . Infected uninfected network member eligible enrollment . Index participant randomly assign network member either intervention group control group . All participant receive HIV counsel regular HIV testing . Index participant assign intervention group attend six , two-hour peer educator-training session period 4 week . The training session focus skill build promotion risk-reducing behavior . A one-hour booster training session hold index participant 6- 12-month follow-up assessment . The study last approximately 48 month , enrollment expect take 30 month . Participants follow minimum 18 month maximum 30 month . Both index participant network member follow-up visit every 6 month , complete survey design assess HIV risk behavior , network characteristic , intensity intervention delivery , social harm may associate study participation . Average network HIV incidence rate compare two study group . NOTE : January 31 , 2006 , HPTN 037 trial terminate . Participants enrol study continue follow reduced number study visit .</detailed_description>
