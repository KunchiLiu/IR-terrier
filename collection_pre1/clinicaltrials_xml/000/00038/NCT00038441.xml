	<brief_summary>This clinical research study new investigational treatment cancer call `` DTI-015 '' give intratumoral injection . Intratumoral injection drug inject directly tumor . This study help doctor find best dose level DTI-015 treatment shrink tumor without cause severe side effect . The effect drug patient 's quality life ( patient feel patient ) mental function ( reason think ability ) also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Intramural Injection DTI-015 Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve 45 patient malignant glioma brain tumor . Before study , patient give physical exam blood urine test , ask cancer treatment . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain pinpoint location tumor . Female patient able child pregnancy test . All patient ask quality life undergo test mental function . Patients might receive steroid drug several day treatment . This help prevent swell around tumor . Patients also give drug prevent convulsion . DTI-015 injected catheter ( hollow tube ) center brain tumor . For patient undergo needle biopsy , computer ( `` stereotactic '' ) guidance use place catheter . For patient undergo open brain operation , catheter place direct vision surgeon computer guidance . It possible injection might do brain operation patient either much little tumor resection . The catheter remove injection . Each patient receive one injection although one first three patient might receive second injection first injection volume le 25 % tumor volume . A second injection also give patient stable first injection develop nodule growth . If &gt; 250 mg BCNU total inject , repeat injection do least 6 week . The dose DTI-015 depend size patient 's tumor . The dose level increase first 3 patient next 3 patient . After treatment , patient remain hospital 1 day . Several test repeat study . Patients come M.D . Anderson every 2-4 week total 12 week . Blood test do visit . An MRI scan brain do every month 3 month . The physical exam , quality life questionnaire , mental function test repeat 12 week treatment . Some blood test , however , may do local doctor . The test result would send study coordinator . The follow-up visit end 12 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic proof recurrent previously irradiate supratentorial malignant glioma include anaplastic astrocytoma , glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic oligodendroglioma , anaplastic ependymoma . It must judge gross total resection patient 's tumor possible patient must refuse open resection tumor . The decision tumor totally resect make mutually agree upon physician investigator study . There must tumor volume tumor component great equal 0.5 less equal 15 cubic centimeter . The patient must undergo stereotactic biopsy clinical reason injection DTI015 . The patient must Karnofsky functional status rating great equal 60 . The patient must fully recover acute effect prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . The patient must able read fully understand informed consent document must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . The patient must willing able comply protocol . For female patient childbearing potential , patient must pregnant evidence menses last 8 week negative urine HCG pregnancy test . Any radiotherapy chemotherapy four week prior enter study . Nitrosoureas mitomycin C six week prior enter study . Patients active uncontrolled infection . Serious liver bone marrow disorder specifically serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg % , SGOT &gt; 2.5 time normal , SGPT &gt; 2.5 time normal , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500/mm3 , platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 . Evidence renal failure ( blood creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg % , BUN &gt; 30 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min Evidence bleed diathesis use anticoagulant medication . Unstable severe intercurrent medical condition . For female : risk pregnancy ( i.e. , unwillingness use adequate protection prevent pregnancy ) , breast feed baby study period , lactation . Tumors shape 3 component exclude . Ovoidshaped spherical tumor allow . Central necrosis and/or central cystic area allow long enhance rim thickness &gt; 5 mm . Patients undergone partial resection tumor cavity inside residual tumor exclude . Patients tumor locate follow area brain exclude : brainstem ( pons medulla ) , midbrain ( mesencephalon ) , primary sensorimotor cortex dominant hemisphere , within 1.5 cm optic chiasm , either optic nerve , cranial nerve . Patients tumor extend ventricular system also exclude .</criteria>
