	<brief_summary>When HIV infect person take strong anti-HIV drug temporarily stop take , viral load rise body 's immune system expose HIV . This may lead body mount good immune response virus . The purpose study find take interleukin-2 ( also call IL-2 aldesleukin ) stop anti-HIV drug short period time help patient control HIV viral load . Study hypothesis : Patients study low virologic rebound maintain CD4 cell count long time patient comparative study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Treatment HIV Infected Patients Who Have Interrupted Their Anti-HIV Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Structured treatment interruption ( STIs ) may stimulate anti-HIV immune response . Evidence suggest IL-2 , increase CD4 count , could also enhance specific immune response HIV . Enhanced immune response could influence magnitude time virologic rebound follow treatment discontinuation . This study compare viral load present 12 week antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) interruption period patient receive different dose regimen IL-2 take part least two STIs . This study last 40 104 week . IL-2 provide part study ; potent ART provide . Patients study receive potent ART least two scheduled potent ART interruption . Patients randomly assign one two treatment arm . Arm A patient receive low-dose injection IL-2 3 week , last 2 week potent ART interruption period first week restart potent ART . Arm B patient receive high-dose injection IL-2 first 5 day restart potent ART interruption period . The first two ART interruption 4 week duration , follow 12 week back ART . Depending patient 's viral load CD4 count Week 32 , patient either enter third potent ART interruption 12 48 week continue ART . No IL-2 give third scheduled potent ART interruption . Throughout study , participant physical exams laboratory test , include measurement viral load CD4 count .</detailed_description>
