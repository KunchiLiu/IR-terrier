	<brief_title>Liposomal Vincristine Pediatric Adolescent Patients With Relapsed Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before treatment patient exams do . These may include blood test , urine test , bone marrow test , test central nervous system , x-rays , MRI/CT test . These needed measure patient 's clinical condition progress . A physical exam blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) repeat least one time weekly . Since Liposomal Vincristine may prevent body make and/or keep new blood cell , prior treatment patient also Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( AIDS virus ) test , blood test detect presence antibody AIDS virus . A separate informed consent give sign , order obtain permission test . Female patient may also require urine pregnancy test treatment may begin , know drug may affect unborn child . Patients receive liposomal vincristine central venous catheter ( plastic tube usually insert collar bone ) one hour , every 14 day , + 2 day . Patient 's also give drug docusate day liposomal vincristine start . This do try prevent constipation side effect . All patient show continued response stable disease without major side effect may continue receive liposomal vincristine 24 month . Patients solid tumor lymphoma X-rays perform every 8 week follow progression tumor . Patients leukemia bone marrow aspirate biopsy do first second month treatment , every 8 week . This investigational study . The FDA authorize use study drug research . Up 60 patient take part study . Up 30 patient enrol UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
