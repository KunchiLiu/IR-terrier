	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical research study answer follow question use 18F-fluoromisonidazole imaging agent : 1 . Do cell exist human tumor low oxygen level ( hypoxic cell ) ? 2 . If hypoxic cell exist human tumor , effect ability radiotherapy control human tumor ? 3 . Can Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scan ) detect hypoxic cell human tumor ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Head Neck Tumor Hypoxia Using 18F-Fluoromisonidazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic ( low oxygen ) cell long know exist animal tumor . It also know hypoxic cell difficult eliminate radiotherapy tumor cell normal level oxygen ( normoxic cell ) . However , extent hypoxic cell limit curability human tumor uncertain . To determine hypoxic cell exist human tumor hypoxic cell might influence efficacy radiotherapy , study involves direct measurement oxygen level human tumor compare tumor uptake experimental drug , 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( 18F-FMISO ) , visualize PET scan . 18F-fluoromisonidazole used PET image tell difference grow tumor high low oxygen content . Before begin radiotherapy , PET scan ( series picture , 20 min . scan ) perform 2 hour intravenous injection small amount radioactive trace drug , 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( 18F-FMISO ) observe active hypoxia tumor area . Upon completion 18F-FMISO PET scan , direct oxygen measurement obtain place small needle tumor computer tomographic ( CT ) guidance . The PET scan needle measurement repeat every 4 week course radiotherapy completion radiotherapy . The measurement obtain 18F-FMISO PET scanning ( non-invasive technique ) direct needle measurement ( invasive technique ) correlate eventual treatment outcome future use .</detailed_description>
