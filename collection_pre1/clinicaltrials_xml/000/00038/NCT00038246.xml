	<brief_title>Study Paclitaxel , Estramustine Phosphate Thalidomide Patients With Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Evaluate maximum tolerate dose oral daily thalidomide along Paclitaxel ( 100 mg/m^2 3-hour infusion weekly * 2 , every 21 day ) oral estramustine phosphate ( 140 mg mouth three times/day 5 day per week * 2 week , every 21 day ) patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate carcinoma . 2 . Evaluate efficacy regimen patient metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer fail two prior non-paclitaxel contain chemotherapy regimen , measure : - 2A . The objective response rate 'prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate ' combination treatment patient AI-PCa progressing chemotherapy . - 2B . Secondary endpoint : calculate time disease progression , effect performance status , analgesic consumption , survival . 3 . To evaluate toxicity combination treatment patient metastatic AI-PCa progressing chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
