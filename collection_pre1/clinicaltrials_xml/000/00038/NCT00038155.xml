	<brief_summary>Hospitalization acute medical condition often result functional decline old adult . This loss function often reverse hospital discharge . Our general hypothesis patient benefit rehabilitation occur simultaneously medical management acute condition link home exercise program implement discharge hospital . This approach differ traditional approach address rehabilitation need acute condition resolve provide rehabilitation service select patient institutional setting , subacute unit nurse home . The feasibility program assess document participation subject inpatient phase adherence subject home-based program . Fifty subject recruit individual 60 year age older admit Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) treatment acute medical condition . Subjects either unable ambulate , require assistance ambulation , unable ambulate functional distance ( 150 foot ) functional velocity ( 30m/min ) . Subjects randomly assign physical rehabilitation group ( PR ) control group ( CON ) . During hospitalization , subject PR group daily one 45-minute morning rehabilitation session one 30-minute evening rehabilitation session . Both session include ambulation transfer training . The longer morning session also include resistance exercise . Subjects CON group medial care currently provide . During six month discharge , subject PR group perform home-based exercise program consist ambulation resistance exercise . The program monitor progressed exercise physiologist visit subject weekly first month discharge , every week second third month discharge , monthly fourth , fifth , six month discharge . This study design test feasibility effectiveness practical potentially cost-effective rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives Project Specific Objective 1 : To evaluate feasibility inpatient rehabilitation hospitalization follow home-based exercise program old person limit ambulation admit hospital . Feasibility determine ability identify , recruit enroll subject , ability subject complete two session rehabilitation day inpatient phase , subject adherence home-based program . Adherence home-based program assess regular visit review activity log . Criteria feasibility successful recruitment fifty study subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion , participation least 80 % schedule inpatient rehabilitation session least 80 % prescribe home exercise session . Specific Objective 2 : To study impact standardize twice daily inpatient rehabilitation program ambulation , ability perform transfer self-care , muscle strength hospital discharge old adult hospitalize acute medical condition . We study individual either lose ability ambulate independently ( within two week hospitalization ) , limited ability ambulate ( le 150 foot functional velocity ) . The primary outcome measure objective Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test ( 41 ) . Ambulation , transfer , self-care also assess use locomotion , mobility self care subscales Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) ( 15 , 22-24 ) . The Microfit 2 hand-held dynamometer ( HHD ) use test muscle strength six low extremity muscle group three upper extremity muscle group ( 44 ) . An important outcome assessment proportion subject regain independence ambulation hospital discharge . Specific Objective 3 : To study effect combine program inpatient rehabilitation progressive home-based exercise training program six month follow discharge ambulation , ability perform transfer self care , walk endurance , mobility within home community . The Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test primary outcome measure . Ambulation , ability perform transfer self-care , muscle strength also assess use measure describe second specific objective . The Six Minute Walk Test ( 6 MWT ) use evaluate walking endurance , life-space assessment use evaluate mobility within home community ( 42 ) . The study randomize , control clinical trial , involve physical rehabilitation ( PR ) group , control ( CON ) group . Fifty subject meet study criterion randomly assign PR CON . PR receive intensive rehabilitation program consist progressive ambulation , transfer training , resistance exercise hospitalization . A similar home exercise program prescribe six month post-hospitalization . The CON group receive routine medical care currently provide .</detailed_description>
