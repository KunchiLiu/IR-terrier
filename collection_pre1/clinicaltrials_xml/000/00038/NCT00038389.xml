	<brief_summary>It interest determine whether COX-2 inhibitor give radiation therapy prolong progression-free survival brain stem glioma . Diffuse pontine brainstem glioma common child , also see adult . However , use commercially available COX-2 inhibitor evaluate pediatric population proper dose pediatrics unknown . Therefore Phase I study need conduct first step . Rofecoxib FDA approve COX-2 inhibitor use adult . This phase I study design determine maximum tolerate dose Rofecoxib give concurrently standard radiation therapy diffuse pontine brainstem glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rofecoxib non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug . Patients study take certain amount rofecoxib mouth either twice day treatment radiation therapy . They continue take rofecoxib 6 month end radiation therapy . Different dose level give different patient base statistical dose escalation ( increase ) program run computer call Continuous Reassessment Method . At least 3 patient treat dose level start low level . All patient require fill medication diary , document dose rofecoxib take time take . Patients receive radiation therapy day , five day week six week . During treatment , patient weekly exam , include blood work urine test . The blood work include liver kidney function test well coagulation ( blood clot ) test . Patients take study intolerable side effect occur , include bleed and/or severe allergic response . During 6 month completion radiation , patient still receive rofecoxib , monthly medical history , physical exam , blood test , urine test perform . Patients MRI 1 , 3 , 6 month completion radiation therapy . The first year completion rofecoxib therapy , patient interview examined blood urine test MRI every 3 month . During 1-3 year follow completion rofecoxib therapy , repeat every 6 month . After 3 year follow completion rofecoxib , follow-ups occur yearly . This investigational study . Rofecoxib currently approve FDA use adult . A maximum 30 patient take part study UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
