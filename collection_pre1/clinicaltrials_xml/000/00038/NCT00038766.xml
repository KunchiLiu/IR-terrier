	<brief_title>CNI-1493 Treatment Moderate Severe Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic inflammatory disease involve upper low gastrointestinal tract characterize abdominal pain , weight loss , gastrointestinal bleeding formation fistula loop bowel bowel skin organ . Current therapy active Crohn 's disease consist symptomatic treatment , nutritional therapy , salicylates immunosuppressant surgical management . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-a ) play central role initiation amplification granulomatous inflammatory reaction see CD ( van Deventer , 1997 ) . Increased TNF-a present gut mucosa well stool patient active CD ( Braegger et al , 1992 ) . CNI-1493 synthetic guanylhydrazone compound inhibitor TNF-a synthesis . A monoclonal antibody TNF , infliximab , approve treatment CD , patient respond many respond eventually become refractory treatment well . CNI-1493 synthetic compound block production several inflammatory cytokine , include TNF . Because block production multiple inflammatory mediator , may active product target specific cytokine . In addition , biologic , cause hypersensitivity reaction induce formation antibody . The purpose trial determine CNI-1493 safe effective treating patient moderate severe Crohn 's Disease placebo control setting .</detailed_description>
