The timeliness propose study underscored high prevalence co-morbid condition widely untested use combine medication treatment clinical practice . Thus , study fill important gap knowledge regard treatment high risk clinical population . We hypothesize combined fluoxetine naltrexone treatment offer enhance treatment alcoholic co-morbid major depression .
