	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effectiveness combination anti-HIV drug therapy ( protease inhibitor [ PIs ] without ) patient early HIV infection . This study also look whether drug call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) boost immune system patient . Doctors sure anti-HIV drug combination best use patient early HIV infection never receive anti-HIV treatment . PIs anti-HIV drug decrease viral load ( level HIV blood ) . However , PIs cause serious side effect patient . Doctors would like know drug combination contain PI good one contain PIs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Use Protease Inhibitor Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Treatment Early HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies suggest antiretroviral drug regimen non-nucleoside agent efavirenz ( EFV ) combination two nucleoside analogue effective achieve maximal viral suppression . This provide alternative treatment toxic PI-containing regimen . This trial examine whether nonPI regimen EFV beneficial PI-containing regimen use combination two nucleoside analogue . A second part study look whether addition IL-2 may offer immunologic benefit co-administered drug . Patients randomized initiate antiretroviral therapy PI-based ( stavudine/didanosine/ritonavir [ RTV ] /indinavir [ IDV ] ) nonPI-based ( stavudine/didanosine/EFV ) regimen . Within treatment arm , stratify accord positive negative p24 antigen result . At Week 16 , patient achieve maximal viral suppression ( low 50 copies/ml ) option add abacavir ( ABC ) drug intensification therapy . Those achieve virologic suppression ( le 50 copies/ml ) randomize either receive IL-2 . At study entry , 12 month , tissue sample CSF , lymph node , genital secretion obtain , permission . Patients physical exam , woman child-bearing potential pregnancy test , blood sample draw clinic visit 12-16 time year 3 year virologic immunologic evaluation may perform . Compensation time transportation give .</detailed_description>
