	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although tobacco smoking major environmental risk factor COPD , minority smoker develop condition , appear genetic environmental factor important determine risk . There grow interest hypothesis dietary factor modify COPD risk , possibly protect oxidant injury . Available data address hypothesis variety methodological limitation preclude firm conclusion . The study first address hypothesis use data Nurses ' Health Study , large , prospective cohort study detail dietary assessment follow-up interval sufficient duration examine incident COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine relationship dietary factor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) among participant Nurses ' Health Study , ongoing prospective cohort study 121,700 woman , age 39-64 1985 . This cohort follow mean biennial questionnaire inquire variety topic , include dietary intake ( use validate semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire ) physician diagnosis COPD . In 1998 , participant history COPD send supplementary questionnaire regard specific COPD diagnosis relate topic . The study examine relation dietary factor risk newly-diagnosed COPD 1985-1998 . During time period , approximately 2,100 case `` confirm '' COPD ( i.e. , physician diagnosis pulmonary function test [ PFTs ] time diagnosis abnormal FEV-I past year ) `` probable '' COPD ( i.e. , physician diagnosis recent respiratory symptom , PFTs know ) . Preliminary data support validity case definition , examine review 600 medical record . Likewise , potential under-diagnosis examine random sample past current smoker never report COPD asthma . The specific dietary hypothesis high intake antioxidant ( e.g. , vitamin C , vitamin E , carotenoid ) , magnesium , potassium , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( e.g. , fish oil ) decrease risk COPD , whereas high intake specific fatty acid ( e.g. , linoieic acid ) increase risk . The cohort size 13-year follow-up provide &gt; 90 percent power detect trend across quintiles dietary intake . In 1998 , among approximately 2,400 prevalent case diet data , study investigator address secondary aim : determine relation dietary factor COPD severity 1998-2000 . COPD severity assess self-report current medication , recent symptom , activity limitation , health care utilization ( e.g. , emergency room urgent office visit COPD exacerbation ) . The rise prevalence COPD , particularly among woman , along high societal cost , make COPD prevention important public health goal . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
