	<brief_summary>The feasibility dose-limiting toxicity administer escalate dos dendritic cell transfected autologous renal cell carcinoma RNA DC ( DCRCC-RNA ) define . As secondary endpoint , ability DCRCC-RNA induce tumor-specific immune response evaluate . Finally , anti-tumor effect measure clinical response criterion , duration overall survival ( calculated 2-year follow-up ) determine patient receive dendritic cell therapy . Background : Prognosis metastatic renal cell carcinoma poor median survival less one year . Although renal cell carcinoma show response immunotherapy , result systemic administration biologic response modifier disseminate renal cell carcinoma poor . Growing evidence suggest active immunotherapy , particularly dendritic cell ( DC ) base vaccine , may prove viable clinically effective therapeutic option patient advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : This study enroll patient renal cell carcinoma Stage III ( T3 N1 M0 ) Stage IV ( T4 N0 N1 M0 - T N2 M0 - T N M1 ) nephrectomy . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell collect leukapheresis process DC generation . Mononuclear cell separate cultured 7 day GM-CSF IL-4 . Harvested DC pulse renal tumor RNA harvest nephrectomy . An aliquot cell test appropriate phenotype fungal bacterial sterility well endotoxin content prior lot release . Renal tumor RNA transfected DC store cryopreserved administration . The first 3 patient enrol low dose monitor dose limit toxicity . If dose limit toxicity see , next 3 patient enrolled medium dose . If dose limit toxicity see medium dose , 6 additional patient enrol high dose evaluate dose limit toxicity . If preparation vaccine insufficient RNA dendritic cell available perform require three injection assign dose level patient withdrawn study treatment position remain open , i.e. , dose fraction give . Patients minimum number DCRCC-RNA produce deliver one I.V . one I.D . injection able receive vaccine , even assign high dose level , replace order ass toxicity . Data Analysis 1 . To determine short long term toxicity associate administration DCRCC-RNA patient metastatic RCC . 2 . To determine feasibility DC vaccine generation accord proportion patient sufficient cell generate provide treatment . 3 . To determine cellular immune response administration DCRCC-RNA . 4 . To measure clinical response mediate administration DCRCC-RNA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients metastatic RCC follow resection primary renal tumor ( Pathologic diagnosis stag disease complete time surgery ) . Patients must performance status 0 1 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) criterion must estimate life expectancy 6 month . Patients must undergo major surgery past 6 week . In addition chemotherapeutic agent , ( standard experimental ) radiation therapy , ( local therapy palliative treatment painful bony metastasis ) immunotherapy ( i.e . IL2 , interferonalpha , ALT therapy ) administer 6 week prior enrollment . Patients must recover acute toxicity prior treatment . Adequate hematologic function : WBC 3000 mm3 , hemoglobin 9 mg/dl , platelet 100,000/mm3 Patients may transfuse meet eligibility criterion . Adequate renal hepatic function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl , bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl Adequate coagulation parameter : Partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.5 x control Ability understand provide sign inform consent fulfills Institutional Review Board guideline Ability return Duke University Medical Center adequate followup require protocol . Women pregnant nursing woman exclude . Patients radical nephrectomy exclude since tumor tissue retrieve vaccine generate . Patients either previously irradiate new CNS ( central nervous system ) metastasis determine enhanced cranial CT MRI prior enrollment . Patients history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Patients serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider P.I . constitute unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . Medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol . Patients prior history another malignancy within last 5 year ( exclude basal cell carcinoma , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , control superficial bladder cancer ) . Presence active acute chronic infection , include symptomatic urinary tract infection , HIV ( determine ELISA confirm Western Blot ) , viral hepatitis ( determine HBsAg Hepatitis C serology ) surgical site infection follow nephrectomy . Any postoperative complication render experimental therapy unduly hazardous i.e . deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism exclude eligibility study . Patients steroid therapy ( immunosuppressive agent azathioprine cyclosporine A ) exclude basis potential immune suppression . Patients must 6 week discontinuation steroid therapy prior enrollment . Patients serum calcium &gt; 12 mg/dl symptomatic hypercalcemia . Documented active treatment hypercalcemia allow . Patients inadequate peripheral vein access perform leukapheresis .</criteria>
