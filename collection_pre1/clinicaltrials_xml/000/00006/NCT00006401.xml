	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide Preventing Chronic Lung Disease Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite advance medical , nursing , respiratory care , CLD affect 50 percent premature infant . As result , nearly 50,000 infant United States develop CLD . It desirable investigate therapy decrease incidence CLD associate failure thrive , developmental delay , increase risk pulmonary infection , reactive airway disease , pulmonary hypertension , death . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center study . Three specific hypothesis test : 1 ) iNO reduces incidence CLD ; 2 ) iNO reduces serum lung ( tracheal aspirate ) marker inflammation ; 3 ) iNO increase incidence intraventricular hemorrhage premature neonate . The primary endpoint survival without CLD ( define continue oxygen requirement ) 36 week post conceptional age . A total 793 premature newborn enrol 14 center within 48 hour birth . They randomly assign receive either placebo iNO 5 ppm breathe tube safely remove 21 day . The iNO deliver INOvent delivery system way physicians nurse know treatment participant receiving . Management strategies aspects patient care include mechanical ventilation , surfactant administration , fluid administration , steroid use determine physician center . Serial cranial ultrasound methemoglobin level monitor determine adverse event . The first 200 patient serial blood sample tracheal aspirate obtain measurement inflammatory mediator , include interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , endothelin-1 , myeloperoxidase , neutrophil count ( tracheal aspirate ) , endothelin-1 ( blood ) . Participants see 12 24 month age monitor long-term effect cardiopulmonary neurologic system . At visit , health questionnaire administer Bayley II scale infant development complete .</detailed_description>
