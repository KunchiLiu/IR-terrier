	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Treating Patients With Metastatic Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare pharmacokinetic profile vinorelbine administer intravenously day 1 orally day 8 v reverse order patient metastatic advance solid tumor . II . Determine intersubject variability pharmacokinetics oral vinorelbine . III . Compare safety profile oral vs intravenous vinorelbine patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive vinorelbine IV 20 minute day 1 oral vinorelbine day 8 . Arm II : Patients receive oral vinorelbine day 1 vinorelbine IV 20 minute day 8 . Treatment continue arm absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow 28 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
