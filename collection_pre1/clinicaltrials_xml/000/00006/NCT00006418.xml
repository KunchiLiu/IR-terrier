	<detailed_description>Each site recruit individual large geographic area , use efficient ascertainment strategy assessment procedure order maximize number collect . Subjects think schizophrenia assess personal family interview review medical record . Diagnoses make consensus best-estimate procedure . Blood specimen obtain individual schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder plus available parent also control individual . A clinical self-assessment administer control subject . The assessment include validate self-assessments lifetime major depression , anxiety disorder , substance use , self-reported history bipolar psychotic symptom . Permanent cell line create DNA extract NIMH-sponsored Center Genetic Studies . At end four-year project period , biological material blind pedigree clinical data make available scientific community genetic study schizophrenia related disorder . The control sample , however , release staggered fashion , twice fiscal year , start 2nd year recruitment . The informed consent control include consent specimen use research genetics medical disorder . In year 3 4 , undertake association analysis . Power analyse suggest study excellent power detect locus associate gene relatively small etiologic effect . Data derive study potentially application treatment prevention schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
