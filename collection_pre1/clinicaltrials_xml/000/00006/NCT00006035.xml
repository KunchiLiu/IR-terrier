	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Electroporation therapy may enhance ability chemotherapy drug enter tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy electroporation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase I trial compare effectiveness bleomycin without electroporation therapy treat patient stage III stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bleomycin With Without Electroporation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare objective tumor response rate patient stage III IV melanoma treat intratumoral bleomycin without electroporation therapy . II . Determine safety electroporation therapy patient . III . Compare time heal treatment patient . IV . Compare duration lesion response treatment patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally day 1 . Arm II : Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally follow electroporation therapy intratumorally day 1 . Treatment continue every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm I progressive disease 1 course treatment may cross arm II . Patients follow 4 6 month final treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient ( 10 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
