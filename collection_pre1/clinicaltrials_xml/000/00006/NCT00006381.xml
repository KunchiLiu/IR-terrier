	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy celecoxib trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) woman HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer refractory prior trastuzumab . - Determine safety celecoxib patient . OUTLINE : At least 3 week last dose prior chemotherapy , patient receive oral celecoxib twice daily . Patients continue restart trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute weekly every 3 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within approximately 9 month .</detailed_description>
