	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan explore brain change ( reorganizes ) response learn brain lesion healthy people people various physical disability . Normal volunteer patient disability include blindness , limb amputation , hemispherectomy ( removal cerebral hemisphere ) , stroke may eligible study . Candidates screen medical neurological examination . Participants MRI scan lie still perform certain movement , instruct . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member intercom system time procedure . All participant first scan show brain structure , take 30 minute . A second scan measure blood flow biochemical concentration take 1 2 1/2 hour . Depending disability , patient participate one follow test : - Blindness-This study ability blind people process tactile information . - Stroke- This study mechanisms underlying recovery motor function stroke . The patient perform voluntary movement remain still scan . - Amputation- This study mechanisms underlying ability brain reorganize amputation . The patient move different part body remain still scan . - Hemispherectomy- This study mechanisms underlying ability one side brain control movement arm . The patient make different kind movement scan . Normal volunteer participate one follow test : - Use-dependent plasticity- This evaluate effectiveness amphetamine placebo demonstrate brain flexibility . The volunteer take amphetamine placebo ( inactive pill ) scan perform specific exercise use thumb . - Motor fatigue- This study mechanisms underlie fatigue , affect many patient neurological condition . The volunteer contract muscle forearm hand several minute feel fatigue . - Light deprivation- This evaluate change brain occur light deprivation . The volunteer remain rest scanner 150 minute . - Somatosensory stimulation-This examine whether stimulation wrist cause change hand representation part brain control movement . The volunteer make hand movement different time test . In addition , mild electric shock deliver wrist 2 hour . Although shock intensity regulate avoid pain , may discomfort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol investigate plastic change human cerebral cortex health disease . The overall hypothesis possible identify neuroimaging pattern reflect reorganization human cerebral cortex use fMRI possible obtain information mechanism underlie plastic change use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) GABA . This information potentially important understanding mechanism cortical reorganization operating human . Patients normal volunteer scan rest performance different task . These study provide new information mechanism human plasticity . The MRI technique use purpose functional MRI ( fMRI ) , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) , conventional MRI magnet 1.5 4 tesla .</detailed_description>
