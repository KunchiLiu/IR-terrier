	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether woman major depression lose bone mass faster rate woman without depression . This study also determine drug alendronate maintain increase bone mass premenopausal woman major depression osteoporosis . Depression may major risk factor osteoporosis ; associate abnormally elevated stress hormone level may contribute bone loss . This study evaluate bone mass woman depression healthy volunteer . Participants undergo psychiatric , medical , dietary , stress hormone evaluation bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurement . Participants depression divide two group : normal BMD low BMD . Depressed participant normal BMD compare control group healthy premenopausal woman normal BMD follow 36 month . Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) determination make month 6 , 12 , 24 36 ; bone turnover endocrine parameter depression measure every 3 6 month . Participants depression low BMD randomly assign receive either alendronate placebo ( inactive pill ) week 24 month . Participants receive calcium vitamin D supplement daily . DEXA determination perform screen , Months 6 , 12 , 18 24 ; bone turnover endocrine parameter depression measure every 3 6 month . For group , four visit may optimally do inpatient stay two night . All remain visit outpatient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Loss Premenopausal Women With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This five-year study natural history bone turn-over depress premenopausal woman , age 21 45 year , normal bone mass , response treatment alendronate depress premenopausal woman , age 21 45 low bone mass ( indicated bone mineral density ( BMD ) negative 1.5 SD peak bone mass spine and/or hip ) . Osteopenia define BMD spine and/or hip negative 1.5 negative 2.5 SD ; osteoporosis define BMD negative 2.5 SD spine and/or hip . During initial screening , woman evaluate depression . Women meet DSM-IV diagnostic criterion Major Depressive Disorder indicate structured psychiatric interview ( SCID-IV HAM-D ) , undergo DEXA scan determine BMD . Participants divide four subcategories base BMD result . Premenopausal depressed woman normal BMD ( less negative 1 SD average peak bone mass spine and/or hip ) ( Group B ) match age , race , body mass index control group healthy , premenopausal , non-depressed woman normal bone mass ( Group A ) . Groups A B follow 12 month DEXA determination every 6 month , measurement bone turnover marker every 3 month , measurement relevant endocrine parameter every 3 month , exercise substudy 0 , 6 , 12 month , collection DNA sample one visit . Women depression low BMD ( negative 1.5 SD peak bone mass spine and/or hip ) enter 12-month , placebo-controlled , clinical trial randomize either blind alendronate 70 mg week ( Group C ) blind placebo week ( Group D ) . In addition alendronate 70 mg week placebo week , woman Groups C D also receive daily 500 mg elemental calcium 400 IU vitamin D. DEXA determination perform Screening , Month 0 , Month 6 , Month 12 . Determination biochemical marker bone turnover endocrine parameter relevant depression perform 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . An exercise substudy perform 0 , 6 , 12 month . The collection DNA sample also perform one visit .</detailed_description>
