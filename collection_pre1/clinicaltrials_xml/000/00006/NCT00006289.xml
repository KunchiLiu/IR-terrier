	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness drug neurotropin treat chronic pain injury limb large nerve . Two group patient participate study : patient complex regional pain syndrome type 1 , CRPS-I ( also call reflex sympathetic dystrophy ) patient complex regional pain syndrome type 2 , CRPS-II . CRPS-I pain develop relatively minor injury arm leg , last much longer much severe would normally expect . CRPS-II pain result injury large nerve . Candidates history physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Patients CRPS I II receive individualize regimen physical therapy standard treatment control pain . In addition , receive neurotropin placebo tablet 5 week , trial medicine least 1 week , trial drug next 5 week . That , patient take placebo first 5 week take neurotropin second 5 week vice versa . Neither patient doctor know receive drug two interval study . Patients complete questionnaire pain , quality life , ability perform daily live activity . They various test measure pain ( sensitivity heat cold , electric current , mild pin prick , etc . ) ; provide information change condition ( test range motion joint limb size ) ; measure blood circulation sweat arm leg ( measurement blood flow limb , skin temperature , sweat production ) , procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy ( RSD ) , re-named Complex Regional Pain Syndrome , type I ( CRPS-I ) , chronic , post-traumatic pain spread beyond distribution single peripheral nerve without evidence major peripheral nerve damage . A similar disorder , Causalgia , re-named CRPS-II , present clear evidence nerve injury . No successful drug treatment exist disorder . Neurotropin non-protein extract cutaneous tissue rabbit inoculate vaccinia virus . Neurotropin use extensively Japan treat RSD painful condition ; however , drug undergone clinical therapeutic testing United States . This protocol carry double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study clinical efficacy Neurotropin acute pain dental outpatient chronic pain outpatient CRPS-I II .</detailed_description>
