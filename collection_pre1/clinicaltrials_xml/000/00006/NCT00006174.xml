	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness letrozole treat precocious ( early ) puberty girls McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) . The physical change puberty , breast enlargement , menstruation growth spurt , well emotional change developmental stage , usually begin girl age 8 14 . Girls MAS , however , often begin puberty age 7 . In MAS , large ovarian cyst produce high level estrogen ( female hormone ) cause change puberty . Children MAS also polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ( PFD ) , disease bone , depend part skeleton affect , lead broken bone disfigurement head , face , arm legs , cause pressure nerve blood vessel . Many child MAS cafe-au-lait spot ( increase pigmentation ) area skin well . Letrozole estrogen-lowering drug approve treat woman breast cancer . Although drug test approve use child , pediatric specialist give girl precocious puberty MAS find improve condition without harmful side effect . This study examine whether letrozole lower estrogen girl MAS arrest puberty . It also study drug 's effect substance involve bone growth , include calcium , phosphate amino acid . Girls 1 8 year old MAS may eligible study . Patients enrol NIH protocol 98-D-0145 ( Screening Natural History Patients Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright syndrome ) also eligible . Participants admit hospital 2 3 day every 3 month 15 month , total 6 visit . They undergo complete history physical examination routine blood urine test every visit , well evaluation general health , growth bone development , endocrine system ( hormone-secreting gland ) status PFD status . A hand X-ray take first visit every 6 month measure bone age advance . The child begin take letrozole second visit continue drug 6 month . They evaluate 3 month 6 month drug ( visit 3 4 ) , 3 month 6 month stop treatment ( visit 5 6 ) . Parents child weigh 18 kilogram ( 40 pound ) may ask extra blood may draw 3 month ( visit 3 ) 6 month ( visit 4 ) treatment measure letrozole level . The blood drawn morning dose 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 hour dose indwell needle place vein 8 24 hour . Parents keep record episodes menstrual bleeding symptom complaint . Children respond well therapy ( decreased menses , slow breast development , slow growth bone age advance ) offer another 12 month letrozole treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Letrozole Precocious Puberty Due McCune Albright Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Girls age 1 - 8 year McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) girls condition characterize precocious puberty due estrogen hypersecretion ovarian cyst eligible pilot study . Patients previously enrol Protocol 98-D-0145 ( Screening natural history patient polyostotic fibrous dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome ) also eligible . Patients treated letrozole , potent , nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor , suppress elevate serum estrogen level . We confirm safety efficacy letrozole , study effectiveness control elevate sex steroid level , advance rate linear growth , bone maturation , pubertal progression patient . We also study effect decrease estrogen level status polyostotic fibrous dysplasia measure serum urine value bone biomarkers , include calcium , phosphate , organic amino acid , vitamin D metabolite , know abnormal many patient MAS . Patients act control . We compare serum urine parameter pubertal progression bone biomarkers , , discontinuation letrozole . This trial carry parallel in-vitro in-vivo laboratory study use animal model fibrous dysplasia . In model , osteogenic precursor cell patient bone biopsy culture hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate matrix transplant immunocompromised mouse . We anticipate laboratory finding complement care patient , result effective treatment precocious puberty bone disease child MAS . Because initial study indicate letrozole effective treat precocious puberty MAS patient , protocol also enroll girl related condition , gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty without bone disease polyostotic fibrous dysplasia . We also believe study complement recent FDA NIH mandate child include evaluation pharmaceutical product federally fund clinical research study .</detailed_description>
