	<brief_summary>Too much little genetic information ( chromosome material ) cause abnormal development fetus death . Each year approximately 2.5 million pregnant woman screen Down Syndrome use invasive screening method ( amniocentesis chorionic villus sample ) . This 11 center study 38,000 woman compare accuracy several non-invasive test first second trimester pregnancy versus amniocentesis diagnosis birth diagnose aneuploidy Down Syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The FASTER ( First Second Trimester Evaluation Risk ) Trial multicenter prospective study compare accuracy first second trimester non-invasive screening method Down syndrome aneuploidy diagnosis delivery miscarriage/fetal loss ) . All woman receive two non-invasive test battery first second trimester . The accuracy result different combination non-invasive test compare diagnosis delivery miscarriage later fetal loss . First trimester screen involve ultrasound measurement fetal nuchal translucency ( NT ) thickness 10-14 week gestation , together maternal age , serum level pregnancy associate plasma protein-A ( PPAP-A ) free-beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( FbhCG ) . Second trimester screen base current standard care serum `` triple screen '' , consist alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) , unconjugated estriol ( uE3 ) , hCG , perform 15-18 week gestation , together maternal age new serum marker inhibin-A . If patient screen positive ( risk &gt; /= 1 380 ) , patient notify offer invasive test 15 week ( serum `` quad '' test , additional tube blood analysis presence fetal nucleate erythrocyte maternal blood [ NIFTY : National Institute Child Health Human Development Fetal Cell Study ] ) , amniocentesis accept ) . True positive case receive counsel . True negative case , decline invasive testing , screen negative serum `` quad '' test , receive routine care final pediatric outcome . Patients priori risk Down Syndrome may elect invasive fetal test 15 week quad test . For fetus NT measurement great 3 mm , karyotype find normal amniocentesis , follow repeat ultrasound examination 18 20 week gestation , evaluate fetal anatomy , particularly fetal cardiac structure . Final pediatric examination information obtain follow delivery . If pregnancy result miscarriage later fetal loss , attempt make karyotype fetal tissue . This especially important pregnancy abort spontaneously time first second trimester method screen . Pregnancy outcome data obtain case .</detailed_description>
