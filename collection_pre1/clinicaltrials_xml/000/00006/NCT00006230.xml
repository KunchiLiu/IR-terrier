	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate duration response patient advanced ovarian cancer treat nitrocamptothecin . - Determine probability objective response express response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease status ( sensitive v refractory ) . Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily 5 consecutive day week 3 week . Treatment continue every 3 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease ( SD ) receive 4 additional course past SD . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) receive minimum 2 additional course past PR CR . Patients follow every 6 week disease progression initiation another antitumor therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 28-50 patient ( 14-25 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
