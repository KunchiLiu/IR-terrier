	<brief_summary>This study test whether new islet transplant procedure enable patient type 1 diabetes mellitus stop insulin therapy . Islets cell cluster pancreas contain insulin-producing cell . The new procedure feature three important advance , first develop group Edmonton , Canada , way islet transplant traditionally perform : 1 ) islet transplant immediately remove donor ; 2 ) islet transplant two different donor order obtain number islet normal pancreas ; 3 ) anti-rejection drug regimen design reduce harmful side effect `` condition '' chemotherapy . ( In standard transplant procedure , patient receive intensive chemotherapy follow transplant . This study use radiation lower-dose chemotherapy . ) Patients age 18 65 diagnosis type 1 diabetes mellitus least 5 year may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , chest X-ray tuberculin skin test , electrocardiogram exercise test heart function , abdominal ultrasound , psychological evaluation , arginine stimulate c-peptide test . The latter test determines patient produce insulin . Eligibility restrict patient make insulin . The study active phase last 15 month follow-up continue indefinitely . Patients receive 10,000 `` islet equivalent '' per kilogram ( 2.2 pound ) body weight . This likely require two separate transplant procedure two donor . Before first surgery , patient give anti-rejection ( immune suppressing ) drug , include FK506 rapamycin ( orally ) daclizumab ( intravenously ) . The islet infuse tube place portal vein ( large vein feed liver ) . After surgery , patient receive insulin intravenously 24 hour . They abdominal ultrasound blood test determine liver function . If few 10,000 islet transplant , patient continue insulin treatment , dosage adjust account transplanted islet . They take Daclizumab every 2 week , FK506 rapamycin daily . Blood test follow much drug blood stream perform daily first weekly blood level drug stabilize . They give antibiotic prevent infection . The arginine test repeat 2 week transplant periodically thereafter . Blood drawn weekly check drug level , monthly test . The investigator track daily insulin requirement , record monthly . Patients require second transplant achieve require amount islet return procedure compatible organ donate . The second procedure do described . As , insulin infuse 24 hour follow surgery . It stop , however , resume unless blood glucose level reach 180 milligrams/deciliter . Patients continue take FK506 rapamycin indefinitely . Daclizumab give every 2 week 4 dos follow second transplant , stop . Patients take antiviral call ganciclovir 14 week another antibiotic 1 year follow surgery . For first year surgery , patient frequent blood test monitor drug level immune function . They return NIH complete history physical examination 2 3 year final islet transplant contact yearly phone ascertain general health status whether remain insulin independent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Solitary Islet Transplantation Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Using Steroid Sparing Immunosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We test whether pancreatic islet isolate cadaveric human donor pancreata transplant portal vein patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) way achieve insulin independence recipient . The protocol employ define islet isolation procedure , percutaneous islet infusion recipient portal vein via intra-portal catheter , tight glycemic control peri-transplant period , novel immunosuppressive protocol avoids glucocorticoid . Up 20 patient age 18 65 diagnosed T1DM least five year detectable endogenous insulin produce capacity enrol . Since study call least 10,000 islet equivalent ( IEQs ) per kilogram recipient body weight transplant , since typical human pancreas yield approximately 2.0 4.0 time 105 IEQs , protocol enrollee require islet isolate two different donor . Islets transplant shortly isolation , since human donor pancreata available unpredictable time , time islet transplant procedure also unpredictable . The study primary end-point insulin independence one year follow transplantation least 10,000 IEQs per kilogram recipient body weight . Secondary endpoint evidence partial islet function reflect stimulated c-peptide secretion , Hgb A1c 7.0 % less , absence severe hypoglycemia . Additional secondary endpoint determine : 1 ) immune parameter predictive islet loss , 2 ) islet transplantation effect renal function 3 ) protocol influence fast lipid profile .</detailed_description>
