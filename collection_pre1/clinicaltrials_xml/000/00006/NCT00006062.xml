	<brief_summary>This phase I study experimental anticancer drug oxaliplatin . It design establish maximum dose drug give safely patient cancer impair liver function determine drug 's side effect . It also examine liver function affect drug 's elimination body . The liver play important role elimination many anticancer drug , patient impair liver function take certain drug take reduce dos . Patients 18 year age old cancer metastasize ( spread original tumor site ) standard treatment available longer effective may eligible study . Candidates screen various test procedure may include physical examination , computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , chest X-rays , blood urine test . Participants give oxaliplatin dos determine accord level liver function . Patients may normal liver function mildly , moderately severely impaired liver function , may liver transplant . Oxaliplatin infuse intravenously ( vein ) two hour first day 21-day treatment cycles-that , every 3 week . Treatment continue long cancer control side effect require stop drug . Urine collect 48 hour infusion determine much drug eliminate urine . Blood test do monitor safety treatment , image study , X-rays , CT MRI scan , do periodically evaluate tumor 's response treatment . Special blood test also do study oxaliplatin eliminate body . With first dose drug , blood sample collect infusion begin , end , 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour infusion , 1 week 3 week later . Additional blood sample may collect third treatment cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin diaminocyclohexane platinum derivative know anticancer activity solid tumor . The recommended single-agent dose oxaliplatin adult cancer patient 130 mg/m ( 2 ) give intravenously 2 hour every 3 week . Hepatic metabolism major route drug elimination many anti-cancer agent . Although limited safety pharmacokinetic data oxaliplatin patient renal impairment , currently data regard disposition patient liver dysfunction . This phase I pharmacologic study single agent oxaliplatin conduct adult cancer patient advanced malignancy vary degree liver dysfunction . Patients stratify five group base upon degree liver dysfunction assess liver function test . Group A consist patient normal hepatic function serve pharmacologic control . Group E consist patient receive liver transplant . The remain 3 group start different dos oxaliplatin base hepatic dysfunction dose escalation group proceed manner accordance standard phase I trial 3 patient per dose level dose limit toxicity observe . Pharmacokinetic monitoring perform patient study . The goal trial define toxicity pharmacokinetics single agent oxaliplatin patient population determine recommend dos oxaliplatin patient different degree hepatic impairment .</detailed_description>
