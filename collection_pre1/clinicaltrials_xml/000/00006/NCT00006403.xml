	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent epidemiologic evidence suggest inflammation play major role development coronary artery disease . High sensitivity C-reactive protein assay show independent risk factor development atherosclerosis . Measurements C-reactive protein also add predictive value lipid level determine risk cardiovascular disease . Levels inflammatory marker may also correlate response commonly use lipid lower agent . The exact role inflammation coronary artery disease clear ; however , suggest inflammation may marker subclinical cardiovascular disease , may indicate presence vulnerable plaque . In addition possible causative agent development atherogenesis , postulate inflammatory marker may reflect event predict development myocardial event . The fact agent aspirin pravastatin , know anti-inflammatory effect , effective agent prevention atherosclerosis suggest possibility prevention inflammation may play important role reduction risk cardiovascular disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study assess inflammatory marker 3,765 men woman Framingham Study . The marker include inflammatory ( C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , endothelin-1 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) oxidative stress marker ( 8-epi-PGF 2alpha , thromboxane B2 ) . The relation CVD risk factor systemic marker vascular inflammation determine . The relation inflammatory marker , endothelial dysfunction , subclinical disease analyze . Markers inflammation relate prevalent incident cardiovascular disease event adjust standard risk factor . The central hypothesis inflammatory marker independent risk factor cardiovascular disease event endothelial dysfunction operate causal pathway . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
