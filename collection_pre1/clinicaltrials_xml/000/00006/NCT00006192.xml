	<brief_summary>To document cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease risk factor among 1,200 Native Alaskans member approximately 40 family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics Coronary Artery Disease Alaskan Natives ( GOCADAN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There many compelling reason study heart disease Native Alaskans . These Eskimo village remote isolate . The traditional lifestyle erode mechanization westernize diet . There relatively little outside genetic influence , like American Indians low 48 state , begin show marked acceleration prevalence atherosclerosis coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study family-based , cross sectional study . Recognized emerge risk factor prevalent cardiovascular disease document individual standardized interview , physical exam , laboratory measurement , carotid ultrasound , ECG , review centralize medical record . Assays make contemporary sample serum specimen store Anchorage Center CDC antedate study ( 10 20 year ago ) specific marker inflammation serologic response . Through ten-centimorgan genetic map , attempt make find specific gene relate cardiovascular disease . The study use standard method assess risk factor relate lipid metabolism , hypertension , diabetes mellitus . Importantly , study also use state-of-the-art method detection infectious disease exposure , specifically C. pneumoniae , cytomegalovirus , infectious agent hypothesize play role atherogenesis . A case-control age-matched design use analyze infectious disease burden .</detailed_description>
