	<brief_title>A Study Patients Who Recently Have Been Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary early HIV infection represent potentially unique opportunity well understand pathogenesis HIV infection , well potentially prevent establishment latent infection . Approved antiretroviral therapy able reduce plasma viremia unmeasurable level establish infection several group observe comparable effect recently infect adult . This study design evaluate follow cohort patient primary early HIV infection evaluate time course latent infection whether latent infection CD4 cell allow viral persistence despite antiretroviral therapy . Patients begin antiretroviral therapy within 7 day enrollment . All patient evaluate treatment compliance complete compliance questionnaire regularly . Clinical evaluation , include CD4 , CD8 , HIV RNA count also do regularly . Antiretroviral therapy discontinue detectable virus ultrasensitive assay culture technique plasma , PBMCs , lymphoid tissue . In subset patient , genital secretion CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ) evaluate . If relapse occur , antiretroviral therapy re-instituted . In addition , virology immunology substudies perform .</detailed_description>
