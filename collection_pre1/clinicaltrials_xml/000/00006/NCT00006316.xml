	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether stop preventive histoplasmosis medication patient currently receive effective anti-HIV drug place risk get histoplasmosis . Histoplasmosis serious opportunistic ( AIDS-related ) infection respond well antifungal medication . Before anti-HIV drug , patient histoplasmosis require lifelong antifungal therapy . Patients take anti-HIV drug long time may see improvement immune system function . Improved immune function may eliminate need long-term preventive treatment antifungal agent . Doctors want see improve immune function allow preventive treatment histoplasmosis stop . ( This study change include histoplasmosis treatment drug itraconazole . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Withdrawal Antifungal Treatment Histoplasmosis Patients After Improved Immune Response Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Histoplasmosis serious opportunistic infection person AIDS demonstrate excellent response antifungal therapy . However , advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , patient histoplasmosis require lifelong suppressive antifungal therapy . It think immune reconstitution result HAART may diminish need chronic therapy . Histoplasmosis offer opportunity examine concept discontinuation maintenance therapy rapidly diagnose effectively treat itraconazole [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/27/00 : appropriate therapy disseminate histoplasmosis ] relapse occur . Patients discontinue antifungal maintenance therapy . Patients see routine visit every 8 week urine serum specimen collect real time Histoplasma antigen test immunologic parameter . Patients suspect recurrence , determine clinical routine laboratory finding consistent recurrent histoplasmosis , reevaluate within 1 week onset finding . Patients suspect recurrence base serum urine Histoplasma antigen rise 2 unit , absence clinical routine laboratory finding consistent histoplasmosis , reevaluate within 2 week . All patient suspect recurrence frequent evaluation additional laboratory test . Those negative study resume bimonthly follow-up . All patient develop proven ( positive culture positive fungal stain tissue body fluid ) probable relapse ( clinical finding relapse increase antigen 4.1 unit , clinical finding increase antigen level repeat test recent antigen test demonstrate increase antigen 4.1 unit ) experience persistent reduction CD4 cell count 100/mm3 antifungal induction therapy reinstituted . Patients remain study least 12 month regular follow-up/evaluations .</detailed_description>
