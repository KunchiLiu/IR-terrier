	<brief_title>Mistletoe Lectin Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity mistletoe lectin ( recombinant viscumin ) patient advance solid tumor fail standard therapy . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine whether induction antibody recombinant viscumin occurs patient . - Determine whether immunological stimulation RNA level immune cell occur patient treated regimen . - Determine whether modification endothelial parameter occur patient treated regimen . - Determine objective response rate patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive mistletoe lectin ( recombinant viscumin ) IV 1 hour twice weekly . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-3 patient receive escalate dos recombinant viscumin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 20 % patient experience dose-limiting toxicity first course . Additional patient treat MTD . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression initiation another therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
