	<brief_title>Flavonoids Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Basic science , clinical observation , epidemiologic study contribute emerge body evidence potential role flavonoid , group polyphenolic compound antioxidant property , prevention cardiovascular disease . However , exist study flavonoid food source provide inconsistent result , usually focus primary prevention coronary heart disease mortality . The study use small grant mechanism ( R03 ) analyze previously collect data . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator examine whether flavonoid intake associate risk incident CVD , whether specific food source flavonoid -- include tea , onion , apple , red wine , food -- associate risk incident CVD . The investigator process analyze previously collect data 39,876 middle-aged old woman free CVD ; Women 's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study ( WACS ) , prospective study 8,171 middle-aged old woman pre-existing CVD three coronary risk factor ; Normative Aging Study ( NAS ) , prospective study 2,280 middle-aged old men ; Boston Area Health Study ( BAHS ) , case-control study first nonfatal myocardial infarction men woman age less 76 year . Using data semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire administer study , investigator determine individual intake flavonoid food source . Unlike previous study , examine flavonoid relation primary secondary prevention incident cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , consist confirm case nonfatal myocardial infarction ( Ml ) , nonfatal stroke , revascularization procedure , CVD death . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
