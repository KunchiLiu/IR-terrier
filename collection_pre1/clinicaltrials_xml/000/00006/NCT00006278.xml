	<brief_summary>This study design provide information cause two unusual type Cushing 's syndrome evaluate quality life cure disease . In Cushing 's syndrome , adrenal gland produce much hormone cortisol . This often cause weight gain , skin change ( bruise stretch mark ) , mood change irritability , easy cry depression . Adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) normally regulate cortisol production ; cortisol low , ACTH rise , stimulate adrenal produce cortisol , cortisol high , ACTH level fall . In two form Cushing 's syndrome , however , adrenal gland produce cortisol even ACTH low . Patients 18 year age old Cushing 's syndrome related ACTH production may participate study . Candidates history physical examination , electrocardiogram , urine , blood saliva test , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan one adrenal gland . They fill questionnaire disease symptom , quality life , basic information , marital status , education level , place residence , etc . Finally , corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) test confirm form Cushing 's syndrome study protocol . This test involve collect blood sample interval administration sheep CRH measure cortisol ACTH level . Participants undergo 3 7 day test determine cortisol level rise take certain medicine eat certain food . These food medicine , choose mimic stimulate substance already body , : glucagon , ACTH , gonadotropin-releasing hormone , vasopressin , thyrotropin-releasing hormone , mixed meal consist protein , carbohydrate fat ( usually chicken breast milkshake-like drink ) . Blood collect interval take food medicine measure cortisol blood level . Blood also collect patient stand position lie bed , change posture cause substance body increase decrease . Depending individual 's response test , additional test may do insulin , glucose , luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone . Patients respond substance undergo adrenalectomy ( surgery remove one adrenal gland ) . This standard treatment type Cushing 's syndrome . It usually do laparoscopy , air inject abdomen tube insert small incision , enable surgeon see organ remove gland . Part remove tissue examine learn cause type Cushing 's syndrome ; may also use genetic study relate disease . Patients stay hospital week 10 day observation treatment discharge care doctor . They continue complete quality life questionnaire every 3 month 2 year . Patients normal adrenal gland participate National Cancer Institute study schedule adrenalectomy part standard treatment also recruit study serve control . The patient 24-hour urine collection , part adrenal gland tissue remove treatment use research purpose study , possibly include genetic study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cushing 's Syndrome Not Related ACTH Production</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In healthy individual , ACTH major stimulus cortisol production cellular growth adrenal cortex . Normal elevate ACTH level amplify stimulus , lead hypercortisolism growth adrenal gland , clinical condition recognize Cushing 's syndrome . However , patient hypercortisolism Cushing 's syndrome suppress rather normal high level ACTH . This pilot study seek good understand apparently autonomous nature hypercortisolism two benign cause Cushing 's syndrome , adrenal adenoma massive macronodular adrenal disease ( MMAD ) . Patients low level ACTH Cushing 's syndrome undergo routine test confirm hypercortisolism , low ACTH , adenoma MMAD CT scan . They fill questionnaire quality life . They also undergo 3-7 day research test variety agent investigate whether agent increase cortisol . Following , patient schedule adrenalectomy NIH . This standard treatment condition . The abnormal tissue obtain surgery use laboratory study evaluate whether agent may cause excess cortisol production . After surgery , patient discharge care local health care provider , continue fill questionnaire quality life two year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENTS WITH NORMAL ADRENAL GLANDS : Patients normal adrenal gland recruit studied NCI protocol . They take suppressive dos glucocorticoid 12 month , know adrenal pathology , either cortex medulla . They VonHippel Lindau syndrome . PATIENTS WITH ACTHINDEPENDENT CUSHING 'S SYNDROME : Will age 18 old ; Will plasma ACTH level 10 pg/mL less ; Will outside physician follow surgery . Must weigh great 380 pound . These patient unable undergo CT scan . Must CT scan show normal atrophic bilateral adrenal gland . Must CRH test show response define . The diagnosis patient need evaluation . Must condition would preclude surgery , include advanced heart failure , significant coronary artery disease , severe pulmonary disease . Must hematocrit le 30 research blood withdraw great 450 mL previous six week . Must pregnant . Must history angina know coronary artery disease , patient risk exacerbation vasopressin test . The SF36 questionnaire give individual speak read English fluently . Patients may participate remainder study , however , meet criterion .</criteria>
