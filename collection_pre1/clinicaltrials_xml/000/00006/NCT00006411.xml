	<brief_summary>The Cornea Donor Study ( CDS ) design prospective cohort study follow objective : To determine whether graft-failure rate 5-year follow-up period follow corneal transplantation use corneal tissue donor older 65 year age compare tissue young donor . To assess relationship donor/recipient ABO blood type compatibility graft failure due rejection . To assess corneal endothelial cell density indicator health cornea alternate outcome measure ( optional Specular Microscopy Ancillary Study ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study enrol 1101 subject corneal disease consider moderate risk failure ( principally Fuchs ' dystrophy pseudophakic corneal edema ) . A donor cornea meeting follow criterion assign subject one 43 participate eye bank : - donor age 10 75 year - endothelial cell count 2300 3300 - tissue quality good excellent - death preservation time &lt; 12 hr body refrigerate eyes ice &lt; 8 hr - death surgery time &lt; 5 day The cornea surgeon ( investigator ) patient mask donor age characteristic donor cornea . Preoperative management , surgical technique , postoperative care , include prescription medication , provide accord investigator 's customary routine . The follow-up visit schedule initial six month leave investigator 's discretion time minimum follow-up visit schedule include visit six 12 month one visit every 12 month five year . The primary study outcome graft survival five year . The definition graft failure , base definition use Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies , regraft , absence regraft , cloudy cornea loss central graft clarity sufficient compromise vision minimum three consecutive month . Follow-up initial phase study continue five year unless patient regraft study eye . For ABO compatibility study , ABO blood type donor recipient determine order compare rate graft failure ABO-compatible case rate ABO-incompatible case . For Specular Microscopy Ancillary Study , endothelial cell count determine specular image central reading center , relationship cell count donor age assess . In initial phase study , specular image obtain 6 month , annually five year post-transplant . Five-year follow complete November 2007 . The 5-year cumulative probability success 86 % : 86 % &lt; 66.0 year donor age group 86 % &gt; =66.0 year donor age group ( difference = 0 % , upper limit one-sided 95 % confidence interval = 4 % ) . Adjusting baseline endothelial cell density appreciable effect result . In statistical model donor age continuous variable , significant relationship donor age outcome ( P=0.11 ) . Three graft failure due primary donor failure , 8 uncorrectable refractive error , 48 graft rejection , 46 endothelial decompensation , 30 cause . At least one probable definite graft rejection episode precede graft failure 23 46 failure attribute endothelial decompensation ( 4 definite 19 probable ) 18 30 failure attribute cause ( 4 definite 14 probable ) . The distribution cause failure donor age group substantially differ . Although 5-year result indicate difference success rate moderate-risk transplant accord donor age , result SMAS indicate among successful case , slight association donor age endothelial cell loss , cell loss 5 year slightly low cornea young donor ( r adjust baseline endothelial cell density = -0.19 , 95 % confidence interval -0.29 -0.08 ) . Whether slight association cell loss donor age clinical importance know . Of perhaps even great importance , however , find irrespective donor age , endothelial cell loss substantial first five year transplant even graft successful . Half successful case experience cell loss 70 % , five year half endothelial cell density &lt; 800 cells/mm2 . The CDS continue patient follow annually 2012 order determine overall 10-year survival rate moderate risk graft determine whether graft-failure rate relate donor age . Additional objective include determine value endothelial cell density predict graft failure evaluate donor recipient characteristic may predictive late graft failure . All CDS subject active 5-year exam eligible extend follow-up phase . As part Specular Microscopy Ancillary Study , follow-up image obtain extend follow-up phase 7-8 year 10-years . The procedure use first 5 year follow grade 7-8 year 10-year image .</detailed_description>
