	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect experimental drug call NS2330 Parkinson 's disease symptom dyskinesias ( involuntary movement ) develop result long-term treatment levodopa . This drug prevent neurotransmitter dopamine enter nerve cell . Patients 18 75 year old moderately advance Parkinson 's disease motor problem result levodopa therapy may eligible 5-week study . Candidates complete medical history physical examination detail neurological evaluation . If need , patient undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan brain chest X-ray . All patient blood urine test electrocardiogram ( EKG ) take write test evaluation depression . Patients enrol study , possible , stop take antiparkinson medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) one month study begin duration . For first 1 3 day , patient undergo levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For study , patient stop take usual oral levodopa medicine instead levodopa infused vein 12 hour . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly either 1 ) parkinsonism symptom improve , 2 ) dyskinesia appear , 3 ) unacceptable side effect occur , 4 ) maximum study dose reach . When patient 's optimal dose determine , treatment begin . Patients take three pill contain NS2330 placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) 3 day week 5 week , addition regular levodopa medication . All participant receive placebo point study ; patient receive placebo throughout entire 5 week . On treatment day , patient brief medical examination receive drug monitor side effect 6 8 hour take drug . At begin week 2 5 , levodopa infusion repeat previously determine optimum rate . Throughout study , parkinsonism symptom , dyskinesias depression evaluate . Blood urine sample collect week standard safety test , blood also draw periodically measure NS2330 level .</brief_summary>
