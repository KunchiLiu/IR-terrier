	<brief_title>Dose/Response Exercise Long Term Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Exercise key component behavioral weight loss program effect weight loss , body composition , cardiovascular disease risk factor , obesity relate disease type 2 diabetes mellitus . Despite benefit , unclear whether optimal exercise duration and/or intensity enhance long-term weight loss . The current public health recommendation physical activity individual participate least 30 minute moderate intensity physical activity day week ( approximately 150 minute per week total ) . However , unclear whether amount exercise adequate long-term weight loss . Moreover , cross-sectional study show individual successful long-term weight loss participate level physical activity great current public health recommendation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The researcher hypothesize adopt high level exercise duration and/or intensity , couple strong behavioral intervention would enhance long-term weight loss . To test hypothesis , recruit 200 overweight woman randomly assign one four treatment group : ( 1 ) moderate intensity , moderate 1000cal/wk duration exercise , ( 2 ) vigorous intensity moderate duration exercise , ( 3 ) moderate 2000cal/wk intensity , high duration exercise , ( 4 ) vigorous intensity , high duration exercise . All subject participate 24-month behavioral weight loss program , subject attend group meeting receive periodic telephone contact weight loss program , subject attend group meeting receive periodic telephone contact interventionists . In addition , facilitate adoption exercise protocol , subject provide home treadmill . Assessment body weight occured 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 month exercise participation measure throughout program . In addition , body composition , cardiorespiratory fitness , cardiovascular disease risk factor , mediator behavior change measure 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 month . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
