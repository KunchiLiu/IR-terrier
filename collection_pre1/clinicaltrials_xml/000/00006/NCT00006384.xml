	<brief_title>SU5416 Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy toxicity SU5416 combine interferon alfa-2b patient unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive SU5416 IV 30-60 minute twice weekly interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously every 12 hour daily . Treatment continue every 6 week minimum 2 course . Patients achieve partial response stable disease completion course 2 receive additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response may receive additional course , discretion protocol investigator , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression allow stay study measurable lesion increase 100 % baseline measurement . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-31 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
