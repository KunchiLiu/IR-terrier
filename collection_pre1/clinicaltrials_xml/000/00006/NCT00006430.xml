	<brief_summary>Purpose : This protocol propose safety feasibility trial patient metastatic prostate cancer ( stag D1-D3 ) investigate induction antitumor immunity administration culture autologous peripheral blood precursor derive dendritic cell ( DC ) , transfected mRNA amplify autologous prostate tumor tissue . The feasibility dose-limiting toxicity administer escalate dos tumor RNA transfected dendritic cell define . As secondary endpoint , ability tumor RNA transfected dendritic cell induce tumor-specific immune response evaluate . Finally , anti-tumor effect base PSA ( biochemical ) response criterion define . Background : Because prostate cancer incurable metastatic conventional therapy offer clear survival benefit , new therapeutic strategy warrant . This study base premise clinically effective cell mediate immune response prostate tumor elicit activation tumor associate antigen specific T cell . Work perform others group suggest PSA , protein express virtually prostate cancer , serve widely express candidate antigen prostate cancer immunotherapy . In particular , show cultured dendritic cell transfected mRNA encode PSA remarkably effective stimulating antigen specific immunity vitro . Therefore , hypothesize administration PSA RNA transfected DC lead detectable level PSA specific CTL peripheral blood patient PSA express metastatic prostate cancer . It hop T cell response also clinical antitumor activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : Patients undergo percutaneous needle biopsy either primary metastatic site obtain tumor tissue . Patients sufficient tumor mRNA amplify PCR transfect assign dendritic cell dose undergo leukapheresis peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture vitro 7 day GM-CSF IL-4 generate precursor derive dendritic cell . Dendritic cell cryopreserved later use . On day patient return receive infusion ( week 0 , 2 , 4 ) dendritic cell thaw , reconstitute , transfected amplified total tumor mRNA . Patients receive total 3 treatment consist combined I.V . I.D . injection , study week 0 , 2 , 4 . Repeat leukapheresis perform 2 week last dose determine immune function . PSA level measure prior start treatment 2 week follow last infusion . Patients receive therapy due failure produce sufficient RNA dendritic cell replace order ass toxicity . Data Analysis : 1 . To determine short long term toxicity associate administration tumor RNA dendritic cell patient metastatic prostate cancer . 2 . To determine feasibility dendritic cell vaccine generation accord proportion patient sufficient cell generate provide treatment . 3 . To determine cellular immune response intravenous infusion tumor RNA dendritic cell . 4 . To measure PSA response patient metastatic prostate cancer intravenous infusion tumor RNA dendritic cell .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patient histologic clinically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma ( Stage D1D3 metastatic regional lymphatic , bone , visceral , soft tissue metastasis ) .

Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 month The patient adequate hematologic function : WBC &gt; =3000mm3 , Hemoglobin &gt; =9mg/dl , Platelets &gt; =100,000/mm3 The patient adequate renal hepatic function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.5mg/dl bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl The patient adequate coagulation parameter : PT = 11.313.3 sec PTT = 20.132.9 sec For patient receive medical gonadal androgen suppression , patient may continue hormonally ablative therapy LHRH analogue ( i.e . Gosereline Leuprolide ) . Testosterone level must &lt; 50 mg/l . For patient receive oral nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy ( i.e.flutamide bicalutamide ) experience rise PSA : 4 week period observation must complete follow discontinuation nonsteroidal antiandrogen prior entry . The patient ability understand provide sign inform consent fulfills Institutional Review Board guideline . The patient ability return Duke University Medical Center adequate followup require protocol . The patient receive concurrent chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy . There must least 4 week ( 12 week prior therapy include 89Strontium ) prior therapy study entry . Patients must recover acute toxicity prior treatment . The patient previously irradiate new CNS ( central nervous system ) metastases . ( Preenrollment head CT require indicated clinical sign symptom . ) The patient history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . The patient serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider P.I . constitute unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . The patient serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider P.I . constitute unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment .
