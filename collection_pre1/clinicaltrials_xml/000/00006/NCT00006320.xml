	<brief_summary>This study determine blood level anti-HIV drug pregnant woman change different stage pregnancy change require dosage adjustment order maintain adequate drug level pregnancy . Anti-HIV medication recommend HIV-infected woman pregnancy treat infection , also reduce chance pass virus baby pregnancy . Changes body occur pregnancy may affect body use eliminate drug , reduce level pregnancy . Pregnant woman 18 year age older infect HIV may eligible study . Candidates medical history physical examination , pregnancy test blood test .

	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy currently recommend HIV-1 infect pregnant woman management maternal HIV infection prevention perinatal HIV transmission . Many physiological change occur pregnancy may lead change pharmacokinetics drug . Some pharmacokinetic change may include increase volume distribution total body clearance well decrease oral absorption , area concentration time curve , peak trough concentration . All change may result decrease drug exposure . Other zidovudine , little known pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent pregnancy . A number study suggest correlation trough concentration : IC50 ratio virological response . The objective study examine pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent different stage pregnancy comparison non-pregnant state ( post-partum historical control ) . HIV infect pregnant woman general good health least three antiretroviral drug combination enrol study . Pharmacokinetic profile antiretroviral agent take subject obtain two four time pregnancy around one month post-partum . These data use assess need dosage adjustment therapeutic drug monitor antiretroviral agent pregnancy .</detailed_description>
