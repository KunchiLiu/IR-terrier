	<brief_title>Observational Cohort Study Sodium , Weight Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sodium reduction weight loss lead decrease blood pressure ( BP ) . Among hypertensive , BP lower lead decrease risk MI , stroke , cardiovascular death . Nonetheless , concern raise increase number cardiovascular event among individual low sodium intake large weight change . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prospective observational follow-up Trials Hypertension Prevention ( TOHP ) include cardiovascular event among 4 , 507 survive participant ten clinical center involve Phases I II TOHP . Phase I randomize trial effect non- pharmacologic intervention , include sodium reduction weight loss , BP 18 month follow-up 2,182 participant . Phase II examine effect sodium reduction weight loss BP long 36-month period randomize 2X2 factorial design 2,382 participant . During follow-up Phases I II TOHP , several measure weight sodium excretion carefully obtain participant . The prospective observational follow-up specifically examine whether value , emphasis average level sodium excretion weight change predictive later cardiovascular disease . The follow-up conduct centrally mail Division Preventive Medicine , serve Coordinating Center Phases I II , successful conduct large-scale study mail . Information cardiovascular event subsequent trial period collect June , 2003 , represent average follow-up approximately fourteen year end Phase I eight year end Phase II . This cohort provide unique resource address impact normotensive population salt restriction weight change subsequent cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
