	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Adult study show adiposity , especially visceral adipose tissue , cardiovascular ( CV ) fitness key link lifestyle factor like diet exercise one hand , CV disease . However , little known link juvenile year , process lead CV disease early stage development . The study response Program Announcement issue March 1998 Diet Cardiovascular Disease Risk Children Adolescents . The Program Announcement , jointly issue National Institute Nursing Research NHLBI , seek encourage research relevant development and/or test dietary intervention improve cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk profile child adolescent , especially increase risk CVD development CVD risk factor genetics , family history , socioeconomic status ( SES ) , race/ethnicity , level blood cholesterol blood pressure , factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study determine relation free-living diet exercise total body percent fat ( percent BF ) , visceral adipose tissue CV fitness black white boy girl vary socioeconomic status ( SES ) . The study also determine relation fatness fitness different CVD risk factor . A total 800 15 18 year old , 200 ethnic gender subgroup recruit . Diet assess seven 24-hour recall , exercise two seven-day recall heart rate monitoring . Percent body fat measure dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry , visceral adipose tissue magnetic resonance image CV fitness multi-stage treadmill test . Measurements make major fatness- fitness-related CV disease risk factor ( e.g. , total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol ratio , insulin , systolic blood pressure , leave ventricular mass indexed height , fibrinogen ) . Multivariate univariate analysis conduct determine relationship .</detailed_description>
