	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare safety effectiveness fenofibrate pravastatin treat HIV-positive patient abnormal level fat ( lipid ) blood . Increased lipid blood associate HIV infection anti-HIV drug grow problem . The drug use study know reduce certain lipid , little known safety effectiveness . This study see one drug safer effective , combine drug safest effective way lower lipid . This study change . On June 26 , 2001 , study review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The DSMB independent board monitoring progress study . The review show neither pravastatin fenofibrate alone effective reach cholesterol triglyceride goal . There safety concern . It known combination fenofibrate pravastatin effective safe . Therefore , important continue study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Fenofibrate Pravastatin HIV-Positive Patients With Abnormal Blood Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipid disorder associate HIV infection antiretroviral therapy grow concern . There little information available safety efficacy statins fibrates treatment HIV-associated hyperlipidemia . Fenofibrate pravastatin able reduce low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) triglyceride ( TG ) , unclear whether one therapy effective , combination therapy need achieve desirable reduction LDL TG . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/13/01 : The NIAID HIV Therapeutic Trials Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meet June 26 , 2001 review interim result . The interim monitoring plan study state accrual either single-agent therapy arm stop response rate fail meet pre-specified minimum time interim review . The DSMB find stop criterion meet single-therapy arm . The DSMB recommend patient currently single-agent therapy offer opportunity initiate dual-agent therapy , regardless time study . There safety concern . ] Patients randomize either Arm A Arm B stratify gender , TG level , number cardiovascular risk factor . Patients add daily fenofibrate ( Arm A ) pravastatin ( Arm B ) antiretroviral therapy 48 week . Evaluations Week 12 determine LDL , TG , high-density lipid ( HDL ) level . Patients achieve clinical goal level stay drug rest study . Patients achieve goal Week 12 receive combination pravastatin fenofibrate rest study . At regular clinic visit , patient physical exam question medication , diet , exercise . Blood sample draw clinical evaluation , include lipid profile HIV-1 RNA monitoring . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/13/01 : On June 26 , 2001 , DSMB review interim result determine response rate arm meet stopping rule futility . As result , patient currently single-agent therapy offer opportunity initiate dual-agent therapy regardless time study . No additional accrual sought ; however , exception make patient screening time DSMB review . These patient give option start single- dual-agent therapy . The DSMB recommend patient dual-agent therapy follow 32 week obtain additional safety efficacy data . Further endpoint analyze Week 12 single-agent therapy Week 32 dual-agent therapy . ]</detailed_description>
