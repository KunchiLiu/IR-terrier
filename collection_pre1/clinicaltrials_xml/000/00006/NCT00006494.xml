	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine laboratory test call genotyping phenotyping assess effectiveness antiretroviral drug use treat HIV infection . Some HIV-infected patient measurable level virus blood even though take combination drug therapy-including didanosine , stavudine , efavirenz-against HIV . Genotyping phenotyping use test resistance specific drug , thereby provide information help doctor decide optimal drug treatment give patient . Genotyping identifies mutation , change , virus undergoes allow continue grow despite drug treatment . Phenotyping involve grow virus test tube different amount drug calculate much drug require stop growth . Patients 18 year age old HIV infection viral level 5000 100,000 copy per milliliter blood take antiretroviral therapy least 6 month may eligible study . Candidates screen urine test various blood test , include genotyping phenotyping . Participants series test determine whether drug active HIV . This involve temporarily stop drug study ( i.e. , either efavirenz didanosine stavudine ) . The study procedure follow : 1 . Patients six blood test 10 day measure viral load current anti-HIV medication . On one day two blood test do measure level didanosine stavudine . Efavirenz also measure drug stop . 2 . The patient temporarily stop drug continue take drug . ( Efavirenz stop 3 week ; stavudine didanosine stop 2 week . ) Seven blood test do follow interval measure viral load : For patient stop efavirenz , blood drawn day 13 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24,28 30 . ( Day 0 first day study . ) Patients stop stavudine didanosine blood drawn day 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 24 . Repeat genotype phenotype test also do time , CD4 count ( measurement certain type white blood cell ) do end 2- 3-week period . 3 . The drug stop restart viral load test repeat . For pati ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficacy highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) limit emergence drug-resistant virus strain . Development resistance one antiretroviral drug HAART regimen may result substantial rebound viremia require new drug regimen . The use virus genotyping phenotyping identify drug likely active anti-retroviral experienced patient recommend , test limitation clinical utility yet establish . The goal project investigate correlation phenotype/genotype select antiretroviral agent short-term change viral load upon discontinuation single antiretroviral agent fail regimen . For nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) protease inhibitor , resistance poorly understand ; thus , plan determine whether change viral load occur discontinue drug . If , plan correlate change phenotypic genotypic characteristic . Study participant must stable viral load least 1000 copies/ml bDNA assay despite HAART must receive one anti-retroviral agent designate study : . Baseline viral load establish multiple bDNA sample 10-day period . Next , drug interest withdrawn rest regimen maintain either two week ( NRTIs except 3TC , protease inhibitor ) four week ( 3TC ) discontinuation ass change viral load . Finally , withdrawn agent re-instituted , serial sample change viral load , genotype phenotype follow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In order enroll , subject must : Be HIV infect . Be currently receive highly active antiretroviral therapy . Drugs available expand access compassionate use protocol permit . Have receive least 6 month HAART therapy . Currently receive willing temporarily discontinue select antiretroviral indicated duration . Have viral load 1,000 100,000 copies/ml within 6 week prior screen screen . If one value great 100,000 copy one value less , average two viral load use determine eligibility . Similarly , one value le 1,000 one value great 1,000 , average viral load use determine eligibility . Have two viral load test bDNA method NIH laboratory differ le 20 % ( log10bDNA ) three week prior enrollment . Viral load perform participation another NIAID study acceptable . Alternatively , new patient come clinic permit two screen visit . Have CD4 T cell number great 100 cell within 4 week enrollment great 100 cell within 8 week enrollment recent CD4 cell count available . Be adults age 18 older . Selfreport adequate adherence antiviral medication ( miss one dose drug weekly ) commit work towards adherence study participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : In order enroll , subject must : Have positive pregnancy test . Have evidence recent HIV infection , define history negative HIV ELISA within 12 month screen . Have acute infection might alter viral load previous 4 week . Have receive vaccine previous 4 week . Have symptomatic HIV disease rapid institution salvage regimen would advisable . Be receive concomitant medication concomitant illness malabsorption emesis could expect result inadequate concentration antiretroviral drug . Be receive antiretroviral regimen include drug use concomitantly ( e.g. , stavudine zidovudine ) inadvisable dosage antiretroviral agent . Have laboratory abnormality withdrawal drug drug regimen might consider . For purpose general guidance , Grade III toxicity would result exclusion study exception stable thrombocytopenia proteinuria elevate bilirubin result Gilbert 's syndrome indinavir treatment . Grade II SGOT SGPT might reason study exclusion explain underlying hepatitis pattern recent increase stable baseline . Have genotypic evidence screen would suggest discontinue select antiretroviral would result suboptimal therapy would clearly place remainder regimen risk development new resistance mutation discontinuation period . Two prominent possibility would patient take NNRTI regimens discontinue NRTIs PI component patient genotypes NNRTI mutation . During discontinuation period , would possible patient may acquire new resistance mutation NNRTIs . Genotype may perform part screen perform PMD . Have change antiretroviral regimen past 6 week . Have receive cytotoxic chemotherapy include hydroxyurea last 6 week , anticipate need chemotherapy study . Have evidence active hepatitis B infection wish interrupt either tenofovir 3TC . Have suggestion trend increase decrease viral load past 6 week . Have significant active substance abuse psychiatric illness might interfere study assessment ability return study visit .</criteria>
