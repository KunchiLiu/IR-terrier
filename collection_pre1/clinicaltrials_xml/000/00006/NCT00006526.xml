	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While advance make control coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk factor , especially smoke high dietary fat intake , much decline age-adjusted CHD mortality rate due medical treatment procedural intervention overt CHD well hypertension hypercholesterolemia . In context , availability inexpensive , sensitive specific method noninvasive detection early coronary atherosclerosis asymptomatic advance CHD could allow beneficial treatment target many high-risk individual . The study design determine whether fast-gated helical compute tomography ( FGHCT ) , advance readily-available variant technique ( EBCT ) achieve full promise , could play role . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Dr. Crouse colleague augment ongoing case-control study , HL35333 , `` Carotid Atherosclerosis Progression Study '' HL59503 , `` Vascular Disease , Structure Function '' . HL35333 comprise 280 symptomatic individual &gt; 45 year equally divide men woman , half half without angiographically define coronary artery disease evaluate risk factor extracranial carotid intimal-medial thickness ( ECIMT , B-mode ultrasound ) baseline yearly three year . The grant quantify association coronary artery disease coronary artery disease risk factor ECIMT progression . HL59503 quantify flow-mediated brachial artery reactivity ( FM-BAR ) cohort . Literature review suggest ECIMT predict coronary artery disease status clinical sample less well asymptomatic sample ; longitudinal data ( CLAS study ) suggest progression ECIMT best predict incident coronary artery disease , Electron Beam Computed Tomography ( EBCT ) quantification Coronary Artery Calcium ( CAC ) likely even great discriminatory power coronary artery disease ECIMT . However , EBCT limit accessibility . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
