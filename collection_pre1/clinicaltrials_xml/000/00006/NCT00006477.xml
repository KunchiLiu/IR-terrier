	<brief_title>Mistletoe Lectin Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity mistletoe lectin ( recombinant viscumin ) patient advance solid tumor fail standard therapy . - Determine optimal biologically active dose mistletoe lectin base analysis specific biological surrogate marker , include plasma cytokine level peripheral count activate immune cell immunological stimulation RNA level immune cell . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine whether induction antibody mistletoe lectin occurs patient . - Determine whether modification endothelial parameter occur patient treated regimen . - Determine objective response rate patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive mistletoe lectin ( recombinant viscumin ) subcutaneously twice weekly . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-6 patient receive escalate dos mistletoe lectin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient treat high dose level immediately precede MTD . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression initiation another therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
