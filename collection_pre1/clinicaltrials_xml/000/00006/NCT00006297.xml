	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There high mortality especially cardiovascular disease among patient dialysis . Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) lead contributor high morbidity mortality among end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient , account 36 percent ESRD death ( total annual mortality 23 percent ) . The high mortality among dialysis patient major public health problem ability identify treat risk factor may reduce morbidity mortality would substantial benefit . There well-known risk factor cardiovascular disease certainly related morbidity mortality among dialysis patient , i.e. , relationship hypertension , diabetes , smoking , etc . However , new risk factor could also contribute excess mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prospective study test hypothesis high level several novel risk factor ( Lp ( ) level apo ( ) isoforms ; homocysteine related vitamin ; Chlamydia pneumoniae cytomegalovirus ; C-reactive protein fibrinogen ) traditional risk factor predict high risk ASCVD 925 incident dialysis patient recruit within three month start dialysis . Although factor implicate etiology ASCVD ESRD patient , little prospective data exist . The cohort already recruit collaboration Johns Hopkins 80 Dialysis Clinics Incorporated ( DCI ) clinic ; many important predictor possible confounders measure . Long-term follow-up obtain extend mean followup 2.4 year four year . The investigator 1 ) extend specimen collection , follow-up , instituted standardize review ASCVD event ; 2 ) characterize baseline association novel traditional factor , dialysis modality dose , nutritional status , ASCVD prevalence full cohort use cross-sectional design ; 3 ) determine whether baseline level risk factor predict subsequent incidence ASCVD event , total mortality use prospective cohort study design test priori hypothesize interaction risk factor risk ASCVD ; 4 ) study variability risk factor time use annual measurement random subset 180 patient ( subcohort ) use longitudinal design ; lastly , 5 ) use case-cohort design , utilize subcohort , test whether recent level ASCVD event , baseline level , mean level risk factor predictive ASCVD risk . Baseline data collection include patient health questionnaire standardize review comorbidity use dialysis chart record . Serum , plasma DNA store -80 degree C. patient visit recruitment ( month 0 ) , followup ( month 1,2,3,6,12,8,24 , etc. ) . ASCVD assess review hospital chart , patient care provider questionnaire , HCFA death form . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
