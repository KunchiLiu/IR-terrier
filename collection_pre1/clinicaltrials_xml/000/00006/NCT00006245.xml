	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine flavopiridol paclitaxel treat patient locally advance metastatic esophageal cancer respond previous paclitaxel therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Esophageal Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient paclitaxel-refractory locally advanced metastatic esophageal cancer treat sequential paclitaxel flavopiridol . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Assess quality life patient treat regimen . - Obtain pharmacokinetic information regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 flavopiridol IV continuously 24 hour day 2 weekly 3 week . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , course 1 2 , every 2 course thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within 6-18 month .</detailed_description>
