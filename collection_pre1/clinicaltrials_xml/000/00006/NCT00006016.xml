	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study effectiveness combine thalidomide chemoembolization treat patient liver cancer remove surgery . Thalidomide may stop growth liver cancer stop blood flow tumor . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep chemotherapy drug near tumor . Combining thalidomide chemoembolization may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide Chemoembolization With Doxorubicin Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility potential activity thalidomide patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma undergo chemoembolization predominant tumor mass . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Determine serum level vascular endothelial growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor , tumor necrosis factor alpha patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily begin 4 week first plan chemoembolization procedure . Thalidomide administration stop 24 hour chemoembolization procedure , restart 24 hour completion procedure OR blood count level bilirubin transaminase recover , whichever occurs later . Thalidomide treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo placement visceral arterial catheter . Patients receive doxorubicin chemoemulsion via arterial catheter 1 hepatic lobe angiographic guidance . Immediately delivery chemoemulsion , patient undergo particulate embolization . The opposite lobe , involve , treat within 3-5 week treatment initial lobe . Patients reevaluate repeat chemoembolization within 8-12 week last chemoembolization . For eligible patient , lobe treat separately second time , sequence , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 75 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
