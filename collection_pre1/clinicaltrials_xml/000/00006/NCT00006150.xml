Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome ( AD-HIES ; Job 's syndrome ) cause STAT3 mutation , multisystem disorder skeletal , vascular , connective tissue manifestation . Understanding STAT3 mutation cause diverse clinical manifestation critical complete understand bone metabolism , bronchiectasis , dental maturation , atherosclerosis . Mutations DOCK8 cause many case autosomalrecessive Hyper IgE syndrome . These individual suffer extensive viral infection well high incidence malignancy mortality . The pathogenesis disease investigate . Therefore , seek enroll patient family confirm suspected diagnosis HIES syndrome extensive phenotypic genotypic study well disease management .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must refer NIH diagnosis suspicion Hyper IgE syndrome . Family member probands patient refer immune syndrome demonstrate characteristic HIES may also evaluate protocol . Male female patient accept . An inclusion age range construct accommodate atrisk infant bear affected family well able examine member extend family . The extent evaluation tailor patient need , age , condition . The cutaneous manifestation HIE often present birth need management time . Because often AD disorder , important evaluate family member . Family member labs draw genetic test additional lab clinically indicate . Selected family member EBV cell line make family member receive geneticoriented physical examination close examination palate , hyperextensibility , etc . If evaluation information uncovered suggest abnormality relate Hyper IgE syndrome , workup would include chest Xray CT , possible spine film , dental evaluation , dermatology consult , consults procedure deem necessary particular relative . For recessive form HIES , DOCK8 deficiency PGM3 deficiency , family member may evaluate possible donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant necessary . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant woman exclude procedure test may endanger pregnancy fetus due risk radiographic study , anesthesia , certain biopsy . We see flare skin disease pregnancy therefore believe enrol follow patient pregnancy appropriate . Coronary CT angiography perform patient contraindication IV contrast medium . This include patient : 1 ) creatinine value great 1.3 mg/dl , 2 ) history multiple myeloma , 3 ) use metformincontaining product less 24 hour prior contrast medium , 4 ) history significant allergic reaction CT contrast agent despite use premedication .</criteria>
