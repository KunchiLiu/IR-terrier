	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 Cisplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Residual Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall response rate complete response rate patient platinum-refractory ovarian cancer treat infusional Bryostatin-1 give combination intravenous cisplatin . II . To estimate duration response patient . III . To obtain tissue order evaluate molecular determinant apoptosis include : p53 status , WAF1/CIP1 gene expression prior directly chemotherapy , bcl-2 gene expression vivo , bcl-2/bax ratio , p21 , extent apoptosis determine TdT assay ; molecular determinant DNA damage repair include : expression level ERCC1 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously 72 hour immediately follow cisplatin IV 1 hour . Treatment continue every 3 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-32 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
