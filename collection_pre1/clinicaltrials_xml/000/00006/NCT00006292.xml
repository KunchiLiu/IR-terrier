	<brief_summary>This study test whether drug combination methotrexate infliximab ( anti-TNF-alpha antibody ) effective methotrexate alone treat rheumatoid arthritis early disease . ( The Food Drug Administration approve treatment regimen patient long-standing rheumatoid arthritis . ) The study also evaluate effectively magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detect difference development bone damage two treatment group early 6 month . Patients 18 year age old rheumatoid arthritis le 2 year four affect joint may eligible 1-year study . Patients must receive methotrexate treatment past without complete success , must treat previously Anti-Thymocyte therapy . All participant receive 20 Mg./week methotrexate . In addition , patient randomly assign receive monthly infusion infliximab placebo ( fluid contains active drug ) . After 6 month , patient receive active infliximab remain half year study . Patients also receive folic acid ( 1mg/day ) , Vitamin D ( 400 IU/day ) , calcium supplement . They may continue take prednisone ( 10 Mg./day ) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) . Medication dosage adjust need pain joint swell worsen . Over course study , patient come NIH 15 visit undergo follow test procedure : 1 . Joint examination-at every visit . 2 . Drug side effect evaluation-at every visit study study 24 36 month questionnaire fill return . 3 . Hand foot X-rays first visit , 6 month 12 month . 4 . MRIs wrist examine damage bone synovial tissue ( tissue line joint ) -before treatment begin week 15 , 27 54 . For study , patient lie still narrow cylinder ( scanner ) strong magnetic field . A contrast material ( gadolinium ) inject blood enhance image synovium . The MRI take 45 minute . 5 . DEXA scan ( dual emission X-ray absorptiometry ) low spine , one hip one wrist measure bone density ass bone loss-before treatment begin week 27 54 . This X-ray test take 5 10 minute . 6 . CTs ( compute tomography ) one hand ass joint damage wrist-before treatment begin week 27 54 . Only half patient study X-ray study , produce 3-dimensional image hand . It do compare location , size change damage wrist see CT information obtain MRI . The procedure take 5 10 minute complete . 7 . Blood tests-at every visit evaluate treatment response side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current 'gold standard ' measure osseous damage patient RA context clinical trial radiographic evaluation hand foot . However , conventional radiograph insensitive change extend trial duration require reliably document difference important surrogate endpoint different treatment arm . In active treatment control double blind trial patient erosive RA want test whether sensitive image modality , MR image typically involved joint , wrist , detect difference formation erosion two treatment arm few number patient 6 month . We plan enroll total 60 patient study , allocate 20 methotrexate/placebo arm 40 methotrexate/infliximab arm . The anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab combination methotrexate show retard development bone erosion conventional radiograph patient establish rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) one year . We propose use MRI severely involved wrist highly sensitive image modality ass difference development new erosion significantly earlier , 3 6 month ( primary endpoint ) two treatment arm . After 6 month , patient receive open label treatment methotrexate combination infliximab additional 6 month follow one year evaluation . We use MRI ass abnormality 6 month still present 12 month . Concomitantly evaluate use bone cartilage marker well endocrine metabolic marker treatment infliximab .</detailed_description>
