	<brief_title>Amino Acids Urine , Diet , Blood Pressure : International Population Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study analyze data INTERMAP study , international , cooperative , 17-sample population study 4,706 men woman age 40-59 United States , United Kingdom , China , Japan . It provide large amount data available pattern urinary amino acid excretion . It also make possible determine excretion specific amino acid related intake dietary protein specific food source . Furthermore , provide ability test hypothesis intake dietary protein related level systolic diastolic blood pressure . These hypothesis strongly hold Japan , one country participate INTERMAP study , investigate limited degree United States Europe . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The purpose study analyze data INTERMAP Study , international , cooperative , 17-sample population study 4,706 men woman age 40-59 four country include United States , United Kingdom , China , Japan . Analyses assess follow : whether , independent multiple possible confounding variable , significant relationship dietary protein ( total , animal , vegetable ) dietary specific amino acid ( AA ) 24-hour urinary excretion total individual AA related compound ; systolic diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) individual relate 24-hour urinary excretion taurine -- possible marker fish protein intake ; 1-methylhistidine , 3-methylhistidine , histidine , lysine , anserine ( 1-methylhistidine-B-alanine dipeptide ) -- reflect meat protein intake ; arginine -- source cell nitric oxide ( NO ) , implicated vasodilation ; urinary amino acid . INTERMAP already collect standardized comprehensive dietary blood pressure data individual 17 sample ( four 24-hour dietary recalls/person yield data 60+ nutrient , include 19 amino acid , two 24-hour urine specimens/person data Na , K , urea N , creatinine , volume ; eight standardize systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure measurements/person ; data ) . Urinary concentration amino acid analyze chromatographically high performance automatic amino acid analyzer INTEPMAP Central Laboratory Leuven , Belgium . Regression coefficient amino acid-blood pressure relationship compute without correction reliability ( regression-dilution bias ) ; sample-by-sample pooling country , region , overall ; also gender ; person antihypertensive treatment ; nonhypertensives ; free history recent diet change ; education ; evaluate comprehensively whether urinary amino acid excretion could add meaningfully dietary data give good total understanding relationship dietary protein-amino acid blood pressure . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
