	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know whether keyhole limpet hemocyanin effective doxorubicin bladder cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness keyhole limpet hemocyanin doxorubicin treat patient bladder cancer respond BCG patient tolerate BCG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin Compared With Doxorubicin Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy BCI-ImmuneActivatorâ„¢ ( keyhole limpet hemocyanin ) versus doxorubicin BCG refractory intolerant patient carcinoma situ without resect superficial papillary bladder cancer . - Compare toxicity safety treatment patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center prior BCG response ( refractory v intolerant ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive sensitize dose keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) intradermally week -2 follow induction KLH IV weekly week 1-6 . Patients partial response receive IV KLH reinduction therapy weekly week 13-18 . Patients complete response receive IV KLH maintenance therapy monthly week 13 , 17 , 21 , month 6-12 . - Arm II : Patients receive doxorubicin IV weekly week 1-6 . Patients complete response receive maintenance therapy comprise doxorubicin IV week 13 , 17 , 21 month 6-12 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1.5 year , every 6 month 1 year . ( Patient total participation study may last long 42 month . ) PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient ( 75 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
