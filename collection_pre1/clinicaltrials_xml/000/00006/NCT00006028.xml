	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness gemcitabine plus cisplatin treating patient primary ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer recurrent respond platinum-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Is Recurrent Has Not Responded Platinum-based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine anti-tumor activity gemcitabine cisplatin patient recurrent refractory platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma fail high priority treatment protocol . - Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient population . - Correlate ex vivo drug sensitivity resistance clinical response regimen patient . - Correlate molecular marker drug responsiveness cellular apoptosis ex vivo measure drug resistance patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour follow gemcitabine IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 5-14 month .</detailed_description>
