	<brief_summary>This study screen patient cerebellar ataxia check antibody indicate allergy gluten ( wheat protein ) study effect gluten-free diet patient antibody . Patients cerebellar ataxia problem coordination , result `` clumsiness '' unsteadiness posture walk . There many known cause cerebellar ataxia , many patient cause unknown available treatment . Cerebellar ataxia recognize complication celiac disease , syndrome characterized sensitivity gluten . Recognizing gluten sensitivity patient cerebellar ataxia would important two reason : would one rare cause disease potentially treatable , would identify patient risk develop gastrointestinal cancer , particularly intestinal lymphoma . Patients cerebellar ataxia know unknown cause normal healthy volunteer age eligible study . All participant medical history , physical examination , blood drawn ( 30 milliliter , 2 tablespoon ) check celiac disease antibody , possibly lab test . This complete participation normal volunteer . All patient magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . This diagnostic tool use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . Scanning time vary 20 minute 2 hour . Patients celiac disease antibody upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy intestinal biopsy . For procedure , flexible tube insert mouth throat stomach duodenum ( upper part small intestine ) , small tissue sample take microscopic examination . Patients antibody put gluten-free diet follow NIH every 3 month 12 month . On first visit , patient ataxia evaluate use NINDS 's ataxia scale meet dietitian instruction gluten-free diet . On second fifth visit ( 3 , 6 , 9 12 month , respectively , gluten-free diet ) , patient ataxia evaluate , speak dietitian ass nutritional status , weight , compliance diet , provide blood sample celiac disease antibody test . At completion study , patient may choose continue stop gluten-free diet . If ataxia assessment show improvement , patient advise continue gluten-free diet permanently .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gluten-Free Diet Patients With Gluten Sensitivity Cerebellar Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many patient cerebellar ataxia , etiology unknown . Sensitivity gluten ( wheat protein ) suggest cause cerebellar ataxia even absence malabsorption symptom intestinal pathology . However , prevalence gluten sensitivity patient present cerebellar ataxia unknown effect gluten-free diet gluten sensitivity-associated cerebellar ataxia systematically study . The aim project : 1 ) To identify gluten sensitive cerebellar ataxia patient attend Human Motor Control Clinic NIH use test celiac disease antibody screen method . 2 ) To conduct open-label controlled clinical trial ass efficacy gluten-free diet patient identify use detailed cerebellar ataxia scale objective clinical measure .</detailed_description>
