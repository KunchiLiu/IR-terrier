	<brief_title>Assessing Occupation Burden COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease one top four five leading cause death U.S. worsen epidemiological trend . Cigarette smoke account approximately 85 percent-90 percent case , 10 percent-15 percent attributable risk still represent substantial fraction disease remain unexplained . Recently , several study , various country , address whether certain occupational exposure ( primarily relate dust , vapor , gas , and/or fume ) potential risk factor COPD . Most study show elevated odds ratio relative risk , although always statistically significant level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A population sample continental United States age 55-75 , supplement enriched sample geographic `` hot spot '' identify National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) respiratory disease map . Structured telephone interview assess demographic , health status , smoking exposure , occupational history . High risk job cod use job matrix system independent subject report specific exposure . Two hundred thirty-four COPD , over-sampling great severity , follow 12-14 month ass health status health service utilization , well decrement quality life . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
