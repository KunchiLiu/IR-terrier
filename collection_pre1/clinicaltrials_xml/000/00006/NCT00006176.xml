	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn medical problem genetic factor involve recently define form inherit dementia call `` familial dementia neuroserpin inclusion body ( FDNIB ) . '' Abnormal substance nerve cell patient disease affect brain nervous system function , cause confusion , memory decline impair cognition ( think ability ) . Patients also develop movement disorder , possibly , seizure . Symptoms begin midlife , 45 55 year age . Patients FDNIB family member 18 year age old risk disease may eligible 3-year study . Participants medical family history review medical record ; interview medical geneticist ( specialist genetics ) ; physical , neurological psychiatric examination ; follow test procedure : 1 . Blood test assess general health 2 . Chest skull X-rays 3 . Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) -record electrical activity heart use electrode place chest 4 . Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) -record electrical activity brain use electrode place head 5 . Ultrasound abdomen-imaging abdominal organ use sound wave 6 . Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -imaging brain use strong magnetic field radio wave 7 . Hearing evaluation 8 . Assessment performance daily living activity 9 . Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) -imaging brain metabolism blood flow use radioactive substance inject vein The evaluation do 3- 4-day period . At completion , participant meet physician genetics counselor discus clinically significant finding . Participants may ask return follow-up evaluation every 6 month year ( depend individual 's condition ) 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Genetic Studies Familial Presenile Dementia With Neuronal Inclusion Bodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project involve study novel familial neurodegenerative disorder , familial encephalopathy neuroserpin inclusion body ( FENIB ) . This disorder , characteristic clinical course progressive dementia neurologic involvement , initially define one extend family . Neuroserpin gene disorder mutation present large kindred four additional families/cases . This protocol characterize clinical phenotype , delineate natural history disorder explore genotype/phenotype correlation index family possibly report case . Families immunohistopathologically-neuroserpin positive neuronal inclusion autopsy/biopsy affected member ( ) , neuroserpin mutation-positive proband , familial presenile dementia neurologic feature consistent original FENIB family enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients family history earlyonset progressive dementia decline cognition neuronal inclusion body immunohistopathologically consistent neuroserpin inclusion body . Children progressive dementia myoclonic epilepsy consistent report clinical course pediatric patient child clinical phenotype autopsy demonstrate neuronal inclusion boidies immunohistopathologically consistent neuroserpin inclusion body . Family member risk , least 18 year age , include first degree relative affect patient adult offspring first degree relative . In rare instance probands risk family member know presenile dementia neurologic course typical see FENIB enrol . We may also enroll offsite individual finding , medically fragile travel Clinical Center durable power attorney ( DPA ) available . The physical examination laboratory research study perform Investigator ( ) clinical study do local accredit hospital . Family member either risk unaffected spouse may enroll primarily genetic linkage information . These individual contribute blood sample molecular analysis . Those unwilling travel may also provide blood sample . No clinical study perform individual category . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Another diagnosis presenile demential make physician include limited : 1 ) Huntington Disease , 2 ) Parkinson Disease/Diffuse Lewy Body Disease , 3 ) Familial Alzheimer Disease know mutation presenilin 1 , presenilin 2 betaamyloid precursor protein , 4 ) Lafora Body Disease , 5 ) Pick 's Disease , 6 ) frontotemporal dementia . A Durable Power Attorney available human subject medically competent give consent .</criteria>
