	<brief_title>Sargramostim Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Has Spread Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 4-month progression-free survival rate overall survival rate patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma lung treat aerosolized sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine immunomodulatory effect regimen term natural killer cell cytotoxicity , T-cell , B-cell , dendritic cell activation marker . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive aerosolize sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) nebulizer 10-15 minute twice daily day 1-7 14-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unaceptable toxicity . Patients follow disease progression every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-48 patient accrue study within 7-20 month .</detailed_description>
