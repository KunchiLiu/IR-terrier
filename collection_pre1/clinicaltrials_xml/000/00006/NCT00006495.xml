	<brief_summary>The purpose study see vaccine Remune ( HIV-1 immunogen ) vCP1452 affect immune response patient also take anti-HIV medication . This study also see vaccine safe use either alone combination . Treatment anti-HIV drug always keep HIV viral load low control . This study look effect HIV vaccine , vCP1452 , immune response work combination Remune . Information immune response safety vaccine HIV-positive patient gather .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Responses HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Anti-HIV Drug Combination When Given HIV Vaccines Remune vCP1452</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human viral infection control immune system . However , multiple immune response provoke HIV infection control infection people . The ability specifically augment CTL responses immunotherapeutic vaccine may strengthen containment viremia afford antiretroviral agent thereby extend durability viral suppression . The current study attempt determine whether therapeutic immunization HIV-1 immunogen vCP1452 safe able augment HIV-1 specific immune response longer period time antiretroviral therapy alone , agent well either . Patients currently enrol A5058s A5057/A5058s Versions 1.0 2.0 give option continue participation A5058s independent study . Rollover patient register Step II begin treatment/evaluations A5058s study week Versions 1.0 2.0 A5057/A5058s . New patient enter Step I need register Step II . Step I patient stratify basis HIV viral load , antiretroviral history , current antiretroviral treatment . Within stratum , patient randomize 1 follow 4 treatment arm : HIV-1 immunogen plus ALVAC placebo , HIV-1 immunogen placebo plus ALVAC placebo , HIV-1 immunogen placebo plus vCP1452 , HIV-1 immunogen plus vCP1452 . Patients receive injection study entry every 12 week thereafter end study , minimum 2 year . Step II patient receive treatment patient Step I . Patients evaluate every 12 week clinical , immunologic , virologic parameter . Patients continue take antiretroviral treatment take study entry reach virologic relapse define protocol . If response new drug regimen occur , antiretroviral therapy change , immunization may continue long viral load remain 5,000 copies/ml .</detailed_description>
