	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over past 50 year , considerable progress make understanding factor stimulate development atherosclerosis manifestation `` preclinical cardiovascular disease , '' document 2- 4-fold high risk subsequent myocardial infarction morbid event asymptomatic individual pathological transformation artery heart . However , much less information available factor ( `` trigger '' ) precipitate morbid mortal event high-risk individual . Recent work Paul Ridker colleague group identify association presence marker prothrombotic tendency , inflammation immune activation myocardial infarction cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event . However , available data obtain men less know relevance newer risk factor potential `` trigger '' stimulation atherosclerosis precipitation CVD event woman . In context , research examine relation relatively new potentially novel `` trigger '' subsequent myocardial infarction woman considerable potential clinical biological significance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Drs . Ridker colleague comprehensively evaluated series thrombotic , inflammatory , genetic marker myocardial infarction ( MI ) among participant Women 's Health Initiative Observational Study ( WHI-OS ) , prospective cohort study 90,000 ethnically representative post-menopausal American woman age 50-79 year . Employing prospective nest case-control design , assayed baseline plasma buffy coat sample nine marker increase thrombotic potential ( tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) , total plasma homocysteine , prothrombin fragment F1+2 , D-dimer , APC-R , C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 , sICAM-1 ) determine whether elevation parameter lead future MI coronary death . They also explore common genetic polymorphism tPA , PAI-1 , MTHFR , thrombomodulin , prothrombin , factor V gene inherit environmental determinant coronary thrombosis woman could simultaneously evaluate . Case subject WHI-OS participant free cardiovascular disease study entry subsequently develop document MI coronary death follow-up ( N = 650 ) . Control subject select study participant remain free disease follow-up ; control 1:1 matched case age , smoke status , ethnicity , follow-up time . Data usual risk factor , hormone replacement therapy , standard lipid profile use evaluate potential confounding effect modification . The analysis take advantage unique unprecedented blood bank well-characterized , ethnically diverse , large-scale cohort post-menopausal woman ongoing follow-up high quality endpoint verification , thereby provide efficient way critically evaluate hypothesized role hemostasis , thrombosis inflammation risk factor future MI coronary death among American woman . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
