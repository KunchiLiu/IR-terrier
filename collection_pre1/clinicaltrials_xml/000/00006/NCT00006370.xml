	<brief_title>Radiolabeled SMT-487 ( Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide ) Treating Patients With Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tumor response rate yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 patient refractory small cell lung cancer advance metastatic breast cancer express somatostatin receptor . II . Determine safety treatment regimen patient . III . Determine overall survival patient treatment regimen . IV . Determine quality life patient treatment regimen . V. Determine frequency tumor positive ( 3+ 4+ ) OctreoScan scintigraphy patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 IV 10-15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 6-9 week 3 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Quality life assess baseline course 3 , week 6 . Patients follow 6 12 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-29 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
