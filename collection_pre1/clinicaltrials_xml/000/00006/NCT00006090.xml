	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical efficacy safety arsenic trioxide patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) refractory fludarabine relapse . II . Determine pattern clinical adverse experience patient treat regimen . III . Evaluate effect drug cytokine , apoptosis , angiogenesis patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 2 hour day 1-15 OR day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 . Courses repeat 2 5 week interval course 10-12 course ( 1 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month second year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
