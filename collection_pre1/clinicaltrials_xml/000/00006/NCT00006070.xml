	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect anti-inflammatory drug etanercept ( Enbrel ) relieve pain swell oral surgery . The Food Drug Administration approve Enbrel treat symptom rheumatoid arthritis , include pain . Healthy volunteer 16 35 year age require third molar ( wisdom teeth ) extraction may eligible study . Participants must allergic aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Candidates screen eligibility medical history oral examination , include X-rays need . Participation study require four clinic visit : two surgery two follow-up : Visit 1 : Patients ultrasound picture take measure cheek size . One hour surgery , receive dose either 25 milligram ( mg ) Enbrel ; 15 mg standard pain medicine Toradol ; placebo ( salt-water ) arm vein . A local injection anesthetic ( lidocaine ) give surgery numb mouth , sedative ( Versed ) infuse vein induce sleepiness . When anesthetic take effect , small piece tissue remove inside cheek , upper low molar one side mouth extract . After surgery , small piece tubing place low extraction site , sample collect measure chemical involve pain inflammation . Patients stay clinic 4 hour surgery anesthetic wear complete pain questionnaire time . If , hour surgery , patient pain relieved treatment give surgery , may receive acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) codeine pain . Another biopsy take ( local anesthetic ) inside cheek pain occurs end 4-hour observation period . The tube remove patient discharge Tylenol codeine pain . Visit 2 : Patients return clinic morning 48 hour oral surgery 1- 2-hour visit . They fill questionnaire , undergo ultrasound image cheek another biopsy take inside cheek operated side . Visits 3 4 : Three week first surgery patient schedule extraction two wisdom teeth side mouth , procedures visit 1 2 repeat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose investigation randomize , double-blind , placebo positive-controlled within-subjects design clinical study evaluate role cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) acute inflammation use specific TNF receptor antagonist , etanercept ( Enbrel , Immunex Corporation , Seattle , WA ) . The goal study determine whether inhibition TNF bioactivity attenuate acute inflammation . The anti-inflammatory adverse effect etanercept , recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein , evaluate use model tissue injury , oral surgery model . Briefly , healthy volunteer refer third molar extraction undergo surgical extraction third molar local anesthesia conscious sedation . At completion surgical procedure , microdialysis probe place mucogingival flap previously elevate surgical procedure subject observe pain swell course four hour follow surgery . Tissue biopsy prior follow surgery obtain buccal mucosa . Etanercept control administer parenterally one hour prior surgery . Tissue level pro-inflammatory cytokine , growth factor , inflammatory mediator measure time interval postoperatively . Pain swell assess postoperatively course four hour 48 hour . Demonstration amelioration pain , swell , and/or change level tissue mediator take evidence acute anti-inflammatory effect etanercept . Since fusion protein ( hereafter , TNFR : fc ) specifically bind TNF-alpha prevents interaction cellular receptor , change inflammatory cascade clinical endpoint inflammation may provide insight role TNF-alpha pathophysiology acute inflammation clinical sequela .</detailed_description>
