	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study well combination chemotherapy follow second-look surgery radiation therapy work treat child nonmetastatic medulloblastoma primitive neuroectodermal tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining one drug combine chemotherapy surgery radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed Second-Look Surgery Radiation Therapy Treating Children With Nonmetastatic Medulloblastoma Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine propose treatment child &gt; = 8.0 month &lt; 3 year age registration non-metastatic ( M0 ) medulloblastoma effective combined treatment give child age extent disease POG 9233 , measure event-free survival ( EFS ) rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility safety plan use second look surgery focal conformal radiation therapy follow chemotherapy . II . To determine acute chronic toxicity associate treatment regimen . III . To describe neuropsychological neuroendocrine effect systemic chemotherapy , surgery , local , conformal radiation . IV . To determine feasibility validity centralize telephone interview base data collection method neuropsychological evaluation . V. To determine incidence atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor ( AT/RT ) child enrol study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive induction chemotherapy consist vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 ; cisplatin IV 6 hour day 1 ; cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 2 ; oral etoposide daily day 2-22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day total 4 course . After completion induction chemotherapy , patient residual disease undergo second resection . Within 4 week completion induction chemotherapy second resection , patient receive focal conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 6 week . Four week completion radiotherapy , patient receive alternate treatment maintenance chemotherapy . Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 course 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 oral etoposide daily day 1-21 course 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . Treatment continue every 28 day 8 course . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
