	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Impairment coronary vasofunction believe one early manifestation coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . The impact risk factor elevate cholesterol level , diabetes , hypertension , smoke coronary microcirculation remain largely unknown . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional study determine whether impairment myocardial perfusion reserve provide marker coronary heart disease ( CHD ) compare novel measure subclinical vascular disease , test association risk factor CHD . The study ancillary Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( `` MESA '' ) , NHLBI fund , prospective observational study characteristic subclinical cardiovascular disease , i.e . disease detect non-invasively produce sign symptom . In MESA new measure subclinical disease coronary artery calcium impair brachial artery reactivity examine investigate relationship well-established risk factor clinical event . Myocardial perfusion reserve ( MPR ) useful measure coronary vasofunction include evaluation new measure subclinical disease . An impaired MPR appear specific early indicator functional impairment microcirculation patient risk factor coronary artery disease . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use advanced , quantitative imaging modality determine short ( 20 minute ) exams myocardial perfusion reserve group 400 MESA participant . The study test hypothesis impaired myocardial perfusion reserve indicate presence subclinical coronary atherosclerosis coronary microvascular disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
