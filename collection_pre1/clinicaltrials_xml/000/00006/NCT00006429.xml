	<brief_summary>This trial test whether treadmill training use improve `` walk '' patient partial spinal cord injury . While treadmill , patient partially support use specially design harness attach overhead lift ( also call Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training , BWSTT ) . Patients enroll study randomly assign either experimental group , receive 12 week specialize treadmill train regular physical therapy , control group , receive 12 week regular physical therapy . The ability patient `` walk '' measure treatment well 6 12 month later , use standard test examine mobility independence speed ambulation . The trial take place across five site US Canada . Patients eligible trial traumatic spinal cord injury within 8 week trial entry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 5-site randomized clinical trial task-oriented locomotor intervention acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The intervention , body weight-supported treadmill training ( BWSTT ) , partially support weight patient via overhead lift attach harness . Therapists train patient walk treadmill correct gait deviation manipulate sensory input enhance control stance swing phase walk increasingly high speed less weight support . 100 patient incomplete SCI ( C4 T10/11 ) 100 patient lesion T12 L3 randomly assign 12 week conventional therapy program mobility versus intensity duration combination conventional therapy plus BWSTT . The primary outcome measure level independence ambulation maximal speed walk 50 foot . Patients test masked examiner 12 week therapy , 6 12 month entry study .</detailed_description>
