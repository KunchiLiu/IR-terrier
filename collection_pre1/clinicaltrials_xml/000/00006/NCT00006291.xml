	<brief_summary>The purpose study see add HIV vaccine ( ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 ) , IL-2 ( interleukin-2 , protein find blood help boost immune system ) , anti-HIV-drug therapy safe , tolerable , effective control viral load ( level HIV body ) . ( This study change clarify drug name . ) Anti-HIV drug help reduce patient 's viral load . However , HIV still remain CD4 cell ( cell immune system help fight infection ) . Combining HIV vaccine , IL-2 , anti-HIV drug may help reduce number HIV-infected cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The important goal design future therapeutic intervention understand nature persistent HIV infection patient successfully treat potent antiretroviral therapy develop strategy promote clearance reservoir least long-term suppression reservoir . If latently infect cell able persist long period ( despite effective suppression de novo infection ) primarily immune clearance adequately stimulate viral antigen , HIV-specific immunization reasonable strategy enhance clearance cell . Stimulating effective HIV-specific cellular immune response time plasma viremia maximally suppress also may contribute long-term containment HIV replication potent antiretroviral therapy . A second component evaluate trial whether broad , cyclical activation T cell IL-2 increase activation HIV proviral gene expression thereby render target cell susceptible immune-mediated clearance . This pathogenesis-based clinical trial explore potential novel treatment strategy ( HIV-specific immunization IL-2 , alone combination ) complement effect potent antiretroviral therapy promote effective immunologic control HIV-1 replication . This study divide 3 step . STEP I : Patients continue receive stable potent antiretroviral therapy randomize 1 4 arm : Arm A : Vaccine placebo [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : ALVAC ] ; Arm B : Canarypox HIV-specific immunogen [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : ALVAC-HIV ] ( vCP1452 ) ; Arm C : 8-week cycle IL-2 plus vaccine placebo [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : ALVAC ] ; Arm D : 8-week cycle IL-2 plus canarypox HIV-specific immunogen [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : ALVAC-HIV ] ( vCP1452 ) . Patients receive vaccine ( vaccine placebo ) injection Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 48 . IL-2 injection synchronize vaccine injection . IL-2 give open-label vCP1452 double-blinded . Patients must Step I minimum 51 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : prior entry Step II ] . STEP II : Patients stop study medication interrupt potent antiretroviral therapy [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : `` 6 16 '' replace follow text : minimum 12 ] week . Patients whose viral load Step II remain [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : ] 5,000 copies/ml [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : whose CD4 count 200 cells/mm3 ] encourage remain antiretroviral medication continue viral-load monitoring additional 10 week . These patient follow [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/23/01 : `` 16 week '' replace follow text : Week 74 ] Step II must register Step III viral load increase 50,000 copies/ml great , CD4 count decrease 200 cells/mm3 , primary care physician recommend resume antiretrovirals . STEP III : Patients resume original potent antiretroviral therapy regimen 6 10 week monitor minimum 6 week . If patient achieve viral load 50 copies/ml 6 week , continue monitor additional 4 week degree suppression achieve potent antiretroviral therapy regimen another appropriate regimen .</detailed_description>
