	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Stage III , Stage IV , Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OOBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , term response , patient advance , recurrent , persistent endometrial adenocarcinoma demonstrate HER2/neu gene amplification fluorescent situ hybridization . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . II . Determine effect prognostic factor ( i.e. , initial performance status histological grade ) patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-42 patient accrue study within 12 year .</detailed_description>
