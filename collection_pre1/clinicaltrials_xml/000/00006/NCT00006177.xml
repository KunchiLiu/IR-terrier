	<brief_title>Child &amp; Adolescent Bipolar Disorder Brain Imaging Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : For protocol define Bipolar Spectrum disorder ( BSD ) propensity manic episode Bipolar Disorder Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Related Disorder . BSD child adolescents receive increase research attention , important question remain developmental trajectory , phenomenology behavioral correlate , little known underlie neural mechanism . In study youth BSD , study three objective : 1. use longitudinal technique characterize clinical physiological manifestation pediatric BSD , use cross-sectional technique ( e.g. , compare child adult BSD measure ) provide preliminary data guide longitudinal study 2. identify follow longitudinally behavioral , neuropsychological , neurophysiological , neuroanatomical correlate pediatric BSD , compare child chronic irritability hyperarousal symptom ( severe mood dysregulation , SMD , outline protocol 02-M-0021 ) , youth attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , typically develop youth . 3. examine genetic familial correlate pediatric BSD Study population : There 11 separate population study protocol : 1 . Children adolescents age 6-17 year old meet criterion BSD . 2 . Adults age 18-58 year old meet criterion BD , include age 18-25 BSD . 3 . Control population : ) Healthy volunteer child adolescent age 3-17 year old , b ) Parents healthy volunteer child healthy adult research , c ) Children 8-17 year old attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , mood disorder . 4 . First second-degree biological relative ( B.1 ) ( B.2 ) , , 3-58 year old . 5 . A subgroup cohorts Old Order Amish individual fulfill eligibility ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3a ) , ( 3b ) , ( 4 ) . Design : For child adolescent BSD ( i.e . Bipolar Disorder Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Related Disorder ) , study outpatient characterization longitudinal follow-along design . Once determine eligible , individual come initial assessment , 2-year interval return clinical interview , behavioral task , structural functional MRI . For child adolescent relatives individual BSD , outpatient follow-along design individual come outpatient assessment 2-year interval clinical interview , behavioral task , structural functional MRI . For healthy volunteer child , child ADHD , adult BD , parent healthy volunteer child , study outpatient cross-sectional study include clinical interview , behavioral task , structural functional MRI . For others , individual come NIH clinical interview , behavioral task , MRI . For individual Amish community , investigation occurs field , receive clinical interview behavioral task . Some may choose come NIH participate behavioral test MRI . For individual , genetic material saliva blood obtain protocol 01-M-0254 . Outcome measure : This study examine group difference clinical , behavioral , genetic , neuroanatomical , neurophysiological variable individual BSD , relatives , healthy volunteer . Findings child BSD also compare severe mood dysregulation , sometimes call broad phenotype pediatric BD , recruit protocol 02-M-0021 ( Nottelman , 2001 ) . Longitudinal clinical , behavioral , neuroanatomical data also obtain .</detailed_description>
