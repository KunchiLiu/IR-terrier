	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness treat brain tumor child continuous infusion phenylbutyrate . A breakdown product drug , phenylacetate , normally find low concentration blood . At much high concentration , phenylbutyrate phenylacetate active cancer animal . Patients 2 21 year old brain tumor progress recur radiation chemotherapy , include bone marrow transplant , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) head , need , spinal fluid test bone marrow test . Study participant continuous infusion phenylbutyrate two 28-day cycles-every day , 24 hour day , 7 day week . The medicine infuse thin tube ( catheter ) place large vein upper chest , deliver portable infusion pump . Patients hospitalize least 3 day treatment begin . If side effect time , infusion continue outpatient basis . The patient care giver receive medicine 4-day supply teach change bag tube daily drug administration , well use infusion pump . Patients monitor weekly blood test look side effect measure blood level phenylbutyrate . They physical examination least week . At end second 28-day cycle , patient CT MRI scan evaluate tumor 's response treatment . Patients whose tumor grown stop treatment come study . Those whose tumor remain stable shrunk may continue phenylbutyrate long treatment beneficial serious side effect . CT MRI scan do every 2 cycle ( sooner need ) evaluate treatment . Patients certain tumor type ( medulloblastoma , PNET , ependymoma , malignant germ cell tumor pineoblastoma ) symptom indicate might tumor along spinal cord may spinal tap . For procedure , patient lie side needle insert two vertebra ( bone spine ) low back , cerebrospinal fluid space . A sample fluid drawn test cancer cell . If tumor spread spinal fluid , spinal tap do every cycle ( every 2 month ) monitor effect therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phenylbutyrate aromatic fatty acid convert phenylacetate vivo mitochondrial Beta-oxidation phenylacetate . Preclinical study show continuous exposure phenylacetate phenylbutyrate induce tumor cytostasis differentiation wide variety cell line include malignant glioma neuroblastoma . However , phenylbutyrate show potent differentiate agent phenylacetate variety tumor cell line . In addition , phenylbutyrate appear molecular activity distinct phenylacetate may induce apoptosis . Phase I trials adult child establish feasibility administer phenylbutyrate prolong schedule . A phase II trial phenylbutyrate administer continuous intravenous infusion perform child recurrent progressive brain tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Patients must 2 21 year old . Histologic diagnosis : Previously treat brain tumor patient histologic diagnosis recurrent progressive disease radiation chemotherapy , include bone marrow transplant . For patient brainstem tumor requirement histologic verification may waive . However , patient brainstem tumor treat hyperfractionated radiotherapy biopsy , PET scan NMR spectroscopy strongly recommend prior study entry rule radionecrosis possible cause MRI change . A biopsy , PET scan , NMR spectroscopy require patient treated radiosurgery prior study entry . Phenylbutyrate study within follow disease stratum define initial tumor histology : 1 . High grade glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma multiforme ) 2 . Brainstem glioma 3 . Medulloblastoma primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) present supratentorial posterior fossa location . 4 . Other Radiologic evaluation : ( must obtain within two week prior start therapy ) Patients must CT MRI image study document measurable lesion ( ) clearly demonstrate recurrent progressive nature lesion ( ) . Recovery prior therapy : 1 . Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study must without significant systemic illness ( e.g . Infection ) . 2 . Patients must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 week ( six week prior nitrosourea ) entry onto protocol . 3 . Evaluable lesion must radiotherapy within 8 week , radiosurgery within 4 month start protocol . 4 . Patients receive dexamethasone must stable decrease dose 2 week prior study entry . Life Expectancy : Patients must life expectancy least 8 week . Performance status : For patient older equal 10 year Karnofsky performance score must 50 percent great . For child young 10 year , Lansky score must 50 percent great . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheel chair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . Informed consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient young 18 year age ) must sign document inform consent indicate awareness investigational nature risk study . When appropriate patient include discussion order obtain verbal assent . Hematological parameter : ( must obtain within 1 week prior start therapy ) . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC great 1,000/mm ( 3 ) ; platelet count great 50,000/mm ( 3 ) ; hgb great 8.0 mg/dL ) . Patients histologic evidence bone marrow involvement tumor , history either bone marrow transplantation extensive radiotherapy ( craniospinal XRT field encompass region great hemipelvis ) eligible study evaluate separately hematologic toxicity . Transfusion support may use obtain hematologic parameter patient . Biochemical parameter : 1 . Hepatic Function : Patients must bilirubin less 1.5 mg/dl SGPT le 2x normal . 2 . Renal Function : Patients must ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( see ) creatinine clearance 70 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) great . ____________________________________________ Age ( Years ) Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) ____________________________________________ 5 great 0.8 Between 5 10 1.0 Between 10 15 1.2 Greater 15 1.5 ____________________________________________ Electrolytes : Patients must normal serum electrolyte ( Na+ , K+ , Cl , CO2 ) . Note : They may receive electrolyte supplement maintain electrolyte normal range . Central venous access : Patients must willing central venous access device ( e.g . Broviac Hickman PortaCath ) . An external central venous access device preferable . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : A DPA must offer patient 18 21 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women childbearing potential pregnant lactating . Patients significant systemic illness . Patients amino acidurias organic acidemia .</criteria>
