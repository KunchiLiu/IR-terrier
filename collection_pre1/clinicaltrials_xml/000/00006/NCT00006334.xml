	<brief_summary>This study examine clinical genetic factor related Turner syndrome , disorder sex chromosome . Humans usually 23 pair chromosomes-thin strand DNA-in nucleus every cell , contain gene determine hereditary makeup . One pair chromosomes sex chromosome , designate X Y . Females usually two X chromosome ; however , patient Turner syndrome single X chromosome one normal one defective X Y chromosome . This abnormality cause medical problem short stature , premature ovarian failure heart kidney defect . Individuals Turner syndrome increase risk thyroid disorder , high blood pressure , diabetes mellitus , abnormal liver function , hear loss osteoporosis . This study try identify gene responsible specific medical problem associate disorder . Females 10 year age old X chromosome defect may eligible 3- 5- day inpatient study National Institutes Health Clinical Center Bethesda , Maryland . Participants physical examination , body measurement ( height , weight , hip waist ) blood draw clinical research purpose . Participants comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation , include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , 24 hour blood pressure monitoring , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart aorta , ultrasound image heart ( cardiac echo ) expert consultation NIH Cardiology Service . Women 35 year age old may computerize tomography ( CT ) scan coronary artery investigate possible blockage heart blood supply . Risk diabetes investigated study body fat content oral glucose tolerance test . The risk coronary artery disease assess measurement cholesterol know risk factor blood . Thyroid function presence antibody thyroid gland also evaluate blood test . Liver function test measurement product liver metabolism blood liver ultrasound . Ovary function investigate blood test estrogen FSH level pelvic untrasound visualizes uterus . Bone structure strength evaluate routine X-rays wrist spine , DEXA scan ( type X-ray study measure body fat , muscle bone thickness ) . Adults also bone density spine abdominal fat content measure CT , accurate DEXA . Vitamin D level measure blood tests.These state art diagnostic test may uncover unsuspected anatomic problem abnormality aorta aortic valve serious clinical implication would indicate need close medical follow-up , well uncover potential risk development diabetes osteoporosis future , would also indicate need change lifestyle medical management . Study participant invite return re-evaluation 1-3 year interval . A major goal follow-up visit determine whether enlargement aortic diameter impairment cardiac function time . Some patient may ask undergo skin biopsy ( removal small sample skin tissue ) obtain information genetic make-up cell . Parents patient may contact ( patient 's permission ) provide blood saliva sample genetic study help understand certain trait Turner syndrome express .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Turner Syndrome : Genotype Phenotype</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Turner syndrome ( TS ) sporadic disorder affect ~ 1/2500 live female birth . It cause absence significant part one sex-chromosome . Major developmental consequence include severe short stature , ovarian failure distinctive cognitive behavioral trait , renal cardiovascular defect affect minority . Adults TS excessive rate osteoporosis , hypertension diabetes mellitus experience morbidity mortality several-fold high general population . Many problem TS result haplo-insufficiency X-chromosome encode gene , remain unknown . Previous study attempt correlate genotype phenotype TS limit due small number subject , limited genetic methodology incomplete phenotypic characterization . This study aim correlate TS phenotype genotypes use advanced clinical genetic diagnostic methodology , goal identify X-chromosome gene epigenetic mechanism cause different feature TS . For TS subject 45X genotype , parental origin single normal X-chromosome trace identify genomically imprinted feature disorder . X chromosomal structural defect analyze use high-resolution physical mapping relation emerge sequence data Human Genome Project . The elucidation genetic mechanism TS help improve diagnosis treatment girl woman disorder understand gene dosage effect general .</detailed_description>
