	<brief_summary>Peripheral neuropathy cause weakness sensory loss produce severe disability . Some neuropathy immune-mediated associated antibody . It postulate Rituxan treatment may reduce level antibody production limit loss muscle strength hence improve activity daily live . The purpose open-label study ( participant get Rituxan placebo ) determine safety effectiveness Rituxan treatment polyneuropathies associate serum IgM autoantibody already treat one course Rituxan . Subjects treat in-patient Clinical Research Center Rituxan two treatment one week part individual treatment every 10 week one year . The effectiveness Rituxan follow look increase muscle strength decrease serum IgM autoantibody .</brief_summary>
