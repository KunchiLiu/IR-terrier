	<brief_title>Capecitabine Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity capecitabine patient recurrent , platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cavity cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 14 day . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
