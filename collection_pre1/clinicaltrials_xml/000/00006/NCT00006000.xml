	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . SU5416 may stop growth solid tumor stop blood flow tumor . Combining SU5416 chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness SU5416 plus irinotecan cisplatin treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 , Irinotecan , Cisplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose SU5416 combination irinotecan cisplatin patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine quantitative qualitative toxicity treatment regimen term organ specificity , time course , predictability , reversibility patient population . III . Determine therapeutic response treatment regimen patient . IV . Evaluate clinical pharmacokinetics relationship kinetics toxicity response patient population treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study SU5416 . Patients receive cisplatin IV 90 minute immediately follow irinotecan IV 90 minute SU5416 IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients receive SU5416 alone day 4 . Patients receive combination chemotherapy weekly 4 week SU5416 twice weekly 6 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SU5416 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
