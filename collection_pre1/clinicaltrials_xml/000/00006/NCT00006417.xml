	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness new stem cell transplant procedure treat chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) patient active infection . CGD inherit disorder neutrophils-a type infection-fighting white blood cell-that leave patient vulnerable life-threatening infection . Standard treatment antibiotic , sometimes surgery , always successful , patient persist infection poor long-term prognosis . Transplantation donate stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature different blood components-white cell , red cell platelet ) cure CGD . However , procedure carry significant risk death , particularly patient active infection , require completely suppress immune system high-dose chemotherapy radiation . In addition , lymphocytes-another type infection-fighting white blood cell-from donor may cause call graft vs. host disease ( GvHD ) , donor cell `` see '' patient 's cell `` foreign '' mount immune response reject . To try reduce risk , patient study give low-dose chemotherapy radiation , regimen easy body tolerate involve short period complete immune suppression . Also , donor 's lymphocyte remove rest stem cell transplant , reduce risk GvHD . Patients CGD age age 1 55 year old active non-viral infection may eligible study . They medical history , physical examination blood test ( include test adequacy genetic match donor ) . A bone marrow sample take evaluate disease status . This test , do local anesthetic , use special needle draw bone marrow hipbone . A central venous catheter ( flexible plastic tube place vein ) put place treatment begin . It use draw transfuse blood , give medication , infuse donated stem cell . Several day transplant procedure , patient start low-dose chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine , two commonly use anti-cancer drug . They also give anti-thymocyte globulin prevent rejection donate cell . When condition therapy complete , stem cell infused central line . Patients give cyclosporine 4 day 3 month stem cell transplant help prevent rejection . About 3 week transplant , patient discharge hospital . They return follow-up clinic visit weekly twice weekly 3 month . These visit include symptom check , physical examination , blood test . Blood transfusion give need . Subsequent visit schedule 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month transplant , often require , yearly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Stem Cell Transplantation Procedure Treating Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) inherit disorder neutrophil function . Patients profoundly immunocompromised plague early life recurrent life threaten infection . The prognosis CGD patient whose infection persist despite appropriate medical surgical intervention extremely poor . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation cure CGD however mortality procedure high patient actively infect . Ongoing clinical trial NIH elsewhere suggest use non-myeloablative conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation safer less toxic patient free infection time transplant . The goal phase II study investigate safety efficacy novel approach allogeneic stem cell transplantation CGD patient actively infect . Following preparative regimen design provide intense immunosuppression without myeloablation , patient receive peripheral blood stem cell graft HLA identical parent sibling . Donor T-cells infuse post-transplant donor stem engraftment unsatisfactory . The end point study engraftment , degree donor-host chimerism , incidence acute chronic GvHD , infection status , immune reconstitution , transplant relate morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENT : Ages 155 year . DHR proven CGD : Includes gp91phox , p47phox , p22phox , p67phox deficiency . Must active , life threaten nonviral infection persist despite adequate appropriate medical surgical therapy ( continue presence pathogen histology , culture positivity continue radiographic evidence infection ) . Patients progressive infectious process despite appropriate medical surgical intervention may consider expedited enrollment study . HIV negative . No major organ dysfunction preclude transplantation . HLA identical sibling parent compatible 6 HLA A , B DR antigens molecular type technique . Left ventricular ejection fraction great 35 % predict . ECOG performance status 03 . DONOR : HLA identical sibling parent donor . Fit receive GCSF give peripheral blood stem cell ( weight 18kg , normal blood count , normotensive , history stroke , history severe heart disease ) . Female carrier Xlinked must great 30 % normal neutrophil . If donor sibling minor , he/she old eligible sibling adult eligible donor . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant patient donor . Age great 55 year . ECOG performance status 4 . Psychiatric disorder mental deficiency patient donor sufficiently severe make compliance PBSC transplantation treatment unlikely , make informed consent impossible . Evidence rapid deterioration due progressive infection and/or organ damage . Left ventricular ejection fraction : le 35 % predict . Creatinine Clearance less 50 . A maximum age adjust serum creatinine use patient unable provide accurate 24 hour urine collection . Serum bilirubin great 4 mg/dl , Transaminases great 4 time upper limit normal . HIV positive ( donor recipient ) . Donors positive HBV , HCV HTLV use discretion investigator . Malignant disease liable relapse progress within 5 year . Donor unfit receive GCSF undergo apheresis . ( Uncontrolled hypertension , history stroke , history heart disease , thrombocytopenia , massive splenomegaly ) .</criteria>
