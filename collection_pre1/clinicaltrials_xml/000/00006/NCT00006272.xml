	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare total daily energy expenditure infant ventricular septal defect vs healthy control infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Energy Expenditure Infants With Ventricular Septal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : Height , weight , vital sign ( include oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ) measure Day 1 . Resting energy expenditure , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) , rest respiratory exchange quotient ( RQ ) measure use open circuit respiratory calorimetry Day 1 . Patients undergo assessment total daily energy expenditure use doubly label water method comprise oral deuterium oral oxygen O 18 next scheduled feeding Day 1 . Urine sample collect prior isotope administration , serially approximately 12 hour isotope administration Day 1 , daily Days 2-7 . These sample analyze mass spectrometry . On Day 1 , patient also undergo echocardiogram confirm size defect measure degree pulmonary/systemic blood flow ratio pulmonary artery pressure .</detailed_description>
