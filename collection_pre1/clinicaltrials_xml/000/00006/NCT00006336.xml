	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness Braille read sensory train program improving symptom focal ( localize ) dystonia , movement disorder cause sustained muscle contraction . Musicians , writer , typist , athletes others whose work involve frequent repetitive movement may develop focal dystonia hand . Dystonia patient impaired sense touch , think symptom may improve sensory tactile ( touch ) training . Patients task-specific dystonia healthy normal volunteer may eligible 8-week study . Patients undergo evaluation dystonia complete neurologic examination . Healthy volunteer complete physical examination . On first day study , 4 week 8 week , participant gap detection test sensory perception test . The test use eight plastic device call JVP-Domes ridge different widths surface . The subject 's arm hand hold palm-up position right index finger test 1 second 20 time dome . The subject ask report whether direction dome vertical horizontal . The test take 30 minute . Patients dystonia also symptoms evaluate visit . The evaluation involve complete write questionnaire write paragraph . All participant train Braille read NIH . Sessions give every day first week , twice week second third week , week following week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It hypothesize dystonia may sensory disorder . Animal study well physiological study patient focal dystonia demonstrate sensory dysfunction . It also show patient dystonia impaired sensory perception include assessed JVP gap detection test . This could possibly result enlargement dedifferentiation representation sensory cortex . We therefore hypothesize sensory training could improve impaired sensory perception hence improve dystonia . This study examine Braille read sensory train program correct sensory perception dystonia . The primary outcome improvement JVP gap detection test .</detailed_description>
