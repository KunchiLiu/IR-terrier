	<brief_title>Paclitaxel BMS-214662 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose BMS-214662 combination paclitaxel patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics treatment regimen patient population . IV . Determine pharmacodynamic effect treatment regimen serial tumor biopsy patient . V. Determine cytotoxicity treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study BMS-214662 . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 BMS-214662 IV 1 hour day 3 course 1 . For subsequent course , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour follow 30 minute later BMS-214662 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease objectively respond disease receive additional therapy investigator 's discretion . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-214662 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 18-21 patient accrue study within 12-15 month .</detailed_description>
