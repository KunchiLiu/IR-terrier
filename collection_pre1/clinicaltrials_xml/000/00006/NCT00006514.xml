	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Several algorithm develop calculate multivariate risk CVD base characteristic associated disease . Framingham Heart Study data use develop original algorithm , along later model , use different mathematical form , outcome , characteristic . Researchers begin investigate issue generalizability , whether risk estimate could apply new population . For algorithms general application , must able rank risk correctly . And , Framingham model compare new model develop study , result ordering risk , fact , similar . The ability order risk correctly , however , imply estimate probability right term predict disease individual . Methods need assess individual risk make treatment decision , cost-benefit analysis , quantify benefit . These method must base patient 's absolute risk , exist equation may incapable establish absolute risk across population . Earlier comparison multivariate risk among study make comparison population homogenous possible analysis . However , multivariate risk estimate truly useful , must applicable general population , applicable , estimate must base comparison cohort include woman ethnic minority . Also , statistical term , estimate must robust enough allow minor shift methodology data collection endpoint definition . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The heterogeneity multivariate risk different population examine base data study represent national sample , cohort study , clinical trial . An analysis study conduct include sex , various risk profile , representative several nationality ethnic group . The pooled sample involve 20 study , 233,833 participant , 47,000 death . Based common statistical approach , proportional hazard model develop study relate set essential characteristic prediction CVD mortality . The characteristic include body mass index , age , blood pressure , serum cholesterol , smoking , diabetes status . The model compare term ability predict absolute risk mortality across study . Secondary analysis conduct discover factor associate inaccurate prediction study characteristic associate particular finding , interaction term . An empirical examination conduct method add newly discover risk factor exist prediction equation . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
