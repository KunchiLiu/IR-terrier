	<brief_summary>The purpose study see addition capravirine VIRACEPT ( nelfinavir mesylate ) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) effective combination drug therapy HIV patient fail nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Capravirine Plus VIRACEPT Plus Two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors HIV-Infected Patients Who Failed Previous Anti-HIV Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ Note : As 2/28/2001 , due toxicity study concern safety , patient need sign new inform consent . Patients take capravirine currently viral load 400 copies/ml may continue take capravirine 1400 mg twice daily . Capravirine discontinue patient viral load great 400 copies/ml last visit switch new therapy continue background therapy deem appropriate investigator . ] This study take place approximately 150 center US , Canada , Europe , Australia , Argentina , South Africa . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment group stratify geographic site ( North American non-North American ) , plasma HIV-1 RNA level , prior NNRTI use . Group 1 patient receive capravirine plus VIRACEPT plus 2 new NRTIs Group 2 patient receive capravirine placebo plus VIRACEPT plus 2 new NRTIs . NRTIs provide sponsor . Patients may remain assigned treatment 48 week , posttherapy follow-up occur 1 3 month . Assessments , do various time throughout study , include medical history , HIV antibody test , complete symptom-directed physical examination , vital sign , height , weight , serum pregnancy test , hematology , chemistry , record concomitant medication adverse event . Other select assessment perform specified visit . Plasma sample resistance test blood specimen peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain several time . The plasma sample PBMCs may use viral drug resistance test . Blood sample quantitation capravirine , VIRACEPT , M8 ( metabolite VIRACEPT ) plasma concentration collect several time . Additional blood sample analysis drug concentration may request depend concomitant NRTIs medication . A Data Safety Monitoring Board monitor patient safety prescribe interval study .</detailed_description>
