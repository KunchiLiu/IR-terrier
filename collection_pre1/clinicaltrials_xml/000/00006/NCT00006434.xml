	<brief_summary>When patient relapse primary chemotherapy Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , may eligible receive high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support . Unfortunately high-dose chemotherapy curative less half patient receive . This study conduct determine safety , side effect , ability respond investigational vaccine consist tumor-pulsed dendritic cell give immune stimulate drug call interleukin-2 . The patient must lymphomatous node accessible excision prepare vaccine . Dendritic cell immune cell obtain blood , important body 's immune response foreign substance . This study examine response immune system three vaccination ( compose dendritic cell , expose dead fragment lymphoma cell ) give begin three month transplant . Vaccination may result sensitize patient 's dendritic cell lymphoma cell , potentially result immune response lymphoma . Twelve patient treat study .</brief_summary>
