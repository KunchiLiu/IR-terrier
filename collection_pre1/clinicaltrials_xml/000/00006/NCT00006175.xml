	<brief_summary>This study measure level enzyme call cyclooxygenase gum tissue follow third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction . Cyclooxygenase think contribute pain normally follow tissue injury surgery . Healthy volunteer 16 35 year age require removal third molar may eligible study . Participants receive injection local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) mouth sedative ( midazolam ) arm vein surgery . Before tooth remove , small tissue sample ( biopsy ) collect gum tissue cover one low third molar extract . After surgery , second biopsy take point surgery time pain extraction start develop . These tissue sample analyze cyclooxygenase level . Patients stay clinic 4 hour surgery anesthetic wear . During time , complete pain questionnaire . If need , patient may receive additional medicine pain relief time surgery 4-hour observation period . They also give standard pain medication take home end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostanoids inflammatory mediator implicate stage acute chronic inflammation . The inhibition prostanoid synthesis NSAIDs form basis therapeutic well side effect . NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [ COX ] , lead reduction prostaglandin synthesis also gastric erosion , inhibition platelet aggregation nephrotoxicity . The identification two isoforms COX lead hypothesis COX-2 responsible production prostaglandin follow tissue injury , COX-1 involve normal homeostasis . This hypothesis primarily base result animal study chronic inflammatory condition arthritis . Recent result oral surgery model acute inflammation suggest COX-2 present oral mucosa may contribute prostanoid production acute inflammation rather require induction response injury . The propose study aim evaluate time course COX-1 COX-2 acute inflammation evaluating level mRNA baseline prior surgery , completion surgery , one , two three hour follow surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects healthy volunteer age 1635 year present Clinical Center removal third molar . The type third molar characterize time screen oral exam panoramic radiograph : 1 . Erupted tooth : Clinical crown present mouth cover soft tissue . 2 . Soft tissue impaction : Clinical crown present mouth adjacent alveolar bone cover portion crown radiograph . 3 . Partial bony impaction : Clinical crown present mouth alveolar bone cover crown radiograph . 4 . Full bony impaction : Clinical crown present mouth alveolar bone cover crown radiograph . Patients eligible inclusion study two mandibular molar classify partial full bony impaction . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pregnant nursing . Presence infection inflammation [ pericoronitis ] either extraction site . Patients take follow drug : antidepressant , diuretic , aspirin near daily basis , coumadin blood thinner ; drug might influence pain report COX formation , e.g . steroid .</criteria>
