	<brief_title>Identification Asthma Susceptibility Gene 3P</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma increasingly common disease cause bronchial inflammation characterize bronchial hyperresponsiveness intermittent airways obstruction . The development asthma likely determine interaction host susceptibility environmental exposure . Bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) elevate total serum IgE level , characteristic finding asthma , show strong genetic component . The identification genetic factor regulate susceptibility asthma important public health consequence , may lead improved understanding pathogenesis asthma . This may lead improved preventive measure new therapeutic approach . The study response Request Applications `` Positional Candidate Gene Approaches Asthma Gene Discovery '' issue October 1999 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In effort delineate genetic susceptibility asthma , Dr. Bleecker colleague identify several region genome contain potential asthma susceptibility gene use Dutch population 200 family ascertain proband asthma . The two region strongest evidence linkage complete genome screen locate chromosome 3p14-p21 5q31 . They identify asthma susceptibility gene locate chromosome 3p use Dutch family determine contribution disease population . There six specific aim study . The first develop high-resolution genetic map candidate region chromosome 3p14-p21 . The second aim construct correlate genetic physical map candidate region chromosome 3p . The third aim genotype additional cohort Dutch trio ( one affect child parent ) identify haplotype confirm case-control candidate gene study . The fourth aim analyze know novel gene candidate region use case-control study design population . The fifth aim determine contribution chromosome 3p asthma susceptibility gene population include U.S. Collaborative Study Genetics Asthma ( CSGA ) Dr. Ober 's Hutterite population . The sixth aim characterize identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) haplotype contribute asthma susceptibility . There interaction investigator determine impact genetic locus investigate gene-gene interaction .</detailed_description>
