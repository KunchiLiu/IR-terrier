	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Without intervention , 11 percent child sickle cell anemia sustain stroke age 20 . The STOP 2 follow recently complete NHLBI trial , Stroke Prevention Trial Sickle Cell Anemia ( STOP 1 ) , find patient high risk stroke could identify use transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasound , incidence stroke could reduce 90 percent child periodic blood transfusion least 36 month . However , chronic intermittent blood transfusion cumbersome , expensive associate morbidity iron overload . Thus , study determine transfusion safely halt 30 month treatment critically important continue clinical care patient sickle cell disease risk stroke . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In multicenter , randomize clinical trial , 100 child randomize continue receive periodic transfusion therapy 50 discontinue receive periodic transfusion therapy . The primary endpoint reversion transcranial Doppler velocity level great 200 cm/second , indicate return increase risk overt stroke . Recruitment two phase . Phase I include patient begin transfusion April 1 , 1999 . These come mainly STOP 1 cohort . Those begin transfusion April 1 , 1999 April 1 , 2001 eligible Phase II recruitment . All patient receive quarterly TCD examination . Patients revert high risk offer return transfusion . The overall design include three month start-up , two phase recruitment ( establish STOP patient new patient ) total 36 month , 18 month observation recruitment end 3 month wrap-up . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
