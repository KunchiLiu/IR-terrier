	<brief_summary>Children Sensory Modulation Dysfunction ( SMD ) either over- under-react stimulus environment . This cause significant problem daily activity may lead anxiety , poor attention , low self-esteem , complication motor , cognitive , social emotional development . Diagnosis SMD base physiological response specific stimulus , measure behavioral/social/emotional symptom , study result functional limitation disability . Treatments involve direct biomedical behavioral intervention improve sensory processing , well adjustment home , school community environment . This study compare effect occupational therapy vs. alternative therapy reactivity function child SMD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single masked , crossover trial randomize child Sensory Modulation Dysfunction ( SMD ) either Occupational Therapy ( OT ) , alternative treatment ( Activity Protocol ) , delay treatment ( initially control group ) . Children assign one three treatment group use random number table block randomization . Assignments make research assistant , mask assessment , parent priority , family needs/characteristics . Using block procedure , first child randomly assign treatment group A , B , C. The next child enter study age , gender socioeconomic status ( parent ' education ) randomly assign one two remain group . The third child meeting age , gender SES criterion automatically assign remain group . This procedure reduce seasonal confounds chance variation group characteristic . The order treatment group : GROUP A ( OT - 1st 10 week ; Activity - 2nd 10 week ) ; GROUP B ( Activity - 1st 10 week ; OT - 2nd 10 wks ) ; GROUP C ( Wait list - 1st 10 week ; OT - 2nd 10 wks ; Activity - 3rd 10 wks ) . Inclusion study base standardized assessment physiological reactivity `` Sensory Challenge Protocol '' , technique develop research group publish several medical journal . Standardized measurement physiologic , behavioral emotional status , administer treatment , treatment condition , treatment complete investigator mask treatment ; include follow : Measurements Impairment : The Sensory Challenge protocol laboratory paradigm child 's physiologic reactivity sensation test use electrodermal reactivity vagal tone index assess sympathetic parasympathetic system . Measurements functional limitation include aggression , withdrawal , impulsivity , hyperactivity , inattention , sensitivity tactile , movement , taste , smell , auditory visual stimulus . These measure area : ( 1 ) attention ( subscales parent-report Child Behavior Checklist [ CBCL ] , Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised ; Continuous Performance Task , StopTask Go-No Go Task ) ; ( 2 ) emotion ( CBCL ) ; ( 3 ) sensation ( Short Sensory Profile ; Leiter-R ; Multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children ; Stop Task ; Go-No-Go Task ; Auditory Continuous Performance Test ) . Measures Disability Dimension include Vineland Scales Adaptive Behavior , Goal Attainment Scale , play dinner-time paradigm . Finally , measure Societal Limitations Dimension include parent semi-structured interview Visual Analogue Scale . Occupational therapy target protocol involve functional sensory-integration activity , support family-based activity home .</detailed_description>
