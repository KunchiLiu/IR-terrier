	<brief_title>SU5416 Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate , median overall survival , time progression patient unresectable malignant mesothelioma treat SU5416 . II . Determine effect SU5416 surrogate biologic endpoint , include microvessel density , tissue proliferative index , apoptosis , vascular endothelial growth factor level , tumor perfusion measure MRI patient . III . Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly . Courses repeat every 4 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 21-45 patient accrue study within 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
