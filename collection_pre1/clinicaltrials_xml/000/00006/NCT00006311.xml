	<brief_title>Anxiety Vagal Control Heart Coronary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease continue lead cause death United States , despite risk factor reduction technological advance treatment option . Prospective study implicate chronic anxiety independent risk factor fatal coronary heart disease . In particular , anxiety increase risk sudden cardiac death substantially . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Nine hundred fifty CAD patient recruit study patient hospitalize elective cardiac catheterization . Anxiety measure Hospital Anxiety Scale , Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory , Crown-Crisp Phobic Anxiety Scale . Symptoms depression measure Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , Hospital Depression Scale , Beck Depression Inventory . Vagal control heart rate determine use power spectral analysis measure two index vagal control : baroreceptor-mediated vagal reflex cardiac control , respiratory sinus arrhythmia . Patients follow 6 month , l year , 2 year , 3 year postcatheterization , cardiac mortality data obtain , include non-sudden sudden cardiac death . The data generate study use examine involvement impair vagal cardiac control risk fatal coronary heart disease sudden cardiac death associate anxiety . Specifically , study examine : ( 1 ) relationship anxiety cardiac mortality ; ( 2 ) relationship anxiety vagal control ; ( 3 ) role play reduced vagal control mediate anxiety-related risk ; ( 4 ) relationship depression , vagal control cardiac risk . Findings relationship anxiety , reduced vagal control sudden cardiac death would suggest potential importance early intervention cardiac patient anxiety disorder would underscore benefit aggressive monitoring arrhythmias population , may ultimately translate reduce mortality rate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
