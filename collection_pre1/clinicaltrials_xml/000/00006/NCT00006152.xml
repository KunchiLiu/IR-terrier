	<brief_summary>The purpose study see add 1 2 drug anti-HIV therapy patient whose HIV level increase take anti-HIV drug low viral load ( amount HIV blood ) keep low Week 24 . ( This study change . Previously , patient whose level increase first round anti-HIV drug study . ) Anti-HIV drug treatment contain combination 3 drug low HIV level , raise CD4 cell count , improve survival . Unfortunately , many patient `` fail '' anti-HIV drug treatment HIV level go 500 copies/ml . Usually next step switch patient different anti-HIV drug . Doctors would like see whether add 1 2 different drug `` fail '' treatment also low HIV level . Adding 1 2 drug might better switch drug since patient take many different drug develop drug-resistant HIV . ( This study change . Previously , patient take protease inhibitor ( PI ) whose level increase first round anti-HIV drug study . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Successful therapy follow viral rebound problematic . Intensification exist regimen add 1 2 drug generally avoid . However , successfully add new drug exist regimen would advantageous since would expose patient few antiretroviral agent overall treatment course . Recent evidence suggest significant proportion patient experience viral rebound receive protease inhibitor ( PI ) actually viral rebound PI-sensitive virus . Other study show treatment decision base resistance assay result good virologic outcomes . This trial examine effect resistance assay-directed intensification PI-containing antiretroviral regimen viral load . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/03/01 : The antiretroviral regimen need contain protease inhibitor . ] Patients stratified baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level ( 5,000 copies/ml less versus great 5,000 copies/ml ) . Patients undergo phenotypic drug resistance test prior study entry . Based phenotypic result , patient [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : selectively ] randomize equally 1 3 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : 1 2 ] intensification strategy remain current , initial [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : ( background ) ] antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/03/01 : ART need initial . ] A patient exclude randomization arm arm contain drug patient phenotypic resistance . Arm A add abacavir ( ABC ) . Arm B add amprenavir ( APV ) [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : ritonavir ( RTV ) ] . Arm C add didanosine ( ddI ) plus hydroxyurea ( HU ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : Arm C discontinue . ] A patient 's HIV must sensitive least 3 drug . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00 : Each patient must take least 3 drug his/her HIV isolate sensitive , include ABC APV least 2 drug part current , initial ( background ) ART . If phenotypic resistance test screen indicates resistance nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) drug patient 's current , initial ( background ) ART , local investigator may choose discontinue drug . However , patient local investigator may choose continue drug consider active drug per protocol . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/03/01 : ART need initial . ] Patients regular clinic visit physical exam blood test , include CD4 CD8 cell count , plasma HIV-1 RNA assay , test pharmacokinetic variability . In event viral rebound 500 copies/ml Week 12 later , phenotypic/genotypic drug resistance assay . In addition , phenotypic drug resistance assay primary endpoint ( Week 24 ) end treatment ( Week 48 ) patient .</detailed_description>
