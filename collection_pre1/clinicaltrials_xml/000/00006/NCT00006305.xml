	<brief_summary>The BARI 2D trial multicenter study use 2x2 factorial design , 2400 patient assigned random initial elective revascularization aggressive medical therapy aggressive medical therapy alone equal probability , simultaneously assign random insulin provide insulin sensitize strategy glycemic control ( target value HbA1c le 7.0 % patient ) . SPECIFIC AIMS A . Primary Aim The primary aim BARI 2D trial test follow two hypothesis treatment efficacy 2400 patient Type 2 diabetes mellitus document stable CAD , set uniform glycemic control intensive management risk factor include dyslipidemia , hypertension , smoking , obesity : 1 . Coronary Revascularization Hypothesis : strategy initial elective revascularization choice ( surgical catheter-based ) combine aggressive medical therapy result low 5-year mortality compare strategy aggressive medical therapy alone ; 2 . Method Glycemic Control Hypothesis : target HbA1c level le 7.0 % , strategy hyperglycemia management direct insulin sensitization result low 5-year mortality compare strategy insulin provision . B . Secondary Aims The secondary aim BARI 2D trial include : ) compare death , myocardial infarction stroke combined endpoint event rate revascularization versus medical therapy group insulin sensitization versus insulin provision group ; b ) compare rate myocardial infarction , ischemic event , angina quality life associate revascularization hyperglycemia management strategy ; c ) evaluate relative economic cost associate trial treatment strategy , ) explore effect glycemic control strategy progression mechanism vasculopathy include change PAI-1 gene expression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Type 2 diabetes mellitus , become prevalent society population age , one strong risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) consequent mortality . In addition generate enormous toll human suffering , diabetes place economic burden approach 100 billion dollar annually U.S. health care system . Despite well know dismal prognosis diabetes complicate angiographically document CAD , optimal treatment paradigm large group patient study . Coronary revascularization , increasingly use , directly show additional benefit simultaneous intensive medical management CAD along management hyperglycemia , hypertension , dyslipidemia , risk factor . Moreover , intensive effort low HbA1c demonstrate favorably affect clinical course Type 2 diabetes mellitus term microvascular complication , optimal hyperglycemia management strategy regard macrovascular outcome know . These critical treatment dilemma motivate development BARI 2D , multicenter randomize trial design determine patient Type 2 diabetes stable CAD : 1 ) efficacy initial elective coronary revascularization combine aggressive medical therapy , compare initial strategy aggressive medical therapy alone ; 2 ) efficacy strategy provide insulin ( endogenous exogenous ) , versus strategy increase sensitivity insulin ( reduce insulin resistance ) , management hyperglycemia , target HbA1c level le 7.0 % strategy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The BARI 2D trial multicenter study use 2x2 factorial design , 2400 patient assigned random initial elective revascularization aggressive medical therapy aggressive medical therapy alone equal probability , simultaneously assign random insulin provide insulin sensitize strategy glycemic control ( target value HbA1c le 7.0 % patient ) . Following confirmation patient eligibility provision write consent , patient randomize show : Number Patients Per Treatment Assignment ( N=2400 patient total ) Stable Ischemic Heart Disease Treatment Strategy Glycemic Control Strategy : Revascularization Insulin Providing ( IP ) N=600 ; Revascularization Insulin Sensitizing ( IS ) N=600 ; Medical Insulin Providing ( IP ) N=600 ; Medical Insulin Sensitizing ( IS ) N=600 .</detailed_description>
