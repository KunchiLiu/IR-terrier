	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving chemotherapy drug surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial study effectiveness chemotherapy without surgery treating patient recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Surgery Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival progression free survival patient ovarian epithelial cancer receive treatment chemotherapy without secondary cytoreductive surgery . - Determine toxicity treatment regimens patient . - Determine complication related surgical treatment patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord stage initial diagnosis ( early stage I-IIa v advance stage IIb-IV ) , length interval end prior first line chemotherapy ( 1-2 year vs 2 year ) , response first 3 course second line induction chemotherapy study ( change vs partial remission v complete remission ) , number measurable tumor lesion ( 1 vs 1 ) , large tumor size recurrence ( le 5 cm v 5 cm ) , participate center . Patients receive second line induction chemotherapy either 3 course 3-4 week regimen 6 course weekly regimen platinum base ( cisplatin carboplatin ) therapy . Patients change , partial remission , complete remission randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery within 14 day randomization . Within 8 week last preoperative chemotherapy course , patient continue platinum base chemotherapy every 3-4 week least 3 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients continue platinum base chemotherapy least 3 additional course arm I . Quality life assess baseline ; 4th 6th course chemotherapy 1 week surgery ; 6th course chemotherapy chemotherapy arm OR 4th 6th course chemotherapy surgery arm ; 2 month chemotherapy 6th course chemotherapy surgery arm ; every 6 month 5 year . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 700 patient accrue study within 5 year .</detailed_description>
