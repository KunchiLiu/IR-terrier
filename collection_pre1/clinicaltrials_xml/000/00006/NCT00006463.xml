	<brief_title>Ecteinascidin 743 Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity ecteinascidin 743 pediatric patient refractory solid tumor . II . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . III . Determine antitumor activity drug patient population . OUTLINE : This dose escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord pretreatment ( pretreated vs less heavily pretreated ) . Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment continue every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos ecteinascidin 743 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-20 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
