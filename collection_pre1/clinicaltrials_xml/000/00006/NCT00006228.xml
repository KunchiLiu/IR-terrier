	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate toxicity low-dose IL-2 intermediate- '' pulse '' dose interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) trastuzumab patient uni-dimensional measurable metastatic breast cancer human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive ( 3+ overexpression immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] method positive fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) either evidence progressive disease receive trastuzumab-containing regimen , progressive disease within 12 month receive trastuzumab-containing regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform correlative immunologic assay determine degree natural killer ( NK ) cell expansion response low-dose IL-2 , effectiveness patient ' peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) assay direct HER2 target cell . II . To determine pharmacokinetics trastuzumab use every 2-week schedule . III . To determine Fc-gamma receptor polymorphism study patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 8 aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2-7 9-21 . Beginning day 22 , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30 minute every 14 day . Patients also receive aldesleukin SC daily day 1-14 . Treatment continue 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
