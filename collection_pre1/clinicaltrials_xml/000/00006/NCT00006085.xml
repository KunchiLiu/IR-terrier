	<brief_title>CP-609,754 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , maximum tolerate dose CP-609,754 patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine predictability , duration , intensity , onset , reversibility , dose relationship observed toxicity patient treat regimen . III . Determine preliminary evidence antitumor activity treatment assess response rate time disease progression patient population . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive oral CP-609,754 1-2 time daily . Treatment continue every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CP-609,754 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 44-56 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
