	<brief_title>Capecitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy capecitabine term PSA response , PSA response duration , time PSA progression patient metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer . II . Evaluate toxicity treatment patient . III . Evaluate correlation PSA response quality life patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment continue every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess day 1 8 first course treatment , day 1 course thereafter , treatment failure . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
