	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Anti-HIV Drug Combination With Without Hydroxyurea Patients With Early HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) single HIV-1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) result significant sustained decrease plasma HIV-1 RNA resultant mark diminution selection drug-resistant variant able adhere tolerate regimen . However , two line evidence suggest additional perhaps aggressive approach may necessary HIV-infected individual : 1 ) failure potent three-drug regimen sustain viral replication level limit detection ; 2 ) ability recover virus lymphoid tissue obtain without evidence detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA use sensitive assay . A regimen contain drug potentially different mechanism action synergistic activity may result great , rapid , durable antiviral activity , reduce number latently infected cell patient acute early HIV-1 infection . Patients Group I begin study therapy within 7 14 day screen . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm A receives stavudine ( d4T ) plus didanosine ( ddI ) plus ritonavir plus indinavir . Arm B receive d4T plus ddI plus ritonavir plus indinavir plus hydroxyurea . Patients discontinue hydroxyurea Week 24 . Group II consist patient meet eligibility criterion elect receive antiretroviral treatment . Patients Groups I II follow schedule evaluation . Enrollment visit ( Week 0 ) evaluation complete prior dispense drug , patient clinical , virologic , immunologic evaluation perform every 4 week Week 24 , every 8 week thereafter . Patients Group I take study drug 104 week optional 52-week rollover . Laboratory result Week 96 evaluation use decide whether patient continue study medication . Patients elect participate optional rollover meet criterion treatment failure time study offer best available treatment discretion HIV care provider continue follow 8-week interval .</detailed_description>
