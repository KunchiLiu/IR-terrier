	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect new anti-inflammatory drug , Celebrex , relieve pain oral surgery . It also design assess drug 's selective inhibition chemical call cyclooxygenase-2 closely related form , cyclooxygenase-1 . This selective inhibition allow pain alleviation without adverse side effect ( e.g. , bleed stomach upset ) often associate anti-inflammatory drug . Healthy volunteer require removal third molar eligible study . Participants oral surgery tooth extraction receive local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) mouth sedative ( midazolam ) arm vein . On even 1 hour surgery , patient give dose either standard anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen ( Advil , Nuprin , Motrin ) , Celebrex , placebo ( pill active ingredient ) . After surgery , small piece tubing place extraction site tie adjacent tooth hold place . Samples collect tubing measure chemical involve pain inflammation . Patients stay clinic 6 hour surgery anesthetic wear complete pain questionnaire . During time , may receive acetaminophen plus codeine ( Tylenol 3 ) , need , pain . The tube remove patient discharged standard pain medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostanoids mediator implicate stage inflammation . The inhibition prostanoid synthesis NSAIDs form basis therapeutic well side effect . NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [ COX ] , lead reduction prostaglandin synthesis also gastric erosion , inhibition platelet aggregation nephrotoxicity . The identification two isoforms COX lead hypothesis COX-2 responsible production prostaglandin follow tissue injury , COX-1 involve normal homeostasis . The selective COX-2 inhibitor believe efficacious anti-inflammatory drug devoid side effect associate inhibition COX-1 . However , selectivity drug demonstrate vitro ex vivo , may reliable indicator vivo selectivity . The propose study aim evaluate vivo selectivity celecoxib , drug demonstrate selective inhibitor COX-2 vitro oral surgery model acute inflammation .</detailed_description>
