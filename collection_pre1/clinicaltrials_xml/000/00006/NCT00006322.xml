	<brief_title>Birth Weight Effect Blood Pressure Late Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease lead cause morbidity mortality United States . On basis interplay genetic environmental factor , disease appear root childhood . Recent report implicate intrauterine nutritional environment regulate fetal growth determinant adult cardiovascular disease . According concept , impaired fetal growth , consequent low birth weight , result alteration organ structure subsequent functional impairment later life . Higher blood pressure ( BP ) suggest possible link compromise intrauterine growth long-term risk cardiovascular disease . Despite many report appear support low birth weight - high BP hypothesis , concept conflict body data association BP body size childhood , adolescence , adulthood consistently demonstrate direct relationship body weight BP . The result prospective study contribute objective body data important issue . If birth measure reflect intrauterine exposure contribute significantly BP later childhood , study focus mechanism regulate risk justify . Alternatively , post-natal/childhood parameter major determinant later BP , effort focus effective preventive strategy childhood , obesity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To examine low birth weight - high blood pressure concept , investigator conduct prospective study cohort child well characterize birth . In 1988 , data weight , length , BP , gestation maternal health obtain 1,160 newborn case represent range birth weight gestational age . They re-examine child age 11-13 year test overall hypothesis birth weight , well newborn measure intrauterine growth , correlate BP age 11-13 year . The aim project : 1 ) determine birth weight contribute BP and/or body size childhood ; 2 ) determine duration intrauterine growth term gestational age contribute BP body size ; 3 ) determine newborn ponderal index , measure relative fetal growth , contribute BP body size ; 4 ) determine relative contribution newborn measure birth weight , gestational age , BP , ponderal index , maternal health BP body size late childhood . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
