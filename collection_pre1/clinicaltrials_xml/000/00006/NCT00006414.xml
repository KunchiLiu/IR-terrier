	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness experimental treatment improve hand function patient stroke affect one side body . One main problem stroke patient difficulty use affected hand . Most treatment focus acute ( early ) intervention , although special exercise may help chronic patient . Previous study indicate combine hand exercise anesthesia ( block motor sensory function ) upper arm may improve hand movement stroke patient , even chronic state . This study examine whether exercise plus anesthesia treatment beneficial patient long-term exercise alone . Patients 18 year old least 12 month post stroke , affect one side body , may eligible study . Candidates medical history physical neurological examination . Participants randomly divide two group : one practice hand exercise without upper arm anesthesia exercise anesthesia . All patient perform two consecutive session 30-minute pinch practice-forceful pinch thumb index finger . Patients anesthesia group anesthetic inject low neck . Enough anesthetic administer block motor sensory function shoulder upper arm , maintain much function possible forearm hand . All patient also transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) testing . For procedure , brief electrical current pass insulated wire coil place head , produce magnetic pulse . The pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current outer part brain . During study , patient ask make movement , simple task , tense muscle , electrical activity muscle record . Patients four session 3-week interval three follow-up session 3 week , 9 week 24 week test . Follow-up evaluation include pinch power testing , TMS , sensory function test hand function measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol enhance understand effect regional anesthesia proximal arm pair practice motor recovery stroke . We plan determine ; 1 ) regional anesthesia proximal arm ( elbow level ) pair practice chronic disable stroke patient enhance improvement hand motor function addition motor power ; 2 ) enhancement motor improvement achieve repetitive trial intervention ; 3 ) long effect last .</detailed_description>
