	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining two treatment may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy radiation therapy treat patient stage II stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer completely remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine humoral T-cell response adjuvant monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine radiotherapy patient completely resect stage II IIIA non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity regimen patient . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine intracutaneously separate site weekly 3 week begin 2-7 week ( later 49 day ) surgery subcutaneously monthly 2 year regardless disease progression . Beginning 1 week third postoperative vaccination , patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 5-6 week . Patients extracapsular nodal metastasis T3 lesion also undergo 6 additional radiotherapy boost . Patients follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 54 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
