	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The optimal degree hemodilution profoundly hypothermic CPB remain controversial , widely dissimilar hemodilution study evolve center perform infant cardiac surgery . HCT , measurement volume red blood cell , interest cardiopulmonary bypass . Higher HCT level expose individual risk microvascular occlusion ( blockage small blood vessel ) , low HCT level may critically limit oxygen delivery brain organ . Preliminary research suggest high HCT level provide superior brain myocardial protection , study report outcomes usage high versus lower HCT level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In single-center , prospective , randomize study , hemodilution HCT level 35 % versus 25 % compare respect neurodevelopmental outcome early postoperative course infant congenital heart disease . The first aim study test hypothesis hemodilution HCT level 35 % , compare level 25 % , associate superior central nervous system protection . The primary outcome variable developmental outcome age 1 year , assess use Bayley Scales Infant Development . Secondary outcome variable include follow : 1 ) tissue release S-100 protein measure cerebral cellular injury ; 2 ) cerebral hemodynamics oxygenation , determine near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) ; 3 ) intrinsic cerebral vasoregulation , measure NIRS transcranial Doppler ; 4 ) age 1 year , neurologic examination , MacArthur inventory , structural volumetric finding magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The second aim study test hypothesis hemodilution HCT level 35 % , compare level 25 % , associate well early postoperative cardiovascular status . The primary outcome measure serum lactate level 1 hour surgery . Secondary outcome measure include follow : 1 ) duration postoperative endotracheal intubation , ICU stay , hospital stay ; 2 ) serum lactate level ; 3 ) PaO2/FiO2 ratio ; 4 ) level circulate pro-inflammatory cytokine ; 5 ) percent change total body water , estimate bioelectrical impedance . The structure study allow assessment whether 1-year outcome predict perioperative variable HCT strategy . Through use novel technique NIRS volumetric MRI , study may also provide insight mechanism HCT perioperative variable affect brain . The information obtain study broadly generalize infant form congenital heart disease undergo early repair substantial impact clinical practice .</detailed_description>
