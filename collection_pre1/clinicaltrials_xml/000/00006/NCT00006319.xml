	<brief_summary>This study try identify mutation gene responsible primary immunodeficiency disorder ( inherited disease immune system ) evaluate course disease patient time learn medical problem cause . The immune system compose various cell ( e.g. , T B cell phagocytes ) substance ( complement system ) protect body infection cancer . Abnormalities gene ( ) responsible function component lead serious infection immune problem . Patients Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) deficiency , Janus Associated Kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) deficiency , common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) immunodeficiency may eligible study . Participants undergo medical family history , physical examination , additional procedure test may include follow : 1 . Blood test : routine laboratory study ( i.e . cell count , enzyme level , electrolyte , etc . ) ; HIV testing ; immune response various substance ; genetic testing ; establishment cell line maintain supply cell continue study 2 . Urine saliva test biochemical study 3 . Skin test assess response antigens virus bacteria responsible tetanus , candida , tuberculosis , diphtheria , chicken pox , disease . 4 . Skin lymph node biopsy tissue DNA study 5 . Chest X-ray , CT scan , look cancer various infection . 6 . Pulmonary function test ass lung capacity breath test test H. pylorus infection . 7 . Dental , skin eye examination . 8 . Treatment intravenous immunoglobulin antibody prevent infection . 9 . Apheresis collect white blood cell study cell function . In procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove , red cell , platelet plasma return body , either needle second needle place arm . 10 . Bone marrow sample study disease . A small amount marrow hipbone drawn ( aspirate ) needle . The procedure do local anesthesia light sedation . 11 . Placental umbilical cord blood study , cord blood available , study stem cell ( cell form blood cell ) . Information gain study may provide good understand primary immunodeficiency , lead good diagnosis treatment . In addition , study participant may receive medical genetic counseling may find eligible NIH study diseases .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol study patient primary immunodeficiency disorder goal contribute clinical molecular understand heterogeneous group inherit disease . Clinical issue address include disease manifestation evolution , well prevention management medical problem . Patients diseases known molecular basis ( include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , ADA deficiency , JAK3 deficiency syndrome ) genotyped order investigate phenotype-genotype correlation . Patients disease unknown incomplete genetic characterization study hope contribute identification specific gene responsible disease . Studies fresh cell , cell line tissue sample perform help characterize patient syndrome well test efficacy genetic correction available . The outcome seek improve knowledge molecular basis , clinical presentation evolution primary immunodeficiency disease collaborate maintain improve health status patient . No investigational clinical intervention plan protocol . It anticipate additional protocol generate preliminary data gather umbrella study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinical history sign symptom suggestive primary immune deficiency syndrome family member eligible inclusion study may refer physician selfreferred . If possible , local physician/clinical immunologist identify selfreferred patient serve primary reference . If screening patient , either phone interview review medical record indicate patient may primary immunodeficiency syndrome HIVnegative , patient invite come NIH sign inform consent . If family history positive immunodeficiency , patient family member may ask invite relative contact PI participate study . Adult patient unable provide inform consent eligible participate permission obtain legal guardian durable power attorney . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability subject subject parent/guardian provide inform consent . Patients infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus enrollment .</criteria>
