	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Giving monoclonal antibody different way may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness monoclonal antibody therapy treat patient ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients Scheduled Surgery Remove Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 ( In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 ) give intraperitoneally OR intravenously patient ovarian carcinoma . II . Compare localization In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 ovarian cancer tissue intraperitoneal vs intravenous injection . III . Compare biodistribution pharmacokinetics drug administer intraperitoneally vs intravenously patient . IV . Determine antibody response patient drug . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm first come sequential basis . Arm I : Patients receive indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 ( In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 ) intraperitoneally 30 minute . Arm II : Patients receive In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 IV 30 minute . Patients undergo surgical debulking 3-7 day follow In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 administration , biopsy sample obtain assess radioactive uptake . Immunohistochemistry also perform . Blood sample obtain assess serum radioactivity . Whole body image perform 3 hour infusion radiolabeled monoclonal antibody , day surgery , one time point . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10 patient ( 5 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
