	<brief_summary>This study explore new screen method early detection breast ovarian cancer woman high risk disease , alter breast cancer 1 ( BRCA1 ) breast cancer 2 ( BRCA2 ) gene . It also try determine breast tissue characteristic woman BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation differ woman normal gene . Premenopausal woman 25 45 year age participate National Cancer Institute study family individual high genetic risk cancer ( 78-C-0039 99-C-0081 ) least 50 percent probability carry alter BRCA1 BRCA2 gene may eligible study . At first visit , participant 4 24 tablespoon blood drawn interview breast ovarian cancer risk factor , family personal history cancer , history pregnancy , use oral contraceptive hormone drug , previous surgery breast ovary . In addition , undergo follow procedure : Routine breast ovarian cancer screen high-risk woman , include mammogram , breast pelvic exam , instruction breast self-examination , CA 125 blood test transvaginal ultrasound ovary . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) breast MRI use strong magnetic field show structural chemical change tissue . Breast Duct Lavage In procedure sample fluid cell line breast milk duct collect look cancerous pre-cancerous cell change . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan PET scan do participant whose mammogram MRI finding require additional evaluation . This diagnostic test base difference cell take use glucose ( sugar ) , one body main fuel . Annual follow-up visit schedule 3 year include routine high-risk screening describe , blood draw , update family history risk factor , breast MRI , breast duct lavage , change MRI mammogram need evaluation , PET repeat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Imaging Studies Women High Genetic Risk Breast Cancer : Annual Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Women carry mutation gene BRCA1/2 high lifetime risk breast cancer ( BC ) risk develop BC earlier age woman general population . - Prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy may use decrease risk intensify mammographic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) surveillance may allow early diagnosis ; however , prophylactic mastectomy show convey survival advantage conservative management . - Greater breast tissue density low BC incidence result lower positive predictive value mammography premenopausal woman compare postmenopausal woman ( PPV=0.04 woman age 40-49 ) . - This study explore whether high-risk breast image phenotype may identify compare image characteristic mutation carriers/non-carriers use two imaging modality : mammography MRI . - Nipple Aspiration Fluid collection ( NAF ) breast duct lavage use obtain cytologic material may use adjunct breast image early detection epithelial atypia pre-invasive cancer . Objectives : - Compare four outcome include two mammographic density measure ( qualitative semiquantitative ) , fibroglandular volume measure use MRI , contrast enhancement measure use MRI ( semiquantitative ) mutation carriers/non-carriers improve lesion detection - Explore non-ionizing approach ( MRI ) BC screen effect ionize radiation due mammography unknown . - Use NAF and/or BDL obtain epithelial cell sample correlate cytologic imaging finding . - Gather prospective data transformation normal/hyperplastic/pre-invasive/invasive disease BRCA1/2 mutation carriers/non-carriers molecular/genetic study breast tissue ( via biopsy radiographic abnormality ) breast fluid ( via BDL and/or nipple aspiration ) develop molecular marker early detection epithelial atypia/pre-invasive cancer . - Assess psychosocial impact participation BC screen program . Eligibility : - Women 25-56 year age carry know BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation . - Women age 25 -56 first- second- degree relative individual deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation . - Women age 25-56 first- second- degree relative individual BRCA-associated cancer family document BRCA mutation . Design : - Prospective cohort study 200 woman gather data evolution epithelial cell/molecular change BRCA1/2 mutation carrier , collecting/analyzing NAF , BDL fluid , biopsy tissue ( indicate ) , serum/lymphocytes ; sample store future study . - Women complete questionnaire undergo breast/pelvis examination , transvaginal ultrasonography , serum pregnancy test , fast glucose , electrolytes , BUN , creatinine CA 125 . Standard four view mammogram breast MRI perform study entry annually three additional year .</detailed_description>

Must : A known BRCA1 BRCA2 deleterious mutation carrier OR A first second degree relative individual know carry deleterious BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation OR A first second degree relative individual tumor associate BreastOvarian Cancer Syndrome family know BRCA mutation . Have undergone genetic counseling risk assessment . Agree release genetic test result stratification purpose , whether choose receive individual test result clinical decisionmaking . Have ECOG performance status 01 . Be able provide inform consent . Have least one nonirradiated breast . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Annual Followup Study : Any following result exclusion Annual Followup Study : Pregnancy lactation within 6 month enrollment . Abnormal CA125 level . Bilateral breast cancer , ovarian ( stage ) breast cancer ( Stage IIB bad ) unless relapse free 5 year prior time enrollment . Patients DCIS , Stage I Stage II breast cancer eligible provide least 6 month completion primary therapy ( surgery , radiation , chemotherapy applicable ) . Tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor adjuvant therapy allow . Patients DCIS , Stage I Stage II breast cancer local relapse primary treatment eligible unless relapse free 5 year prior time enrollment . History invasive cancer unless relapse free 5 year prior time enrollment . NonMelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ except . Previous bilateral mastectomy bilateral radiation therapy . Weigh 136 kilogram . Allergy gadolinium . Allergy lidocaine Marcaine ( bupivacaine ) . ( excluded breast duct lavage ) . Subareolar surgery breast study might disrupt ductal system . For example , papilloma resection , biopsy fine needle aspiration ( FNAs ) within 2 cm nipple might disrupt ductal system . Biopsies FNAs great 2 cm nipple acceptable .
