	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness gemcitabine plus docetaxel treating patient unresectable metastatic liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Docetaxel Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess six-month overall survival patient unresectable metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treat gemcitabine docetaxel . - Determine tumor response time progression patient population treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Assess pharmacokinetics docetaxel patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel IV 15-60 minute gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week . Patients achieve complete response 2 course therapy receive 2 additional course therapy . Patients stable disease partial response continue therapy disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
