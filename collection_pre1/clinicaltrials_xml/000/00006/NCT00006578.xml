	<brief_summary>The purpose study see amount stem cell ( cell develop many kind cell ) blood anti-HIV drug take predict immune system become strong anti-HIV drug give anti-HIV drug restore stem cell . HIV infection show cause stem cell function well . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , cause stem cell go bone marrow ( tissues bone blood cell form ) bloodstream , could possibly help boost immunity anti-HIV treatment . This study examine effect G-CSF help immune system become strong begin anti-HIV treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In HIV infection , progressive decline and/or dysfunction several cell type see . It think stem cell dysfunction destruction may contribute hematologic immunologic perturbation characteristic HIV infection may possibly limit extent immunologic recovery follow HAART . This study propose investigate whether stem cell function reserve important determine extent immune reconstitution follow HAART . Patients stratify accord CD4 count . On Day 0 , patient receive 7-day cycle subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . Blood sample collect regularly , Day 14 patient undergo real-time HIV-1 RNA determination . On Day 28 , sooner HIV RNA least 1 log baseline Day 14 , HAART consist daily receipt abacavir , lamivudine , amprenavir , ritonavir initiate continue Week 76 . Patients achieve viral suppression ( 400 copies/ml plasma HIV-1 RNA ) Week 26 eligible receive second 7-day cycle G-CSF Week 28 , viral suppression continue Week 50 , third cycle G-CSF Week 52 . Patients follow every 8 week change viral load . Additionally , patient monitor regular interval surrogate marker immunologic recovery , cycle G-CSF , measurement stem cell mobilization . Patients may also volunteer A5085s ( Bone Marrow Aspirate Substudy ) participate site .</detailed_description>
