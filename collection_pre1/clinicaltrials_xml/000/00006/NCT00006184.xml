	<brief_summary>Background : The mainstay therapy newly diagnose multiple myeloma patient remain systemic chemotherapy . Although partial remission 60 % obtain conventional regimen , multiple myeloma essentially incurable disease median survival approximately 30 month . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) result high percentage complete remission , associate significant treatment-related mortality , primarily attribute conventional myeloablative transplant regimen . Recent clinical study show highly immunosuppressive yet non-myeloablative dos fludarabine-based chemotherapy result alloengraftment . Even reduction treatment related mortality , success allogeneic SCT limit significant risk relapse . Donor immunization myeloma Id set non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT may represent novel strategy treatment multiple myeloma . Objectives : Primary Objectives : To induce cellular humoral immunity allogeneic stem cell donor recipients unique idiotype express recipient 's myeloma . To determine whether antigen-specific immunity , induced stem cell donor , passively transfer allogeneic SCT recipient set non-myeloablative conditioning regimen . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate effect Fludarabine- ( etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone , cyclophosphamide ) EPOCH regimen host T cell depletion myeloid depletion prior allogeneic SCT . To determine efficacy novel conventional chemotherapy regimen ( Fludarabine-EPOCH ) set multiple myeloma . To determine treatment-related morbidity mortality allogeneic stem cell transplantation use non-myeloablative conditioning regimen multiple myeloma . To determine re-vaccination allogeneic stem cell donor unique idiotype express recipient 's myeloma enhance cellular humoral immunity patient specific-idiotype prior lymphocyte donation treatment patient recurrent progressive disease transplantation . Eligibility : Patients 18-75 year age Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) multiple myeloma . Patients must achieve least partial remission follow initial conventional chemotherapy regimen autologous stem cell transplantation . Consenting first degree relative match 6/6 5/6 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antigens . Design : Phase 2 trial use non-myeloablative condition regimen reduce treatment-related toxicity . Recipient undergo plasmapheresis obtain start material isolation idiotype protein . Donors would immunize Id vaccine prepare patient . Prior transplantation patient would receive conventional chemotherapy regimen contain agent active myeloma T cell deplete . The allogeneic SCT would perform condition regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine . The stem cell source would blood mobilized filgrastim . Recipients immunized Id vaccine follow transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Collection plasma recipient : Patients Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) multiple myeloma . Patients sibling . Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) type recipient donor ( ) initiate . Viral antibody screen initiate . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Recipient : Patients IgG IgA multiple myeloma . Patients must achieve least partial remission follow initial conventional chemotherapy regimen autologous stem cell transplantation . Patients undergone tandem autologous stem transplant eligible meet eligibility criterion . Patients achieve least partial remission initial ( primary ) conventional chemotherapy encourage proceed autologous transplantation , also eligible protocol . Patients 1875 year age . The upper age limit choose felt toxicity would exceed potential benefit old population . Karnofsky performance status great equal 80 % . Life expectancy great 6 month . Left ventricular ejection fraction great 50 % either multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) 2D echo . Carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) great 50 % expect value correct hemoglobin ( Hb ) ( 96 ) . Creatinine le equal 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min . Direct bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dl serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) less 4x top normal . Mprotein : concentration harvest plasma must great 70 % total Ig corresponding isotype . Patients must human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) negative . There theoretical possibility degree immune suppression associate treatment may result progression HIV infection . Patients may Hepatitis B core antigen positive , surface antigen negative without evidence active infection . Patients must Hepatitis C negative . Not pregnant lactating . Patients childbearing potential must use effective method contraception . The effect chemotherapy , subsequent transplant medication use transplant highly likely harmful fetus . The effect upon breast milk also unknown may potentially harmful infant . Consenting first degree relative match 6/6 5/6 HLA antigen , may include mismatch D locus . Ability give inform consent . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Donor : Age 1875 year . As potential cerebrovascular cardiac complication may potentially increase age , age 75 choose arbitrarily upper age limit . However , determine initial accrual patient upper age range procedure relatively safe , age range may extend . No physical contraindication stem cell donation ( i.e . severe atherosclerosis , autoimmune disease , cerebrovascular accident , active malignancy ( 97 ) . Patients severe atherosclerosis history receive cardiology consult judge eligible case case basis . Donors must HIVnegative , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , Hepatitis C antibody negative . This prevent possible transmission infection recipient . Not pregnant lactating . Donors childbearing potential must use effective method contraception . The effect cytokine administration fetus unknown may potentially harmful . The effect upon breast milk also unknown may potentially harmful infant .
