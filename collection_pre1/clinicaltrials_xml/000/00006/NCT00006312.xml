	<brief_title>Hemochromatosis -- Genetic Prevalence Penetrance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) common inherit disorder among Caucasians estimate frequency high 8 per 1000 . Affected individual absorb excessive amount dietary iron develop progressive accumulation tissue iron store consequent organ dysfunction include hepatic cirrhosis , diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , arthropathy impotence . Early diagnosis institution phlebotomy treatment prevent disease manifestation normalize life expectancy . In 1996 , HFE , gene HHC map short arm chromosome 6 ( 6p21.3 ) . HH therefore natural target development routine screening strategy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator demonstrate favorable cost-effectiveness ratio adopt screen strategy HH screen 16,031 primary care patient use serum transferrin saturation ( TS ) level confirm prevalence undiagnosed HH set demonstrate feasibility screening . The recent description HFE gene mutation individual HH make genetic test HH possible may increase attractiveness general screening . However , several important question genetic prevalence penetrance remain addressed recommendation make . The large screened sample provide unique opportunity address several important issue . First , obtain population-based estimate prevalence HFE gene mutation . Second , determine sensitivity serum TS test detect mutation . Third , comparison genotype phenotype allow draw useful inference disease penetrance . The result enable propose optimal screen strategy HH determine place genetic test diagnostic algorithm . This strategy may vary depend age , sex race . The answer question enable determine great confidence relative effectiveness screen strategy HH clarify primary care practitioner patient screen disorder . These question recently identify priority Centers Disease Control Prevention National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute .</detailed_description>
