	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safe tolerable dose protease inhibitor ( PI ) atazanavir ( ATV ) , without low-dose boost PI ritonavir ( RTV ) , take anti-HIV drug HIV infect infant , child , adolescent . Advancements anti-HIV drug HIV infect child adolescent hard make , part patient often take drug prescribe . ATV may better option available form powder child adolescent may willing take regularly . Using low dose RTV boosting agent ATV may also increase chance virologic response highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) -experienced patient . This study aim find safe tolerable dos ATV without low-dose RTV boost infant , child , adolescent . For study , participant enrol United States South Africa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atazanavir Used Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs HIV-Infected Infants , Children , Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advancements HAART HIV-infected child adolescent hinder patient nonadherence . The availability powder formulation once-daily dose schedule make ATV attractive agent improve adherence pediatric treatment regimen . This study design provide pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data guide dose recommendation ATV , give concurrently without low-dose RTV boost , infant , child , adolescent . During study , safety tolerance ATV ( without low-dose RTV ) closely monitor , virologic efficacy data obtain . There two part study . Step I take place United States South Africa , divide two set group , Parts A B . Part A participant receive ATV Part B participant receive ATV low-dose RTV boost . All participant receive ATV day 2 antiretroviral drug ( provide study ) . In Part B , participant receive ATV low dose RTV . Participants place 1 8 group ( Groups 1 4 Part A ; Groups 5 8 Part B ) respect age study drug formulation . Participants Groups 1 5 infant age 3 month 1 day ( 91 day ) 2 year ( less exactly 730 day ) take ATV powder form . Participants Groups 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 child 2 year 1 day ( 731 day ) old 13 year old . Groups 2 6 receive ATV powder form , Groups 3 7 receive capsule form . Patients Groups 4 8 adolescent 13 year 1 day old 21 year old ( include 22nd birthday ) take ATV capsule form . As 01/02/2008 new group , 5A open enrollment . Participants Group 5A 3 month 6 month old take ATV powder form plus low-dose RTV booster . For group , enrollment start five participant per group . All participant evaluate PK safety criterion , adjust dose ATV one found pass set criterion . Then five additional participant enrol , enrollment continue group participant within group meet PK criterion . For group receive RTV ( Groups 5 8 ) , additional criterion must meet dose ATV study . In addition PK safety evaluation , 24-hour post-dose concentration ( Cmin ) monitor first 10 participant enrol dose ATV participant enrol study dose . Note Protocol Version 5.0 , South African ( S.A. ) sit allow enroll patient study group 3,4,5,6,7,8 . As result , study design modify stratify study group 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ( final recommend dose ) , country , i.e. , U.S.A. versus S.A. , 10 evaluable study subject accrue parallel study group-country cohort . Clinic visit every 4 week Week 48 , every 8 week last participant enroll study reach Week 96 his/her treatment . If , 56 week , participant toxic reaction nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) medication regimen , regimen may change different NRTI . At every visit , participant undergo complete medical history physical exam , cardiac conduction evaluation , urine blood collection . Participants childbearing age pregnancy test perform visit . Step II open South African subject virologically respond treatment last enrollee either part Step I ( Part A Part B ) complete 96 week treatment ( end Step I ) . All participant give ATV capsule form dose receive end Step I , well antiretrovirals receive Step I . Step II continue ATV approve South Africa readily available individual prescription , participant study visit every 12 week . Note follow ATV dos independently evaluate group dose-finding stage base description : Group 1 ATV Powder ( 310mg/m^2 , 620mg/m^2 ) ; Group 2 ATV Powder ( 310mg/m^2 , 620mg/m^2 ) ; Group 3 ATV Capsule ( 310mg/m^2 , 415mg/m^2 , 520mg/m^2 ) ; Group 4 ATV Capsule ( 310mg/m^2 , 520mg/m^2 , 620mg/m^2 ) ; Group 5 ATV Powder + RTV ( 310mg/m^2 ) ; Group 6 ATV Powder +RTV ( 310mg/m^2 ) ; Group 7 ATV Capsule + RTV ( 310mg/m^2 , 205mg/m^2 ) ; Group 8 ATV Capsule + RTV ( 310mg/m^2 , 205mg/m^2 ) ; Group 5A ATV Powder + RTV ( 310mg/m^2 ) . All dose group present Participant Flow group show total number participant enrol , participant enrol final group dos present subsequent result . The follow group satisfy safety PK guideline specify protocol : Groups 3,4,6,7,8 . Groups 5 5A satisfy protocol-defined pharmacokinetic criterion . There considerable inter-subject variability systemic exposure age group , dose escalation 415mg/m^2 may result ATV exposure great 90,000 ng*hr/mL child . Thus , dose increase Groups 5 5A attempt . These final dose group : Groups 1 2 ( Final dose establish ) ; Group 3 ATV Capsule ( 520mg/m^2 ) ; Group 4 ATV Capsule ( 620mg/m^2 ) ; Group 5 ATV Powder ( 310mg/m^2 ) + RTV ; Group 6 ATV Powder ( 310mg/m^2 ) +RTV ; Group 7 ATV Capsule ( 205mg/m^2 ) + RTV ; Group 8 ATV Capsule ( 205mg/m^2 ) + RTV ; Group 5A ATV Powder ( 310mg/m^2 ) + RTV .</detailed_description>
