	<brief_summary>We offer non-pharmacologic therapy alleviation symptom associate depressed mood recurs annually fall winter . The treatment self-administered home patient , close clinical supervision . Our trial use specially design device replenish two different environmental element , naturally occur light negative ion air . Both factor may reduce winter , bring depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trials Three Non-Drug Treatments Winter Depression ( SAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment investigate include bright light therapy upon awaken , two contrast treatment final hour sleep : negative air ionization ( provide two level ) dawn simulation ( also two level ) , switch silent electronic timer microprocessor . We hypothesize reduced outdoor light availability winter , well reduce concentration negative ion air circulation factor contribute depression . By supplement indoor environment either ion light , aim recreate summer-like condition therapeutic . Our past study show three method antidepressant effect patient seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) . Unlike light therapy , negative air ionization imperceptible ( sense ionizer active ) . Applications program accept review throughout year . Screening interviews entry program schedule August February . Patients researcher benefit application receive start individual 's `` problem season , '' leave maximum time explore alternate treatment . Candidates undergo two-hour personal interview Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center ascertain whether meet inclusion criterion . At second two-hour visit provide standard medical examination include blood test , urinalysis EKG , without cost . As alternative , physicals may perform one 's personal physician . Once study underway , five additional one-hour appointment clinical evaluation , flexibly schedule business day , usually 10 day apart . We provide treatment apparatus loan . All treatment schedule morning around time awaken . The bedroom treatment ( negative ion dawn simulation ) end time awaken . The bright light treatment take place half hour wake . Initially , patient randomly assign one treatment group . The treatment must take consistently three week time every day , temporarily suspend determine whether symptom return . Given sufficient time within winter season , patient opportunity try one alternate treatment determine work best . This provide informed , confident basis treatment plan subsequent year . As part protocol , patient provide saliva sample two evening , use test level melatonin , hormone becomes active night . Results reveal whether person 's internal circadian rhythm early , late normal , information use guide time future treatment . This constitute distinct benefit research participant , since diagnostic test yet available medical practice .</detailed_description>
