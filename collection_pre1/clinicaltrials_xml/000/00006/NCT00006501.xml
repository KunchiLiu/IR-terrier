	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether T Wave Alternans predict ventricular arrhythmia sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) prospective epidemiologic natural history study . The prospective epidemiologic pilot study include 550 patient leave ventricular dysfunction history sustain ventricular arrhythmia . The primary hypothesis test whether increase risk arrhythmic event T Wave Alternans present patient . The secondary aim include compare risk due T Wave Alternans ischemic patient non-ischemic patient assess whether T Wave Alternans remain independent predictor risk upon adjustment know risk factor arrhythmic event ejection fraction , ventricular ectopy , NSVT , average NN interval , RR interval variability . The study approach standard epidemiologic surveillance technique . The subject population consist individual Class I III heart failure underwent TWA Holter monitor test follow two year arrhythmic event occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death account approximately 400,000 death year United States remain health problem epidemic proportion . Most sudden cardiac death cause fatal ventricular arrhythmia . An effort aim primary prevention sudden cardiac death require efficient identification patient high enough risk arrhythmia warrant aggressive prophylactic therapy . A number recently complete , randomize clinical trial demonstrate implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) prevent sudden cardiac death highly select group high-risk patient . When trial view together , patient prophylactic implantation ICD proven benefit patient identify documented , spontaneous inducible , sustain ventricular arrhythmia . Two randomized treatment trial ( MADIT II , SCD-HEFT ) test hypothesis implantation ICD would reduce mortality patient congestive heart failure ( CHF ) leave ventricular dysfunction without risk tratification . However , implication two trials-implantation ICD every patient CHF-were unlikely accept either medical community health care payer . More efficient method risk stratification necessary identify patient CHF likely benefit prophylactic treatment ICD . T Wave Alternans subtle every-other-beat variation electrocardiographic T wave prognostic patient high risk life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia sudden cardiac death . It recently show T Wave Alternans ( TWA ) measure exercise strongly associate inducible monomorphic CVT subsequent spontaneous arrhythmic event . This preliminary data suggest TWA may efficient non-invasive surrogate electrophysiologic test screen patient may high-risk sudden cardiac death .</detailed_description>
