	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin Treating Patients With Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response duration objective response patient advance small cell lung cancer treat nitrocamptothecin . - Determine probability objective response express response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease status ( sensitive v refractory ) . Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily 5 consecutive day week 3 week . Treatment continue every 3 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease ( SD ) receive 4 additional course past SD . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) receive minimum 2 additional course past CR PR . Patients follow every 6 week disease progression initiation another antitumor treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-25 patient accrue sensitive disease stratum total 19-24 patient accrue refractory disease stratum</detailed_description>
