	<brief_summary>This study examine whether take vitamin lutein change lutein blood level . Lutein , vitamin C , vitamin E beta-carotene may useful treat eye disease age-related macular degeneration , information need support . Age-related macular degeneration significantly impair ability read , drive , carry daily activity . It common cause vision loss people age 60 . Lutein carotenoid occur naturally retina ( back part eye ) , especially macula-the part retina important fine , detailed vision . Men woman 60 year age old , without age-related macular degeneration , may eligible study . Candidates undergo follow test : 1 . Medical history physical examination . 2 . Eye examination-Includes evaluation visual acuity , measurement eye pressure , examination lens , retina , pupils eye movement , photograph eye . 3 . Visual field study-Examines ability see object periphery . The subject look target screen indicate light appear place screen visible . 4 . Flicker photometry-The subject look flash light turn knob light stop flash . 5 . Blood tests-To measure blood level lutein carotenoid , liver function , cholesterol triglyceride . Participants randomly assign take one three dosage lutein ( 2.5 milligram , 5 milligram 10 milligram ) 6 month examine follow-up visit schedule 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month start lutein . During visit , many exam describe repeated evaluate effect lutein treatment eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate association vary dos oral supplementation lutein result serum level lutein people age 60 may may AMD . Secondary objective investigate relationship level disease lutein absorption ass change macular pigment . Assessment macular pigment routinely perform patient population . Including assessment current study attempt standardize implementation . If result appear warrant study , placebo-controlled study may appropriate . Patients range AMD little drusen either eye end stage AMD ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) eye bad disease . AMD severity classify use Age-Related Eye Disease Study criterion definition advance AMD ( Appendix 2 ) . Development safety profile specific objective study . To point time , available publish data indicate safety concern . However , due lack complete knowledge potential toxicity , safety assessment perform schedule study visit . These safety assessment include : visual acuity , complete ophthalmic examination , fundus photo , liver function test , visual field test , side-effect questionnaire AREDS . Should safety concern arise , adverse event rate compare AREDS , base study population .</detailed_description>
