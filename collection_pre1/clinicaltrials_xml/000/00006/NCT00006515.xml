	<brief_summary>This study examine late effect treatment sarcoma ( bone soft tissue cancer ) child . Survival patient diseases improved year , long-term adverse effect treatment also note . Patients previously treat sarcoma NCI 's Pediatric Oncology Branch first remission sarcoma completion therapy cancer treatment ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , cancer relate surgery immunotherapy ) least 24 month may eligible 3- 4-day study . It review incidence extent follow late effect therapy . - Heart problems-The chemotherapy drug doxorubicin cause acute late injury heart muscle . Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart look change compare finding information obtain standard echocardiogram ( ultrasound test heart ) MUGA ( nuclear medicine scan heart ) . - Gonadal dysfunction-The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may affect sex hormone production , lead infertility , early menopause brittle bone . Low sex hormone level may also increase risk heart attack , obesity fracture . Patients blood test measure hormone level well mineral level , lipid level blood cell count . They also DEXA scan measure bone mineral density CT scan abdomen evaluate distribution fatty tissue abdomen . Males offer semen analysis part fertility evaluation . - Psychosocial problems- Cancer diagnosis treatment pose major life stress lead problem personal relationship , job , insurance , education , health care , personal professional goal setting . Some patient may become depressed develop psychiatric illness . Patients fill questionnaire treatment , recovery , aspects current life meet psychologist psychiatrist . - Changes bodily function capabilities-Patients undergo surgery radiation treat sarcoma treatment may experience muscle , bone joint change . Patients interview performance daily activity , physical limitation , change skill level . They series exercise measurement strength , mobility physical skill , focus part body affect sarcoma subsequent local therapy . - Exposure viruses-A number patient receive blood transfusion part cancer treatment . Some transfusion give HIV screen become available . Patients test virus well hepatitis virus HTLV-1 ( human T-cell leukemia virus-1 ) , also small transfusion-associated risk . - Kidney function-The chemotherapy drug ifosfamide may affect kidney function . Patients provide urine specimen kidney function test . - Immune function-Chemotherapy affect function infection-fighting immune cell call T-lymphocytes . A blood sample drawn study time involve recover full immune function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Late Effects Treatment Sarcomas Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Childhood cancer mark relatively infrequent disease entity annual age adjust rate child age 0-14 year 14 per 100,000 . Over last 30 year striking increase survival due improve diagnosis aggressive treatment approach vastly enhance outlook patient population . 75 % child 15 year age expect survive diagnosis cancer 5 year . However , report improve survival follow increase awareness multitude long-term treatment-related side effect , addition overall death rate 9.6 time higher sex- age-matched general population . Over last 35 year , patient pediatric sarcomas treat Pediatric Oncology Branch ( POB ) National Cancer Institute . Since 1971 adriamycin cyclophosphamide escalate dos incorporate multimodality treatment protocol . Ifosfamide become integral part therapy 1986 . The survival rate patient diseases improved period time . Accordingly exist group long-term survivor therapy employed series POB sarcoma protocol represent valuable source information treatment-associated late-effects , e.g . cardiotoxicity , gonadal dysfunction , growth delay stress-related neuroendocrine abnormality . In addition may evaluable rehabilitative impairment alteration psychosocial behavior may manifest time , prove characteristic population . This protocol systematically enumerate describe incidence extent treatment relate long-term toxicity patient population .</detailed_description>
