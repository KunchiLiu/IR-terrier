	<brief_summary>Women carry BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation first- second-degree relative individual BRCA-associated cancer family document BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation eligible enrollment pilot study breast cancer screen modality . We recruit fifty woman ( twenty-five woman carry altered BRCA1 BRCA2 gene 25 non-carriers match age family mutation type ) regular menstrual cycling ( documented menstrual history premenopausal FSH level ) . A physical exam include exam breast pelvis , standard four view mammogram , breast MRI PET scan schedule initially either follicular mid-luteal phase menstrual cycle . A unilateral cranio-caudal mammogram , bilateral MRI PET scan repeat three month entry phase initially study . A CA125 transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography do follicular phase . Carriers non-carriers compare respect menstrual cycle difference : ( 1 ) two measure mammographic density ( qualitative semiquantitative ) ; ( 2 ) semiquantitative measure fibroglandular volume ( MRI ) ; ( 3 ) semiquantitative measure contrast enhancement ( MRI ) ; ( 4 ) FDG uptake measured time ( PET scan ) . On initial three-month visit , participant undergo breast duct lavage investigate consistent menstrual cycle difference breast ductal cytology . Participants see annually thereafter additional three year follow-up . A physical exam , standard four-view mammography , breast MRI , CA 125 , transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography breast duct lavage do annually . Consent PET study request abnormality detect mammography breast MRI require additional clinical radiographic follow-up . Participants Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study , complete self-administered questionnaire telephone interview complete periodic follow-up questionnaire assess various behavioral psychosocial endpoint . As part Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study , recruit 25 volunteer assist train study investigator perform breast duct lavage . Cytologies obtain volunteer use develop oncogene probe panel use study .</brief_summary>
