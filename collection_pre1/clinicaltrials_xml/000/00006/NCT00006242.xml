	<brief_title>BMS-214662 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) identify dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) investigational agent BMS-214662 escalate 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion every 7 day 3 consecutive week patient solid tumor fail curative survival prolong therapy therapy exist . II . To establish assess safety appropriate dose Phase II study . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics BMS-214662 patient escalate 24-hour continuous IV infusion . IV . To assess extent duration farnesyltransferase inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell relevant surrogate marker pharmacological activity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe preliminary evidence antitumor activity . II . To establish pharmacodynamic relationship pharmacological effect drug upon surrogate marker activity host toxicity . III . To compare toxicity profile 1 hour IV infusion 24 hr continuous IV infusion administration schedule , assume 24 hr infusion schedule feasible . OUTLINE : This dose-prolongation , dose-escalation study . Single patient cohort receive BMS-214662 IV escalate period 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 hour weekly 3 week follow 1 week rest . If patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , dose escalation proceeds single patient cohort . Treatment repeat every 4 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Individual patient cohort may increase duration BMS-214662 infusion subsequent course current duration safely reach . Beginning infusion level DLT first encounter single patient , cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-214662 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience DLT . An additional cohort 10 patient treated MTD . Patients follow least 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 9-12 month .</detailed_description>
