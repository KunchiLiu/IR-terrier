	<brief_summary>This study evaluate healthy normal volunteer patient variety endocrine disorder 1 ) learn condition affect endocrine gland ( gland secrete hormone ) 2 ) train physician endocrinology . Patients endocrine-related condition healthy volunteer age may eligible study . All participant physical examination medical history . They may require provide blood , saliva urine sample undergo ultrasound ( use sound wave ) magnetic resonance ( use magnetic field ) image visualize internal body structure . Some healthy adult volunteer hormone-stimulating test assess endocrine function . These test measure blood hormone level injection synthetic form hormone . A device call heparin lock , hormone inject blood sample collect , place vein arm hand . Blood sample draw hormone inject various interval injection measure level hormone . These test , last 1 3 hour , may include follow : 1 . CRH stimulation test corticotropin-releasing hormone give test pituitary adrenal gland function 2 . ACTH stimulation test adrenocorticotrophic hormone give test adrenal gland function 3 . LHRH stimulation test luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone give test pituitary gland function 4 . TRH stimulation test thyroid-releasing hormone give test pituitary thyroid gland function 5 . GHRH stimulation test growth hormone release hormone give measure growth hormone level . An oral glucose tolerance test , similar stimulation test , may also do measure blood glucose ( sugar ) insulin level drink sugary liquid . Healthy volunteer patient hereditary endocrine disorder family member may also ask provide blood sample genetic study inherit endocrine disorder . Patients endocrine-related disorder may offer medical surgical treatment disorder . AcAccess http : //turners.nichd.nih.gov/ additional study publication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design allow endocrine-related evaluation healthy subject patient variety endocrine disorder . Healthy subject may study obtain normative data endocrine test involve blood , urine , saliva , ultrasound magnetic resonance examination . If eligible specific NICHD research protocol , patient endocrine-related condition may evaluate auspex protocol advance clinical skill physicians participate NICHD clinical research training program , provide stimuli new clinical research initiative . Standard , medically-indicated laboratory radiological study may perform confirm diagnosis aid management patient . In case , patient receive medical surgical treatment disorder , accord current clinical practice . The overall purpose endocrine evaluation protocol support clinical training research mission .</detailed_description>
