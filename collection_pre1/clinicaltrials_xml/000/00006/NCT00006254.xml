	<brief_title>VNP20009 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose minimum effective dose associate toxic effect VNP20009 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine whether VNP20009 detect tumor treatment patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics treatment regimen patient . - Determine antitumor effect treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive VNP20009 IV 4 hour day 1 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease partial complete response ( CR ) may receive additional course every 35 day 12 total dos 2 course past CR . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos VNP20009 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 6-9 patient treat MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-45 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
