	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Low level high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) find associate increased risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . However , genetic basis association well understood clinical implication association extensively address . The study , seek elucidate genetic basis low HDL-C examine clinical implication low HDL-C , focus upon important research topic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Specific aim study include : 1 ) Collection characterization plasma DNA probands low HDL-C. Linkage analysis perform use highly polymorphic marker within near HDL-C candidate gene . The hypothesis test polymorphic microsatellites segregate low HDL-C phenotype . 2 ) Further genetic characterization family evidence linkage specific HDL-C candidate gene identify Specific Aim 1 . The hypothesis test structural variant HDL-C candidate responsible low HDL-C. 3 ) Evaluate physiologic significance novel genomic variant identify Specific Aim 2 . The hypothesis test structural variant affect expression gene product . 4 ) Examine early atherosclerosis low HDL-C syndrome . The hypothesis test increased carotid intima-medial thickness prevalent isolate low HDL-C .</detailed_description>
