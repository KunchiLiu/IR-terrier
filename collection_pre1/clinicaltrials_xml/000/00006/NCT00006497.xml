	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite extensive research many year , noninvasive method detection presence severity coronary artery disease remain imperfect , part due fact different , partially interrelate , facet coronary atherosclerosis may predispose different manifestation ( e.g. , luminal diameter narrow myocardial ischemia wall plaque burden high risk acute thrombosis ) . One noninvasive index degree coronary atherosclerosis , extent coronary artery calcification , become accessible non-invasive evaluation due development fast electron-beam computed tomography ( EBCT ) . Initial study show EBCT coronary calcification relate variety coronary risk factor also predictive variable extent different population incident coronary heart disease event , data available concern evolution EBCT-detected coronary calcification relation coronary risk factor prevalent incident coronary heart disease . The study draw success Los Angeles South Bay Heart Watch ( SBHW ) recruit ethnically-diverse sample individual high risk coronary heart disease event undergone serial evaluation assessment conventional coronary heart disease risk factor evaluation coronary arterial calcification fluoroscopy EBCT sequential evaluation . The study group able maintain contact participant achieve outstanding rate contact follow-up repeat participation sequential component study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study follow 1,000 asymptomatic high-risk survivor South Bay Heart Watch population recruit 1990-1992 ( n = 1,461 ) study EBCT 1992-1993 ( n = 1,309 ) . The primary objective examine effect baseline risk factor measure calcium metabolism change amount coronary calcium asymptomatic high-risk adult cohort . This observational study follow specific aim , follow : 1 ) relate demographic factor traditional risk factor progression coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) score time ; 2 ) relate serum marker calcium metabolism change CAC score ; 3 ) relate baseline CAC score change CAC score leave ventricular dysfunction intervene coronary event . The SBHW cohort NHLBI reading center well Dr. Azen 's data coordinate center use examine whether baseline risk factor , ethnic group index calcium metabolism associate change coronary calcium quantity four five year . EBCT scan perform 1,000 survive member cohort repeat measurement leave ventricular hypertrophy , plasma lipid , blood pressure , homocysteine , fibrinogen , para-thyroid hormone vitamin D level . The independent relationship risk factor examine 1994 baseline evaluation change coronary calcium score determine EBCT . Logistic regression , dependent normality independent variable , use examine relation annualized change coronary calcium incidence event . The study continue August , 2008 .</detailed_description>
