	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity EMD 121974 patient HIV relate Kaposi 's sarcoma . II . Determine antiangiogenic activity drug patient . III . Determine antitumor activity drug patient . IV . Determine effect drug CD4 CD8 cell count percentage , HIV viral load patient . V. Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive EMD 121974 IV twice week four week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos EMD 121974 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow least 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-30 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
