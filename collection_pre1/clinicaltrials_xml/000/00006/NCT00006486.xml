	<brief_title>Carboxyamidotriazole Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity disease-stabilizing effect carboxyamidotriazole patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . II . Determine objective response rate patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord time diagnosis metastatic disease study entry ( few 24 month vs 24 month ) . Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole ( CAI ) daily 4 week . Treatment repeat 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 4 course , patient experience complete partial response continue treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral CAI . Arm II : Patients receive placebo . Treatment repeat every 4 week least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression unblinded placebo begin oral CAI . Patients follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 335 patient accrue study within 15-25 month .</detailed_description>
