	<brief_summary>The purpose study see PEG-Intron safe tolerate give child , see much get blood long stay blood , see well work reduce viral load ( level HIV blood ) . PEG-Intron experimental drug work differently anti-HIV medication . It decrease ability HIV infect T cell ( special type cell help fight infection ) . PEG-Intron approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat hepatitis C adult , study , use investigational agent treatment HIV/AIDS . It test child experience PEG-Intron adult limit . ( This protocol change reflect FDA approval PEG-Intron treating hepatitic C adult . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current optimal clinical management HIV infection involve therapy combination nucleoside nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor HIV protease inhibitor . These regimen , though effective , completely eliminate HIV development drug resistance major clinical problem . Interferons propose possible treatment HIV . Interferon-alfa inhibits HIV replication vitro , HIV-infected patient appear reduce production interferon . Previous short-term clinical study adults show anti-HIV activity , although safety tolerability problem associate high dose regimen use . This study utilize rise multiple-dose design ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics single multiple dos PEG-Intron HIV-infected child . In dose-escalation study , patient add weekly PEG-Intron antiretroviral therapy 6 week . The first 2 dos receive clinic parents/guardians train administer injection , succeed dos give home . Patients enrol 2 cohort . An old cohort age 2 16 year receive PEG-Intron low drug level . If dose tolerate , patient add safety criterion meet , patient enrol next high dose level . The dose level increase similarly 4 dos . An optimal dose level chosen . Cohort II patient young group range 3 month 2 year age . Patients initially receive next low PEG-Intron dose optimal dose identify Cohort I [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/23/01 : 1 microg/kg optimal dose prof 1 microg/kg ] . If dose safely tolerate , additional patient add . If dose level meet safety criterion , patient enrol receive optimal dose level . Patients evaluate safety criterion Cohort I . Patients cohorts least 0.5 log reduction HIV RNA 28 day treatment offer continued treatment total 60 week .</detailed_description>
