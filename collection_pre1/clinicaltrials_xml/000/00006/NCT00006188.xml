	<detailed_description>This `` Evaluation Treatment Protocol '' allow uveitis specialist ocular immunologist NEI identify , follow provide `` standard care '' treatment patient uveitis intraocular inflammatory disorder . A primary purpose protocol accumulate cohort patient uveitis intraocular inflammatory disease possible participation new NEI clinical trial epidemiological protocol . Also , provide long-term follow-up treatment variety uveitic intraocular inflammatory disorder , uveitis specialist ocular immunologist NEI well able identify research hypotheses diseases addition maintain clinical skill . The availability cohorts patient spectrum uveitic disorder valuable training fellow intraocular inflammatory disease , important mission NEI . The ability provide long-term follow-up care also facilitate referral effort new NEI protocol . The uveitis specialist National Eye Institute free choose ocular inflammatory condition interest . However , total number patient enrol protocol restrict . This protocol design test new treatment . Any evaluation treatment protocol base current standard care uveitic syndrome .
