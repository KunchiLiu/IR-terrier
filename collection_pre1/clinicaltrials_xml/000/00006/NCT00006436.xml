	<brief_summary>Background : - HIV-infected patient weaken immune system , chemotherapy , use treat lymphoma , probably cause damage immune system . - Limiting amount immune damage due chemotherapy might decrease number infection risk develop cancer future HIV-infected patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Objectives : - To determine whether reduce total amount chemotherapy use specific combination drug call EPOCH-R ( etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , cyclophosphamide rituximab ) rid body lymphoma quickly decrease risk infection future cancer . - To determine whether lymphoma remain undetectable least one year treatment stop one cycle patient enters remission . Eligibility : -Patients non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma HIV infection 4 year age older treat previously rituximab cytotoxic chemotherapy . Design : - Patients receive EPOCH-R 3-week treatment cycle least three six cycle . - The lymphoma evaluate use CT PET scan end treatment cycle 2 3 . A bone marrow biopsy repeat cycle 2 biopsy initially positive screen participation study . - Anti-HIV therapy stop chemotherapy begin restart EPOCH-R treatment end . - Patients monitor treatment response blood test image scan baseline , treatment end , 2 month treatment end every 3 6 month total 24 month follow chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : This study investigate preliminary fashion feasibility short course chemotherapy patient HIV-associated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HIV-NHL ) . This study investigate paradigm treatment successfully change standard 6 cycle one cycle beyond complete remission 6 total allowable cycle . Objective : To assess 90 percent probability least 50 percent patient treat short-course EPOCH-R progression free one year . Eligibility : Aggressive CD20 positive DLBCL . HIV+ serology . All stage ( I-IV ) disease . ECOG Performance status 0-4 . NHL previously untreated cytotoxic chemotherapy . Age great equal 18 year . May pregnant nursing . May receive previous rituximab . Design : Patients treat every three week combination EPOCH rituximab one cycle beyond CR/CRu CT scan detectable tumor minimum three maximum six cycle . Following cycle 2 , CT , positron emission tomography scan ( PET ) , bone marrow biopsy ( initially positive ) perform . At conclusion study , estimate whether number cycle reduce use paradigm . If cumulative number patient relapse exceed 25 percent 6 month , study close . Following completion chemotherapy , restaging perform 2 month follow end treatment , every 3 month one year , every 6 month one year , every 12 month relapse , death , loss follow . Anti-HIV therapy suspend prior initiation chemotherapy optimum therapy reinitiated cycle administer . To study effect treatment approach parameter HIV disease , measurement CD4 cell viral load make baseline completion therapy , 2 month follow end treatment , every 3-6 month total 24 month follow chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
