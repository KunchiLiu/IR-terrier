	<brief_summary>Dilution blood cause cardiopulmonary bypass ( heart-lung machine ) open heart surgery associate decreased concentration blood coagulation factor . This extreme infant small blood volume lead impairment normal blood clot mechanism excessive bleeding operation . Transfusion fresh whole blood show effective treatment fresh blood rich coagulation factor . However , difficult obtain truly fresh blood blood bank . We hypothesize fresh blood drawn patient give back cardiopulmonary bypass would improve clot mechanism . In study , infant treatment group fresh blood remove anesthetized operation place cardiopulmonary bypass . This blood give back completion cardiopulmonary bypass . Infants control group blood remove undergo cardiopulmonary bypass . We compare two group draw blood sample measure coagulation test .</brief_summary>
