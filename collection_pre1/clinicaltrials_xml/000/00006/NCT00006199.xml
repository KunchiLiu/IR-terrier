	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial establish safe dos combination farnesyl transferase inhibitor , R115777 plus topotecan patient advance solid tumor , previously treat beyond standard therapy clinical benefit . Maximum tolerate dose , dose limit toxicity activity combination assess . This chemotherapy regimen two-pronged attack way cancer cell replicate . R115777 compound may inhibit cancer cell growth interfere p21 ra oncogene , topotecan , topoisomerase-1 inhibitor , work cancer cell subject control ra oncogene . Animal study suggest combination may synergistic . Another advantage R115777 take mouth .</brief_summary>
