	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) deadly tumor incidence increase United States , primarily due prevalence hepatitis C infection . An important aspect development HCC occur patient underlie cirrhosis liver , thereby limit therapeutic option . There potential curative treatment patient , resection tumor lesion liver transplantation , treatment feasible small percent patient . Furthermore , majority patient HCC also candidate palliative treatment percutaneous ablation tumor , chemotherapy radiation . Additionally , show palliative treatment modality alter survival , associate significant risk . Therefore , treatment option patient HCC . A new theory emerge fight cancer inhibition angiogenesis ( development new blood vessel ) . The hypothesis blood supply `` feeding '' tumor cell divide survive . One approach , pioneered institution Drs . George Brewer Sofia Merajver , anticopper approach use medication tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) . By create mild copper deficiency state , several pathway require angiogenesis inhibit . They perform Phase I trial patient metastatic cancer treat TM result decrease tumor vascularity . TM excellent safety profile patient population . HCC well known hypervascular tumor . An antiangiogenesis approach might provide novel treatment HCC . This pilot study 10 patient HCC candidate curative surgical therapy resection liver transplantation , ablative technique . Patients see General Liver clinic Liver Transplant clinic overall good performance status , expect survival 6 month enrol . After initial evaluation , give 120 mg/day TM divide dos one year . The size vascularity tumor evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The primary outcome study prevent tumor progression .</brief_summary>
