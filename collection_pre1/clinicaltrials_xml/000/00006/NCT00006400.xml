	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Prevent Organ Damage Children With Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1995 , Multicenter Study Hydroxyurea ( MSH ) demonstrate hydroxyurea effective decreasing frequency painful crisis , hospitalization crisis , acute chest syndrome , blood transfusion 50 % . The recently complete phase II study hydroxyurea child ( PED HUG ) demonstrate child response hydroxyurea similar see adult term increase fetal hemoglobin level total hemoglobin , decrease complication associate sickle cell anemia . In addition , study demonstrate drug adversely affect growth development age 5 15 . A recently complete pilot study hydroxyurea give child age 6 month 24 month demonstrate drug tolerate well small infant , fetal hemoglobin switch force remain `` position '' hydroxyurea administration . A Special Emphasis Panel ( SEP ) meet April 12 , 1996 review result MSH trial progress date PED HUG study . The SEP recommend NHLBI undertake BABY HUG trial . DESIGN NARRATIVE : BABY HUG randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study determine hydroxyurea prevent onset chronic end organ damage young child sickle cell anemia . Approximately 200 child sickle cell disease recruit receive either hydroxyurea placebo . The child screen study entry sign abnormal brain , kidney , pulmonary , splenic function , developmental milestone . They randomly assign receive either hydroxyurea placebo follow yearly assess chronic end organ damage major organ system . The primary endpoint 50 % reduction rate damage major organ surrogate marker organ function follow-up Phase II trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Majority fetal sickle ( FS SF ) hemoglobin pattern confirm centrally electrophoresis ( screen may begin 7 month age ) Chronic transfusion therapy Cancer Less 5th percentile ( 10th percentile pilot study ) height , weight , head circumference age Severe developmental delay ( e.g. , cerebral palsy mental retardation , Grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage ) Stroke neurological deficit Surgical splenectomy Participating clinical intervention trial Probable know diagnosis Hemoglobin SHereditary Persistence Fetal Hemoglobin Known hemoglobin Sbeta plus thalassemia ( hemoglobin A present ) Any condition chronic illness , opinion principal investigator , make participation unadvised unsafe Inability unwillingness complete baseline ( preenrollment ) study , include blood urine specimen collection , liverspleen scan , abdominal sonogram , neurological examination , neuropsychological testing , transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( interpretable study require , confirm velocity great 200 cm/sec result ineligibility ) Previous current treatment hydroxyurea ( HU ) another antisickling drug The following exclusion criterion transient ; patient reevaluate eligibility : 1 . Hemoglobin le 6.0 gm/dL 2 . Reticulocyte count le 80,000/cu mm hemoglobin le 9 gm/dL 3 . Neutrophil count le 2,000/cu mm 4 . Platelet count le 130,000/cu mm 5 . Blood transfusion 2 month prior study entry unless HbA le 10 % 6 . ALT great twice upper limit normal 7 . Ferritin le 10 ng/ml 8 . Serum creatinine great twice upper limit normal age 9 . Bayley standardize mental score 70</criteria>
