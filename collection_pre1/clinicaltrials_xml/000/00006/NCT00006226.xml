	<brief_title>Thalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether thalidomide induce objective response relapse B-CLL patient . II . To determine toxicity thalidomide patient population . III . To document alteration vascular growth factor and/or bone marrow angiogenesis pattern correlate thalidomide related clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
