	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness combine topotecan paclitaxel combine etoposide cisplatin treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat topotecan paclitaxel versus etoposide cisplatin . II . Compare time response , response duration , time progression , survival patient treat regimen . III . Determine toxicity profile regimens patient . IV . Compare effect regimens symptom disease patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) , elevate LDH ( absent v present ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 6 continue blood count recover . Arm II : Patients receive cisplatin IV 3 hour day 1 etoposide IV 30 minute day 1-3 . Treatment continue every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient ( 75 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
