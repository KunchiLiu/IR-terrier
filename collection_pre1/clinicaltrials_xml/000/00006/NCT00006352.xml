	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . BCG may activate immune system kill tumor cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy BCG may kill tumor cell . It yet know monoclonal antibody therapy plus BCG effective treatment limited-stage small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial determine effectiveness monoclonal antibody therapy plus BCG treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine impact vaccination adjuvant BCG monoclonal antibody BEC2 survival patient limited stage small cell lung cancer . - Determine progression free survival patient receive treatment regimen . - Determine safety treatment regimen patient . - Assess quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , Karnofsky performance status ( 60-70 % vs 80-100 % ) , response first line combine modality treatment ( complete remission v partial remission ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive vaccination BCG monoclonal antibody BEC2 intradermally day 1 week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive therapy . Quality life assess baseline ; week 6 , 12 , 24 ; every 6 month thereafter disease progression . Patients follow 6 month , every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 570 patient ( 285 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
