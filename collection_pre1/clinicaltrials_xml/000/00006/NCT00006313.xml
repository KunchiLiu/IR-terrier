	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease lead cause death among postmenopausal woman . Growing evidence exist hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) may reduce cardiovascular disease mortality . This lead use postmenopausal HRT primary prevention heart disease , however remain unresolved woman likely benefit clinical approach . This complicated question many potential mechanism involve hormone therapy ( HRT ) may confer cardioprotection . The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestins Intervention ( PEPI ) trial examine relative impact four regimens hormone therapy range cardiovascular disease risk factor ( e.g . lipid , blood pressure , insulin/glucose , hemostasis factor ) . The trial well conduct ; data thoroughly edit yielded series important publication . To date , however , publication focus average effect without thorough exploration range , interplay among , various effect across 875 enrolled trial . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study extend analysis PEPI data : 1 ) characterize distribution responses hormone therapy respect risk factor cardiovascular disease ( lipids/lipoproteins , blood pressure , insulin/glucose , hemostasis factor ) ; 2 ) examine multivariate pattern treatment effect among cardiovascular risk factor outcomes ( symptomatology , bone , endometrial ) ; 3 ) examine clinical demographic factor may affect relationship , , characterize woman may vary respect `` sensitivity '' separate effect estrogen progestin therapy ; 4 ) examine closely patterns adherence relationship response . An experienced team statisticians/epidemiologists conduct planned publish result analysis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
