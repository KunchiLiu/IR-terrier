	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand relationship age HIV disease progression . This study explore possible relationship age HIV disease progression . Older age important risk factor faster disease development , old people may respond good combination drug therapy . This relationship need understood well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study HIV-Disease Development Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older age important risk factor accelerate HIV-disease progression . However , virologic response highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) may superior old person . A good understanding immunologic , virologic , behavioral mechanism underlie age-related difference may help elucidate critical immune response necessary control progression HIV-disease . Patients group accord age . Group A consist patient age 13 30 year . Group B consist patient age 45 year old . All patient receive open-label lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) plus emtricitabine ( FTC ) plus stavudine ( d4T ) 96 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/04/02 : 192 ] week . Study visit occur pre-entry , entry , Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 every 12 week thereafter Week 96 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/04/02 : Week 192 ] . Clinical assessment , safety laboratory test , CD4 cell count monitoring , lymphocyte phenotyping , HIV-1 RNA determination perform routinely . Blood sample store immunology virology study . Patients may volunteer participate virology substudy A5020s either immunology substudy A5016s A5017s [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/04/02 : Substudy A5017s eliminate . ]</detailed_description>
