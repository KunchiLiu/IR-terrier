	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time recurrence treatment celecoxib v placebo patient superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder high risk recurrence . II . Correlate modulation one biomarkers recurrence bladder cancer confirm value marker ( ) surrogate endpoint biomarker bladder cancer celecoxib . III . Determine toxicity celecoxib patient . IV . Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center presence Tis disease ( yes v ) . Patients randomize one two arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily . Treatment continue arm 1-2 year absence unacceptable toxicity , development recurrent invasive bladder carcinoma , development second malignancy require radiotherapy systemic therapy . Quality life assess baseline week 54 . Patients follow 6 week every 12 week last randomized patient study 1 year disease recurrence .</detailed_description>
