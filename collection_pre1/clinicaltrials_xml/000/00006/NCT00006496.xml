	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) remain major cause morbidity mortality around world . In United States alone 150,000 case per year . Although significant scientific advance understand clinical pathophysical aspect syndrome , yet specific therapy ARDS . Moreover , although major risk factor development ARDS include sepsis , aspiration , multiple trauma , minority patient risk factor develop ARDS . Individual differences susceptibility chronic disease subject active molecular epidemiologic investigation past decade . In particular , risk factor cancer confer heritable polymorphism various metabolic function report . More recently , polymorphism endothelial nitrate oxide synthase associate increased susceptibility coronary-artery disease , polymorphisms GSTM1 associate increase risk develop asbestosis . A recent study tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) polymorphisms associate poor outcome ARDS . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The case-control study examine association specific polymorphisms several gene cod specific inflammatory response surfactant protein potential association increase susceptibility ARDS . The first objective ass role candidate-gene polymorphism risk factor ARDS case-control study . The second objective ass relationship genotype phenotype candidate marker case control . The third objective ass role polymorphisms clinical outcome ( survival , recovery ) use patient propose case-control study multicenter case series clinical trial sponsor NHLBI ARDS network . By combine large case-control study case series network , study advantage sufficient case ascertainment , statistical power , diagnostic standardization , uniform outcome criterion study efficiency . Overall , result study provide new insight epidemiology ARDS allow possible preventive strategy well possible modification therapeutic intervention Network Phase III trial . The investigator test hypothesis increase risk ARDS patient heritable trait relate inflammatory cytokine surfactant . They examine risk prognosis , examine case control genetics relation cytokine level . They also plan case-series analysis separate study ARDS network . They examine TNF alpha beta , interleukin-1 receptor antagonist , surfactant protein B interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : All risk factor ARDS eg , pneumonia , trauma , sepsis . Vulnerable population ( incarcerate , pregnant , etc . ) exclude enrollment . The following medical condition also exclude study : 1. immunocompromised patient 2. patient chronic lung disease may appear like ARDS 3. pulmonary vasculitis patient 4. patient diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 5. patient treat immunemodulating agent within 3 week admission 6. patient unable intubate DNI order patient place comfort measure</criteria>
