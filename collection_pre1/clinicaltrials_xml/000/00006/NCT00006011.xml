	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness two combination chemotherapy regimens plus radiation therapy treat patient stage III stage IV endometrial cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen plus radiation therapy effective endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens Plus Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare survival progression-free survival patient stage III endometrial carcinoma treat tumor volume-directed pelvic radiotherapy without paraaortic radiotherapy follow cisplatin doxorubicin without paclitaxel . II . Compare short long-term toxic effect treatment regimens patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord radiotherapy field ( pelvic v extend field ) . Within 8 week surgery , patient receive tumor volume-directed pelvic radiotherapy without paraaortic nodal radiotherapy daily 5 consecutive day 16 week surgery . Within 8 week complete radiotherapy , patient randomize 1 2 chemotherapy treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive doxorubicin IV 30 minute immediately follow cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) pegfilgrastim day 2-11 . Arm II : Patients receive doxorubicin cisplatin arm I , paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 2 , G-CSF SC pegfilgrastim day 3-12 . Treatment repeat every 3 week maximum 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 614 patient ( 307 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 5.2 year .</detailed_description>
