	<brief_summary>The purpose study see begin change anti-HIV medication affect body composition ( weight , height , growth , body fat , muscle mass , fat muscle distribution ) HIV-infected child . This study also look change body composition relate change viral load ( level HIV blood ) , CD4 cell count , height , weight HIV-infected child . This study also compare change body composition level cytokine ( protein body affect immune cell ) HIV-infected child begin change anti-HIV therapy . Though study do adult , little known effect HIV infection anti-HIV drug body composition child . One theory change body composition predict failure anti-HIV treatment . If true , body composition measurement useful CD4+ cell count determine drug effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Anti-HIV Treatment Body Characteristics HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite accumulate data adult , little information available regard effect HIV infection antiretroviral therapy body composition child . Preliminary information indicate lean body mass lose preference fat mass HIV-infected child , support theory failure thrive HIV infection often cytokine mediate . It hypothesize change body composition ( lean body mass ) may predict change weight growth velocity may give early clinical indication treatment failure . If , body composition measurement may yield additional outcome measure clinical trial , equivalent utility laboratory measure treatment response , e.g. , persistent CD4+ cell count change . Additionally , body composition change highly correlated response viral load , body composition may prove affordable measure antiretroviral effectiveness develop country . This study nonrandomized , observational study . Children recruit 4 age stratum : Stratum A : 1 month 18 month . Stratum B : great 18 month 3 year . Stratum C : great 3 year 8 year . Stratum D : great 8 year less 13 year . Children begin change antiretroviral therapy fulfilling study specification may enrol study . Children 5 outpatient clinic visit , entry 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 week , anthropometry , body composition bioelectrical impedance analysis , cytokine level , viral load , CD4+ cell count , marker lipid glucose metabolism .</detailed_description>
