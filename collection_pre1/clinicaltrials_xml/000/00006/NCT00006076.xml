	<brief_summary>This study examine hereditary basis tone deafness identify region human genome link condition . Both exceptionally good pitch recognition ( perfect pitch ) exceptionally poor pitch recognition ( tone deafness ) run family . A good understanding cause tone deafness may provide new insight auditory ( hear ) function . Individuals two family member 15 year age old tone deaf trouble recognize different melody may eligible study . Candidates screen short listen test pitch short write test . Those identified poor pitch recognition fill brief questionnaire family tree family member ( without identify name ) trouble recognize melody tone . Individuals poor pitch recognition ask help contact family member may interested participate . Members family two first-degree relative ( parent , grandparent , sibling ) tone deaf may enroll study . They provide blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) genetic study may take 20-minute hearing test use headphone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal study identify region genome show genetic linkage deficit pitch recognition . Pitch recognition subject test identify individual family poor pitch recognition , know tune deafness , define inability recognize wrong note popular melody . We undertake 2-stage process , first screen identify probands , secondly full family ascertainment enrollment . Probands family member give auditory verbal attention test , addition listen test measure aspects center auditory process attention . Family phenotypic data use additional epidemiological study tune deafness . Affected unaffected member family contain multiple tune deaf individual 20 cc blood drawn obtain DNA . These DNA sample genotyped use marker distribute across human genome , genotypic information analyze determine marker show linkage tune deafness . Genetic linkage initial step process positional cloning , clone defective gene underlie tune deafness long term goal research .</detailed_description>
