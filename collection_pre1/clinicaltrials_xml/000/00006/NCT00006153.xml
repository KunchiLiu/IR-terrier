Therapeutic approach Remune , augment cell-mediated immunologic response , may prove beneficial control progression HIV infection , especially use combination antiretroviral therapy early infection . Current antiviral drug work inhibit infection new cell yet seem suppress early cell-mediated immune response . The question raise whether immune-based therapy Remune may counteract suppressive effect antiretrovirals slow progression infection . Patients receive fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy randomize add either Remune Incomplete Freund 's Adjuvant ( IFA ) control . Vaccinations administer Day 1 , Week 12 , Week 24 . Blood sample collect Day 1 Weeks 4 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 28 . Clinical assessment include lymphocyte proliferative response , cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) memory cell activity , chemokine cytokine measurement , CD4 count , viral load . Delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) skin test perform Day 1 Week 28 . HIV-1 specific immunogenicity coordinate response antiretroviral therapy patient .</detailed_description>
