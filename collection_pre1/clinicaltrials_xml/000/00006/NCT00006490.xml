	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 different type test HIV virus see specific anti-HIV drug would work best . Drug resistance major reason therapy failure HIV patient . Two type test detect resistance drug : 1 ) genotyping ( sequence ) , look DNA sequence virus see whether develop genetic resistance ; 2 ) phenotyping , look ability different drug suppress virus growth laboratory . Genotyping phenotyping help doctor give patient effective drug therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Tests Anti-HIV Drug Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence drug resistance major factor contribute failure antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected patient . Drug resistance detect genotypic phenotypic assay , distinct advantage disadvantage . Results genotypic phenotypic test helpful exclude subsequent regimen drug resistance identify , test predict virologic response salvage therapy patient fail previous regimen . Resistance test likely beneficial aid selecting salvage regimen . At entry , patient randomize Arm A ( sequence ) Arm B ( phenotyping ) resistance test drawn still receive current regimen even though regimen failure suspect . The test result available Weeks 1 4 , inclusive . There weekly visit first 4 week entry monitor viral load maintenance current failing ( prestudy ) regimen . If virologic failure confirm , new regimen choose prescribe first visit resistance test result available . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/6/00 : If resistance assay fails yield result , another regimen choose prescribed base patient 's medical medication history . ] If virologic failure confirm , current drug regimen change . Otherwise , on-site study visit occur every 4 week Week 24 every 8 week thereafter Week 48 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/6/00 : on-site study visit occur every 4 week Week 24 every 8 week thereafter ] . Medical resource use assess baseline every 8 week Week 48 . Quality life assess baseline every 16 week Week 48 .</detailed_description>
