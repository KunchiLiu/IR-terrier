	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obese child engage vigorous exercise program show beneficial effect total body percent fat ( percent BF ) visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) ; however , little known prevent accretion total body visceral adiposity high risk youth , African-American ( AA ) females.The project important health implication two reason , follow . There dearth information concern effect exercise intervention school community setting . If study show afternoon exercise program reduces accretion general visceral adiposity favorable impact fitness health population high risk obesity , school may encourage implement similar intervention prevent juvenile obesity associate health problem . The study award response Program Announcement Physical Activity Cardiopulmonary Health release October 1994 jointly NHLBI , National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases , National Institute Nursing Research . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design involve randomization 200 African American girl , eight 10 year age intervention control group . After one year , group compare test primary hypothesis one year afternoon exercise program reduce accretion general visceral adiposity girl . Then girls switch group assignment next year . The pattern data three time point show happen two year period youth , , involved exercise program . The measurement include : ( 1 ) percent body fat dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ; ( 2 ) visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) magnetic resonance imaging ; ( 3 ) cardiovascular fitness multi-stage treadmill test ; ( 4 ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor ( i.e. , ratio total high density lipoprotein cholesterol , insulin , systolic blood pressure , fibrinogen ) ; ( 5 ) free-living exercise diet ; ( 6 ) psychosocial variable ( i.e. , self-efficacy self-concept ) ; ( 7 ) sexual maturation ; ( 8 ) anthropometric measure . The exercise program implement neighborhood school 90 minute weekday afternoon . Transportation provide need . Sessions include motor skill instruction aerobic exercise .</detailed_description>
