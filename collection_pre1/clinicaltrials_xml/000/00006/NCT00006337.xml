	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect experimental drug call KW-6002 Parkinson 's disease symptom dyskinesias ( involuntary movement ) develop result long-term treatment levodopa . This drug block action neurotransmitter adenosine , think involve produce Parkinson 's symptom . Patients relatively advanced ( Stage II IV ) Parkinson 's disease 30 80 year age may eligible 7-week study . Participants complete medical history physical examination , include blood test electrocardiogram , possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , CT scan , chest X-ray . Patients enrol study , possible , stop take antiparkinsonian medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) one month study begin throughout duration . For first 1 3 day , patient admit NIH Clinical center undergo levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For study , patient stop take Sinemet instead levodopa infused vein 8 hours/day . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly either 1 ) parkinsonian symptom improve , 2 ) unacceptable side effect occur , 3 ) maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently find two infusion rate : 1 ) one less need relieve symptom , 2 ) one relieve symptom may produce dyskinesia . This procedure repeat end week 2 , 4 6 study . When patient 's optimal dose determine treatment begin . Patients take tablet capsule contain KW-6002 placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) day 2 week , addition regular Sinemet . All participant receive placebo least 2 week study ; patient receive placebo throughout entire 7 week . At end week 1 , 3 5 , patient evaluate brief physical examination , routine blood urine test , assessment adverse effect . Throughout study , parkinsonian symptom dyskinesias evaluate blood sample draw periodically measure drug level .</brief_summary>
