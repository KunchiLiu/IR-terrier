Patients stay clinic observation least 1 hour go home return clinic follow-up examination test one week infusion . However , week 0 8 visit last approximately 8 hour require return clinic follow morning . Blood collection perform week 0 8 visit determine fast Micellar Paclitaxel eliminate body . Approximately 2 teaspoon blood take prior infusion , twice infusion , eight time 22 hour follow infusion total eleven sample . These return visit last approximately 1-2 hour . Patients follow procedure : 1 . A skin biopsy ( removal small tissue sample microscopic examination ) do first visit ( week 0 ) week 6 , 14 22 . The area biopsy numb anesthetic , small circle skin width pencil eraser half deep cut lift away . Stitches place remove 1 2 week later . 2 . A history physical examination do every visit . Patients interview change skin condition treatment side effect examine nurse physician . 3 . Blood urine sample collect frequent interval ( nearly every visit ) test side effect . 4 . Photographs skin take first visit several later visit document change psoriasis . 5 . A blood sample drawn genetic test look gene change people psoriasis . 6 . An electrocardiogram take last visit . This do week 24 compare screening EKG . 7 . Gonadal toxicity monitoring start patient enter protocol May 2001 . Blood drawn measure Inhibit A females Inhibit B males week 0 , 6 , 14 , 22 .</brief_summary>
