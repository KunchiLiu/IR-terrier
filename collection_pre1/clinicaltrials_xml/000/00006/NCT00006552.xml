	<brief_title>Adherence Antihypertensive Therapy -- Data Analyses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High blood pressure continue highly prevalent condition affect 20 percent U.S. population . Untreated , may lead coronary heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , complication . Medication major mean control hypertension avert debilitate consequence . Treatment drug , however , undermined suboptimal adherence therapy . Forgetting take medication commonly elicit reason lapse medication use ; side effect , health belief , lack knowledge disease treatment instruction , financial barrier may also interfere . Determining factor ( 1 ) predictably associate fluctuation adherence ( day week , holiday , medication appointment ) ; ( 2 ) ameliorate impact nonadherence , pharmacologic property drug protect patient adherence lapse ; ( 3 ) correlate accuracy adherence reporting patient assist anticipate address adherence obstacle serve objective study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use data collect electronic adherence monitor , questionnaire , computerize medical record contain blood pressure reading prior investigation antihypertensive adherence . This early investigation , conduct 1994 1997 , involve 286 member Harvard Pilgrim Health Care single drug therapy mild moderate hypertension . Objective 1 evaluated impact temporal factor weekend versus weekday , holiday , season , impend medical appointment adherence analyze effect daily rate dose record electronic medication monitor . Time trend model use purpose . Objective 2 assessed impact pharmacologic duration action level antihypertensive adherence require maintain goal blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg . This involved determine relationship adherence blood pressure modify duration drug effect . Objective 3 concern correlate accuracy report adherence approach verify report adherence electronically measure adherence . Predictors correlate accurately report adherence patient age , gender , race/ethnicity , education , socioeconomic status , health belief , measure health status identify cross tabulate statistical model accurate reporting factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
