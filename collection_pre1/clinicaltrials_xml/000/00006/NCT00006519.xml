	<brief_summary>This study test safety , side effect anti-HIV activity different dos capravirine child adolescent HIV infection . Capravirine belong class drug call non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , prevent virus replicating ( make copy ) . Other NNRTIs nevirapine , delavirdine efavirenz . HIV-infected child age 4 month 21 year may eligible study : 1 ) receive less 6 week treatment antiretroviral drug ; 2 ) benefit antiretroviral therapy 12 week treatment ; 3 ) continue antiretroviral treatment harmful side effect . For first week study , participant 1-week `` washout period '' receive anti-HIV therapy . During time , physical , eye neuropsychologic examination , blood urine test , echocardiogram , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest X-ray , head CT scan skin test . These physical exam test repeat throughout study determine change health . After washout period , patient take capravirine day morning 6 day . After dose , small amount blood drawn 8 different time 12 hour measure activity drug HIV blood level . A heparin lock place vein avoid multiple needlesticks . After 6 day capravirine another washout period , time 21 day . During time , doctor determine optimum combination therapy individual patient . After second washout , patient begin combination therapy capravirine plus least two anti-HIV medicine . ( These may include reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine , didanosine , lamuvidine , zalcitabine , stavudine , maybe one protease inhibitor ritonavir , nelfinavir , saquinavir , indinavir amprenavir . ) For first week , patient daily blood test determine HIV blood level . Afterwards , treatment continue outpatient basis clinic visit every 4 8 week physical exam , lab test procedure require . The study last approximately 48 week . Patients benefit capravirine therapy may able continue receive drug drug company sponsor part another study , protocol study may amend lengthen treatment period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pediatric phase I dose escalation study determine biologically active dose obtain information concern safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics capravirine ( AG 1549 ) ( 5- [ ( 3,5-dichlorophenyl ) thio ] -4- ( 1-methylethyl ) -1- ( 4-pyridinylmethyl ) -1H-imidazol-2-methanol carbamate ) , potent non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) inhibitor , induces novel pattern resistance mutation . In addition obtain needed biological activity , pediatric safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic data , study utilize capravirine 's potent antiretroviral activity novel resistance mutation pattern , together serial measurement plasma HIV viral load , flow cytometry , genotypic phenotypic viral resistance analysis conduct pilot study pediatric HIV pathogenesis , response antiretroviral therapy , develop strategy optimize management pediatric antiretroviral therapy . We also use initial viral decay dynamic patient characteristic model prediction long-term response antiretroviral therapy . We enroll child become refractory experienced toxicity prior therapy . The study include resistance test fail regimen , one week period antiretrovirals ( washout period ) , initial 6 day capravirine monotherapy follow capravirine combination optimal antiretroviral therapy determine baseline viral resistance mutation pattern history . The patient follow least 48 week assess long-term tolerability toxicity , assess clinical , virological , immunological response capravirine .</detailed_description>
