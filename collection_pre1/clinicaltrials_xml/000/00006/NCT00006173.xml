	<brief_summary>Renovascular hypertension ( RVH ) potentially curable disease affect 0.5-5 percent patient hypertension . The current diagnostic work-up RVH involve complex algorithm include doppler ultrasound , captopril renography conventional angiography . Because expense , risk inconvenience workup , patient may correctly diagnose . Advances MR technology present opportunity develop single comprehensive test . This would combine MR angiogram provide anatomic information renal artery , MR renogram provide information functional impact stenosis cause hypertension . Our main purpose test MR renography without oral angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) combine MR angiography reference standard captopril radionuclide renography . Secondary goal study test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidney affect RVH detectable T2 weight ( Blood oxygen level dependent BOLD ) MRI . This consider value since test oxygenation would shorten simplify diagnostic MR test . Information gain study could lead important change diagnostic pathophysiologic understand RVH .</brief_summary>
