	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : SU5416 may stop growth prostate cancer stop blood flow tumor . Dexamethasone may effective slow growth prostate cancer cell . It yet know whether SU5416 dexamethasone effective treat progressive prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness SU5416 dexamethasone treat patient progressive prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 Compared Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare time progression patient hormone refractory prostate cancer treat dexamethasone without SU5416 . - Determine difference PSA kinetics PSA hazard score two regimen patient population . - Determine objective response rate time development new lesion patient treat SU5416 . - Determine toxicity SU5416 patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral dexamethasone day 6 day week . Treatment continue disease progression , time patient cross arm II . - Arm II : Patients receive oral dexamethasone arm I follow SU5416 IV 60 minute twice weekly 4 week . A small dose dexamethasone administer day SU5416 . Treatment continue minimum 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per arm ) accrue study within 16 month .</detailed_description>
