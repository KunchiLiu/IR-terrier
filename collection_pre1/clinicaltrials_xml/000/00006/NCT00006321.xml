	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) relatively frequent condition may affect 2-3 percent school age child . The morbidity untreated OSAS may include failure thrive , pulmonary systemic hypertension , behavioral neurocognitive deficiency . However , remain unclear extent OSAS impinge aspect neurocognitive behavioral function , whether sleep fragmentation , intermittent hypoxemia , alveolar hypoventilation , three major physiological alteration OSAS , selectively affect particularly vulnerable component neurocognitive function . Furthermore , certain similarity exist behavioral alteration occur OSAS see child Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . The study response Request Applications ( RFA ) Obstructive Sleep Apnea Children . NHLBI issue RFA December , 1997 , co-sponsorship National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research National Institute Child Health Human Development . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional study test hypothesis OSAS detrimental particular aspect neurocognitive behavioral functioning . Snoring 6 year-old child attend public elementary school system New Orleans Parish prospectively identify appropriate questionnaire enrol study . Snoring child underwent overnight polysomnographic assessment determine presence severity OSAS , neurocognitive behavioral function subsequently evaluate employ Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children-III , Conners ' Continuous Performance Test , Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery test . Multivariate regression analyse variance allow determination aspect neurocognitive function behavior vulnerable OSAS general , OSAS components particular . The study also test hypothesis child ADHD may increase prevalence snore OSAS . Children diagnosis initially confirm ADHD use revise Diagnostic Interview Children Adolescents , Conners ' Parent Rating Scale , Child Behavior Checklist . ADHD child underwent polysomnographic evaluation well extensive evaluation neurocognitive function behavior . The prevalence snore OSAS calculate . The study extend June 2007 test hypothesis SDB induce systemic inflammatory response , magnitude inflammatory response major determinant severity neurocognitive dysfunction associate SDB .</detailed_description>
