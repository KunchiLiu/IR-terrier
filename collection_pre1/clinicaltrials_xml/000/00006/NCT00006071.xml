	<brief_summary>Cells line blood vessel produce various substance cause vessel dilate ( relax ) constrict ( tighten ) , thereby regulate blood flow . In patient high blood pressure high cholesterol , blood vessel dilate properly . This study investigate effect rosiglitazone-a drug use improve action insulin diabetic patients-on blood flow examine effect endothelin ( substance cause vessel constriction ) , substance produce vessel-lining cell . Adults blood pressure recording 140/90 mmHg high least three separate day blood cholesterol level least 240 mg/dl may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood pressure recording , blood urine test . This `` crossover '' study involve two separate treatment period ; , participant take either rosiglitazone placebo ( inactive look-alike pill ) day 8 week , drug 4 week , alternative treatment next 8 week . Patients continue take high blood pressure medicine first 6 week treatment period . They stop medication 2 week follow procedure , do end 8-week treatment period : Strain gauge plethysmography-A small catheter place needle artery bend arm measuring blood pressure draw blood sample study . Pressure cuff place wrist upper arm , strain gauge ( rubber band device ) place around forearm measure forearm blood flow . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge rate proportional flow , measurement record . Small dose four drugs-acetylcholine , bradykinin , sodium nitroprusside BQ-123-are give catheter . Acetylcholine slow heart rate . Bradykinin stimulate release substance cause blood vessel dilate low blood pressure . Sodium nitroprusside cause blood vessel dilate use treat high blood pressure heart failure . BQ-123 block blood vessel-constricting activity endothelin . Brachial ultrasound reactivity study-A baseline ultrasound image ( picture produce use sound wave ) brachial artery ( artery locate bend arm ) take blood flow measurement record . Then , pressure cuff place around upper forearm , inflate 5 minute stop blood flow forearm , release . Images artery flow measurement repeat . After 15-minute rest , new baseline image take flow measurement obtain . A small amount nitroglycerin spray tongue 3 minute , blood flow measurement brachial artery image record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since publication data San Antonio Heart Study , link metabolic cardiovascular disorder increasingly recognize , well feature disorder common : insulin resistance vascular endothelial dysfunction . Therefore , interested mechanism underlie impairment endothelial function insulin-resistant state . In particular , recently find insulin stimulates vascular activity ET-1 NO normal human vasculature . It therefore reasonable speculate occurrence insulin resistance and/or endothelial dysfunction may lead imbalance mechanism result increased vascular activity ET-1 . A new class insulin sensitize agent , thiazolidinediones , show posse , addition numerous metabolic role , positive effect blood pressure vascular endothelial function , include decrease endothelin-1 production reduce circulating level endothelial surface molecule . Based data , plan investigate hypothesis thiazolidinediones may improve insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction essential hypertension hypercholesterolemia . We hypothesize treatment rosiglitazone improve endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation conductance resistance vessel , decrease vascular endothelin-1 activity reduces plasma level leptin marker endothelial activation .</detailed_description>
