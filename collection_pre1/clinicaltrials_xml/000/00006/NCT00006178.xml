	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness two drug , Sirolimus Thymoglobulin , prevent rejection transplant kidney . Standard anti-rejection therapy use combination drug , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , steroid , others , take daily life . However , even daily therapy , half kidney recipient slowly reject transplant within 10 year . Both Thymoglobulin , antibody , Sirolimus , anti-rejection drug , prevent rejection lower response immune system transplant organ . Thymoglobulin give pre- postoperative period , Sirolimus take long term . Patients receive kidney transplant National Institutes Health Clinical Center eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants undergo kidney transplant . Before surgery , central line ( intravenous catheter ) , blood medicine give , place neck chest . Patients may also undergo leukapheresis , procedure collect white blood cell . The cell store transfusion later white cell count drop follow Thymoglobulin treatment . For procedure , blood drawn needle place arm flow machine separate blood component spin . The white cell collect bag red cell plasma return second needle arm . Thymoglobulin give intravenously day transplant day 1 9 operation . Sirolimus take mouth , mixed water orange juice . Sirolimus therapy start day transplant continue life . Follow-up study visit schedule weekly first month transplant , every 6 month 1 year year 4 year .

	<brief_title>Sirolimus Thymoglobulin Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol test novel dual agent combination therapy ability prevent human renal allograft rejection . Thymoglobulin ( Sangstat ) , FDA-approved polyclonal rabbit-IgG antithymocyte preparation , give ten day time transplantation achieve profound lymphocyte depletion . This paired chronic therapy Sirolimus ( rapamycin , Wyeth-Ayerst ) , oral immunosuppressant agent recently approve FDA . Rapamycin allow antigen specific T cell activation prevent T cell clonal expansion interrupt IL-2 receptor beta-chain signal transduction . The rationale combination eliminate exist alloreactive T cell clone could initiate rejection time transplantation , promote graft specific activation induce cell death ( AICD ) repopulating T cell allospecific T cell deficit induce . The desired effect therapy prevent allograft rejection without chronic use calcineurin inhibitor glucocorticosteroids , , develop regimen transplantation avoids chronic drug toxicity inherent use two class immunosuppressant . Twenty people evaluate pilot protocol . Ten receive living donor kidney allograft ten receive cadaveric kidney allograft . Patients treat Thymoglobulin begin prior graft implantation continue ten day . Glucocorticosteroids give Thymoglobulin treatment limit monocyte activation prevent cytokine release syndrome associate antibody preparation . Patients give Sirolimus orally begin day transplantation continuously thereafter . Patients monitor evidence allograft rejection use standard functional parameter protocol allograft biopsy . In addition , patient follow specific desired effect , allospecific AICD , promote development allospecific graft tolerance . This accomplish assay peripheral blood allograft biopsy apoptosis peripheral blood evidence alloreactive T cell clone depletion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates kidney transplant perform NIH Clinical Center . Willingness legal ability give inform consent . Availability donor tissue test . This could include splenic peripheral blood lymphocyte cadaveric donor willing living donor enrol Clinical Center Living Donor Protocol consent periodic phlebotomy peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Immunosuppressive drug therapy time 2 month prior enrollment . Specifically , candidate may take prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , antilymphocyte agent , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , agent whose therapeutic effect immunosuppressive . Any active malignancy history hematogenous malignancy lymphoma . Patients primary , cutaneous basal cell squamous cell cancer may enrol provide lesion appropriately treat prior transplant . Significant coagulopathy requirement anticoagulation therapy would contraindicate protocol allograft biopsy . Platelet count le 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . Any known immunodeficiency syndrome . Any history cardiac insufficiency , major vascular disease , symptomatic coronary artery disease . Systemic pulmonary edema . Inability effectively dialyze . Any condition would likely increase risk protocol participation confound interpretation data . Any history sensitization rabbit extensive exposure rabbit . Inability unwillingness comply protocol monitoring therapy , include , among others , history noncompliance , circumstance compliance protocol requirement feasible due living condition , travel restriction , access urgent medical service , access antirejection drug research protocol complete .</criteria>
