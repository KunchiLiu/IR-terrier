	<brief_summary>Parathyroid glands small endocrine gland secrete hormone control blood calcium level . Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PH ) common disorder whereby one glands may enlarge overproduce hormone . Subsequently , elevate blood calcium cause many symptom problem . The standard treatment surgical removal gland ( ) cause disorder . The standard safe effective operation bilateral open parathyroid exploration ( BOPE ) . A new procedure use radioactive compound concentrate parathyroid gland allow limited operation find remove causative gland [ Minimally-Invasive Radioguided Parathyroidectomy ( MIRP ) ] . The radiation exposure minimal safe . Although operation may prove less expensive , certain whether effective safe BOPE . This study serve directly compare cost , effectiveness , safety associate type operation . All patient ( adolescent old ) PH candidate participate . The participant randomly assign MIRP group BOPE group independently patient physician preference . MIRP patient undergo sestamibi nuclear medicine scan attempt localize specific parathyroid gland cause hyperparathyroidism subsequently limited operation local anesthesia remove single gland . Parathyroid hormone level measure operation ensure patient cure . If , standard BOPE procedure complete . The total cost care track group . Careful test complication vocal cord dysfunction do . General Health status pain level measure operation . Patient satisfaction operation care also assess .</brief_summary>
