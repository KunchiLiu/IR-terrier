	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety drug call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) give anti-HIV therapy child HIV infection . This study also determine best dose IL-2 give child . IL-2 important substance produce body 's white blood cell help body fight infection . People HIV infection produce enough IL-2 . It hop IL-2 treatment help boost immune system people HIV infection . It study much child doctor need know dos safe give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Plus Anti-HIV Therapy HIV-Infected Children With Weakened Immune Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One challenge effective combination therapy HIV-infected patient ability achieve immune reconstitution . IL-2 hypothesize restore and/or preserve immune system add potent antiretroviral regimen . This study evaluate restoration immune function CD4 cell also determine best way deliver IL-2 safe effective way . Part I : Patients add 5-day course subcutaneous IL-2 every 8 week 48 week ( 6 cycle ) HAART therapy . Three dose level IL-2 administer . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 5/3/01 : It strongly recommend , require , ] first second cycle IL-2 give hospital inpatient basis . The parent patient train give injection option administer subsequent injection home . Patients monitor CD4 CD8 cell count viral load . Enrollment Part 1 begin low dose level ; assume serious toxicity ( Grade 3 high ) occur , patient enrol high dose level . The high tolerated dose establish . Part 2 : After high tolerate dose establish Part 1 , additional patient randomize receive HAART alone ( Arm 1 ) , HAART high-dose IL-2 ( Arm 2 ) , HAART low-dose IL-2 ( Arm 3 ) . High-dose IL-2 give twice daily high dose tolerate Part 1 5 day every 8 week 6 cycle . Low-dose IL-2 give day every day 48 week . For Arms 2 3 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 5/3/01 : ( except patient pharmacokinetic substudy ) , strongly recommend , require , ] IL-2 give first week inpatient basis hospital personnel . As Part 1 , option administer remain injection home . Intensive toxicity monitoring , routine lymphocyte subset , quantitative HIV RNA perform patient specified time point study . The first 12 patient Arms 2 3 pharmacokinetic test frequent blood sample draw interval , require stay 12 hour clinic . Diphtheria/tetanus immunization bacteriophage phi X174 immunization administer patient determine antibody response .</detailed_description>
