	<brief_title>Chromosome 5Q Gene Variants Asthma-Related Traits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Markers gene chromosomal region 5q31-33 show link associate asthma component asthma phenotype , suggest chromosomal region important genetic susceptibility asthma , yet difficult show specific gene region play major role asthma development progression . Some difficulty arises fact many gene likely involved pathogenesis asthma , single gene effect emerge major contributor , well fact strong influence environmental factor complicate analysis . Having recognize issue , investigator use component asthma-associated phenotype , include eosinophilia compound `` atopy '' phenotype , identify relevant asthma-related gene region . The identification gene genetic variant may associate asthma relate phenotype may provide important new information pathogenesis asthma . The study response Request Applications `` Positional Candidate Approaches Asthma Gene Discovery '' release October 1999 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Dr. Martinez group find linkage marker chromosome 5q31 eosinophilia composite 'atopy ' phenotype . The goal study identify gene variant 5q31-33 responsible two linkage signal . This do use population family enrol Tucson Children 's Respiratory Study follow since time birth index child approximately 18 year ago . In first specific aim , gene variant frequency 2 % group 25 know gene chromosome 5q identify . The 25 gene select among mapped 28 cM interval test linkage previous study . The second specific aim perform linkage disequilibrium map use 100 know polymorphisms region approximately 6.4 cM show high likelihood contain gene variant responsible either eosinophilia atopy linkage signal . Detailed local mapping use publish newly discover polymorphism around area positive signal also perform . Based previous experience investigator chromosomal region , several association/linkage signal chromosome 5q expect found . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
