	<brief_title>Liposomal Vincristine Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine complete partial tumor response patient aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma refractory relapse second-line combination chemotherapy treat vincristine sulfate liposome injection . - Determine toxicity treatment regimen patient . - Determine duration response , time progression , survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome IV 1 hour . Treatment repeat every 2 week maximum 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
