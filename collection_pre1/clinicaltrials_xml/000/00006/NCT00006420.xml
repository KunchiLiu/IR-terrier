	<brief_title>Minnesota Heart Survey - Mortality Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Minnesota Heart Survey ( MHS ) among population-based longitudinal study monitor explain trend coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality morbidity , lead cause death disability United States . It encompass large well-defined community , Minneapolis/St . Paul ( Twin Cities ) metropolitan area Minnesota , comprise population 2.3 million ( 1990 census ) For almost two decade Minnesota Heart Survey make contribution understand 1 ) component decline coronary heart disease mortality include incidence rate , hospitalize attach rate , case fatality , population level CHD risk factor ; 2 ) methodology disease surveillance time classification diagnostic technology constantly change . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Minnesota Heart Survey continue surveillance coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality morbidity seven county metropolitan Minneapolis/St . Paul ( Twin Cities ) area year 2002 . The study also monitor trend acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , evaluate effect AMI diagnosis widespread use new biomarkers ( troponins ) , perform validation study previous standard , evaluate out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) autopsy study A combination different technique use surveillance . CHD death obtain death certificate data Minneapolis Department Public Health . Census data use construct appropriate denominator . A major focus base in-hospital CHD morbidity mortality . Data Minnesota Hospital Health Care Partnership , originally receive data 22 23 area hospital , use identify validate acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) case . Census data use obtain appropriate denominator . An important issue assess time trend hospitalize AMI attack rate change definition use identify case time . A specific issue regard increase use troponin level sensitive previously use CKMB level identify case . Thus , validation study conduct compare two methodology subject . The goal study obtain correction factor time trend AMI attack rate influence difference diagnostic criterion . A new important area investigation of-hospital sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . Autopsy study 100 case per year ( 300 total ) conduct describe risk factor SCD . In addition , comparison make control group 600 person risk factor study .</detailed_description>
