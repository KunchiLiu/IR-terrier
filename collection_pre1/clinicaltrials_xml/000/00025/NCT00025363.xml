	<brief_title>Comparison Chemotherapy Regimens Treating Children With Relapsed Progressive Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate child relapse progressive rhabdomyosarcoma , undifferentiated sarcoma , ectomesenchymoma treat 2 different schedule irinotecan vincristine upfront phase II window . II . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat multiagent chemotherapy . III . Determine toxic effect tirapazamine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide patient . IV . Determine toxic effect irinotecan vincristine patient . V. Determine whether conversion irinotecan active metabolite SN-38 predicts tumor response patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk status window therapy eligibility ( unfavorable risk eligible v unfavorable risk ineligible v favorable risk ) . UNFAVORABLE-RISK PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR WINDOW THERAPY : Patients stratify accord prior topotecan ( yes v ) . These patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 8 irinotecan IV 1 hour day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 8 irinotecan IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) receive 5 additional course irinotecan vincristine previous schedule . In addition , patient PR CR also receive cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin ( CD ) ifosfamide/etoposide ( IE ) chemotherapy . CD/IE CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour doxorubicin IV 15-30 minute day 1 week 7 , 16 , 28 , 37 , 40 . Patients also receive ifosfamide IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 week 10 , 19 , 22 , 31 , 43 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients response progressive disease arm I II proceed tirapazamine/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin ( TCD ) ifosfamide/etoposide ( IE ) chemotherapy . TCD/IE CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive tirapazamine IV 2 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour , doxorubicin IV 15-30 minute day 1 week 7 , 10 , 16 , 25 , 34 . Patients also receive ifosfamide IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 week 13 , 19 , 22 , 28 , 31 , 37 . PATIENTS WITH UNFAVORABLE RISK AND INELIGIBLE FOR WINDOW THERAPY : Patients receive tirapazamine IV 2 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour , doxorubicin IV 15-30 minute day 1 week 1 , 4 , 10 , 19 , 28 . Patients also receive ifosfamide IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 week 7 , 13 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 31 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin 1 day course chemotherapy continue blood count recover . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PATIENTS WITH FAVORABLE RISK : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour doxorubicin IV 15-30 minute day 1 week 1 , 4 , 10 , 19 , 28 . Patients also receive ifosfamide IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 week 7 , 13 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 31 . Patients also receive G-CSF GM-CSF SC begin 1 day course chemotherapy continue blood count recover . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
