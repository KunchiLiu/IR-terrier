	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness G-CSF treating patient Crohn 's disease-a long-term recur inflammation small large intestine . Patients may swell bleed intestinal lining , lead infection abdominal pain , weight loss , fever , diarrhea , bloody stool , fistula ( connection skin intestine ) , intestinal blockage , abscess . Although various treatment Crohn 's disease , many patient continue inflammation difficult control severe side effect medication . G-CSF approve drug use increase white blood cell count . Other cell , immune cell , expose G-CSF develop specific immune action-a Th-2 response-that decrease inflammatory response Crohn 's disease-a Th-1 response . Patients 18 year age old mild moderately severe Crohn 's disease least 4 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history possible review medical record , physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , urine stool analysis , woman , pregnancy test . They fill Crohn 's Disease Activity Index questionnaire daily 7 day Inflammatory Bowel Disease questionnaire . Participants G-CSF therapy . Before start therapy , series pre-treatment test , include colonoscopy leukapheresis . Colonoscopy examination colon . For procedure , patient give medication lessen anxiety discomfort . An endoscope-a lighted flexible tube-is inserted rectum , allow examination extent inflammation . The endoscope also use take picture colon extract tissue sample test ( biopsy ) . Leukapheresis procedure collect quantity white blood cell . Whole blood collect needle place arm vein circulate machine separate component . The white cell remove , rest blood return body , either needle use draw blood another needle place arm . After colonoscopy leukapheresis , patient receive G-CSF injection every day 29 day . The patient caregiver , family member , teach give injection . Blood sample collect treatment day 4 , 8 , 11 15 , physical examination interview , blood test stool exam do week . Patients repeat colonoscopy leukapheresis 24 hour last treatment dose ( day 29 ) . After 29-day treatment , patient follow clinic follow : - Week 4 treatment - physical exam interview , routine blood work stool exam - Week 8 - interview blood work - Week 16 - interview , blood work stool exam - Week 24 - physical exam interview , blood work , stool exam colonoscopy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study evaluate immunologic clinical response granulocyte-colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF , Filgrastim , Neupogen ) administer patient Crohn 's Disease . Crohn 's disease , incurable , chronic , relapse inflammation small large intestine , affect approximately 500,000 people United States . The disease characterize full-thickness involvement gut wall lead episode abdominal pain , diarrhea , hematochezia , weight loss complication bowel obstruction , fistula formation extraintestinal manifestation . The rationale study base several observation . First , show effector T cell dendritic cell harvest follow G-CSF administration display Th2 phenotype . Second , Crohn 's disease animal model characterize Th1 inflammatory disease susceptible Th2 counter-regulation . Lastly , G-CSF effective treatment Crohn 's disease well colitides resemblance Crohn 's disease accord publish case report . Despite standard therapeutic use steroid , aminosalicylates , antibiotic , antimetabolite immunosuppressant ( 6-MP , methotrexate ) , early agent emerge biologics class drug ( anti-TNFalpha antibody , e.g . ) , treatment Crohn 's disease still troubled loss effectiveness standard therapy time , outright nonresponsiveness , serious medication side effect . For reason new agent strategy treatment Crohn 's disease need develop test . This pilot study propose measure immunologic clinical effect two dose level G-CSF administer subcutaneously patient active Crohn 's disease . The primary outcome include document change immune parameter measure peripheral lamina propria CD4 T cell cytokine release , dendritic cell phenotype cytokine release , change clinical parameter Crohn 's Disease Activity Index endoscopic histologic score . Secondary endpoint include rate severity adverse event . Our short-term goal document production effector cell Th2-cytokine profile associate clinical improvement change . The long-term goal study establish G-CSF effective alternative adjunctive therapy low risk profile treatment Crohn 's disease .</detailed_description>
