	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety effectiveness drug pramipexole give combination lithium divalproex short-term treatment acute depression patient bipolar disorder . Bipolar disorder severe , chronic , often life-threatening illness . Treatments acute unipolar depression extensively research . However , despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , significant proportion depress patient fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment . Novel improve therapeutic bipolar depression need . This study evaluate antidepressant property pramipexole . This study conduct three phase . Phase 1 14-day washout period participant taper psychiatric medicine except divalproex lithium . Participants also ask adhere low caffeine low monoamine diet . During Phase 2 , participant randomly assign receive either pramipexole placebo ( inactive pill ) 6 week . Participants respond treatment give either open-label pramipexole another clinical treatment . Participants screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood urine test , psychiatric evaluation . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test . Participants physical exam EKG study entry study completion . Blood drawn various time throughout study . Pulse blood pressure measurement take daily . Weekly interview conduct . Participants control group healthy volunteer undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Pramipexole Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder ( BPD , manic-depressive illness ) common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Increasingly , recognize depressive phase illness , contribute much morbidity mortality . Impairment physical social function result depression severe chronic medical illness . Suicide cause death 10-20 % individual either bipolar recurrent depressive disorder . The treatment acute unipolar depression extensively research . However , despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % ( unipolar ) depress patient fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Very study examine efficacy somatic treatment acute phase bipolar depression . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic bipolar depression . A deficiency dopamine system stand prime candidate involvement pathophysiology depression . Preliminary study suggest pramipexole ( Mirapex ) , dopaminergic-agent FDA-approved Parkinson 's Disease , may antidepressant property unipolar bipolar patient well neurotrophic property . In study , propose investigate potential efficacy pramipexole , enhance dopaminergic throughput via D2 D3 receptor , exerts robust neurotrophic effect via direct intracellular mechanism . This 6-week randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled add-on study examine efficacy pramipexole acutely depress Bipolar II patient . This study three phase . The first phase washout phase last 14 day . The second phase 6-week double-blind acute phase efficacy tolerability adjunctive pramipexole placebo compare . Patients complete 6-week double-blind phase receive either open-label pramipexole clinical treatment . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Patients , age 18 70 , diagnosis Bipolar II disorder , depress ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment receive either pramipexole ( 0.375-4.5 mg/day ) placebo combination mood stabilizer period 6 week . Following acute period , patient receive either open-label pramipexole treatment clinically indicate . Approximately 100 patient acute Bipolar II depression enrol study . Imaging pharmacokinetic study obtain study .</detailed_description>
