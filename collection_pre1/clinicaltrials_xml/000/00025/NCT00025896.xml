	<brief_summary>Pompe disease cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In infant severe case Pompe disease ( call Classical Infantile Pompe disease ) , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart , skeletal muscle , liver , prevents normal function . This study conduct evaluate safety effectiveness recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase ( rhGAA ) potential enzyme replacement therapy Pompe disease . Patients diagnose Classical Infantile Pompe disease small , inactive , amount natural GAA enzyme present body ( call Cross-Reacting Immunologic Material-Positive `` CRIM ( + ) '' patient ) , study .</brief_summary>
