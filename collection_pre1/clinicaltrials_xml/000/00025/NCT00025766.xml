	<brief_title>Angioplasty Heart Stents Treat Individuals With Occluded Artery Following Heart Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Occluded Artery Trial ( OAT ) international study 3200 participant . Its goal determine delay mechanical reperfusion mean percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) stenting reduces death , heart attack , hospitalization individual New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV heart failure persistently occlude infarct-related artery ( IRA ) 3 28 day follow heart attack . While left ventricular ( LV ) function improvement suggest benefit late reperfusion , solid evidence support claim lacking . Furthermore , stenting reduce reocclusion rate total occlusion PTCA , reocclusion rate recent heart attack unknown . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study substudy OAT enroll 380 participant . The primary aim study include follow : 1 ) compare long-term patency rate two treatment group ( conventional medical therapy PTCA stenting ) mean follow-up coronary angiography one year enrollment ; 2 ) compare change global LV ejection fraction two treatment group utilizing baseline follow-up contrast LV angiogram . Secondary aim include follow : 1 ) comparison regional wall motion LV volume ; 2 ) study effect reocclusion spontaneous recanalization LV function ; 3 ) study effect duration occlusion change LV function Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) . The substudy conduct 21 OAT study site . The Substudy Coordinating Center ( SCC ) University Alberta Edmonton , Canada . The Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) Maryland Medical Research Institute , DCC OAT study . The Angiographic Core Laboratory University British Columbia .</detailed_description>
