	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine activity gefitinib , term failure-free survival , patient malignant mesothelioma . II . Determine response rate patient treat drug . III . Determine toxicity drug patient . IV . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . V. Determine whether overexpression epidermal growth factor receptor expression cyclo-oxygenase-2 predict effectiveness drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within 7-10 month .</detailed_description>
