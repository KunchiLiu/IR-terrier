	<brief_summary>The purpose study use computer-generated virtual reality environment study fear conditioning . Fear condition use explore cause persistence anxiety anxiety disorder . When confront fearful unpleasant event , people develop fear specific cue associate event well environmental context event occur via process call classical aversive conditioning . Advances computer-generated visual stimulation could facilitate design new aversive conditioning study . This study develop virtual reality environment examine human contextual fear condition laboratory . During procedure , moderately painful stimulus administer . Participants study screen medical history , physical examination , psychiatric evaluation , hear test . Participants wear headphone special goggles enable view virtual reality environment . Measures take study see brain adapts environmental stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fear condition paradigm tool explore symptom anxiety disorder . During fear conditioning , organism develops fear phasic explicit cue ( e.g. , light ) associate aversive unconditioned stimulus ( e.g. , shock ) conditioning well environmental context ( e.g. , experimental room ) . Explicit cue condition context conditioning separate process mediate distinct brain structure . Whereas explicit cue conditioning dependent amygdala , context conditioning involve amygdala , hippocampus bed nucleus stria terminalis ( BNST ) . We use explicit cue context conditioning model phasic fear sustain anxiety , respectively . However , contextual fear relatively difficult study human laboratory require two experimental session use different experimental room . Advances computer-generated visual stimulation offer possibility develop sophisticated paradigm laboratory could facilitate design fear conditioning study . In addition , compare traditional paradigm , computer generate three-dimensional stimulation provide opportunity create realistic virtual environment . The main objective study use virtual reality understand fear conditioning human .</detailed_description>
