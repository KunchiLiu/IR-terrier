	<brief_summary>Several complication become prevalent people live HIV/AIDS , include increase blood sugar , increase blood fat cholesterol , fat tissue redistribution . The cause complication well understood effective treatment identify . We propose test efficacy safety 2 treatment complication people live HIV/AIDS : aerobic , weight lift exercise training , new insulin-sensitizing agent call rosiglitazone ( Avandia ) . Exercise rosiglitazone effective moderately safe use HIV-seronegative people diabetes , specific trial need test efficacy safety people live HIV/AIDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Exercise Training : Effects HIV-Infected People With Insulin Resistance , Hypertriglyceridemia , Adipose Tissue Maldistribution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose 12wk control , randomize trial compare effect rosiglitazone therapy , exercise training combine rosiglitazone exercise training . We hypothesize rosiglitazone low blood sugar , insulin , blood fat , muscle liver lipid content composition HIV-infected people . Exercise training induce benefit , also reduce abdominal fat mass . We hypothesize combine exercise training rosiglitazone therapy effective reduce blood sugar , insulin , lipid , muscle liver lipid content , restore body fat distribution either intervention alone . At baseline 12 wk treatment measure : ability insulin promote clearance sugar blood , clearance rate blood sugar , rate glucose production liver , blood fat cholesterol concentration , body fat content fat distribution arm , leg , trunk region , muscle liver lipid content composition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The research volunteer consist HIVinfected men woman treat PIbased HAART develop insulin resistance impair glucose homeostasis : fasting ( 8h ) plasma glucose 110126 mg/dL ( 6.17.1 mM ) OR plasma glucose &gt; 140 ( 7.8 mM ) 2 hour 75goral glucose load . Although required enrollment , many volunteer also develop trunk adipose tissue redistribution ( define ) : trunk/appendicular adipose ratio use wholebody DEXA &gt; 1.1 ( men ) , &gt; 0.9 ( woman ) , visceral adipose/total abdominal adipose tissue ( VAT/TAT ) &gt; 0.40 use 1HMRI image level umbilicus ( ~L3L4 intervertebral space ) . Many also develop fast hypertriglyceridemia ( &gt; 300mg/dL , &gt; 3.4 mM ) . Plasma viremia ( Roche Amplicor assay ) &lt; 5000 copies/ml OR CD4 Tcell county &gt; = 200 cells/ul least 3 month prior enrollment . Stable PIcontaining HAART regimen least 3 month prior enrollment . 1865 year age Body mass index &lt; = 34kg/m*2 , total body fat &lt; =35 % weight</criteria>
