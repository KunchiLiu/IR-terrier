	<brief_title>Thalidomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor cytostatic activity thalidomide , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Determine partial complete response rate patient treated drug . IV . Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . V. Determine effect drug initial performance status histological grade patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
