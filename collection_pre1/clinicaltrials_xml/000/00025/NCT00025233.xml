	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cancer Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine cytostatic antitumor activity bevacizumab , term 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) , patient persistent recurrent squamous cell carcinoma cervix . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Estimate distribution PFS overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine frequency clinical response ( partial complete ) patient treat drug . V. Determine role age initial performance status prognostic factor patient treated drug . VI . Determine whether biological image marker associate clinical efficacy drug , 6-month PFS , patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 11-38 month .</detailed_description>
