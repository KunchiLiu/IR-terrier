	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity ixabepilone patient recurrent persistent platinum paclitaxel-refractory ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course achieve CR . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
