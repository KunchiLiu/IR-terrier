	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect intermittent short cycle HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) treat HIV infection . HAART multi-drug regimen effective suppress HIV perhaps slow halt progression AIDS . However , treatment significant drawback : completely rid body virus ; long-term therapy carry risk toxicity ( harmful side effect ) ; regimen difficult comply many pill capsule must take daily . When patient stop take HAART , HIV level climb . This study see give HAART short cycle 7 day , 7 day , keep viral level low maintain CD4+ T cell count . HIV-infected people age 18 old receive HAART viral load le 50 copies/ml CD4+ T cell count least 175 cells/mm3 may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , possibly chest X-ray electrocardiogram . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test . Participants randomly assign either continue current medication regimen take HAART intermittent cycle 7 day , 7 day . Patients continue treatment 72 week viral level increase CD4+ T cell count decline level concern . Upon enter study , patient blood test monitor amount virus blood , CD4+ T cell count , viral resistance HAART medication , side effect drug , immune response HIV test tube . They clinic visit history , physical examination blood draw every month 12 month . At time , depend T cell count viral load , number visit may reduce , never less frequently every month . Patients also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure collect quantity white blood cells-every 3 4 month study . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein ( similar donate blood ) . The blood circulate cell separator white cell remove , rest blood ( plasma , red cell platelet ) return needle second one arm . The collected white cell use special study level function T cell detect hidden virus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) successful suppress plasma HIV RNA level infect patient , result eradication virus . It clear virus replication persist despite undetectable plasma viremia individual receive HAART . In regard , withdraw HAART , even prolong period virus suppression , lead almost universal rapid rebound plasma viremia . It also clear prolong , continuous HAART carry risk significant toxicity side effect . In addition , monetary cost HAART prohibitive many individual country . These recent observation may argue different approach HAART goal : 1 ) durable suppression virus replication , without attempt eradication , 2 ) minimization toxicity side effect improvement patient life-style , 3 ) reduction cost . Therefore , propose study virologic immunologic effect short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART HIV-infected individual possible mean achieve goal . In pilot study patient successfully treated HAART , demonstrate cycle 7 day HAART follow 7 day HAART maintain suppression plasma , lymph node , rest CD4+ T cell HIV maintain CD4+ T cell count 1 year . It purpose study evaluate observation randomize , control , intent-to-treat trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Documentation HIV1 infection license ELISA test kit confirm second method ( e.g . Western Blot ) . Absolute CD4+ Tcell count great equal 175/mm ( 3 ) within 30 day randomization ( For patient status postsplenectomy , also CD4+ Tcell great 20 % ) . If CD4+ T cell count less equal 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) , patient must receive PCP prophylaxis . Receiving least 3drug HAART least 1viral load test le 500 copies/ml within least 6 month screen . Patients must receive NNRTI PI enrollment . A viral load le 50 copies/ml prior enrollment . Age least 18 year . For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) require within 14 day prior randomization . Laboratory value ( within 30 day prior randomization ) : 1 . AST 5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 2 . Total direct bilirubin 2 X ULN unless pattern consistent Gilbert 's syndrome patient receive indinavir . 3 . Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL . 4 . Platelet count least 50,000/microliter . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Concurrent malignancy , disease state , require cytotoxic chemotherapy . Symptomatic significant HIVrelated illness , opportunistic infection malignancy mucocutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma . A history AIDS defining opportunistic infection mucocutaneous candida . Use experimental antiretrovirals less equal 6 month prior enrollment . An exception may make hydroxyurea accord judgment Principal Investigator . Patients receive IL2 eligible , required cycle onHAART period randomize intermittent arm . Pregnant breastfeeding . Significant cardiac , pulmonary , kidney , rheumatologic , gastrointestinal , CNS disease detectable routine history , physical examination , screen laboratory study . Psychiatric illness , opinion PI , might interfere study compliance . Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety . Refusal practice safe sex use precaution pregnancy ( effective birth control barrier contraceptive abstinence ) . Known history laboratory evidence chronic hepatitis B infection include surface antigen positivity . Receiving salvage HAART , i.e . evidence clinical resistance license antiretrovirals . Patients receive nevirapine , abacavir amd single protease inhibitor regime time enrollment . Patients receive medication may switch approve agent , plasma viremia remain less 50 copies/ml least 30 day later , would eligible enrollment . Patients continuous arm may receive nevirapine abacavir regimens participate arm .</criteria>
