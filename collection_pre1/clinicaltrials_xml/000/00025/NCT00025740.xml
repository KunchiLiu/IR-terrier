The main goal treatment patient PTSD significantly reduce symptom severity across reexperiencing , avoidance hyperarousal symptom along improvement function . While numerous approach use treat PTSD , treatment limit variable response rate , 6-week lag period prior onset clinical response , sub-optimal side effect profile , include possible worsening anxiety insomnia prior clinical response . The propose double blind study examine whether combine treatment benzodiazepine ( clonazepam ) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) ( paroxetine ) patient PTSD accelerate onset clinical response . A second goal evaluate whether rapid clinically meaningful benefit sustain end study , despite taper benzodiazepine midpoint study . The safety tolerability combination paroxetine clonazepam compare paroxetine placebo treatment PTSD . We hypothesize treatment combination clonazepam paroxetine result rapid reduction PTSD symptom compare treatment placebo paroxetine .
