	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Has Been Completely Removed During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To ascertain whether patient completely resect high-risk primary GIST undergo adjuvant treatment STI571 prolong survival compare historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 2 5-year prevalence recurrence patient treat adjuvant STI571 follow complete resection high-risk primary GIST . II . To obtain patient GIST : tumor tissue ( therapy STI571 time recurrence ) , blood specimen ( therapy STI571 ) , serum specimen ( therapy STI571 , complete therapy STI571 , time recurrence ) scientific correlative analysis . III . To assess toxicity oral STI571 therapy use adjuvant setting . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily begin within 84 day surgical resection . Treatment continue 1 year absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
