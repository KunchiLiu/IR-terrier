	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine certain brain chemical work patient Panic Disorder ( PD ) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) without major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Brain chemical regulate emotion , anxiety , sleep , stress hormone , body function bind serotonin ( 5-HT1A ) benzodiazepine ( BZD ) receptor . Evidence suggest 5-HT1A BZD receptor function abnormal patient PD , PTSD , depression . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan examine BZD 5-HT1A receptor bind potential patient PD patient PTSD without co-morbid MDD , well healthy volunteer . This study also determine effect stress hormone cortisol 5-HT1A BZD receptor . The current emotional state psychiatric , medical , family history potential participant evaluate initial telephone interview . After enter study , participant ask question general mood , degree nervousness , behavior . A physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , test intelligence cognition give . Urine , blood , saliva sample take . Women give pregnancy test test determine menstrual phase time ovulation . All volunteer undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) PET scan brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest serotonin1A ( 5-HT1A ) receptor , serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) benzodiazepine ( BZD ) receptor function abnormal panic disorder ( PD ) , postraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) depression ( MDD ) . The hypothesis role 5-HT1A receptor obtain assess behavioral , neuroendocrine temperature response selective partial 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone anxiety disorder subject healthy control , examine effect 5-HT1A receptor function rat follow antidepressant drug ( AD ) administration . 5-HT1A receptor knockout mouse show behavior use model anxiety disorder human . Moreover , 5-HT1A receptor agonist show effective treatment patient anxiety disorder . The serotonin transporter implicate disorder virtue efficacy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor relieve symptoms subject . Evidence argue role BZD/GABA receptor dysfunction anxiety disorder come study show anxiolytic anxiogenic property BZD agonists antagonist , respectively . BZD receptor sensitivity show reduced patient anxiety disorder . Brain image study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) suggest decrease BZD receptor bind PD PTSD . Animal study link together serotonin GABA suggest pathological pathway originate 5-HT1A receptor deficit lead towards dysfunction within GABAergic system , result increased level anxiety . Yet , association disturb interaction 5-HT1A receptor bind alteration BZD receptor binding explore human . The propose study advance knowledge regard neurobiology PD PTSD employ PET [ 11C ] flumazenil , [ 18F ] FC-WAY100635 ( [ 18F ] FCWAY ) [ 11C ] DASB compare BZD receptor , 5-HT1A receptor serotonin transporter bind potential , respectively , PD , PTSD MDD patient healthy control . Because central 5-HT1A receptor density down-regulated rodent corticosterone administration stress-mediated corticosterone secretion , assessments HPA-axis activity assess determine whether down-regulation 5-HT1A receptor correlate cortisol hypersecretion PD , PTSD MDD . The following hypothesis test : 1 ) PD/PTSD/MDD patient reduce GABA ( A ) -BZD receptor bind relative healthy control . 2 ) PD/PTSD/MDD patient reduce 5-HT1A receptor bind potential relative healthy control . 3 ) 5-HT1A receptor bind prominently reduce PD PTSD patient comorbid MDD relative anxiety disorder patient without comorbid MDD healthy control . 4 ) There positive correlation reduction 5-HT1A receptor bind BZD bind PD/PTSD/MDD patient . 5 ) There inverse correlation reduction 5-HT1A receptor bind BZD bind PD/PTSD/MDD patient cortisol secretion . 6 ) Serotonin transporter binding , measure use [ 11C ] DASB , reduce PD subject relative healthy control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ANXIETY DISORDERS SAMPLES : Eighty four subject ( age 1850 ) anxiety disorder ( PD PTSD ) select additionally meet criterion one 4 subgroup : A ) PD , Currently Depressed ( n=27 ) : As define DSMIV criterion PD , still symptomatic define least 1 panic attack/week CGI score least 4 , current HDRS score mildmoderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great 15 ) . Patients request meet DSMIV criterion single recurrent episode major depressive disorder . In case comorbid depression ensure PD earlier onset depressive disorder . B ) PD , Currently Not Depressed ( n=27 ) : Defined symptomatic PD least 1 panic attack/week CGI score least 4 never experience depressive episode meeting DSMIV criterion major depressive disorder dysthymia , OR period least six month one clinically significant symptom , time subject take AD agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 25 item ) score nondepressed range ( less equal 7 ) select . C ) PTSD , Currently Depressed ( n=15 ) : As define DSMIV duration illness least three month . Patients must score great equal 50 ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale ( CAPS2 ) measure PTSD symptom severity . Patients request meet DSMIV criterion single recurrent episode major depressive disorder . Current HDRS score mildmoderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great equal 15 ) . In case comorbid depression ensure PTSD earlier onset depressive disorder . D ) PTSD , Currently Not Depressed ( n=15 ) : Defined PTSD never experience depressive episode meeting DSMIV criterion major depressive disorder dysthymia OR period least six month one clinically significant symptom , time subject take AD agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 25 item ) score nondepressed range ( less equal 7 ) select . HEALTHY CONTROL SAMPLE : One hundred sixteen subject ( age 1850 ) meet criterion major psychiatric disorder . The control subject know firstdegree relative PD PTSD . PSYCHIATRIC CONTROL SAMPLE ( n=30 ) : Subjects Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , currently remit , defined period least three month subject take antidepressant agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scales ( HDRS ; 21item ) score nondepressed range ( le 8 ) , one clinically significant depressive symptom . These subject must history PTSD and/or serious trauma . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects recruit drugnaive currently receive psychotropic drug least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) . In case patient psychotropic medication treatment successful ( defined meeting inclusion criterion note ) , medication taper ensure subject drugfree least 3 week prior PET scan . Subjects also exclude : ) serious suicidal ideation behavior , b ) psychosis extent ability provide inform consent doubt , c ) medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy , ) history drug ( include BZDs ) alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) , e ) current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test prior scanning ) , f ) current breast feeding , g ) general MRI exclusion criterion , h ) patient currently take fluoxetine . Patients control must exhibit moderate alcohol use . Subjects current previous regular ( great 4 week ) BZDs excessive use alcohol ( great 8 ounce/day men great six ounce /day woman ) past present ineligible participate , may produce downregulation BZD receptor may confound result . Postmenopausal female subject . Subjects beyond age 50 exclude reduce biological heterogeneity encompass MDD anxiety disorder criterion . Subjects whose first anxiety disorder episode arise temporally major medical psychiatric condition also exclude . In addition criterion , subject undergo serotonin transporter scan also exclude take recreational drug ecstasy within 3 week prior scan regular use past .</criteria>
