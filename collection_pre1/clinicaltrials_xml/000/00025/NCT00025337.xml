	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy without bevacizumab treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer previously treat . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know bevacizumab effective without combination chemotherapy treat colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Compared With Bevacizumab Alone Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Has Been Previously Treated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response , time progression , overall survival patient previously treat advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treat oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil without bevacizumab versus bevacizumab . ( Arm III close accrual 03/11/2003 ) . II . Compare toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , prior radiotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) IV 22 hour day 1 2 . Arm II : Patients receive oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , 5-FU arm I . Arm III : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . ( Arm close accrual 03/11/2003 ) . Courses arm repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response may receive 2 additional course . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
