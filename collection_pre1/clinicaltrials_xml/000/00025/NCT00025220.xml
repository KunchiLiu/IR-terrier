	<brief_title>Thalidomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Cancer Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor cytostatic activity thalidomide , measure probability progression-free survival ( PFS ) least 6 month , patient recurrent persistent uterine leiomyosarcoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Determine partial complete response rate patient treated drug . IV . Determine duration PFS overall survival patient treated drug . V. Determine effect drug initial performance status patient . VI . Determine effect drug 4 week endogenous angiogenesis factor ( vascular endothelial growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor ) plasma urine patient . VII . Assess association endogenous angiogenesis factor clinical outcome ( PFS ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
