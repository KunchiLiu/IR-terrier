	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy ZD 1839 may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth prostate cancer . It yet know dose ZD 1839 effective treat prostate cancer respond hormone therapy . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare different dos ZD 1839 treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD 1839 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy 2 different dos ZD 1839 , term objective response , PSA response , duration response , patient hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma prostate . - Compare tolerability quantitative toxicity regimens patient . - Determine whether association response stable disease clinical benefit assess change quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord measurable disease ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral , low-dose ZD 1839 twice daily day 1 daily day 2-28 course 1 daily day 1-28 subsequent course . - Arm II : Patients receive oral , high-dose ZD 1839 arm I . Treatment arm continue every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , end course study , 4 week study . Patients stable respond disease follow 4 week every 3 month disease progression . All patient follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-60 patient ( 15-30 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
