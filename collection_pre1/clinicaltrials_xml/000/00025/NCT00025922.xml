	<brief_summary>This 2-part study examine 1 ) immune response influenza ( flu ) vaccine HIV-infected patient , 2 ) effect flu vaccine HIV viral load . Earlier study show people HIV infection respond well flu vaccine healthy subject ; , n't make many antibody response vaccine . Also , study do use HAART ( highly active antiretroviral treatment ) show HIV level increase period time flu vaccination . One small study show small brief increase HIV even patient take HAART . The current trial examine whether flu vaccine , fact , cause elevation viral load whether increase harmful indicate well response vaccine . HIV-infected patient healthy normal volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible part1of study . ( Healthy volunteer serve control subject make sure flu vaccine stimulate production enough antibody protect flu ) . Part 2 include HIV-infected patient few 50 copy per milliliter HIV . Patients part study must receive HAART ( consist least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor ) least 3 month enrollment study . Candidates screen medical history blood test , include HLA testing ( genetic test immune system marker ) . Women able child pregnancy test . Pregnant woman exclude study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Part 1 - Immune Response Flu Vaccine In first two visit , participant blood drawn flu antibody level vaccination , HIV-infected patient , measure T cell count viral load . They receive flu vaccine . Blood drawn second visit 28 day later test . - Part 2 - Effect Flu Vaccine Viral Levels Participants randomly assign receive flu vaccine either begin enrollment study ( immediate ) 3 week enrollment ( defer ) . Those immediate group receive flu vaccine first day ( day 0 ) blood drawn day 0 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 24 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 38 42 . Those deferred group vaccinate day 21 blood drawn day 0 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 24 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 38 , 42 49 . The blood test viral load , CD4 cell count antibody level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccine HIV Infection : Immune Response Effect Viral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part protocol evaluate : Part 1 : response influenza vaccine HIV-infected adult receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) ; Part 2 : effect influenza vaccine HIV-viral load ( Part 2 ) . The purpose Part 1 evaluate effect HIV viral load generation influenza-specific antibody . 95 HIV-infected subject CD4 cell count HIV viral load HAART enrol receive influenza vaccine appropriate on-going influenza season laboratory study ( include influenza titer , CD4 count , HIV viral load ) obtain baseline 28 day post vaccination ; 15 HIV-negative healthy volunteer serve control demonstrate vaccine preparation induce protective immunity . The purpose Part 2 ass potential effect vaccine-associated immune activation HIV viral replication 30 HIV-infected subject HAART suppress HIV viremia ( le 50 copies/mL ) screen visit . These subject randomize receive influenza vaccine appropriate on-going influenza season immediately 3 week enrollment . Both group frequent blood draw HIV viral load 3 week immediately vaccine serve vaccine response period 3 week serve control period subject . All subject pre-vaccine 28 day post vaccine influenza titer determine see relationship HIV viral load increase vaccine response . Subjects compensate participation part study . Those subject ineligible Part 2 screen HIV viral load great 50 copies/mL invite participate Part 1 . This study conduct USA influenza season ( Oct-March ) . Thus , primary study risk phlebotomy inconvenience . Although risk influenza vaccine , ACIP recommend influenza vaccination HIV-infected patient . Finally , subject defer vaccination three week , presumably increase risk develop influenza . Total enrollment study 140 subject ( 125 HIV-infected individual 15 HIV-negative control ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ( HIVPositive ) Age great equal 18 less equal 60 year old willing able give inform consent . Enrollment USA influenza season ( OctoberMarch ) Selfreported history HIV infection enrollment . If NIH HIV test confirm subject HIV positive , subject discontinue study include analysis Selfreported prevaccine CD4 count great equal 400 cells/microliter . If day 0 CD4 cell count test reveals CD4 count less 400 , subject put study receive compensation initial visit . Selfreported use HAART minimum three month prior enrollment . For study , HAART define least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus either nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( HIV positive ) Selfreported history vaccination trivalent influenza preparation use current influenza season . Selfreported vaccination vaccine within one month period prior study enrollment Acute febrile illness ( may defer vaccine resovled ) History hypersensitivity influenza vaccine component include thimerosal egg History GuillainBarre syndrome Intention receive vaccine study period Pregnancy Selfreported treatment immunomodulator/immunosuppressive drug ( interluekins , corticosteroid , G ( M ) CSF ) 4 week prior enrollment . Epoetin use permit . Selfreported hidtory IL2 within past 5 year Use theophylline preparation warfarin theoretical possibility , enhance drug effect toxicities post influenza vaccination Active infection serious illness HIV , opinion investigator , might affect immune response vaccine . Current alcohol , substance abuse , systemic/psychiatric illness potentially could interfere patient compliance ability make study visit INCLUSION CRITERIA ( HIVnegative ) Age great equal 18 less equal 60 year old willing able give inform consent . Enrollment USA influenza season ( OctoberMarch ) Selfreported healthy HIV negative . If NIH HIV test confirm subject HIV negative , subject discontinue study include analysis EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( HIV Negative ) Selfreported history vaccination trivalent influenza preparation use current influenza season Selfreported vaccination vaccine within one month period prior study enrollment Acute febrile illness ( may defer vaccine resovled ) History hypersensitivity influenza vaccine component include thimerosal egg History GuillainBarre syndrome Intention receive vaccine study period Pregnancy Use theophylline preparation warfarin theoretical possibility , enhance drug effect toxicities post influenza vaccination Any medical condition , medication use , opinion investigator , might affect immune response vaccine Current alcohol , substance abuse , systemic/psychiatric illness potentially could interfere patient compliance ability make study visit</criteria>
