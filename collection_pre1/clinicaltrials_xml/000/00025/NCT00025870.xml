	<brief_summary>This study provide medical evaluation patient know suspected metabolic genetic disorder . It allow NICHD investigator trainees experience diagnosing , managing , treat patient metabolic genetic disorder may eligible active NIH research trial . Participants protocol test procedure use standard practice medicine ; experimental test treatment . Patients find eligible active research protocol offer participation study . The medical evaluation trial may uncover new disease process prompt new research initiative . People age suspect diagnosed genetic metabolic condition may eligible study . In addition , child unexplained developmental delay , deafness , dysmorphism , congenital malformation , acidosis , failure thrive , feed problem , short stature , birth defect , syndrome unknown cause may qualify . Participants medical history , include family history , possible review previous medical record , physical examination . Other procedure may include : - Consultation medical specialist . - Hearing and/or vision test . - Imaging study , X-rays , ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . - Blood draw Blood sample ( 2 4 tablespoon adult 1 2 tablespoon child ) may use routine lab test , genetic study , research purpose . - Cheek swab DNA may obtain cheek swab . A small brush rub inside cheek collect cell . - Skin biopsy Under local anesthetic , small circle skin ( 1/8-inch ) remove sharp cut instrument similar cookie cutter . - Muscle biopsy Under local anesthetic , small piece muscle tissue remove aid diagnosis . Participants undergo diagnostic procedure clinically indicate ; , test need confirm rule diagnosis do . Tissue sample collect diagnostic purpose may also use obtain DNA genetic study establish cell line ( cell grow laboratory maintain indefinitely ) future research . The result medical evaluation may indicate whether participant disease run family ( genetic disorder indeed confirm ) . Unless request otherwise , subject ( parent case minor ) receive counsel regard test result . The implication positive test result explain , specifically , participant risk disease , risk pass condition offspring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim protocol provide care patient variety rare genetic disorder , supplement offer additional opportunity train clinical genetics , dysmorphology metabolic genetics National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Institutes National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , spearhead development new research protocols particular aspect diagnosis care specific genetic disease . Evaluations patient broad spectrum metabolic genetic condition perform . In addition , genetic counseling service offer patient family assess risk , give information preventive measure , test option . Disorders study include chromosomal Mendelian disorder childhood and/or adult onset , congenital anomaly and/or birth defect , dysmorphic syndrome , familial cancer syndrome , multifactorial disorder , metabolic abnormality . If eligible another NICHD research protocol ( specific disease treatment ) , patient genetic/metabolic-related condition may evaluate auspex protocol advance clinical skill physicians participate NICHD clinical research training program , provide stimuli new clinical research initiative . Standard , medically indicated laboratory radiological study may perform confirm diagnosis aid management patient . In case , patient receive medical surgical treatment disorder , accord current clinical practice . Patients and/or family member genetic disorder may offer DNA storage and/or test . The overall purpose protocol support Institute training research mission expand spectrum disease see clinic ward .</detailed_description>
