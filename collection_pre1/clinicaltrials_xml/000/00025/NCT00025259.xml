	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study different chemotherapy regimen give without radiation therapy compare well work treat child newly diagnose Hodgkin 's disease . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Giving drug different combination may kill cancer cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage cancer cell . It yet know chemotherapy effective without additional chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy treat Hodgkin 's disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Additional Chemotherapy and/or Radiation Therapy Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response-based therapy standard therapy intermediate risk Hodgkin disease . II . To determine whether involved field radiation therapy ( IFRT ) eliminate base upon early complete response multiagent chemotherapy . III . To determine whether addition additional two cycle chemotherapy ( DECA ) improve outcome slow early response standard chemotherapy . IV . To prospectively collect information individual prognostic significance follow present factor : erythrocyte sedimentation rate , circulate level IL-10 , `` B '' symptoms - fever , night sweat , weight loss , nodal aggregate &gt; 6 cm , large mediastinal mass &gt; 1/3 thoracic diameter number involve nodal site , histology , albumin , blood count , sex age . V. To study reliability utility [ 18F ] -Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) Imaging ( PET scan ) image modality Hodgkin disease . VI . To determine frequency severity late effect therapy include thyroid dysfunction , infertility , cardiotoxicity , pulmonary toxicity second malignant neoplasm . VII . To serve therapeutic companion biology study Hodgkin disease correlate result response therapy , event free-survival overall survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . ARM I ( ALL PATIENTS-OFF THERAPY BEFORE CALLBACK-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY [ ABVE-PC ] ) : Patients receive doxorubicin intravenously ( IV ) 10-30 minute day 1-2 , bleomycin sulfate IV 10-20 minute subcutaneously ( SC ) vincristine IV day 1 8 , etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 , oral prednisone 2 3 time daily day 1-7 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) SC begin day 2 continue blood count recover ( G-CSF hold day 8 ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence progressive disease . At end initial chemotherapy , patient undergo evaluation response . Patients less 60 % disease reduction consider slow early response ( SER ) . Patients 60 % disease reduction consider rapid early response ( RER ) . RER : Patients receive 2 additional course ABVE-PC chemotherapy . After completion treatment , patient randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM II : Patients sustain complete response ( CR ) undergo involve field radiation therapy ( IFRT ) approximately 3 week last day ABVE-PC course 4 5 day week . ARM III : Patients sustain CR receive treatment . ARM IV : Patients good partial response ( VGPR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) undergo IFRT approximately 3 week last day ABVE-PC course 4 5 day week . ARM V : Patients progressive disease take therapy treat physician 's discretion . SER : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM VI : Patients receive dexamethasone IV 15 minute , etoposide IV 3 hour , cytarabine IV 3 hour day 1-2 , receive 2 drop dexamethasone ophthalmic solution every 6 hour day 1 , 2 3 . Patients also receive cisplatin PO IV 12 hour pre-hydration follow continuous IV 6 hour day 1 G-CSF SC begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 2 course , patient receive 2 additional course ABVE-PC chemotherapy . ARM VII : Patients receive 2 course ABVE-PC chemotherapy . In SER arm , patient sustain CR PR undergo IFRT approximately 3 week last course chemotherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
