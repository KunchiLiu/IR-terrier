	<brief_summary>This study collect brain tissue sample research purpose patient undergo surgery treat epilepsy . The standard surgical procedure medically intractable epilepsy i.e. , epilepsy control medicine require removal brain tissue need diagnostic study . This extra tissue , would otherwise discard , use research purpose . In addition , blood vessel scalp , call superficial temporal artery , also normally cut surgery , piece vessel take research use . Patients 4 year age old undergo surgery medically intractable epilepsy may eligible study . Brain tissue collect protocol use study brain cell diseases serotonin receptor . Any remain brain tissue frozen use future research . The superficial temporal artery use comparison carotid artery ( neck artery supply brain ) patient blockage blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol perform research study tissue remove operating room surgical procedure medically intractable epilepsy . Our aim acquire supply useful tissue specimens intramural NIH research project . The investigator free select patient undergo surgery . However , total number patient enrol protocol restrict . This protocol design test new treatment . Any treatment protocol base current standard care epilepsy surgery . The goal surgical procedure remove epileptic focus . Standard procedures perform 1 ) anterior temporal lobectomy 2 ) amygdalohippocampectomy temporal lobe epilepsy , 3 ) focal cortical resection epilepsy arises outside temporal lobe . These research aspects protocol : 1 ) Any brain tissue remove require diagnostic study use laboratory study , consistent institutional guideline . 2 ) Meningeal sample , dura , take examine tissue marker lymphatic vessel . 3 ) Blood test test immune inflammatory mediator perform . 4 ) Saliva collect test immune inflammatory marker . Participants protocol evaluate potential eligibility NINDS clinical trial develop . However , require enter protocol decision participate entirely voluntary . No 120 patient accept protocol .</detailed_description>
