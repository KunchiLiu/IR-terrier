	<brief_summary>This study collect biological samples-buccal cell , blood sample , skin sample-to use develop test laboratory method measure analyze gene . Such method use research identify genetic factor may affect person 's cancer risk . All individual age 21 older may participate study . Participants provide one follow sample : - Buccal ( mouth ) cell - obtain swish small amount mouthwash mouth swab bush inside cheek swab brush . - Blood - obtain pricking finger collect drop blood draw needle place arm vein . - Skin - obtain punch biopsy inner upper arm . For procedure , skin anesthetize small piece skin remove sharp instrument similar cookie cutter . The wound cover hold together sterile bandage . A small scar , approximately 1/8-inch long , leave . Most participant ask provide buccal sample ; blood and/or skin sample request participant . The blood skin sample may use grow cell line ; , make grow indefinitely research use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Specimen Collection Laboratory Methods Development Training Purposes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose two related activity involve collection biological sample . The first involve collection mouthwash sample 200 volunteer , assess feasibility pool sample quantitative genotype determination . For small number volunteer , also collect peripheral blood sample skin punch biopsy establishment lymphoblastoid fibroblast cell line . The blood skin sample use compare amount subcellular localization DNA repair protein lymphocytes ( cell commonly collect epidemiologic study ) fibroblast ( cell type commonly use assay development ) . In addition , conduct hands-on education training session molecular genetics member DCEG others . The hands-on education session aim non-laboratory scientist involve 6-9 hour demonstration participation basic molecular genetics technique . Participants option collect mouthwash sample , extract DNA , perform genotyping assay sample Laboratory Population Genetics Building 41 . After education session , biological sample reassign arbitrary number link personally identify information use laboratory method development .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All individual age 21 old eligible . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants volunteer previous DCEG study within past three year buccal blood sample collect excluded sample collect current study may combine previously collect sample duplication subject avoid . Individuals know active oral disease exclude buccal cell collection component , know form keloid exclude skin biopsy component .</criteria>
