	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know paclitaxel effective without carboplatin treating stage IV breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness paclitaxel without carboplatin treat woman stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With Without Carboplatin Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare objective response rate woman treat paclitaxel without carboplatin first-line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer . - Compare overall survival , time disease progression , duration response patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient population . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 3 week . - Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute weekly 3 week . Treatment arm continue every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , course study , completion study . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 220 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
