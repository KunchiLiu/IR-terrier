	<brief_title>Thalidomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Carcinosarcoma Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine antitumor cytostatic activity thalidomide , measure probability progression-free survival ( PFS ) least 6 month , patient recurrent persistent uterine carcinosarcoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . Secondary I . Determine partial complete response rate patient treated drug . II . Determine duration PFS overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine effect drug initial performance status histological grade patient . IV . Correlate serum plasma biomarkers , include vascular endothelial growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor , clinical outcome ( i.e. , PFS ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
