	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness leptin replacement therapy patient lipodystrophy ( also call lipoatrophy ) . Patients total partial loss fat cell . They also lack hormone leptin , produce fat cell . The leptin deficiency usually cause high blood lipid ( fat ) level insulin resistance may lead diabetes . Patients may hormone imbalance , fertility problem , large appetite , liver disease due fat accumulation . Patients age great equal 6 month significant lipodystrophy may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 10 day follow study begin 12 month leptin therapy : - Insulin tolerance test - Ultrasound liver , abnormality find , possibly liver biopsy . - Fasting blood test - Resting metabolic rate - Magnetic resonance image liver organ , muscle fat . - Pelvic ultrasound woman detect ovarian cyst . - Estimation body fat - Oral glucose tolerance test - Intravenous glucose tolerance test - Appetite level food intake - Hormone function test - Questionnaires assess activity mood - 24-hour urine collection Additional study may include blood test genetic study lipodystrophy , muscle biopsy study muscle protein involve regulate energy expenditure leptin replacement , examination surgical specimen ( available ) study molecule may involve energy storage use . When test complete , leptin therapy begin . The drug inject skin twice day 4 month day , feasible . The dose increase 1- 2-month visit . Follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 month therapy start include physical examination , blood test meet dietitian . At end 12 month , baseline study describe repeat . Patients record symptoms weekly throughout study . Those diabetes measure blood glucose level daily meal bedtime .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lipoatrophic diabetes syndrome characterized insulin resistance association paucity adipose tissue . Patients severe lipoatrophy die prematurely , typically complication diabetes liver disease . Experiments lipoatrophic mice suggest insulin resistance cause lack adipose tissue . Adipose tissue normally produce leptin , hormone increase insulin action . For last fourteen year , study extent leptin deficiency cause diabetes lipoatrophic patient . In fact , initial study see nearly 60 % amelioration fast glucose , triglyceride free fatty acid level 2 % actual decrease baseline HbA1c level 4 month leptin replacement therapy . This response continue sustain , continue follow patient receive leptin replacement therapy fourteen year . This open-labeled study . The study monitor safety efficacy recombinant methionyl human leptin ( A-100 ) replacement child adult . We look long-term effect leptin replacement extend therapy . In long-term replacement protocol , monitor metabolic control ( e.g . glucose , insulin , triglyceride level ) primary outcome measure . Ancillary study evaluate effect Metreleptin hormonal ax , growth development liver pathology . We continue evaluate efficacy broad leptin deficient population patient lipodystrophy . Current inclusion criterion patient great equal 5 year include female patient leptin level &lt; 12 ng/mL male patient leptin level &lt; 8 ng/mL . We continue seek patient meet criterion . In child age 6 month 5 year , use cut-off leptin level 6 ng/mL gender . Patients great equal age 5 year evaluate every 6 month first year therapy . If improvement see 6 month therapy , study medication may increase 150 % predict dose ( 0.09mg/kg/day male girl le 10 year age/ 0.12mg/kg/day female 10 year age old ) 6 month 1 year therapy . If improvement see increase 150 % predict dose , study medication withdrawn . If patient show improvement his/her metabolic parameter leptin , patient invite continue take study medication . The investigator strive patient respond leptin bring metabolic parameter normal range . The maximum dose leptin give 0.24 mg/kg/day female 10 old , 0.12 mg/kg/day male females less 10 year age . After first year treatment , patient evaluate every 6 month second year treatment , study period end . After two year treatment , extend treatment period annual basis decision patient , principal investigator Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMS ) /AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals ( AZ ) . Leptin supply BMS/AZ , currently available research study . Neither NIH BMS/AZ guarantee leptin available indefinitely and/or study end . However , leptin recently approve FDA February 25 , 2014 , use patient generalized lipodystrophy . All patient referral acceptance protocol , initiate physician/health care provider .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All ethnic group . Males female . Age great equal 6 month . Clinically significant lipodystrophy , identify study physician physical examination absence fat outside range normal variation and/or identify disfigure factor patient . Circulating leptin level less 12.0 ng/ml female less 8.0 ng/ml male measure Linco assay specimen obtain overnight fast . In child age 6 month 5 year , circulate leptin level less 6 ng/mL use . Leptin sample run Millipore Laboratories , use Linco Assay , assay previously use measure leptin level throughout study period . Presence least one follow metabolic abnormality : 1 . Presence diabetes define 2007 ADA criteria 1 . Fasting plasma glucose great equal 126 mg/dL , 2 . 2 hour plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dL follow 75 gram ( 1.75gm/kg ) oral glucose load , 3 . Diabetic symptom random plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dl 2 . Fasting insulin great 30 micro units/ml . 3 . Fasting hypertriglyceridemia great 200 mg/dL postprandially elevate triglyceride great 500 mg/dL fast clinically indicate ( e.g . infant ) Persons impair decisionmaking capacity may unable provide inform consent may participate study per discretion Principal Investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant woman , woman reproductive year use effective method birth control , woman currently nurse lactate within 6 week complete nursing . Exclusions underlie disease likely increase side effect hinder objective data collection : Known infectious liver disease Known HIV infection Current alcohol substance abuse Psychiatric disorder impede competence compliance Active tuberculosis Use anorexiogenic drug Other condition ( ) opinion clinical investigator would impede completion study Subjects know hypersensitivity E. Coli derive protein . Subjects acquire lipodystrophy hematologic abnormality neutropenia and/or lymphadenopathy</criteria>
