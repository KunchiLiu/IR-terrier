	<brief_summary>This study seek learn symptom severe mood dysregulation child adolescent age 7-17 . Children adolescent severe mood dysregulation ( SMD ) display chronic anger , sadness , irritability , well hyperarousal ( insomnia , distractibility , hyperactivity ) extreme response frustration ( frequent , severe temper tantrum ) . Researchers describe mood behavior child symptom use specialized testing brain imaging learn brain change associate disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A.Objective : The past decade see dramatic increase focus pediatric bipolar disorder ( BD ) , number child receive diagnosis escalate . Discussion center diagnostic boundary bipolar disorder , whether nonepisodic severe irritability developmental presentation mania . Beginning 2002 , work define specific phenotype [ severe mood dysregulation ( SMD ) ] include youth chronic angry mood behavioral outburst hyperarousal symptom . The purpose work examine similarity difference youth BD SMD , address nosological question whether diagnosis BD separate chronic angry mood behavioral outburst hyperarousal symptom similar present child adolescent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Before work begin , substantial debate , little evidence support either position . Over last decade , substantial progress suggest might best view separate condition , important question remain . In 2013 Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM ) add Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder , ( DMDD ) similar SMD share feature severe irritability . Future work need address relationship classic presentation BD ( protocol 00-M-0198 ) SMD , define protocol DMDD define DSM . Data suggest strong likelihood DMDD/SMD youth develop Major Depression . Thus , youth Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) ( without prior DMDD ) important comparison group . We examine developmental trajectory , phenomenology , behavioral correlate , underlie neural mechanism chronic irritability MDD youth . Our overall goal gain clearer understand course neurophysiology disorder inform treatment improve outcome child irritability depression . In order advance aim protocol 3 objective : 1. use longitudinal technique characterize clinical physiological manifestation irritability youth SMD DMDD , youth significantly irritable yet fall short fully meet criterion ( thus subthreshold DMDD ) . 2. identify follow longitudinally behavioral , neuropsychological , neurophysiological , neuroanatomical correlate DMDD , compare pediatric disorder bear similarity ( BD , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , MDD , subthreshold DMDD ) typically develop youth . 3. examine genetic familial correlate full sub-threshold SMD , DMDD , MDD . B . Study population : There 4 separate population study protocol : 1 . Children adolescents age 7-17 year old meet criterion SMD DMDD subthreshold DMDD . 2 . Healthy volunteer child adolescent age 7-17 year old 3 . Healthy volunteer adult age 18-25 year old . 4 . Children adolescents age 12-17 year old meet criterion major depressive disorder ( MDD ) C.Design : For child adolescent SMD full subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD , study outpatient characterization longitudinal follow-along design . Once determine eligible , individual come initial assessment , return 1-2-year interval age 25 clinical interview , behavioral task , structural functional MRI . For healthy volunteer child , adult parent healthy volunteer child , study outpatient cross-sectional study include clinical interview , behavioral task , structural functional MRI . For individual , genetic material saliva blood obtain protocol 01-M-0254 . D.Outcome measure : This study examine between-group difference clinical , behavioral , genetic , neuroanatomical , neurophysiological variable individual SMD full subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD , BD ( BD , see protocol 00-M-0198 ) , healthy volunteer . Children SMD full subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD may also compare feature disorder ( e.g . anxiety , depression ) study Dr. Daniel Pine protocol 01-M-0192 order elucidate difference SMD DMDD condition . Longitudinal clinical , behavioral , neuroanatomical data also obtain .</detailed_description>
