	<brief_title>Celecoxib Preventing Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether celecoxib decrease ultraviolet ( UV ) -induced erythema affect surrogate biomarkers potential neoplastic change participant Fitzpatrick type I-IV skin expose UV light . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Participants randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral celecoxib twice daily approximately 120 day . - Arm II : Participants receive oral placebo twice daily approximately 120 day . Skin biopsy UV-exposed site evaluate . Participants follow 5 week post-treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 participant ( 18 per arm ) accrue study within 8 month .</detailed_description>
