	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Thalidomide may stop growth prostate cancer stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining chemotherapy thalidomide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine docetaxel estramustine thalidomide treat patient prostate cancer previously treat hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Estramustine , Thalidomide Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat docetaxel , estramustine , thalidomide . - Determine safety toxicity regimen patient . - Determine efficacy regimen pain control patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral estramustine day 1-3 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 2 3 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily begin day 1 continue 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow monthly disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
