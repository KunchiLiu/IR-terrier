	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) examine relationship cognitive processing motor control determine whether part brain call premotor cortex essential imagining movement . TMS , describe , method brain stimulation temporarily inhibit brain function area underlie stimulator . Healthy right-handed normal volunteer may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , neurological examination , test finger dexterity . Participants perform sequential finger tap movement response series number ( stimulus ) display computer monitor . After 10 stimulus , ask finger tap last . They imagine finger tap movement ask finger tap last imagination . During exercise , participant undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation . For procedure , subject seat comfortably chair . A wire coil place scalp brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse pass brain . This generate small electrical current brain , briefly disrupts function brain cell stimulate area . The stimulation may cause twitch arm leg muscle . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer record device , use electrode attach skin tape . Subjects complete eight experimental block test . One block consist 20 experimental trial , trial last 10 second . Five pair TMS stimuli give per trial , pulse deliver short burst one second . After block , subject draw mark line paper , show much attention pay , much fatigue experiencing , well think execute task . Each TMS session take 3.5 hour . Before TMS session , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use determine proper placement TMS coil . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . For procedure , subject lie still narrow metal cylinder ( scanner ) 30 minute scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A high-level motor control often require complex process sensory information , likely correspond neural correlate mental imagery movement . Such cognitive aspect motor control may underlie cognitive function , mental calculation . The present transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) study aim characterize relation cognitive processing motor control . Based previous result neuroimaging experiment , hypothesize ability process information motor imagery would primarily associate dorsal lateral premotor context ( PMd ) well posterior parietal cortex . TMS use disrupt neural process limit brain structure coil short period time ( virtual lesion study ) . For proposal , 15 healthy subject perform number-guided motor execution/imagery task . Both task guide 10 visual number stimulus present rate 1.0 Hz . For test TMS stimulus , pair TMS stimulation deliver either M1 PMd100 ( ) 150 millisecond 5 visual number stimulus . The frequency TMS stimulation 1.0 Hz average short period time ( 10 second ) . Measurement accuracy task performance TMS stimulation compare sham condition . We expect TMS stimulation PMd interfere performance motor imagery performance motor execution . The present study clarify neural correlate underlie ability imagine movement , draw grow attention neuroscience community .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We recruit righthanded subject assess Edinburgh handedness inventory ( Oldfield , 1971 ) . We also administer simple version tap task ass dexterity select subject consistent digit skill require . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Contraindications TMS : pacemaker , implant medical pump , metal plate skull , metal object inside eye skull , history seizure . Contraindications MRI : pacemaker , brain stimulators , dental implant metallic brace , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , insulin pump , shrapnel fragment . Welders metal worker also risk injury possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . Subjects screen contraindication prior study . Subjects previous current neuropsychiatric disorder exclude . Patients MRI finding consistent organic brain lesion brain tumor , stroke , trauma exclude . Patients history significant medical disorder cancer exclude . Subjects capable give informed consent exclude . We scan pregnant woman MRI safety high magnetic field fetus establish . Therefore , administer urine pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential prior MRI scan . Brain function development stage scope particular experiment , , therefore , subject age 21 exclude . Subjects show evidence unusually increase cortical excitability may lead seizure activity detect surface EMG recording exclude study . Subjects always reveal muscle activity motor imagery task also exclude study .</criteria>
