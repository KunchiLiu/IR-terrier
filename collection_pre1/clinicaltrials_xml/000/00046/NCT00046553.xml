	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine function cortisol receptor post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Patients PTSD neurobiological dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis function . High corticotrophin release hormone ( CRH ) level decrease hippocampal volume major feature disorder . The mechanism responsible alteration know . This study evaluate function cortisol receptor determine role maintain PTSD HPA axis dysregulation . Three group subject take part study : Patients PTSD , healthy control subject expose trauma past remain healthy healthy control subject never traumatize At study entry , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) participant sample evaluate . Participants also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain well eye blink trace condition neuropsychological test . Participants admit Clinical Center two night three different occasion . At overnight visit , blood level stress hormone measure every hour 26 hour medication placebo give . This end study group healthy control subject , exception may ask repeat neuropsychologic eye blink test 12 week . Participants PTSD receive paroxetine 10 week . After 10 week participant reevaluate exactly way treatment ( except repeat MRI scan ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose investigate underlying mechanism account neurobiological dysregulation HPA axis function PTSD . Paradoxically , low normal plasma urinary cortisol despite high corticotrophin release hormone ( CRH ) level major feature disorder . Some investigator report decrease hippocampal volume patient PTSD . The mechanism responsible alteration know . One possibility patient PTSD increase number glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and/or increase GR sensitivity , cause hyper-suppression HPA axis . Another possibility high CRH level lead increase mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) level up-regulation MR responsible low cortisol secretion see PTSD . Elevated CRH level could also result reduced hippocampal volume . In order evaluate MR GR function , examine effect RU486 ( Mifepristone ; GR antagonist ) , spironolactone ( Aldactone ; MR antagonist ) , placebo , cortisol ACTH plasma level patient PTSD , trauma expose , non-trauma expose healthy control . The extent increase cortisol and/or ACTH administration antagonist reflect inhibition ordinarily impose GR MR. We also examine subject ' cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) , CRH level , hippocampal volume . Following evaluation , patient PTSD treat paroxetine 8 week . The assessment perform treatment repeat . The first aim present study elucidate pathophysiology PTSD examination role GR MR maintain PTSD HPA axis dysregulation . The second aim compare CSF CRH level across group effort extend previous finding determine whether CRH level PTSD high level trauma expose healthy subject . The present investigation also evaluate relationship CRH level PTSD , MR/GR function , hippocampal volume hippocampally-mediated cognitive task . Finally , examine effect long-term paroxetine treatment PTSD HPA axis function , hippocampal volume , hippocampally-mediated cognitive task .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 65 year age . Male female . Score great equal 50 ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale ( CAPS2 ) baseline measure PTSD symptom severity . Capable provide informed consent , obtain prior study procedure . Free psychotropic medication least 2 week , exclude shortterm hypnotic . Patients treat fluoxetine include medication free period least 8 week . Good physical health , confirm complete physical exam ( include normal vital sign ) , electrocardiogram , neurologic exam , routine laboratory test blood urine . However , patient participate research study blood work primary MD within last 6 month , result use instead repeat blood draw inclusion study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet DSMIV criterion substance abuse ( alcohol drug ) substance dependence within 6 month prior screen . The effect abuse/dependence phenomenology biology could mask exceed PTSD effect . Patients current risk homicide suicide . All additional DSM IV Axis I comorbidity , exclude secondary diagnosis major depressive disorder ( MDD ) anxiety disorder ( AD ) . Given high comorbidity disorder PTSD , since exclude patient would provide full spectrum disorder , patient axis I diagnose MDD AD precede onset PTSD exclude . Pregnant woman ( stage ) woman childbearing potential practicing clinically accept method contraception positive pregnancy test lactating . Blood donation ( 1 Red Cross Unit ) within 8 week precede study . This minimal safe period consecutive donation . Subjects well medication . Although recruit nonmedicated patient , decision stop medication take purely clinical ground . No subject take medication solely participate study . Unable comply study procedures assessment regard screen evaluation ( i.e . PTSD diagnosis , health requirement , etc . ) 3 hospitalization evaluation glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid receptor function . Subjects allergic mifepristone , paroxetine spironolactone , subject contraindication treatment agent ( describe current labeling ) , exclude participation study .</criteria>
