	<brief_summary>We seek male female patient voluntarily take part clinical research study . Patients must age 18 old diagnose symptomatic orthostatic hypotension ( low blood pressure upright position ) due Parkinson 's disease , multiple system atrophy , pure autonomic failure autonomic neuropathy ( i.e . neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ) . Symptoms low blood pressure include dizziness , lightheadedness , change vision generalize weakness upon stand . The main effect drug study increase blood pressure upright position symptom decrease . The purpose clinical study assess clinical effect high dose midodrine hydrochloride ( ProAmatine® ) , approve treatment orthostatic hypotension . During course study , participant receive either ProAmatine® placebo . Assessments make use questionnaire measure symptom activity level . Blood pressure lying , sit stand position measure . Patients also complete stand time assessment . They ask remain stand without move feel sufficiently lightheaded , dizzy , feel faint would feel comfortable sit .</brief_summary>
