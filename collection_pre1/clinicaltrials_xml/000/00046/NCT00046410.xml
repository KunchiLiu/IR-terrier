	<brief_summary>This study compare safety coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) without use heart-lung bypass surgery ( on- versus off-pump surgery ) . CABG carry risk stroke cognition problem ( problem think process ) may cause small stroke . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determine whether new technique off-pump CABG carry low risk stroke on-pump CABG . The study also evaluate relative risk ( risk stroke CABG patient expose follow factor compare CABG patient expose follow factor ) factor stroke cognitive problem , atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) , age , sex , pre-surgery intellectual function performance , previous stroke , chronic kidney failure , diabetes , high blood pressure , carotid artery disease ( narrow neck artery brain ) , peripheral blood vessel disease , micro embolism ( tiny blood clot travel brain ) . Patients 18 year age old chest pain narrow coronary artery schedule undergo CABG surgery may eligible study . Participants randomly assign CABG either on-pump off-pump . They undergo follow test procedure : - Tests cognitive neurological function surgery 6 month surgery - Blood test look cytokine ( substance indicate inflammation ) surgery , immediately surgery 1 day surgery - MRI scan detect stroke surgery , 1 day surgery 1 month surgery . MRI diagnostic test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . For procedure , patient lie table slide scanner-a metal cylinder surround magnetic field . Earplugs worn muffle loud knock sound occur picture take . The scan , take surgery , last 20 minute ; two surgery take 10 minute perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective - Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) hypothesize safe alternative conventional on-pump CABG , comparative risk benefit procedure neurological outcome establish prospective randomize testing . The primary objective study assess difference frequency new ischemic brain lesion patient randomize either on- off-pump CABG . We test hypothesis off-pump CABG associate small proportion patient new lesion MRI post-operatively . Secondary objective explore relationship image marker , blood marker , result cognitive test occurrence new ischemic lesion , estimate relative risk pre-operative factor . We also conduct observational substudy non-randomized heart surgery patient acquire complementary data estimate relative risk pre-operative operative factor occurrence new ischemic lesion . Study population - A total 140 patient ( 70 per group ) randomize . Subjects neurologically independent adult patient undergo non-emergency CABG appropriate either on- off-pump surgery . In observational study also assemble cohort 100 consecutive patient CABG 100 consecutive patient valve replacement surgery . Total accrual across study 340 patient . Design - The study prospective randomize single blind design . Patients randomize on- off-pump surgical technique meet eligibility criterion . Analyses perform blinded surgical group assignment base intention-to-treat principle . MRI evaluation perform prior surgery , 48 hour surgery , 30 day 6 month surgery . Biomarkers quantify blood drawn immediately surgery 6 , 24 , 48 72 hour post-operatively . Cognitive testing also perform 30 day 6 month surgery . Interim analysis 20 patient perform first 100 patient , stop rule highly significant difference observe primary outcome variable . Patients randomize post-operative scan clinical evidence post-operative stroke include sample primary analysis . Patients observational substudy undergo pre- post-operative evaluation patient RCT . Outcome measure - The primary outcome measure evidence new ischemic lesion 48-hour DWI 30-day DWI FLAIR , clinical evidence new stroke protocol require scan perform , determine 30 day surgery . The proportion patient group primary outcome variable test chi-square proportion . Secondary image outcome variable include number new lesion , total volume new ischemic lesion . Secondary outcome measure include cause mortality , encephalopathy , 30-day 6-month cognitive decline , evidence reperfusion injury 48-hour post-gadolinium FLAIR , new ischemic lesion 6-month DWI FLAIR , change value blood marker . The relationship among new ischemic lesion , cognitive decline , change blood marker explore . The association baseline variable prediction new lesion explore use multivariate logistic regression procedure .</detailed_description>
