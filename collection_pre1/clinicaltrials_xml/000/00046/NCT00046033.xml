	<brief_summary>The purpose study see adjust dose lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) well effect lower HIV viral load ( amount HIV blood ) compare take standard FDA-approved LPV/r dose . This study also compare safety tolerability two type dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Standard-Dose Versus Adjusted-Dose Lopinavir/Ritonavir Therapy HIV-Infected Persons With Drug Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral drug may fail suppress HIV unless adequate amount drug blood . By monitor amount drug blood adjusting dos achieve optimal drug concentration , response antiretroviral drug may improve , especially patient fail previous regimen . This study design evaluate drug monitoring dose adjustment protease inhibitor ( PIs ) heavily treatment-experienced patient . Patients randomize receive either standard dose LPV/r ( Arm A ) concentration-adjusted dose LPV/r ( Arm B ) . Concentration-adjusted dosing mean dose ritonavir lopinavir may increase base amount lopinavir measure blood result drug resistance test . All patient start study take LPV/r , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , 0 2 additional nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , saquinavir ( SQV ) amprenavir ( APV ) . Only LPV/r , TDF , SQV provide study . Other medication take part antiretroviral regimen must obtain outside study . Patients Arm A take usual approve dose LPV/r first 24 week . At Week 24 , patient high viral load come clinic 12-hour LPV blood level measurement see level LPV need increase . If , additional capsule ritonavir add regimen boost level LPV . Patients Arm B series blood draws 12-hour period clinic , around 14 day start study , find LPV level need increase . If LPV level need raise , additional capsule ritonavir add regimen boost level LPV . Patients ritonavir dose adjusted return another 12-hour blood draw around Week 5 . If LPV level still need change , additional capsule LPV/r add regimen . A third 12-hour blood draw perform around Week 8 second dose adjustment necessary . During study , patient visit clinic weekly Week 6 , Week 8 , every 4 week thereafter Week 32 . Patients blood drawn certain visit test LPV level , viral load , CD4 count , fast lipid glucose , drug resistance .</detailed_description>
