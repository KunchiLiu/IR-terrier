	<brief_title>Mapping Novel Disease Genes Dilated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) heritable , genetically heterogeneous disorder cause congestive heart failure . Current medical therapy minimal impact prognosis cardiac transplantation definitive treatment end-stage disease . The molecular cellular mechanism underlie DCM poorly define , importance single gene defect disease pathogenesis become increasingly apparent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The genetic epidemiology study identify novel dilate cardiomyopathy gene use genetic linkage mutational analysis . The first aim determine chromosomal location novel familial dilate cardiomyopathy gene . This accomplished genome-wide genotyping genetic linkage analysis three large family autosomal dominant dilate cardiomyopathy . Previously identify dilate cardiomyopathy gene exclude family . The second aim identify mutation novel gene cause familial dilate cardiomyopathy linkage sequence analyse candidate gene map dilate cardiomyopathy locus . Once novel gene familial dilate cardiomyopathy identify , third aim determine role gene large cohort unrelated patient familial sporadic dilate cardiomyopathy . High throughput DNA sequence analysis perform identify additional inherit de novo mutation .</detailed_description>
