	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There comprehensive database allow longitudinal examination neighborhood-level factor may interact individual characteristic predict incident case cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) all-cause mortality . This cross-institutional project join investigator Karolinska Institutet Sweden Stanford University , know expertise immigrant health social inequality CVD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine neighborhood social characteristic ( e.g. , neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ) , social disintegration , socioeconomic ethnic segregation , social capital ) , physical environment ( e.g. , geocoded asset include good service contribute health educational recreational resource ; barrier health include pollution , industry , waste dump , criminal activity , alcohol fast food outlet ) individual factor ( e.g. , SES , cardiovascular disease { CVD } risk factor , country birth social network ) may interrelate predict CVD [ morbidity mortality ] all-cause mortality . Data use newly create , comprehensive set Swedish database , MigMed MigSALLS . MigMed ( 1990-2002 ) include data entire Swedish population 6 million woman men age 25 old , 600,000 first generation immigrant . Their address geocoded , yield 9,677 neighborhood , reduce small number define unit cluster analysis . MigMed include annual assessment individual-level sociodemographic health indicator . Data also analyze MigSALLS ( 1988-2002 ) , include in-depth data face-to-face interview representative sample approximately 18,000 woman men age 25-74 , 2,000 first generation immigrant . MigSALLS contain similar individual- neighborhood-level factor MigMed , well extensive information factor may mediate relationship neighborhood CVD outcome ( e.g. , CVD risk factor smoke , weight , physical activity , blood pressure ) . Information two datasets match hospital death record ( 300,000 death 140,000 incidence case CVD expect 1988-2002 ) , thus create one large databases world involve men woman diverse SES level country origin .</detailed_description>
