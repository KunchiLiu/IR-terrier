	<brief_summary>Liposome Encapsulated SN38 ( LE-SN38 ) oncology drug product consist active metabolite irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) , know anticancer drug , encapsulate liposome . Formulation relatively insoluble compound ( SN38 ) improvement drug delivery ( pharmacodynamic profile ) may obtain liposomal formulation . An improved safety efficacy profile , compare pro-drug CPT-11 , may possible . This rationale support result animal toxicity study mouse dog . LE-SN38 infuse intravenously every 3 week assess safety tolerability study drug disease progression toxicity require early treatment discontinuation . Disease status assess every second cycle treatment . In event disease progression , study treatment discontinue , end-of-treatment study evaluation perform treatment option review .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) LE-SN38 . II . Determine plasma pharmacokinetics SN38 follow IV administration LE-SN38 . III . Observe anti-tumor effect LE-SN38 . PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This open-label study patient advance solid tumor fail conventional therapy . LE-SN38 administer IV 90 minute . At least three patient study dose level least three patient complete one 21-day course patient enrol next dose level . Study drug administration continue every 21-day schedule absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . A subsequent course treatment may administer least 21 day receive prior dose LE-SN38 study criterion meet . Cohorts 3 patient per dose level study . This expand 6 DLT occurs , follow total 6 patient possible MTD . Disease status assess every second cycle . In event disease progression , study treatment discontinue end treatment study evaluation perform . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 40 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
