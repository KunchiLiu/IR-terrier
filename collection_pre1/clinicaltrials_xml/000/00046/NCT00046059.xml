	<brief_summary>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) common behavioral disorder childhood , affect 3-5 % child age 7 17 . Family study suggest genetic component ADHD . Scientists believe complex disorder two gene may involve . Potentially eligible family ask give write consent participate ask complete questionnaire member family . In addition , interview administer parent minor enrol study determine eligibility study . This screen tool computerized take approximately 45 minute administer per child . Once screening complete , blood collection kit send family take local medical care provider , blood sample draw sent NIH . There cost family participate . We would like enroll entire family , parent child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder affect 5 % child worldwide . A study hypothesis Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) genetically influence brain disorder undertaken use two armed approach : 1 ) Isolated population analysis large , extend pedigree study do Colombia , South America population isolate call Paisa study last 7 year ; recently add second isolated USA Amish population Lancaster , Co Pennsylvania ; different background environmental influence , 2 ) U.S. base study nuclear family least one affected child least one sibling ( either affect unaffected ) , parent . Following careful phenotyping , DNA blood sample two genetically different group analyze genomewide scan linkage positional candidate approach search gene associate ADHD . In addition comparison genetic-environment interaction do two different population . Genetic influence modulate biological aspect cognition behavioral manifestation . The prefrontal cortex connection know play important role processing emotion impulsivity . It consider primary biological component brain circuit would explain main clinical characteristic present ADHD phenotype . Measurement brain metabolite region may useful phenotyping ADHD . Thus , identification specific genotype implicate ADHD risk Colombian population , subset already recruit individual , phenotyping include proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H MRS ) detect biochemical phenotype may correlate genetic marker ADHD . Additional analysis potential genetic-environment interaction do compare isolated population different environment . Identification biological marker use support confirm clinical diagnosis highly desirable .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : This study enroll family follow characteristic : 1 . Families child , seven 17 year age , diagnose ADHD ( define proband study ) . 2 . The probands sibling , either affect ADHD ( concordant ) unaffected ( discordant ) , seven year age , include adult sibling . 3 . The parent , mother father , enrol probands . 4 . The study enroll male female probands ethnic background race . The prevalence ADHD high male female , would expect high number male probands female probands . Both male female sibling male female parent probands enrolled . 5 . Adults may unable provide informed consent exclude . 6 . Probands one parent affect ADHD neither parent affect ADHD eligible . Probands bilineal family , family parent affect ADHD , exclude statistical reason . Additional inclusion criterion study include : 1 . Ability read understand spoken English , since questionnaire , scale , interview license use study English . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Some condition confound diagnosis ADHD . Probands follow condition exclude enrollment withdrawn study condition discover subsequent enrollment : Prematurity Neurological condition Cardiac surgery Prenatal drug exposure Hydrocephaly Mental Retardation ( IQ &lt; 80 ) Known genetic syndrome Known CNS disorder Known lead toxicity Tourette Disorder ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder Major Depression proband affect sibling Pervasive Developmental Disorder Age 7 year old Autism Other Psychoses Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Language Disorder ( know ) Severe Sensory Impairment ( visual hearing ) Probands following condition may include , condition note statistical analysis : Oppositional Defiant Disorder Conduct Disorder Tic Disorder Obsessive/Compulsive Symptoms Anxiety/Phobias Learning Disabilities</criteria>
