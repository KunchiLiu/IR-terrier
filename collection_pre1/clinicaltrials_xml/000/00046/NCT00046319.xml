	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind study evaluate effectiveness BSF 208075 treat patient moderate severe pulmonary hypertension . A four-week Screening Period follow 12 week Treatment . After subject qualifies study , subject randomize one four dos BSF 208075 ( 1.0 , 2.5 , 5.0 10.0 mg po qd ) . Subjects randomized 1.0 2.5 mg dose group receive respective dos BSF 208075 day throughout 12-week Treatment Period . Subjects two dose group begin treatment 2.5 mg per day two week dose increase 5.0 mg additional two week . After two week treatment 5.0 mg , subject randomize 10.0 mg dose group undergo final up-titration . After reach randomize dose level , subject receive assign dose throughout Treatment Period . Subjects remain randomized treatment Week 12 . In event subject tolerate study drug , dose adjustment permit Treatment Period . Upon completion 12-week Treatment Period subject either complete four-week Down-titration Period enter optional 12-week Open-label Extension .
