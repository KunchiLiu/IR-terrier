	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Research demonstrate men woman low extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) poorer function men woman without PAD . Preliminary data also indicate severe PAD baseline , measure ankle brachial index ( ABI ) , associate great incidence functional loss . However , pathophysiologic mechanism low extremity responsible PAD-related functional impairment functional loss well define . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cohort consist 790 individual identify three Chicago-area medical center , 500 PAD . Participants undergo baseline two annual follow-up visit . Pathophysiologic finding low extremity refer reduced muscle mass , reduce muscle quality , reduce peripheral sensory motor function . Quality muscle tissue define ratio muscle force muscle mass . Muscle mass measure Computed Tomography ( CT ) . Peripheral nerve function determine use surface electroneurography ( ENG ) . Lower extremity functional measure consist measure pertinent function daily live include six minute walk distance , seven-day physical activity level ( assessed accelerometer ) , walk speed , balance test , low extremity muscle power . The cross-sectional study test hypothesis ) chronic low extremity arterial ischemia associate specific pathophysiologic finding low extremity muscle nerve b ) ischemia-related pathophysiologic finding associate low extremity functional limitation.The longitudinal study test hypothesis ) great baseline low extremity arterial ischemia measure ABI associate great progression pathophysiologic finding two year follow-up b ) great ischemia-related pathophysiologic finding legs baseline associate great functional decline two year follow . Results use develop intervention design improve low extremity function prevent functional decline person PAD .</detailed_description>
