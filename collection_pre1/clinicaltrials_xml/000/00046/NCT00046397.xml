	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine call Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara ( MVA ) use smallpox virus . It also investigate many injection MVA need produce immunity vaccinia virus , closely related smallpox virus . An effective smallpox vaccine exist , cause side effect , rare occasion , life-threatening . The FDA give new license approval Dryvax 10/25/02 , use general population since smallpox eradicate worldwide . Both MVA Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccine make use vaccinia virus , however MVA vaccine contains attenuate , weaken , form virus . [ http : //www.fda.gov/cber/products/smalwye102502.htm ] Healthy normal volunteer 18 30 year age , never vaccinate smallpox vaccine , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , include HIV test pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . MVA , placebo Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) administer different method . The MVA vaccine placebo inject arm muscle needle syringe . The Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccine administer , many year , special fork needle poke lightly skin upper arm , usually 15 time , process call scarification . When vaccine work , small pus-filled blister form , follow scab scar site vaccination . The formation blister scab call take , indicate vaccine effective evidence development immunity . The development take suggest individual protect smallpox least year . If scarification take , either mean person already immunity vaccine work . Participants assign group , well , product randomly . For instance , first study participant could enrol group 3 . The Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) dose give challenge see person take . A reduced take response take , could suggest MVA able produce immune response . The dosing schedule vary 12 24 week volunteer study total 24 36 week , depend number injection . Participants observe least 1 hour injection . They come clinic week MVA placebo injection least twice week Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) 21 day injection site evaluate photographed . At visit , participant ask feel take medication . Blood urine test do injection day follow visit schedule 1 4 week immunization well 12 week Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) challenge dose . Additional test may do visit medically necessary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I/II , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , schedule find study MVA . The hypothesis MVA safe human administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection result immune response comparable observed Dryvax primary vaccination . The primary objective include : evaluate safety MVA administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection single multidose schedule identify schedule MVA provide clinical evidence protection vaccinia ( Dryvax ) challenge . The secondary objective compare immunogenicity Dryvax MVA measure vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody , ELISA , intracellular cytokine assay variola-specific neutralize antibody assay conduct CDC subset sample .</detailed_description>
