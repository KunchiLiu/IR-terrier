	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Epoetin beta may stimulate red blood cell production prevent control anemia patient treat chemotherapy radiation therapy . PURPOSE : Randomized phase IV trial determine effectiveness epoetin beta treat anemia patient receive cisplatin radiation therapy stage IIB , stage III , stage IVA cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Beta Treating Anemia Patients With Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effectiveness epoetin beta v standard care anemia management , term increase hemoglobin level correlation reduce relapse/treatment failure rate , patient stage IIB , III , IVA cervical cancer treat cisplatin radiotherapy . - Compare safety regimens patient . - Compare relapse-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare frequency localization relapse metastases patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare type , frequency , degree adverse event patient treat regimen . - Compare overall response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , parallel-group , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord country , disease stage , brachytherapy technique . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Patients also undergo high-dose rate , low-dose rate , boost brachytherapy . Patients receive cisplatin IV begin day 1 radiotherapy continue weekly 6 week . Patients also receive epoetin beta subcutaneously 3 time week begin 2 week radiotherapy continue 8 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy brachytherapy receive cisplatin arm I . Quality life assess baseline , last treatment , 3 month . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80-450 patient accrue study within 4-22.5 month .</detailed_description>
