	<brief_title>Protein Supplements Treat High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : At least 50 million adult Americans high BP , one important modifiable risk factor coronary heart disease , stroke , end-stage kidney disease . Nutrient intake relate development high BP , nutritional modification become important approach treatment prevention high BP . While effect sodium , potassium , alcohol BP study extensively , effect dietary macronutrients , protein , well study . Results study may provide justification recommend protein supplement prevention treatment high BP general population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study enroll 280 healthy participant BP level higher optimal stage-1 hypertension ( systolic BP 120-159 mm Hg diastolic BP 80-95 mm HG ) . Participants recruit mass mail worksite/community-based BP screen New Orleans , Louisiana , Jackson , Mississippi . Following two-week screening period , eligible participant receive either 40 gram soy protein , 40 gram milk protein , 40 gram complex carbohydrate ( control ) daily eight week . Following eight week , participant receive supplement three week . Participants repeat process two supplement . The primary outcome difference BP soy protein supplementation , milk protein supplementation , placebo control phase . In addition , change serum lipid ; waist hip circumference ; fast plasma insulin , glucose , leptin , homocysteine monitor examined term impact BP level .</detailed_description>
