	<brief_title>Leukotriene Polymorphisms Montelukast Response - Ancillary LoDo Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma common disease cause complex interaction genetic environmental factor . Asthma afflict 17 million Americans . In 1999 , 5000 person die asthma . Given significant mortality morbidity associate asthma , important continue develop new strategy intervention . Leukotriene antagonist think innovative approach asthma therapy 20 year . Despite demonstrated efficacy , safety popularity , leukotriene antagonist associate significant degree inter-patient variability response , limit safety , efficacy cost-effectiveness . Several polymorphism leukotriene pathway gene contribute variability response . The project determine polymorphism gene encode 5-lipoxygenase , leukotriene A4hydrolase , LTC4 synthase , multi-drug resistance protein 1 ( MRP1 ) LT1 receptor proteins determinant response montelukast treatment . The study response Request Applications entitle Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release NHLBI June 2000 conduct mechanistic study clinical trial related heart , lung blood disease . Specifically , initiative focus utilization patient patient material trial study mechanism underlie intervention , mechanism disease pathogenesis , surrogate marker biomarkers disease activity therapeutic effect mechanism human cardiopulmonary hematologic function . Studies aim accelerate development new technology within context mechanistic investigation also encourage . DESIGN NARRATIVE : DNA collect patient participate parent clinical trial entitle : Effectiveness Low Dose Theophylline Add-On Therapy Treatment Asthma ( LoDo Trial ) . 627 patient 19 Asthma Clinical Research Centers randomly assign receive placebo , low dose theophylline ( 300 mg/day ) montelukast , 10 mg daily , 6 month . Stepwise Linear Poisson regression perform outcomes include treatment genetic covariates , interaction term treatment arm genetic makeup . Polymorphisms highly associate response lead development genetic test identify patient likely benefit montelukast treatment . This information may lead individualization asthma medication base genetic make-up patient .</detailed_description>
