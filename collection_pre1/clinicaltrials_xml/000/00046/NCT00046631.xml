The research form ancillary study NHLBI-funded multi-centered Trial Activity Adolescent Girls ( TAAG ) , group ( school ) -randomized control intervention trial increase physical activity among cohort sixth grade girl 2.5 year . The parent TAAG study collect measure physical activity use self-report CSA accelerometer , small monitor wear hip record acceleration deceleration movement without need reporting participant . Using radius 5 mile around participate TAAG school around home study participant , investigator plan use geographic information system ( GIS ) gather information document proximity recreational facility , street design , population density , population mix ( ethnic/age distribution ) , crime , availability mass transit , neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ) , geographic elevation topography type land use . Using hierarchical linear modeling , girl nest within neighborhood , control individual level factor race socioeconomic status , plan investigate relationship environment individual physical activity . In addition , follow girl time , plan investigate whether effect TAAG intervention modify community characteristic .
