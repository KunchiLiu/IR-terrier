	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atherosclerosis major determinant coronary heart disease determine interplay genetic environmental risk factor . Although atherosclerosis tends aggregate family , exhibit classical Mendelian segregation . Thus , gene determine individual 's risk atherosclerosis likely involve multiple site within gene interaction gene , define genetic risk modify host environment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The genetic epidemiology study examines association common variation inflammation/thrombosis gene intermediate quantitative phenotype subclinical coronary atherosclerosis Coronary Artery Risk Factor Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) Study , large , bi-racial cohort study . The set 25 candidate gene involve pathway ( cytokine , chemokines , receptor ; cellular adhesion molecule ; , coagulation protein ) include several receptor-ligand pair . Using cladistic analysis resource Program Genomic Applications ( PGA ) , investigator identify limited set single nucleotide polymorphism ( range 3-10 SNPs per gene ) characterize common haplotype candidate gene within person African descent European descent . DNA CARDIA Year 10 examination ( n = 3,950 subject ) genotyped select variant characterize common haplotype . Data presence common variant haplotype incorporate CARDIA Study database . Levels two important intermediate phenotype , fibrinogen C-reactive protein ( CRP ) previously determine . Non-invasive assessment coronary atherosclerosis , define presence coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) , obtain CARDIA participant Year 15 exam . Analyses stratify race/ethnicity focus association common haplotype fibrinogen , CRP , CAC measure early adult life . Secondarily , investigator explore possible gene-gene gene-environment interaction . The propose multi-disciplinary collaboration enhance sensitivity specificity effort assess association common variation set inflammation/thrombosis candidate gene cardiovascular risk young adult .</detailed_description>
