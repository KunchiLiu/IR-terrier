	<brief_summary>This study determine family member patient xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) various abnormality , include : skin abnormality ; nervous system abnormality , hear problem ; skin , eye , internal cancer , change . XP rare inherited disease involve inability repair damage cell DNA ( genetic material ) . It affect several organ system , include skin , eye , nervous system , bone . Patients thousand-fold increase frequency major skin cancer . Parents patient XP carrier abnormal XP gene . Other family member may also carriers abnormal XP gene . Carriers develop disease ; symptom develop child inherit faulty gene parent . This study try clarify genetic basis XP understand increase frequency cancer disease . XP patient evaluate NIH Clinical Center relatives eligible study . Newly diagnose XP patient also eligible . Spouses relative also include control subject . Patients family member undergo follow procedure : - Parental permission review child relevant medical record pathology material treatment surgery cancer relate illness - Medical history physical examination , particular attention skin possible eye , hear neurological examination - Photographs document skin physical finding - Nuclear medicine scan evaluate brain nervous system - X-rays skull part body - Nervous system test electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , electroretinogram ( ERG ) , electromyogram ( EMG ) nerve conduction velocity measurement - Collection blood skin sample gene study - Establishment cell line collect blood tissue study DNA repair , skin cancer , cancer related XP , immune defect , related study . - Biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tissue ) suspicious skin lesion examination microscope - Collection cheek cell sample , obtain twirl soft brush inside cheek - Collection hair sample microscopic examination composition analysis - Surgery treat skin cancer lesion</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Xeroderma Pigmentosum ( XP ) rare , recessive disorder 1000-fold increase frequency major skin cancer association defective DNA repair . The risk skin cancer among normal appear XP heterozygote individual fully study . We plan study family member XP family know DNA repair gene mutation determine heterozygote carrier XP disease mutation increase risk develop cancer . For control compare XP heterozygote non-carrier blood relative spouses Surveillance , Epidemiology End Results ( SEER ) rate . For purpose , blood , skin buccal cell obtain available relative DNA RNA mutation analysis . Cancer confirmation accomplish review pathology report , medical record death certificate . In addition , willing family member clinically examine determine current cancer status . Individuals determine heterozygous carrier XP DNA repair gene disease mutation family mutation analysis pedigree compare non-carrier relative spouse respect history type cancer . We also focus skin cancer cancer nervous system since risk cancer elevate among XP homozygote .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Members XP family proband previously evaluate Clinical Center newly diagnose approve protocol ( primarily 99C0099 ) eligible participate study . Families XP patient age , gender race eligible study . On referral , family XP patient consider inclusion study proband clinical documentation feature XP laboratory determination DNA repair defect . All relative XP patient include spouse eligible participate . A spouse blood relative patient xeroderma pigmentosum would also eligible . Ability patient Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) sign write informed consent document EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability unwillingness provide family history information tissue ( skin , blood , buccal cell hair ) laboratory study .</criteria>
