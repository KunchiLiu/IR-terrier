	<brief_summary>This study determine dose Retavase safely combine ReoPro treat acute ischemic stroke ( stroke result blood clot brain ) . ReoPro Retavase currently approve Food Drug Administration treat heart problem cause blockage heart artery . The therapy approve Food Drug Administration treat ischemic stroke clot buster drug rt-PA . This treatment effective begin within 3 hour onset stroke , however , patient get hospital early enough benefit . Patients 18 80 year age mild moderate acute stroke 3 24 hour start study drug may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , rating neurological deficit cognition deficit problem walk result stroke , compute tomography ( CT ) scan head . CT involve use specialized X-rays obtain image brain . The patient lie table moved cylindrical machine ( scanner ) imaging study , usually take 5 10 minute . All participant receive 0.25 mg/kg ReoPro ( maximum dose 30 mg ) . The drug infuse vein 12 hour . Some patient also receive one four dos Retavase , may boost effectiveness ReoPro opening block blood vessel . Retavase give needle vein 2 minute . Patients monitor daily discharge hospital , day 5 , whichever early . Assessments include physical examination , blood test examine factor involve blood clotting , CT scan evaluate response treatment drug side effect . They return follow-up examination CT scan 30 day treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : This companion protocol ROSIE protocol . This clinical trial determine acceptable dose reteplase combination fix dose abciximab ischemic stroke 3-24 hour onset patient screen brain CT rather MRI ( require ROSIE protocol ) . The importance study relative ROSIE relevance large proportion acute stroke patient screen MRI , contraindication unavailability emergency MRI hospital . Study Population : Patients select criterion minimize likelihood toxicity maximize likelihood response . These criterion include age 18-80 year old , patient get acute MRI contraindication unavailability MRI , acute ischemic stroke moderate severity ( NIH Stroke Scale less equal 16 ischemic change CT scan less approximately one third volume middle cerebral artery territory ) , evidence hemorrhage CT , clinical , radiological laboratory feature associate increase risk hemorrhage thrombolytic therapy . Design : The study open-label , dose escalation , safety proof principle study combination intravenous abciximab reteplase . A fixed dose abciximab use patient : 0.25 mg/kg bolus ( maximum 30 mg ) follow 0.125 microgram/kg/minute infusion ( maximum 10.0 microgram/minute ) 12 hour . The five dose group reteplase dose 0U , 2.5 U , 5.0 U , 7.5 U , 10.0 U . A maximum 72 patient treat use adaptive statistical design . Non-investigation patient management standardize across patient accord NIH Stroke Center Clinical Care Pathway . Outcome Measures : The primary efficacy endpoint response clinical improvement ( complete recovery improvement 4 point NIH Stroke Scale ) 24 hour start therapy . The primary safety endpoint determination toxicity one following : symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) , major systemic hemorrhage , serious adverse event relate study drug administration , include death , within 48 hour start therapy . The maximum acceptable rate toxicity 10 % patient treat dose level minimum acceptable rate response 50 % patient dose level . The outcome monitor Data Safety Monitoring Committee , authority stop recommend modification trial safety concern . Other clinical outcome variable image variable record analyzed secondary exploratory analysis . If acceptable dose identify , investigated subsequent randomize placebo-controlled trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients may enrol study meet follow criterion : Diagnosis acute ischemic stroke onset 3 24 hour prior plan start study drug . Acute ischemic stroke define measurable neurological deficit sudden onset , presume secondary focal cerebral ischemia , otherwise attributable ICH another disease process . Stroke onset defined time patient last know without new clinical deficit . Patients whose deficit worsen last 24 hour eligible first symptom start 24 hour . If stroke start sleep , stroke onset recorded time patient last know intact . A careful history important determine patient last without present deficit . Disabling neurological deficit attributable acute stroke start study drug . NIHSS less equal to16 Age 18 80 year , inclusive . Patients evaluable ROSIE protocol MRI contraindication MRI unavailability technically inadequate diffusion perfusion MRI . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients exclude study follow reason : General Current participation another study investigational drug device within , prior participation present study , plan participation another therapeutic trial , prior final assessment trial . Time interval since stroke onset le 24 hour impossible determine high degree confidence . Symptoms suggestive subarachnoid hemorrhage , even CT scan negative hemorrhage . Evidence acute myocardial infarction define least two follow three feature : 1 ) Chest pain suggestive cardiac ischemia 2 ) EKG finding ST elevation great 0.2 mV 2 contiguous lead , new onset leave bundle branch block , ST segment depression , Twave inversion 3 ) Elevated troponin I Women know pregnant , lactate positive indeterminate pregnancy test . Patients would refuse blood transfusion medically indicate Stroke Related Neurological deficit lead stupor coma ( NIHSS level consciousness score great equal 2 ) . High clinical suspicion septic embolus . Minor stroke nondisabling deficit rapidly improve neurological symptom . Baseline NIHSS great 16 . MRI/CT Related Evidence acute chronic ICH head CT. CT evidence nonvascular cause neurological symptom . Signs mass effect cause shift midline structure . Patient exclude ROSIE protocol MRI finding . Acute ischemic change CT large approximately one third territory middle cerebral artery territory qualitative assessment . Safety Related Persistent hypertension systolic BP great 185 mmHg diastolic BP great 110 mmHg ( mean 3 consecutive arm cuff reading 2030 minute ) , control antihypertensive therapy require nitroprusside control . Anticipated need major surgery within 72 hour start study drug , e.g. , carotid endarterectomy , hip fracture repair . Any intracranial surgery , serious head trauma ( head injury require hospitalization ) , stroke within past 3 month . Stroke within past 3 month . History ICH time past . Major trauma time stroke , e.g. , hip fracture . Blood glucose great 200 mg/dl . Presence history intracranial neoplasm arteriovenous malformation . Intracranial aneurysm , unless surgically treat great 3 month . Major hemorrhage past 21 day . Major surgery , serious trauma , lumbar puncture , arterial puncture noncompressible site , biopsy parenchymal organ last 14 day . Major surgical procedure include limited following : major thoracic abdominopelvic surgery , neurosurgery , major limb surgery , carotid endarterectomy vascular surgery , organ transplant . For nonlisted procedure , operate surgeon consult assess risk . Presumed documented history vasculitis . Known systemic bleeding disorder , e.g. , von Willebrand 's disease , hemophilia , others . Platelet count le 100,000 cells/mL . Congenital acquire coagulopathy ( e.g. , secondary anticoagulant ) cause either follow : 1 . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) prolongation great 2 second upper limit normal local laboratory , except due isolated factor XII deficiency . Protamine sulfate reversal heparin effect alleviate criterion . 2 . INR great equal 1.4 . Patients receive warfarin prior entry eligible provide INR le 1.4 warfarin safely discontinue least 48 hour . Potentially Interfering Outcome Assessment Life expectancy le 3 month . Other serious illness , e.g. , severe hepatic , cardiac , renal failure ; acute myocardial infarction ; complex disease may confound treatment assessment . Serum creatinine , AST ALT great 3 time upper limit normal local laboratory . Drug Related Treatment qualify stroke thrombolytic GPIIbIIIa inhibitor outside protocol . Any administration thrombolytic drug prior 7 day . Treatment qualify stroke intravenous heparin unless aPTT prolongation great 2 second upper limit normal local laboratory prior study drug initiation . Treatment qualify stroke low molecular weight heparinoid . Previous administration abciximab , know . Known allergy murine protein . Anticoagulation cause herbal therapy .</criteria>
