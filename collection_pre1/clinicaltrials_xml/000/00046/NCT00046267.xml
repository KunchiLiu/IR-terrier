	<detailed_description>Lipid disorder common among patient HIV tend worsen potent antiretroviral therapy . Lipid-lowering drug always effective , data address interaction antiretroviral drug lipid-lowering agent . Additional agent treatment lipid metabolism disorder HIV-infected patient need . Niacin , highly effective similar lipid disorder general population , may effective treat lipid disorder patient HIV . This 48-week study consist two step . In Step 1 , patient begin lipid-lowering diet exercise regimen continue throughout study . After 4 week regimen , patient enter Step 2 study begin extended-release niacin therapy . During Step 2 , niacin dose-escalated every 4 6 week 16-week period . At Weeks 14 20 , niacin dose determine blood fat level . Patients remain dose set Week 20 remainder study . If blood test take Week 24 show blood fat level improve significantly , patient option add another fat-lowering drug therapy . Patients visit clinic entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Patients may ask come clinic Weeks 14 20 receive additional study drug . Patients must fast 8 12 hour screen visit study visit blood drawn . Blood drawn throughout study fat , sugar , insulin test CD4 CD8 cell count .</detailed_description>
