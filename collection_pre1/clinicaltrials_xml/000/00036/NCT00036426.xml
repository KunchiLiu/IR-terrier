	<brief_title>Idiotype Vaccine Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess ability active immunotherapy induce tumor regression relapse low-grade lymphoma . B-cell malignancy express unique antigen , immunoglobulin idiotype ( Id ) , surface . Each B-cell harbor unique genetic sequence use production immunoglobulin idiotype . B-cell lymphomas arise clonal expansion single B-cell tumor cell express unique Id protein . No normal B-cells posse Id cell surface . Hence , Id protein serve ideal target individualize active immune therapy NHL . Many antigen express tumor ( include Id ) weak immunogen . To augment immune response Id , Id protein must chemically couple strongly immunogenic protein . Keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) commonly use protein carrier capable augment body 's immune reaction Id protein . While initial study report predominately humoral ( antibody ) response , cellular immunity ( T-cells ) also play critical role anti-tumor immunity . GM-CSF hematopoietic growth factor stimulate T-cell proliferation .</detailed_description>
