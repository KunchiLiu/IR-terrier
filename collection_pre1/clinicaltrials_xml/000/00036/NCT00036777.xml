	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose , dose limit toxicity toxicity UCN-01 combine carboplatin . II . Preliminarily evaluate antitumor effect combination carboplatin UCN-01 . III . Determine pharmacokinetics UCN-01 carboplatin . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive carboplatin IV 1 hour follow UCN-01 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos carboplatin UCN-01 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
