	<brief_summary>Diffuse pontine glioma tumor pons portion brainstem . Their peak incidence child 5 10 year old . Their location make surgical resection impossible . Most patient treat radiation , typically delay progression tumor median time 6 month ; median survival time le 1 year . The addition chemotherapy improve outcome . Alpha , beta , gamma interferon use treat malignant brain tumor , mixed result . Different dos different method administration study . Alpha interferon usually give high dos 2 3 time week , serious side effect dose . Recent study show administer chemotherapy frequently small dos ( metronomic ) may better effect tumor . PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) form interferon alpha combine monomethoxy polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . It longer half-life interferon alone , administered week , long half-life reduces peak trough blood level . This study enroll 32 patient age 21 . The primary goal study determine difference 2-year survival rate patient treat radiation alone treat radiation follow PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) define toxicity PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) study dos . Secondary goal evaluate various magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques noninvasive monitoring change brainstem evaluate neuropsychological function . In study , PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) administer subcutaneously week low dos ( 0.3 microgram per kilogram body weight ) 4-week cycle . The cycle repeat indefinitely progression disease serious side effect develop . For less severe effect , dose lower patient may remain study . For severe effect , dose discontinue . Patients study may receive supportive medication may receive form chemotherapy . Patients caregiver instructed inject drug . Patients and/or caregiver ask maintain diary documenting dose , site administration , side effect . The diary review National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) visit . Patients return NCI cycle 2 3 . If significant side effect , patient may return NCI every cycle , indefinitely ( i.e. , cycle 5 , 7 , 9 , etc. ) . Patients undergo follow test procedure : - Physical examination , include neurologic exam , monthly - Complete blood count , differential , platelet count weekly cycle 1 every 2 week thereafter severe side effect occur - Blood chemistry weekly cycle 1 every 2 week thereafter severe side effect occur - Endocrine function test cycle - Urinalysis cycle - MRI brain cycle 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , every month ; patient may also proton magnetic spectroscopic image performed time MRI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Pegylated Interferon Alfa 2b ( PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) ) Children With Diffuse Pontine Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Children diffuse pontine glioma dismal prognosis . Because surgery area difficult , radiation therapy mainstay treatment . Although child may improve clinically radiation therapy , effect short-lived almost progress within several month . Chemotherapy significant impact survival . Interferon-alpha cytokine study patient gliomas demonstrated activity prior clinical trial . Objectives : - To compare 2-year survival pediatric patient diffuse pontine glioma receive weekly subcutaneous low-dose pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-Intron [ TM ] ) injection standard radiation therapy versus historical control receive radiation therapy alone . - To define toxicity weekly low-dose pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-Intron ( Trademark ) ) pediatric patient . Eligibility : Age : Patients must less equal 21 year age . Histological Diagnosis : Histologic confirmation require study . Patients must diffuse pontine glioma diagnose MRI criterion . Radiologic Appearance : Patients must diffuse intrinsic tumor epicenter presume pons . The T-2 weight sequence must reveal diffuse signal abnormality involve least 50 percent pons . Prior Therapy : The patient must receive adequate radiation therapy . Radiation must complete 2-10 week prior start treatment Peg-Intron [ TM ] . Design : In study , plan administer pegylated interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-Intron [ TM ] ) subcutaneously week pediatric patient diffuse pontine glioma complete radiation therapy . The endpoint trial 2-year survival compare historical control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Patients must less equal 21 year age . Histological diagnosis : Histologic confirmation require study . Patients must diffuse pontine glioma diagnose magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) criterion . Radiographic Appearance : Patients must diffuse intrinsic tumor epicenter presume pons . The T2 weight sequence must reveal diffuse signal abnormality involve least 50 percent pons . Prior therapy : The patient must receive adequate radiation therapy . ( Radiation must complete 210 week prior start treatment PegIntron ( TM ) . Performance status : Patients Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ( see ) . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheel chair consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . ECOG Performance Status : ScoreClinical Status 0Asymptomatic 1 . Symptomatic , fully ambulatory 2 . Symptomatic , bed less 50 percent day 3 . Symptomatic , bed great 50 percent day bedridden 4 . Bedridden Hematological function : Patients must adequate bone marrow function define peripheral absolute granulocyte count great 1000/mm^3 , hemoglobin great 8 gm/dL , platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . Patients may transfuse red blood cell ( RBC 's ) platelet achieve parameter . Hepatic function : Patients must adequate liver function , define total bilirubin le 2.5 time upper limit normal , direct bilirubin within normal limit , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 2.0 time upper limit normal . Patients Gilbert Syndrome exclude total direct bilirubin requirement . ( Gilbert Syndrome find 310 percent general population characterize mild , chronic hyperbilirubinemia absence liver disease overt hemolysis . ) Renal function : Patients must ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( see ) OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 . Age ( Years ) Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) less equal 50.8 great 5 less equal 101.0 great 10 less equal 151.2 great 151.5 Steroids : Patients steroid must stable decrease dose steroid great equal 1 week prior study entry . Informed consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year old ) DPA must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study . When appropriate , pediatric patient include discussion order obtain verbal assent . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : Assignment DPA family member guardian offer patient 18 21 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know suspected neurofibromatosis1 Patients receive prior chemotherapy , include radiosensitizers , currently receive investigational chemotherapeutic agent Patients know hypersensitivity interferonalpha Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude effect pegylated interferon alfa2b ( PEGIntron ( TM ) ) unborn fetus unknown . Patients clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( include autoimmune disease , serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) judgment Principal Associate Investigators would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy likely interfere study procedure result .</criteria>
