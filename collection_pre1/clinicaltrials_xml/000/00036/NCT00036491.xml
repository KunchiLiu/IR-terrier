	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness rituximab ( anti-CD20 ) treat systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . White blood cell body call B cell give substance active promote SLE disease . Researchers find anti-CD20 block production substances another disease . This study explore whether anti-CD20 also safe people SLE whether may effective treat SLE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>B cell clearly play essential role pathogenesis SLE since produce autoantibody . Clinical observation support contention intervene production autoantibody B lymphocyte effective therapy . Current approve therapy B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma include anti-CD20 . The result anti-CD20 administration SLE anticipate similar lymphoma patient . The current proposal explore mechanisms applicability B-cell depletion potential treatment SLE . Participants receive 4 weekly infusion study medication . Each participant enrol study total 1 year protocol visit weekly first 3 month , every week next 2 month , every month next 4 month , every month remain 5 month study ( Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 27 , 31 , 39 , 47 , 55 ) . Responses exogenous antigen measure ; assessment clinical response SLE-disease activity score ( SLEDEI ) systemic lupus activity measure ( SLAM ) score perform . Participants complete health questionnaire health survey laboratory parameter evaluate .</detailed_description>
