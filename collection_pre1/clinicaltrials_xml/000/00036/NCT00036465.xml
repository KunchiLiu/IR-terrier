	<brief_summary>This study look people take anti-HIV drug still detectable level HIV . The purpose study find happens people change anti-HIV drug viral load reach 200 copy compare change anti-HIV drug viral load reach 10,000 copy . This study also look drug resistance ( well HIV respond drug ) , viral fitness ( well drug-resistant HIV copy ) , immunologic reconstitution ( well immune system recognize various infection , include HIV ) . Many patient experience virologic relapse ( increase viral load sustain viral load suppression ) within 1 2 year take anti-HIV drug . The approach treatment patient experience virologic relapse highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) define . Current guideline recommend switch new treatment regimen soon possible prevent HIV become even resistant anti-HIV drug . However , evidence patient benefit stay HAART drug , even virologic relapse . This study want find happens drug change immediately virologic relapse ( viral load lower ) compare happen drug change delay ( viral load high ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Changing HIV Therapy Lower Versus Higher Viral Loads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Virologic relapse occur within 1 2 year antiretroviral therapy 50 percent HIV-infected individual . The best treatment approach patient experience virologic rebound highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) define . Current guideline recommend switch new treatment regimen shortly virologic rebound effort avoid sequential accumulation multiple resistance mutation . However , early treatment switch numerous disadvantage : risk virologic rebound new therapy , limited number drug combination available treat rebound , difficulty obtain early genotypic phenotypic drug-resistance information guide treatment modification . Delaying switch new antiretroviral regimen advantage preserving future treatment option , HIV level may remain partially suppress even drug-resistant mutant emerge . Moreover , several observational study describe maintenance immunologic clinical benefit HAART even virologic rebound . Delayed treatment switch , however , raise concern sequential accumulation drug resistance mutation may diminish chance viral resuppression successive HAART regimens , long-term immune consequence virologic rebound HAART known . It therefore important evaluate viral immunologic response among patient randomize either early delay HAART switch . This study enroll patient viral load least 200 , less 10,000 copies/ml . The patient randomize 2 treatment arm . Arm A ( immediate switch ) patient genotypic resistance test entry . Based resistance test result , antiretroviral treatment regimen modify switch treatment regimen . Switch treatment initiate later Week 4 . Arm B ( delay switch ) patient continue current antiretroviral regimen genotypic resistance test plasma HIV-1 RNA level reach 10,000 copies/ml great . Based resistance test result , antiretroviral treatment regimen modify switch treatment regimen . Switch treatment initiate later 4 week date least 10,000 copies/ml viral load , date absolute CD4 count reduce 20 percent baseline value . Patients never meet switch criterion remain study . All patient follow minimum 48 week entry . No antiretroviral drug provide study .</detailed_description>
