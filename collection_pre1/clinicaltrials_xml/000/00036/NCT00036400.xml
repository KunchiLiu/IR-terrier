	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Safety Epoetin Alfa Administered Weekly Patients With Gastric Rectal Cancers Undergoing Treatment Plan Preoperative Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy , Followed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient often experience anemia due disease , chemotherapy , . Quality life also affect , part fatigue associate anemia . Previous study epoetin alfa suggest achieve high hemoglobin level may improve quality life help patient live longer . The primary objective study demonstrate effectiveness safety epoetin alfa reduction red blood cell transfusion need gastric rectal cancer patient undergo preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy ( chemoradiation ) , follow surgery . The purpose study ass effectiveness 40,000 60,000 Units epoetin alfa match placebo inject skin weekly 16 week ( start 1 week chemoradiation extend 4 week surgery ) reduce red blood cell transfusion 16-week period . Other effectiveness measure include ability epoetin alfa maintain baseline hemoglobin level chemoradiation effect quality life tumor response study period . The safety epoetin alfa assess incidence severity adverse event , clinical laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign . The hypothesis study epoetin alfa superior placebo reduce number transfusion , prevent anemia improve quality life chemoradiation , surgery , immediately surgery . 40,000 60,000 Units epoetin alfa placebo inject skin weekly 16 week . First 4 week dose 40,000 Units ; increase 60,000 Units weekly start week 4 chemoradiation hemoglobin decrease &gt; =1 g/dL and/or &lt; =13 g/dL 4 week treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must confirm diagnosis gastric cancer rectal cancer treatment plan preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy , follow surgery life expectancy great 6 month baseline hemoglobin value &gt; = 10 g/dL &lt; 15 g/dL adequate hematologic function adequate liver kidney function female , must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , practice effective method birth control . Rectal cancer patient receive chemotherapy gastric cancer patient receive two cycle chemotherapy anemia due factor cancer chemotherapy ( e.g. , iron , vitamin B12 folate deficiency , hemolysis gastrointestinal bleeding ) history major medical condition uncontrolled disease transfusion white blood cell pack red blood cell within one month prior study entry administration androgen ( male sex hormone ) therapy within 2 month study entry receive prior treatment epoetin alfa investigational form erythropoietin within previous six month .</criteria>
