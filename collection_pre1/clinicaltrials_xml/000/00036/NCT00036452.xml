It also determine health care professional oversee weekday dose help people control HIV infection . The study compare take three-drug combination twice day versus take three-drug combination day .

	<brief_title>A Study Compare Anti-HIV Drugs Given Twice Day Once Day , With Without Direct Observation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While many factor contribute success failure antiretroviral therapy HIV , among important factor influence adherence treatment regimen , duration therapy , dose frequency , pill burden , side effect , patient behavior . Inconsistent adherence nonadherence antiretroviral therapy result suboptimal drug exposure . Suboptimal drug exposure , turn , impact short- long-term patient outcome increase likelihood drug resistant HIV mutant subsequent virologic clinical failure . It therefore essential design treatment regimens promote long-term adherence potent antiretroviral therapy . This study evaluate relative contribution reduced-frequency dose directly observe therapy magnitude durability virologic suppression patient treat potent antiretroviral therapy . Patients randomly assign one three study arm . Arms A , B , C receive daily dosage lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , emtricitabine ( FTC ) , stavudine extend release ( d4T XR ) tenofovir DF ( TDF ) . In Arm A , drug self-administered 48 week ; LPV/r take twice daily FTC d4T XR TDF daily . In Arm B , drug self-administered daily 48 week . In Arm C , drug take day directly observe therapy Weeks 0-24 , self-administration Weeks 25-48 . Adherence regimen measure use electronic drug monitoring system . Viral load , CD4 CD8 T cell response , population pharmacokinetics , quality life indicator measure throughout study . The tolerability safety treatment regimen also monitor .</detailed_description>
