	<brief_summary>The purpose study see magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) use detect damage mitochondrion HIV-infected patient take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) drug . HIV-infected patient take NRTI drug may increase chemical blood call lactate . High lactate level may damage energy source cell ( mitochondrion ) . Damage mitochondrion may cause lactic acidosis , liver failure , problem . It important find effective way see mitochondria HIV-infected patient damage . This study see MRS use determine mitochondrial damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity implicate fatal case lactic acidosis liver failure . In addition , investigator believe NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity culprit development peripheral neuropathy lipodystrophy HIV-infected patient . There need sensitive , reproducible , noninvasive marker mitochondrial dysfunction . To date , available noninvasive marker lactate , lactate test insensitive significance reproducibility lactate level HIV-infected population questionable . Spectroscopy promise useful alternative evaluation vivo effect NRTIs mitochondrial function . Prior screen visit , HIV-infected participant must fast least 12 hour refrain exercise least 24 hour . At screen visit , participant blood drawn lactate measurement test hepatitis B C. HIV-uninfected participant HIV test . Women able become pregnant pregnancy test . Prior entry visit , HIV-infected participant must fast 12 hour refrain exercise 3 day . At entry visit , participant blood drawn lactate measurement woman repeat pregnancy test . Participants MRS scan , take approximately 60-80 minute .</detailed_description>
