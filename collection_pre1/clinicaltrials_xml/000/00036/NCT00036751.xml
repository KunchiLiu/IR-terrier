	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate ( confirm , complete , partial ) patient platinum- taxane-refractory stage III IV ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer treat imatinib mesylate . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Correlate , preliminarily , CD117 platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression level response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
