	<brief_title>TLK286 Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 12-month survival patient advance non-small cell lung cancer treat TLK286 . II . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine objective response rate , duration objective response , time tumor progression , disease stabilization patient treat drug . IV . Determine safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive TLK286 IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 week 1 year every 12 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 55 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
