	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Microwave thermotherapy kill tumor cell heat several degree body temperature . Combining chemotherapy microwave thermotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy without microwave thermotherapy surgery treat woman locally advance breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Microwave Thermotherapy Before Surgery Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare safety efficacy neoadjuvant therapy comprise cytoreductive doxorubicin cyclophosphamide without focus microwave thermotherapy woman locally advance breast cancer intact breast . - Evaluate percentage patient achieve least 85 % pathological cell death treatment focus microwave thermotherapy . - Compare clear pathology tumor margin reduction second incision rate patient treat regimen . - Compare amount surgically remove breast tumor tissue patient treat regimen . - Compare measurement extent tumor margin patient treat regimen . - Compare reduction tumor size patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor size ( T2 v T3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 15 minute doxorubicin IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . During course 1 2 , patient undergo focus microwave thermotherapy day 1 chemotherapy ( within 36 hour chemotherapy ) . Patients undergo ultrasound-guided placement microwave sensor temperature probe ( compression breast ) external placement 2 large oppose microwave emitter 7 skin temperature sensor compress breast . Patients receive focus microwave thermotherapy slowly heats primary breast tumor deep proximal breast tissue . In absence unacceptable toxicity , target tumor temperature 43-47Â° C reach maintain equivalent thermal dose 80-120 minute . - Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I . Within 60 day completion thermochemotherapy chemotherapy alone , patient arm undergo total mastectomy , partial mastectomy , breast-conserving surgery , appropriate . At discretion physician , begin completion chemotherapy , patient arm estrogen receptor positive may receive oral tamoxifen . Within 4 week completion chemotherapy surgery , eligible patient arm also undergo radiotherapy breast lymph node . Patients follow 30 90 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 280-312 patient ( 140-156 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
