	<brief_summary>This study examine relationship cerebral hemisphere control muscle side body ( ipsilateral control ) . One good way study relationship record electroencephalogram ( EEG ) activity directly cortical surface . Because patient epilepsy surgical candidate already undergo monitor subdural and/or depth electrode , present opportunity study ipsilateral control . Studying electrocorticographic ( ECoG ) activity associate simple voluntary movement patient would disturb ongoing monitor nearby area brain , would endanger patient . Ten patient , may child adult , recruit study . Brain activity measure move corner mouth finger , wrist , arm , foot . The baseline measurement do scalp electrode . Once subdural electrode place , second set measurement do . Surface EMG electrode place muscle whose movement test . The test do 3 separate day , session longer 2 hour , patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Coupling Cortico-Cortical Cortico-Muscular Connections During Motor Movements : An Electrocorticographic Study Ipsilateral Motor Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A corticomuscular functional relationship well addressed literature term control exert primary motor region cerebral cortex contralateral extremity ( Mima Hallet 1999 ) . However , relationship cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral motor control well understood . We hypothesize cortical motor control region ipsilateral extremity locate Brodmann 's area 6 . There several method use study relationship term cortical region involve : coherence , correlation , event-related desynchronization synchronization . Cortical EEG activity associate contralateral limb activity stimulation usually large associated ipsilateral limb activity . Furthermore , activity scalp ipsilateral motor activity small difficult identify compare occur contralaterally . Recording response directly cortical surface would improve ability identify activity . An occasion would allow u opportunity would invasive monitoring patient epilepsy . Epileptic patient surgical candidate , require precise localization epileptogenic zone , typically undergo long-term video-EEG monitoring subdural and/or depth electrode . Some patient may seizure onset close sensory-motor area brain require functional mapping term motor function . We would like opportunity study electrocorticographic ( ECoG ) activity associate simple movement patient undergo invasive monitoring . This study disturb ongoing monitoring , endanger patient since activation stimulation involve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENTS UNDERGOING SUBDURAL IMPLANTATION : Epileptic patient undergo invasive recording implanted subdural electrode cover sensorimotor cortex . Therefore , recruit patient medically intractable epilepsy candidate surgical treatment , invasive monitoring deem necessary purpose precise localization epileptogenic zone . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : EPILEPTIC PATIENTS : Patients whose electrode implantation cover sensorimotor cortex .</criteria>
