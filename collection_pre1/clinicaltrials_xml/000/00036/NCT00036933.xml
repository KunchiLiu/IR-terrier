	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy QS21 use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Combining vaccine therapy QS21 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy QS21 treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine adjuvant QS21 patient prostate cancer . - Determine antibody response patient treated vaccination therapy . - Assess post-immunization change PSA level objective parameter disease ( radionuclide bone scan ) patient treat vaccination therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly week 0-2 , 6 , 14 , 26 absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients whose antibody titer Globo-H MUC-2 antigen fall 1/40 disease progression may receive seventh vaccination week 50 . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year biochemical relapse radiographic disease progression .</detailed_description>
