	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : To determine whether radical prostatectomy expectant management effective reduce mortality extend life . Secondary Hypothesis : To determine treatment strategy superior term prostate specific cancer mortality , quality life , occurrence recurrence symptom need cancer treatment . Intervention : 1 ) Radical prostatectomy , plus intervention evidence disease persistence recurrence , 2 ) Expectant management palliative therapy reserve symptomatic metastatic disease progression . Primary Outcomes : All cause mortality . Study Abstract : Cancer prostate ( CAP ) common nondermatologic second frequent cause cancer death men . No cure currently possible disseminated disease . Cancer confine prostate believe curable , frequently recommend therapy surgical extirpation tumor radical prostatectomy . However , despite increase cancer detection aggressive surgical treatment , population-based mortality rate prostate cancer decrease , neither nationally state high rate radical prostatectomy . Existing evidence demonstrate superiority procedure compare expectant management treatment localized prostate cancer . Data case series suggest either treatment approach provide equivalent all-cause well prostate cancer specific mortality . The randomized trial limit small sample size result favor expectant management . Radical prostatectomy provide potentially curative removal cancer . However , subject patient morbidity mortality surgery may neither necessary effective . Expectant management offer potential cure . However , provide palliative therapy symptomatic metastatic disease progression , avoids potentially excessive morbid intervention asymptomatic patient , emphasizes management approach focus relieve symptom minimize therapeutic complication . The primary objective study determine two strategy superior management clinically localized CAP : 1 ) radical prostatectomy early aggressive intervention disease persistence recurrence , 2 ) expectant management reservation therapy palliative treatment symptomatic metastatic disease progression . Outcomes include total mortality , CAP mortality , disease free progression free survival , morbidity , quality life , cost effectiveness .</detailed_description>
