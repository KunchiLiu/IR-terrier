	<detailed_description>Previous study show isometric strengthen beneficial manage osteoarthritis knee . This type exercise decrease joint-related pain stiffness increase strength functional measure . However , individual rarely adhere isometric exercise lengthy period time way measure apply force performance time home setting . In addition , type exercise often describe `` boring . '' We believe able monitor one 's progress essential maintain adherence isometric exercise program . This study examine effectiveness portable isometric exercise device home use guide user exercise protocol mean various form feedback . We hypothesize individual exercise device achieve well outcomes pain , stiffness , strength , functional measure control group group exercise accord print material arthritis advocacy group . We randomly assign study participant meet eligibility criterion exercise device group , exercise accord print material group , control group . We conduct measure group clinic visit baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week . As subject exercise device group strengthen leg muscle , physical therapist likely need adjust upward target force different leg position every clinic visit , 2 week apart .</detailed_description>
