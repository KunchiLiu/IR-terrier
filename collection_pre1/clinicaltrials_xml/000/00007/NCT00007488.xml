	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain information type amount HIV present certain place body blood affect potent ( powerful ) anti-HIV drug give . Researchers know type amount HIV may differ certain place body ( call compartment ) sure anti-HIV treatment affect difference . This study gather information help understand virus grows change blood nonblood compartment patient receive anti-HIV treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal antiretroviral therapy maximal suppression HIV-1 replication . Yet study show ongoing replication latent virus blood lymphoid tissue patient receive potent antiretroviral therapy suppress plasma HIV-1 RNA level prolong period time . This continued viral persistence replication could eventually result virologic failure clinical progression well selection transmission resistant HIV-1 . There need identify , quantify , determine significance viral reservoir compartment blood . A5077 design evaluate relationship viral load blood nonblood compartment time virologic failure patient initiate change potent antiretroviral therapy . Patients contribute sample blood study entry ( prior change initiate potent antiretroviral therapy ) , Week 8 every 8 week thereafter Week 96 , ( applicable ) within 30 day confirm virologic failure . Samples saliva either genital secretion lymphoid tissue , , collect study entry ( prior change initiate potent antiretroviral therapy ) , Weeks 16 , 48 , 96 , within 30 day confirm virologic failure . Clinical assessment medication update do study visit . Blood sample test HIV-1 genotypic resistance study , HIV-1 proviral DNA study , HIV-1 quantitation . If total blood volume exceed safe limit , blood sample draw A5077 A5077 protocol team request access plasma PBMC sample coenrolled study applicable .</detailed_description>
