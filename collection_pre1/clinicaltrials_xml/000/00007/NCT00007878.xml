	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose bortezomib give together fluorouracil leucovorin calcium treat patient solid tumor metastatic remove surgery . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil leucovorin calcium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together chemotherapy may effective treatment solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PS-341 ( bortezomib ) administer bolus injection two time week ( day 1 4 ) 2 week follow one week rest . II . To evaluate pharmacodynamics PS-341 determine 20S proteasome nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer activate B cell ( NFkB ) inhibition blood patient treat intravenous PS-341 combine weekly fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) leucovorin calcium ( LV ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify objective tumor response patient treat intravenous PS-341 . II . To evaluate relationship inhibition 20S proteasome NFkB clinical toxicity . III . To obtain preliminary data molecular correlate response PS-341 5-FU LV include gene involve apoptosis , cell cycle control , transcriptional regulation adhesion/angiogenesis base mechanisms PS-341 IV . To examine pharmacokinetics 5-FU co-administered PS-341 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bortezomib . Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 4 fluorouracil IV leucovorin calcium IV day 1 weekly 2 week . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
