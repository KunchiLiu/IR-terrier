	<brief_title>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) Gulf War Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To develop , nationwide ascertainment , comprehensive descriptive epidemiology amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) among Gulf War veteran particular attention whether high expect occurrence ALS among deployed veteran compare non-deployed Gulf War veteran . Secondary Objectives : To ascertain probable/possible etiologic factor particular focus role chemical biologic factor Persian Gulf area deployment . Primary Outcomes : Incidence ALS among deployed non-deployed veteran Gulf War . Intervention : N/A Study Abstract : Recently , concern arisen regard possible elevate occurrence ALS among veteran serve Persian Gulf Operations Desert Shield ( August 2 , 1990 - January 15 , 1991 ) , Desert Storm ( January 16 , 1991 - February 28 , 1991 ) Clean-up ( March 1 , 1991 - July 31 , 1991 ) . In response concern , nationwide epidemiological investigation conduct ascertain occurrence ALS August , 1990 July , 2000 among active duty military mobilized Reserves , include National Guard , serve Gulf War period ( August 2 , 1990-July 31 , 1991 ) . A diagnosis ALS confirm medical record review , necessary , neurological examination . Risk assess age-adjusted , average , annual 10-year cumulative incidence rate . VA lead joint federal government epidemiologic study also involve DoD , HHS , CDC , academic center excellence neurology , advice ALS Association . The study population define active duty military mobilize reserve National Guard serve least one month time Gulf War period . Mobilized reservist member National Guard activate called-up , either deploy S.W . Asia `` back-filling '' position military personnel deploy . Deployed military personnel serve S.W . Asian theater Operations Desert Shield Desert Storm period immediately Desert Storm receive hazardous duty pay Gulf War . All individual study population classify non-deployed , although may station outside U.S . This study primary component field epidemiological investigation , involve nationwide ascertainment ALS case among deployed non-deployed veteran Gulf War obtain census ALS case among population . Ascertainment case occur three avenue . The first search extant VA DoD medical database . Second , solicit case ALS Association , related organization , VA DoD neurology clinic . And third , identified case self-referrals result national medium announcement . Purported case verify via medical record review , necessary , detailed clinical examination . For living case , collect sample blood urine determination ALS-relevant DNA mutation heavy metal exposure , respectively . There also in-home visit include interview patient family member emphasis ascertainment unique exposure . Results : In large epidemiological study , researcher support Department VA DoD find preliminary evidence veteran serve Desert Shield-Desert Storm nearly twice likely non-deployed counterpart develop ALS . VA explore option compensate veteran serve Gulf subsequently develop ALS . Ongoing Surveillance : The study team implement ongoing surveillance system detect future case ALS develop veteran population . This system involve maintain linkage create detect current case . New case subject protocols verification , enrollment data collection original case ascertainment study .</detailed_description>
