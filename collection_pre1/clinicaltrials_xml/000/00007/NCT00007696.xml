	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To measure prevalence undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) annual incidence new case DM among veteran age 45 64 compare health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) veteran undiagnosed DM without DM comparable risk DM , baseline three year follow-up . Secondary Objectives : To describe clinical state veteran diabetes newly diagnose screen describe process usual care veteran diabetes newly diagnose screening . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome : 1 ) prevalence undiagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) ; 2 ) HRQoL measure SF-36 ; 3 ) glycemic control measure HbA1C ; 4 ) calculation 3-year direct utilization-related cost , perspective VA , associate early diagnosis DM , comparison 3-year direct utilization-related cost veteran screen diabetes diabetes . Intervention : N/A Study Abstract : Population-based screening diabetes mellitus non-pregnant adult remain controversial . For screen strategy successful , patient identify surveillance well outcome diagnose later , symptomatic phase disease . However , little known fate patient diagnose diabetes screen . Additionally , half case diabetes among general population give time undiagnosed , prevalence undiagnosed diabetes among veteran unknown . The annual incidence diabetes among veteran also unknown . A mail-out survey study complete 10,350 survey mail 4,500 survey return ( 43 % ) . Enrollment conclude 7/31/99 1,253 new subject enrol . Follow-up enrolled subject ongoing . Some descriptive analysis data reveal prevalence undiagnosed diabetes 4.5 % . Factors associate unrecognized diabetes diagnosis hypertension history parent sibling diabetes . Having primary care provider raise low risk unrecognized diabetes . Based new diagnosis , patient find diabetes required change treatment either blood sugar comorbid hypertension hyperlipidemia order achieve target recommend publish treatment guideline . Patients report primary care provider less likely require change treatment . Conclusions : If diabetes screen effective intervention , opportunistic screen diabetes may prefer method screening , substantial potential case-finding medical center outpatient set . A majority patient diabetes diagnosed opportunistic screening require change treatment blood sugar , blood pressure , lipid receive optimal care .</detailed_description>
