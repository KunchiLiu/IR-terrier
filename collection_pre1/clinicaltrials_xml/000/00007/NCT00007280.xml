	<brief_summary>This study look whether graft bioengineered skin ( BSC ) , know commercially Apligraf , stimulate heal process person 's skin edge wound ( know edge effect ) . The information study provide good understanding way graft bioengineered skin help heal chronic wound . We assign study participant either bioengineered skin group control group . People control group receive compression therapy multilayered compression bandage . We examine participant start treatment week 24 week wound heals . On first day treatment ( day 0 ) week 3 , week 6 , week 24 ( end treatment ) take small tissue sample wound biopsy . After wound completely heal , ask patient return month 6 month make sure wound stay heal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BSC two-layered sheet make purified beef tendon collagen , live human cell , substance maintains cell graft ( remove ) . We obtain human cell donor unrelated patient . The human cell test presence infectious agent find free disease-causing organism hepatitis virus , AIDS virus , bacteria , fungi . We randomly assign ( randomize ) study participant either bioengineered skin group control group ( compression therapy multilayered compression bandage ) . Regardless group patient assign , expect participation study 12 month follow start study treatment . We examine patient screen visit ( 2 week randomization ) 3-4 day start treatment make sure wound free sign infection . After initial randomization visit examine wound week 24 week wound heals , whichever earlier . As soon determine wound completely heal , ask patient return month 6 month make sure remain heal . Bioengineered skin group : We apply BSC wound cover xeroform dressing , foam bolster , gauze dressing , compression bandage . If note improvement week 6 visit , apply BSC wound second time . Control group : We place multilayered compression bandage wind participant assign group . Biopsies ( small piece skin tissue ) : At day 0 biopsy take thigh leg ulcer . The biopsy thigh require suture remove ten day . Sometime week 1 3 , week 6 , week 24 week 48 ( 6 month follow-up ) visit biopsy take ulcer ( wound ) ulcer heal . If ulcer heal week 48 visit , light scrap heal wound perform . Study examination : All study examination include observation , measurement , photography . We admit woman childbearing age study breast feeding , pregnant , surgically sterilize use effective birth control . Because effect propose treatment fetus unknown , remove study woman become pregnant receive BSC application ( day 0-week 3 ) suggest another method treatment .</detailed_description>
