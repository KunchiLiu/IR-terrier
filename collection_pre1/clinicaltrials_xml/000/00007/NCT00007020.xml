	<brief_title>Compassionate Treatment Patients With Inborn Errors Bile Acid Metabolism With Cholic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigational Plan : A Phase III , open label , single arm , nonrandomized , non-comparative , compassionate treatment study cholic acid treatment defect bile acid metabolism . The study begin single study site Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) , 2005 expand compassionate treatment could provide additional patient identify inborn error bile metabolism center 's screening/diagnostic program . Patients screen contact evaluated respect inclusion/exclusion criterion . Signed informed consent patient and/or parents/legal guardian obtain soon confirmed patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion parents/guardian would agree child participate study . The primary intervention study : 1 . Administration study drug . 2 . Collection baseline physical exam , vital sign , blood urine sample laboratory test . 3 . Collection periodic physical exam , vital sign , blood urine sample laboratory test period administration study drug . 4 . Collection adverse event information . Time Events Schedule : Baseline : 1 . Confirm eligibility 2 . Obtain write informed consent patient and/or parents/legal guardian 3 . Collect demographic data disease medication history , include family history Baseline Ongoing : 4 . Obtain body weight 5 . Record adverse event 6 . Obtain blood urine sample laboratory test 7 . Initiate study drug therapy &amp; monitor study drug therapy adjust dose need</detailed_description>
