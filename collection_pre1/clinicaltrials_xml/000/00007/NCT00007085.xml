	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 600,000 Americans sustain pulmonary embolism year ; one-third episode fatal . Unfortunately , pulmonary embolism underdiagnosed , therefore , under-treated . A substantial body evidence suggest diagnosis pulmonary embolism make majority patient cause contributes death . In main , two explanation failure diagnose pulmonary embolism : pulmonary embolism may clinically silent , definitive , noninvasive diagnostic test . Indeed , ventilation perfusion lung scan nondiagnostic majority patient suspect acute pulmonary embolism . Pulmonary angiography may use establish diagnosis patient , underutilized mortality risk around 1 percent . Recently , relatively small study suggest contrast enhanced spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan useful diagnostic test pulmonary embolism , sensitivity high 80 percent specificity high 95 percent . Spiral CT widely available much less invasive pulmonary angiography . If spiral CT could establish useful diagnostic test , pulmonary embolism would diagnose effectively patient would receive proper treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study evaluate role spiral CT scan diagnosis PE comparison composite reference test , include pulmonary angiography , V/Q lung scan patient without prior PE compression ultrasound low extremity patient prior deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) .</detailed_description>
