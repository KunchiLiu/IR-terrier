	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : 1 ) To investigate olfactory function possible proxy neurotoxic exposure cohorts deploy non-deployed Gulf War-era veteran ; , 2 ) To examine potential association olfactory function neurocognitive performance measure know sensitive neurotoxic sequela . Secondary Objectives : To examine association olfactory function stress-related psychopathology , namely posttraumatic stress disorder , Gulf War ( GW ) veteran . Primary Outcomes : The aim proposal investigate olfactory function cohort deploy non-deployed GW-era veteran . In search symptom pattern relate neurotoxic exposure , examination deployment status neurocognitive dysfunction relation sensory measure ( i.e. , olfaction ) sensitive environmental toxin potential contribute additional confirming disconfirming evidence GW exposure . Intervention : N/A Study Abstract : This study fund Durham ERIC 's Pilot Studies Initiative conduct researcher New Orleans , LA VAMC . Significant subsets military veteran report health problem headache , joint pain , fatigue , memory/concentration difficulty subsequent participation Gulf War . However , etiology remain controversial . A number toxin implicated etiologic factor GW-related health problem ; however , exposure level difficult , impossible , document retrospectively . These difficulty exposure verification lead GW researcher de-emphasize method typical neurotoxicological research examine exposure-symptom relationship instead focus epidemiological approach emphasize identification coherent symptom pattern . The propose research build Merit Review Award Dr. Vasterling , `` Follow-up Psychological Neurocognitive Gulf War Outcome : Relation Stress , '' longitudinal , case-controlled study psychological functioning 800 deploy 250 nondeployed GW-era veteran . Variables currently examine include self-reported health symptom , psychological symptom , individual difference variable ( e.g. , personality characteristic ) , stress exposure , self-reported environmental hazard exposure , objective neurocognitive data ( subset veteran ) . This pilot study extend `` Follow-up '' study introduce distinct set variable related olfactory functioning . The study design pilot study case-controlled . A project 120 male female GW veteran deploy war zone 38 male female military personnel activate Gulf War participate . Olfactory measure include olfactory identification , odor intensity pleasantness judgment , reveal factor analysis reflect distinct olfactory component . Odors present use University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test . A brief neurocognitive battery include standardize , age-normed measure function sensitive neurotoxic exposure ( i.e. , attention , fine motor skill , executive functioning , memory ) also administer . Psychopathology self-reported health measure also administer part large `` Follow-up '' study . To-date , 32 deploy 12 nondeployed veteran enrol study . Subject accrual data collection ongoing . The sample size currently small detect meaningful trend . It expect pilot work generate manuscript submit peer-reviewed scientific journal development full-scale epidemiological grant proposal .</detailed_description>
