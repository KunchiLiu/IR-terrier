Olanzapine novel antipsychotic agent reduce incidence extrapyramidal symptom . Other side effect minimal . Approximately 327 patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder randomly assign one two treatment group . One treatment group prescribe olanzapine daily dosage range 5 mg/day 20 mg/day . The treatment group prescribe haloperidol daily dosage also range 5 mg/day 20 mg/day . A semi-structured psychosocial case management treatment program provide study patient . Patients recruit 18 VA medical center 24-month period follow one year . 18 patient enrol one site research program terminate study .
