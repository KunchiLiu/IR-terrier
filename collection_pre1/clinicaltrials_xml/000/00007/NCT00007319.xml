	<brief_summary>The intima-media thickness ( IMT ) test low cost , non-invasive way measure thickness carotid artery ( large artery neck ) . The purpose study compare thickness carotid artery among HIV infect adult take protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , HIV infect adult take PIs , HIV uninfected adult , examine thickness may change time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Determination clinical , lipid , non-lipid risk factor traditional approach gauge individual 's risk coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . However , IMT test , use sound wave measure thickness carotid artery , find diagnose CAD predict person 's risk heart disease well well lipid non-lipid risk factor . This study use IMT test see anti-HIV treatment HIV infection affect patient 's risk develop atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) compare carotid artery thickness among HIV infect adult take PIs , HIV infect adult take PIs , HIV uninfected adult . There 3 group study . Group 1 comprise HIV infect participant currently take PI-containing regimen . Group 2 comprise HIV infect participant take PIs . Group 3 comprise HIV uninfected participant . At site , participant enrol `` triad '' consist individual group . Each member triad closely matched gender , age , smoke menopausal status , race , normal hypertensive blood pressure . All 3 member triad must identify participant register study . All participant visit clinic Weeks 1 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 144 ( 3 year ) . At visit , participant physical exam , medical history waist/hip ratio assessment , blood collection , IMT test . The absolute value carotid IMT compare among 3 group . Viral load CD4 count also measure Group 1 2 participant .</detailed_description>
