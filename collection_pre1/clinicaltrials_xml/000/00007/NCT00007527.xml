	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : The purpose study determine safety sublingual tablet formulation buprenorphine naloxone extend combination tablet availability physicians office-based practice . The general consensus initial effort involve physician experience treatment opiate dependence . The fact buprenorphine already formulation available schedule V analgesic allow administration dispense physician 's office .

Secondary Hypothesis : None Intervention : This single treatment study sublingual 4:1 buprenorphine/naloxone combination tablet . Dosing range 2 mg baseline ( expressed amount buprenorphine ) 24 mg ( maximum dose use study ) . Primary Outcomes : Patient retention rate , percentage urine sample negative opiate Study Abstract : The CS 1018 study recruit total 582 patient seek treatment opiate dependence . They recruit six state ( Florida , New York , Texas , California , Washington , Illinois ) , ten private physician sit clinic participate state .
