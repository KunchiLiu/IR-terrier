	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : The strategy PCI plus intensive medical therapy superior intensive medical therapy alone reduce cause mortality nonfatal MI patient document myocardial ischemia meet AHA task force Class I indication PCI . Secondary Hypotheses : Resource utilization QOL comparison hospitalization acute coronary syndrome superior PCI plus medical therapy compare medical therapy alone . Primary Outcomes : All cause mortality , nonfatal MI . Interventions : All patient treat intensive medical therapy . In addition half receive percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Study Abstract : The COURAGE Trial large-scale , multicenter , randomize control trial compare medical therapy PCI plus medical therapy power `` hard '' clinical endpoint . Patients eligible inclusion COURAGE comprise high-risk subject , include chronic angina pectoris ( Canadian Cardiovascular Society [ CCS ] Class I-III ) , recent uncomplicated MI , asymptomatic ( `` silent '' ) myocardial ischemia . Patients may single- multi-vessel coronary artery disease may prior bypass graft surgery PCI . We project cumulative 3-year event rate 16.4 % 21 % , respectively , yield absolute difference 4.6 % relative difference 22 % . With minimum duration follow-up 2 1/2 year , maximum 7 year , use two-sided test significance 0.05 level , assume 3 % crossover rate 2 % 1 % 2 year meds PCI , annual loss follow-up rate 1 % event rate indicate sample size 2,270 need test hypothesis 85 % power . Fifteen VA , 19 U.S. non-VA , 16 Canadian site enrol study . The plan study duration 7 year , 4 1/2 year patient intake 2 1/2 - 7 year follow-up . Study operation begin January 1999 enrollment begin June 1999 . The Data Safety Monitoring Board approve reduce sample size 2,270 subject base increase length randomization follow-up updating definition MI include biomarker positive ( troponin ) ACS . Enrollment complete 2,287 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
