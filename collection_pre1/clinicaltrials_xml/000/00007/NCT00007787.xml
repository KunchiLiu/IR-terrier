	<brief_summary>The purpose study see kidney function improve transplant give drug Thymoglobulin delay cyclosporine treatment instead initial cyclosporine treatment . There improvements patient receive kidney transplant , yet acute rejection still problem . This lead kidney failure time . Patients whose graft fail function properly first week transplant well 5 year compare patient without early problem . This study see Thymoglobulin , drug suppresses immune system , improve early graft function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibody Delayed Cyclosporine Versus Initial Cyclosporine Alone Patients Receiving Kidney Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While graft survival post renal transplant improve last decade , acute rejection remain problem clinical research seek minimize improved strategy . Graft survival prognosis significantly worsen patient whose allograft exhibit delayed function patient may require early dialysis . Data show cadaveric organ recipient require dialysis use first transplant week 5-year post-graft survival rate 51 percent compare 70 percent free complication . A recent evaluation Thymoglobulin ( rabbit-derived polyclonal antibody ; immunosuppressant ) suggest effective agent worthy evaluation induction therapy . This trial evaluate whether decrease DGF see improve Day 90 graft function . Recipients first second cadaver kidney transplant randomize pre-transplant 1 2 treatment group . One group receive antibody therapy ( Thymoglobulin ) time transplant delay cyclosporine therapy . The group start cyclosporine therapy time transplant without Thymoglobulin . DGF diagnose less 20 percent decrease serum creatinine level first 24 hour post-transplant and/or need dialysis . Patients antibody arm receive additional antibody experience DGF . Biopsies perform case suspect rejection patient biopsy-confirmed acute cellular rejection receive treatment . Patients regular examination include blood test evaluate kidney function incidence complication 24 month transplant . The trial endpoint graft function encompass graft survival graft function calculate creatinine clearance .</detailed_description>
