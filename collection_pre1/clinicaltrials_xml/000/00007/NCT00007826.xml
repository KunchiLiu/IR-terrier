	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Vaccines make cancer cell may make body build immune response kill colorectal tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness monoclonal antibody therapy and/or vaccine therapy treat patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotypic vaccine ONYCR1 , ONYCR2 , ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccine patient locally advance metastatic adenocarcinoma colon rectum . - Determine immunological response treatment regimens patient . - Determine 6-month 1-year survival patient receive treatment regimen . - Determine tumor response treatment regimens patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients assign one three treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotype vaccine ( MOAB 105AD7 ) plus BCG intradermally ( ID ) weekly week 1 2 ; MOAB 105AD7 ID plus alum adjuvant intramuscularly ( IM ) weekly week 4 6 ; MOAB 105AD7 ID alone monthly 12 month . - Arm II : Patients receive ONYCR1 , ONYCR2 , ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccine plus BCG ID weekly week 1 2 ; vaccine ID weekly week 4 6 , monthly 12 month . - Arm III : Patients receive MOAB 105AD7 , ONYCR1 , ONYCR2 , ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccine , BCG ID weekly week 1 2 ; MOAB 105AD7 ONYCR1 , ONYCR2 , ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccine ID plus alum adjuvant IM weekly week 4 6 ; MOAB 105AD7 ONYCR1 , ONYCR2 , ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccine monthly 12 month . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45 patient ( 15 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
