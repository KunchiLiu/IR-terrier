	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound examine change tongue volume blood circulation tongue exercise require use different tongue muscle movement contraction . More information structure function human tongue need develop well treatment people certain disease affect speech swallow . Normal volunteer 21 80 year old live metropolitan Washington , D.C. , area may eligible study . Candidates screen brief medical history physical examination , include suitability MRI testing , brief examination tongue , lip jaw movement . Participants undergo ultrasound MRI study . During test , perform tongue exercise , hold soft round object tongue exert tongue pressure back throat roof mouth . During ultrasound , subject lie flatten dental chair . A small transducer place chin take image tongue exercise . A thin rubber strip air-filled pressure bulb attach roof mouth ( dental adhesive ) measure tongue pressure . For MRI , subject lie table slide inside donut 's machine contain magnetic field . MRI coils-special pad sensor improve image quality-are place around head neck . A pressure cuff place around arm measure blood pressure . The subject wear earplugs muffle loud thumping noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . The subject constant visual contact researcher MR technologist may request stop study time . Participants may undergo another procedure , call magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging , examine fluid ( water ) tongue tissue shift tongue maneuver . This procedure essentially first MRI study , two small round coil place mouth ( one side ) cheek teeth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As organ unparalleled anatomical architecture , tongue versatility effect regional deformation positional change multiple potential degree freedom . Despite abundance study tongue function , well numerous propose tongue model year , much anatomical biomechanical detail vivo human tongue remain poorly understood . Physiologically base biomechanical model tongue swallow ultimate objective protocol . However , model accurately pursue , substantial database must establish , several important , unaddressed issue regard lingual anatomy biomechanics must resolve . These issue include : ( 1 ) compressibility human tongue common , yet untested , reference muscular hydrostat ; ( 2 ) task induced interaction lingual musculature vasculature region-specific vascular demand ; ( 3 ) change lingual fiber orientation , length , strain distribution function contraction task ; ( 4 ) effect normal age , disease process , task train lingual myoarchitecture well integration structure function . Using advance 3D MRI , Doppler ultrasonography , MR image technique ( e.g. , tag MRI , diffusion tensor MRI ) , protocol proposes quantitatively address issue contribute good understanding functional biomechanical well myoarchitectural intricacy vivo human tongue .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Volunteers must : 1. old 21 year age ; 2. reside Metropolitan Washington , D.C. Area ; 3. speech , swallow , respiratory , cardiac problem ; 4. able hold breath least 2030 second ; 5. good general health ; 6. pregnant nursing ; 7. medication would adversely affect blood pressure , circulation , pulmonary function , speech , swallow ability . Patients must : 1. old 21 year age ; 2. pregnant nursing ; 3. tongue weakness , confirm oral motor examination , associate neurologic , degenerative , musculoskeletal , disease . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers : 1 . Any contraindication MRI , include : pacemaker implant electronic device cochlear implant metal eye embed shrapnel fragment cerebral aneurysm clip medical infusion pump orthodontic brace , unremovable metal retainer , dental implant , crown , long metal bridge , large multiple amalgam filling metal clip wire part body 2 . Medical condition present elevated risk reduce tolerance MRI procedure . Examples : angina severe uncontrolled hypertension severe cardiovascular disorder dyspnea rest severe claudication ( le 1 flight step ) paralyze hemidiaphragm symptom pheochromocytoma insulinoma hemoglobinopathy severe asthma , allergy postnasal drainage uncontrolled renal hepatic disease severe back pain inability tolerate supine position claustrophobia morbid obesity pregnancy lactation 3 . History swallow problem condition adversely affect cardiac function , deglutitive function , tongue motility control , hearing , language , cognition . 4 . Unsatisfactory performance status , judge examine speechlanguage pathologist , indicate poor compliance plan task ( e.g. , oral motor deficit , inability hold breath least 20 second ) . Patients : 1 . Any contraindication MRI , 5.2.1 ( 1 ) ; 2 . Medical condition present high risk severely reduce tolerance MRI procedure , determine base consultation medically responsible individual ( designate substitute ) ; 3 . History condition severely impaired cardiac function , hearing , language , cognition .</criteria>
