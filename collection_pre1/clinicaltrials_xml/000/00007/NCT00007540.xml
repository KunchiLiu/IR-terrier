	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To evaluate relationship length CAG repeat sequence occur androgen receptor gene major prostate cancer prognostic determinant ( race , age , histologic grade stage ) time diagnosis black white veteran . Secondary Objectives : To create secure , organize bank DNA plasma sample obtain newly diagnose prostate cancer patient assay peripheral blood DNA inherit polymorphisms androgen receptor gene . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome androgen receptor CAG repeat sequence length stage disease . Intervention : N/A Study Abstract : Prostate cancer diagnose approximately 334,500 men year account nearly 41,800 death United States . Prostate cancer lead cancer affect veteran second leading cancer among Americans . The cause prostate cancer , particularly , reason unusually high incidence rate African-Americans remain obscure . Dietary factor likely play role fatal case , hormone also important regulate prostate cancer growth . Dr. Charles Huggins recognize effect 1940 's , androgen deprivation remain cornerstone therapy advance disease . Despite strong circumstantial evidence , neither epidemiologic study basic science produce clear insight etiologic role hormone . However , recent observation regard androgen receptor gene polymorphisms relation endocrine expression prostate cancer risk may provide important clue etiologic role might mediate molecular level . Thus , important attempt identify genetic marker high-risk cancer patient necessary screen counsel effort . It recently demonstrate androgen receptor function ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator , regulation important control prostate growth apoptosis . Heightened androgenic stimulation , potential by-product shorten CAG repeat length , could potentially increase risk prostate cancer development progression . In particular , short CAG repeat sequence may associate cancer feature high histologic grade , extraprostatic extension , distant metastasis ( stage C D ) . Recent evidence indicate men short CAG repeat particularly high risk distant metastatic fatal prostate cancer . The result demonstrate short CAG repeat sequence androgen receptor gene predict high grade advance state prostate cancer diagnosis , metastatic disease , mortality . However , study limit white since small number African American men prostate cancer include . Prostate cancer incidence vary African-American white men . African-American men high know incidence rate world , 66 % high white men U.S . The genetic finding describe raise possibility racial difference distribution androgen receptor polymorphism may account high rate prostate cancer , advanced disease , young age presentation African-Americans . This study create cohort prostate cancer patient well characterized respect histology , stage diagnosis , ( time ) mortality . This study generate data regard length CAG repeat sequence occur androgen receptor gene major prostate cancer prognostic determinant ( histologic grade state ) time diagnosis black white veteran . CAG repeat length androgen receptor gene evaluate cohort 145 African American 150 white veteran prostate cancer . Results : Mean androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length Caucasians 21.9 versus 19.8 African Americans , p=0.0001 . However , truncate CAG repeat length ( CAG &lt; = 18 versus CAG &gt; 18 ) associate advanced stage cancer diagnosis , high PSA diagnosis , high Gleason score ( p &gt; 0.5 ) . Conclusion : The mean androgen receptor CAG repeat length 2 repeat short African American versus white prostate cancer patient . These finding raise concern prostate cancer African American men may less sensitive hormonal therapy white men . These finding provide biologic rationale clinical trial evaluate joint administration chemotherapy hormone therapy African American men advance prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
