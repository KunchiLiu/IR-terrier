	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety tolerability study drug DPC 083 combine 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) HIV-infected patient fail nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) treatment . In study DPC 083 ( NNRTI ) find low amount HIV blood ( viral load ) , drug-resistant type HIV lower NNRTIs . This study attempt determine safe DPC 083 take combination 2 NRTIs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Drug DPC 083 Combination With Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors HIV-1-Infected Patients Who Are Failing Treatment With Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical human pharmacokinetic data suggest DPC 083 administer daily provide trough plasma concentration free drug suppress replication HIV-1 , include strain contain key resistance mutation observe failure treatment currently available NNRTIs . This study provide assessment safety preliminary assessment efficacy DPC 083 administer dose 100 mg daily combination 2 NRTIs , population HIV-1-infected patient fail treatment NNRTI-containing regimen . Patients receive DPC 083 daily combination 2 NRTIs . The 2 NRTIs select investigator , base HIV-1 genotyping result . Analyses patient safety drug efficacy do Weeks 8 , 24 , 48 use result clinical laboratory test physical exam . Patients continue receive DPC 083 NRTIs last patient enrol study completes 48 week treatment . Patients return post-therapy follow-up visit 1 3 month follow early termination study completion . Some patient may participate substudy evaluates change HIV-1 level cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .</detailed_description>
