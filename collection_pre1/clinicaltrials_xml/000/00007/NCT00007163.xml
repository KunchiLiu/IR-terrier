	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug call J695 treat patient Crohn 's disease-a long-term recur inflammation small large intestine . This disease currently treat steroid , sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine ) , 5-ASA drug ( Pentasa , Asacol ) , immune suppressant , antibiotic , antibody TNF-alpha . Despite number variety available therapy Crohn 's disease , many patient respond adequately treatment develop severe side effect medicine . Therefore , new treatment must develop . J695 antibody identical human antibody chemically change attach eliminate inflammatory chemical make body call interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) . Animal study show eliminate IL-12 antibody prevent inflammation gut also heal inflammation already develop . Patients 18 year age old Crohn 's disease least 4 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram , chest X-ray , blood urine test , stool analysis possibly review medical record . They complete Crohn 's Disease Activity Index Questionnaire 7 day . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group , follow : Group 1 Patients group receive injection either J695 placebo ( solution contain active medicine ) skin day 1 study , day 29 , weekly total seven injection . After last injection , patient follow additional 18 week . They monitor periodically throughout study physical examination , disease activity index score , blood urine test . Group 2 Patients group 2 receive injection J695 placebo day 1 study weekly total six injection . They follow additional 18 week . Patients monitor describe group 1 . Participants may ask undergo additional test part sub-study protocol . These include colonoscopy examine change inflammation gut blood test analyze change cell body chemical affect inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety clinical response human monoclonal anti-interleukin-12 antibody ( J695 ) administer patient Crohn 's disease . Crohn 's disease , incurable , chronic , relapse inflammation small large intestine , affect approximately 500,000 people United States . The disease characterize full-thickness involvement gut wall lead episode abdominal pain , diarrhea , hematochezia , weight loss complication bowel obstruction , fistula formation extraintestinal manifestation . The rationale study base two compelling observation . First , despite standard therapeutic use steroid , aminosalicylates , antibiotic , antimetabolite immunosuppressant ( 6-MP , methotrexate ) , early agent emerge biologics class drug ( anti-TNF alpha antibody , e.g . ) , treatment Crohn 's disease still troubled loss effectiveness standard therapy time , outright nonresponsiveness , serious medication side effect . For reason new agent treatment Crohn 's disease need develop test . Second , study animal human support central role IL-12 gut inflammatory response Crohn 's disease . Administration anti-IL-12 antibody animal model prevent inducible ameliorate establish colitis . For reason IL-12 appropriate therapeutic target treatment Crohn 's disease . This study propose measure toxicity clinical effect two dose anti-IL-12 ( J695 ) administer subcutaneously patient moderately active Crohn 's disease . The primary outcome measure rate severity adverse event . Secondary outcome measure include J695 pharmacodynamics , incidence anti-J695 antibody , clinical response . A separate substudy NIH measure gut lymphocyte apoptosis gut peripheral blood cytokine response study drug well endoscopic histologic response treatment . Our short-term goal assure good tolerance anti-IL-12 treatment regimens Crohn 's disease patient observe beneficial clinical response . The long-term goal study establish anti-IL-12 effective alternative low risk profile therapeutic armamentarium Crohn 's disease .</detailed_description>
