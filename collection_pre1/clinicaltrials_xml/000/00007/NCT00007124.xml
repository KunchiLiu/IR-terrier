	<brief_summary>This study examine effect restricted-carbohydrate diet ( ketogenic diet ) Lafora disease-a severe neurological disease brain cell die abnormal accumulation glucose ( type sugar ) . Patients Lafora disease rapid neurological deterioration myoclonus ( brief muscle jerk ) , seizures mental decline . At present treatment halt disease progression . Patients 10 year age older relatively advanced Lafora disease may eligible study . Participants admit Clinical Center first 4 week 6-month study baseline test start ketogenic diet . They complete medical history physical examination , plus detailed neurological examination blood urine test . Procedures include : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan provide information brain chemistry - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) analyze chemical cerebrospinal fluid - Metabolic endocrinological test , include glucose tolerance test , evaluate body 's response large intake oral glucose - Standard neuropsychological test - Magnetic resonance spectroscopy brain muscle - Electroencephalography ( EEG ) measure brain wave activity - Electromyography ( EMG ) measure muscle activity - Evoked potential ( SEP VEP ) study brain response mild electric visual stimulation . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( magnetic stimulation brain ) may also do study function brain cortex ( outer nervous tissue brain ) effect treatment brain excitability . The ketogenic diet begin test complete . The diet provide mainly fat fuel body , plus recommended amount protein minimum carbohydrate . Vitamin mineral supplement provide meet daily requirement . After 2 week diet , patient discharge hospital see daily outpatient another 1 2 week . During time patient caregiver train prepare ketogenic diet , patient discharge home . Throughout study , disease symptom assess use standardized rating scale . Blood urine test do need , follow-up brain imaging , neuropsychological neurophysiological evaluation . A skin and/or muscle biopsy may do first clinic visit grow skin cell culture analyze skin muscle microscope . The biopsy area numb anesthetic small piece tissue remove either needle , instrument similar cookie-cutter knife . The skin cell may use metabolic study obtain DNA genetic testing . At end study , patient respond well treatment significant adverse side effect may continue diet another 12 month . They follow 3-month interval monitor side effect treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate acute effect potential disease modify effect restrictive minimum carbohydrate diet ( ketogenic diet ) patient Lafora Disease . Untreated Lafora Disease rapidly progressive death 10 year . In open label , proof-of-principle clinical trial , efficacy ketogenic diet assess use validate clinical scale , well surrogate neurophysiological biochemical measure . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female older 10 year eligible study . Younger child may sufficiently cooperative . Women childbearing age must use adequate contraceptive method least one month prior participation study . All carry diagnosis Lafora disease base presence characteristic clinical history neurological finding . All relatively advanced disease least one three cardinal neurological manifestation : myoclonus , epilepsy cognitive decline . All patient histological ( preferable ) genetic confirmation diagnosis . All patient also stable dos concomitant medication least 2 week prior onset study . Patients must presence history medical condition reasonably expect subject patient unwarranted risk . Patients must clinically significant laboratory abnormality reasonably expect subject patient unwarranted risk . Patients must contraindication use ketogenic diet : carnitine deficiency , organic acidurias , defect betaoxidation , clinically significant nephrolithiasis , immunosuppressed . Pregnant woman exclude . Those practice effective mean birth control exclude since influence investigational therapy unborn child reproductive organ unknown . Urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing age . Forbidden medication : No significant interaction generally expect therapy ketogenic diet concomitant medication . However , carbohydratecontaining drug preparation may interfere achievement persistent ketosis , avoid possible . Moreover , case unexpected hospital visit require IV fluid , patient parent ask advise treat medical staff need avoid use dextrosecontaining solution , minimize risk iatrogenic seizure . Anticonvulsant medication , general , negatively interact ketogenic diet , concomitant use drug Topiramate ( sometimes associate nephrolithiasis ) avoid possible . As mention earlier , dose VPA , commonly use patient myoclonic epilepsy , decrease 25 % , KD may significantly elevate serum plasma level VPA .</criteria>
