	<brief_title>Determine Efficacy Topical Tretinoin Cream Prevention Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : To determine efficacy topical tretinoin cream prevention nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) among high risk individual ( least 2 NMSC ? S last 5 year ) . Secondary Hypothesis : Secondary objective : ( ) determine long-term effect topical tretinoin prevalence premalignant actinic keratoses , ( b ) distinguish subpopulation topical tretinoin particularly effective ineffective , compare overall study population . Intervention : Apply Tretinoin 0.1 % cream placebo cream face ear twice day . Primary Outcomes : New NMSC lesion face ear . Number actinic keratoses face ear . Study Abstract : One-third malignancy United States ( approximately one million case diagnose annually ) nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) . NMSC cause considerable morbidity , economic burden , facial deformity least 1,000 death annually . Prevention malignancies topical agent free serious side effect would confer substantial public health benefit . Three hundred fifty thousand veteran expect develop NMSC 1994 . NMSC one common condition require dermatologic care VA system . Topical tretinoin use extensively treat photoaged skin . Retinoids administer orally high dos appear effective chemoprevention nonmelanoma skin cancer unacceptable toxicity . In study , 1200 patient recent history squamous cell and/or basal cell carcinoma enrol six participate center four-year period randomly assign either 0.1 % tretinoin cream placebo . They follow minimum two year determine topical tretinoin effective reduce risk new occurrence .
