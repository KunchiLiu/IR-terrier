	<brief_title>Longitudinal LDL-C Studies Black White Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Elevated concentration plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , major risk factor coronary heart disease , cluster significantly family . This cluster observe cross-sectional study black white family , longitudinal data familial cluster LDL-C virtually nonexistent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The longitudinal study provide new important information change familial low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) correlation black white family period share household environment separate household , use family Princeton Lipid Research Clinics ( LRC ) Prevalence ( 1973-75 ) Family Studies ( 1975-76 ) . The study also provide important information change individual LDL-C level 25 year period . The former student participant six 18 year age 32 45 year age ; parent ( largely ) 26 55 year age 51 80 year age . Plasma LDL-C concentration child adult show associate apolipoprotein ( apo ) E genotype , obesity , elective behavior diet , cigarette smoking , physical activity . In LRC Study , measurement make LDL-C , body habitus , elective behavior , family history cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The study obtain repeat measure factor , plus determine apo E isoforms . Changes individual LDL-C level familial association assess association apo E isoforms , body composition , elective behavior , family history CVD . Family member share range body weight , pattern fat distribution , dietary smoking habit , physical activity level . The extent familial cluster LDL-C level determine apo E isoforms interact similar level obesity , similar behavior , currently know .</detailed_description>
