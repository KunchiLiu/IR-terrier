	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : A variety clinical question major importance address use clinical data routinely obtain VA Hypertension Screening Treatment Program . For example , treatment mild hypertension reduces risk stroke heart attack . Secondary Hypothesis : Target organ damage occur despite blood pressure control . Intervention : Chlorthalidone , furosemide , hydrochlorothiazide , metolazone , indapamide , amiloride , spironolactone , triamterene , atenolol , metoprolol , nadolol , pindolol , propranolol , timolol , acebutolol , penbutolol , clonidine , guanethidine , methydopa , prazosin , guanadrel , labetalol , reserpine , guanfacine , hydralazine , minoxidil , captopril , enalapril , lisinopril , diltiazem , nifedipine , verapamil , nicardipine , dyazide , maxzide , pargyline , terazosin , anti-hypertensives . Primary Outcomes : Blood Pressure Target Organ Damage Study Abstract : Hypertension one common medical problem United States VA health care system . It well-documented hypertension effectively treat . However , remain important unresolved clinical question area antihypertensive treatment . For example , much mortality affect visit compliance , blood pressure control type antihypertensive agent ? Or , regimen associate morbidity others ? Or , inexpensive regimen effective expensive regimen ? The amount data available demonstration project ( currently 6,100 patient ) help address question . The answer question result good care veteran hypertension . This demonstration project provide central collection standard set clinical data patient Hypertension Screening Treatment Program clinic , thereby set national data base treatment hypertension . The primary objective project demonstrate value establish type database . The database use estimate average annual cost different antihypertensive regimen , determine cost-efficacy different therapy least expensive effective therapy address major unanswered clinical question require large population long-term patient care data . There currently 13 medical center participate .</detailed_description>
