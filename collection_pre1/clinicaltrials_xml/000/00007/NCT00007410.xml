	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Abnormalities plasminogen activator system implicate pathogenesis arterial cerebral thrombosis . In particular , elevate plasma level plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) , t-PA/PAI-1 complex find correlate increase risk myocardial infarction ( MI ) and/or stroke . Vascular fibrinolytic balance , large part , determine compete effect t-PA PAI-1 , reflect complex interplay genetic environmental factor . The present collaboration focus common hypothesis association activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) atherothrombotic event derive interaction RAAS fibrinolytic system . The study part initiative `` Thrombosis Arterial Cerebral Vasculature : New Molecular Genetic Concepts Prevention Treatment '' release April 1999 . The objective initiative establish collaborative team closely interact investigator diverse , complementary area expertise elucidate molecular genetic mechanism thrombosis arterial cerebral vasculature . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator use two population-based sample unrelated individual address aim : 1 ) study subject PREVEND study Groningen , The Netherlands DNA plasma sample clinical data already collect 2 ) estimate 2000 unrelated study subject Ghana , Africa data need collect . The collaborative study focus common hypothesis association activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) atherothrombotic event derive interaction RAAS fibrinolytic system .</detailed_description>
