	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness test call MCV guide phlebotomy ( blood draw ) therapy patient hemochromatosis inherit disorder cause much iron absorb intestine . The excess damage body tissue , severely liver , heart , pancreas joint . Because iron carry hemoglobin red blood cell , remove blood effectively low body iron store . Patients hemochromatosis undergo weekly phlebotomy treatment ( 1 pint per session ) deplete iron store . This usually require 10 50 treatment , blood drawn every 8 12 week prevent re-build iron . A test measure ferritin protein involve store iron commonly use guide phlebotomy therapy hemochromatosis patient . This study compare usefulness ferritin test MCV , measure red blood cell size , guide phlebotomy therapy . In addition , study 1 ) examine whether keep iron level low maintenance therapy help heal severe liver disease improve arthritis affected patient , 2 ) design system make blood collect hemochromatosis donor available transfusion patient . Patients 15 year old diagnose hemochromatosis high iron level suggest possible hemochromatosis may eligible study . Candidates history , physical evaluation , review medical record blood test , complete symptom questionnaire . Participants follow procedure : - Phlebotomy therapy every 1 2 week , depend iron level - Blood sample collection blood cell count iron study every phlebotomy session - Blood sample collection ( 2 tablespoon ) every 1 2 week iron store deplete - Phlebotomy every 8 12 week iron store use prevent re-build excess iron With blood donation make available transfusion patient , participant answer health history screen question undergo blood test give regular volunteer blood donor . These include screen HIV hepatitis virus syphilis . Patients meet height weight requirement may ask consider `` double red cell '' donation use apheresis . In procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein , similar routine phlebotomy . The blood circulates machine separate component . The red cell remove rest blood return body , either needle second needle arm . Patients high iron level enlarge liver offer evaluation NIH Liver Service . Those judge increase risk cirrhosis may advise undergo liver biopsy . If cirrhosis find , patient ask consider repeat biopsy 3 5 year continuous iron depletion see scar improve . Patients arthritis offer evaluation NIH Arthritis Service , depend symptom , may advise X-ray study joint biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) occur 1 every 200-250 individual northern European descent , common inherit disease population . Although molecular pathophysiology remain incompletely understood , homozygous mutation HFE gene ( Cys282Tyr ) observe nearly 100 % clinically confirm case . The clinical manifestation HH due inappropriately increase iron absorption excessive iron deposition liver , heart , endocrine organ , joint . Phlebotomy treatment , removal iron contain hemoglobin red cell , effective therapy HH . Phlebotomy therapy relieve many symptom iron-mediated tissue damage prevents progression cirrhosis . However , publish laboratory guideline monitor phlebotomy therapy base retrospective data , general allow moderate level iron overload persist maintenance therapy . Since 1987 , DTM pilot use red cell mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , conjunction hemoglobin , prospective guide phlebotomy therapy small cohort HH patient . In contrast retrospectively-derived guideline , simple , inexpensive , physiologic method find precise indicator iron-limited erythropoiesis , could easily apply adjust pace phlebotomy prevent excess iron reaccumulation . Although majority person HH meet eligibility criterion allogeneic blood donation , recently regulatory guideline restrict use therapeutically withdraw blood transfusion . New regulation permit increase flexibility use unit purpose . The purpose protocol : ( 1 ) prospectively study genotypic phenotypic response phlebotomy therapy HH patient use MCV/hemoglobin monitoring guide , validate use guide large study cohort ; ( 2 ) evaluate course severe hepatic disease rheumatologic symptom follow sustained iron depletion ; ( 3 ) establish safety efficacy document operational issue inherent program collect therapeutically withdraw blood use allogeneic transfusion . These goal combine target establishment simplest , safest system donor processing , phlebotomy management , transfusion blood drawn HH subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Confirmed diagnosis HH , define follow HFE genotype : C282Y/C282 C282Y/H63D . Up 50 percent total study population may receive prior phlebotomy therapy . Elevated transferrin saturation and/or ferritin level , diagnosis HH yet confirm genotype liver biopsy . Elevated transferrin saturation and/or ferritin level without genotype finding list , elevate hepatic iron index liver biopsy . Family member screening ( unknown HH phenotype genotype ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age le 15 year . Pregnancy . Patients require therapeutic phlebotomy reason iron overload ( polycythemia vera ) . Patients iron overload due HH ( e.g . hepatitis C infection , porphyria cutanea tarda , Wilson disease , alpha1antitrypsin deficiency , alcohol abuse ) . Other medical illness condition , opinion Investigators , may contraindicate participation due risk patient Donor Center .</criteria>
