	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn heart skeletal muscle problem relate neuroacanthocytosis ( also call Mcleod 's syndrome Levine-Critchley disease ) . This inherited condition cause problem blood , brain , heart muscle function . About 60 percent patient unusual heart muscle abnormality increase risk sudden death . Although molecular ( genetic ) change responsible neuroacanthocytosis recently identify , heart skeletal muscle problem well understood . This study try correlate specific genetic abnormality clinical feature disease identify possible cause sudden death . Patients first degree relative patient neuroacanthocytosis 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants admit National Institutes Health Clinical Center 2 5 day follow test : - Electrocardiogram - measure electrical function heart - Echocardiogram - use ultrasound measure heart thickness detect heart vessel obstruction - Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - use magnetic field radio wave provide picture heart measurement muscle thickness muscle function - Exercise test stationary bicycle - measure record symptom exercise , exercise duration , heart rate blood pressure , oxygen consumption aerobic threshold - Holter monitoring - use device attach chest continuous record heart rhythm - Blood test - look muscle damage , exclude cause muscle disease , perform DNA ( genetic ) test - Neurological consultation - test muscle function , coordination test certain brain function memory concentration Patients evidence muscle disease may also undergo muscle biopsy . This do local anesthetic possibly small amount sedation . A small area skin large arm muscle ( biceps ) numb , short incision make small sample muscle tissue remove microscopic examination . Patients evidence heart disease may also undergo follow additional test : - Cardiac catheterization electrophysiological study - determine extent heart disease study abnormal heart rhythm . Cardiac catheterization do mild sedation . The groin numb anesthetic catheter ( thin plastic tube ) insert pass blood vessel chamber heart . Pressures inside heart measure picture may take heart artery . During procedure electrophysiology test may do study abnormal heart rhythm . - Cardiac biopsy - examine heart muscle tissue . This may do end cardiac catheterization . Small sample heart muscle obtain use fine instrument pass catheter groin . Family member sign heart muscle disease undergo non-invasive test . All participant give result test treatment option discuss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroacanthocyoses ( NA ) rare , closely related clinical syndrome characterize neurological feature erythrocyte acanthocytosis . Most skeletal myopathy indicate persistently elevate plasma creatinine kinase , 60 percent patient unusual cardiomyopathy increase risk sudden death . The molecular cause syndrome recently define . However , cardiac skeletal muscle involvement outcomes poorly describe cause sudden death unknown . We propose ( 1 ) describe cardiac skeletal muscle finding NA identify potential mechanism sudden death ; ( 2 ) correlate molecular cause NA cardiac skeletal expression ; ( 3 ) define specific phenotype , , associate heterozygous state .</detailed_description>
