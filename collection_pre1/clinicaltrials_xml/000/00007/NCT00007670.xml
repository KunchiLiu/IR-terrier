	<brief_title>Does Gabapentin Lamotriginel Have Significantly Fewer Side-Effects While Providing Equal Better Seizure Control Than Current Drug Choice , Carbamazepine , Treatment Seizures Elderly .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis study one two newly FDA approve antiepileptic drug , gabapentin lamotrigine , significantly few side-effects provide equal possibly well seizure control current world-wide drug choice , carbamazepine , treatment seizure elderly . Secondary Hypotheses : Secondary aim study determine three drug study ( 1 ) few side-effects , ( 2 ) produce best seizure control , ( 3 ) least impairment cognitive function , ( 4 ) best effect mood ( 5 ) best effect quality life . Intervention : Patients randomized carbamazepine , gabapentin lamotrigine . Target dose 600mg carbamazepine ( 200mg tablet overencapsulated ) , 1500mg gabapentin ( 300mg capsule ) , 150mg lamotrigine ( 25mg tablet ) . Carbamazepine gabapentin patient also receive placebo tablet lamotrigine patient also receive placebo capsule . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome measure retention study 12 month . Major secondary outcome seizure frequency first 12 month , time first seizure , total score Systemic Toxicity Neurotoxicity Rating Scales , Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( cognitive function ) , Hamilton Depression Scale ( mood ) SF-36 Health Survey ( quality life ) . Study Abstract : New onset epilepsy elderly occurs 45,000-50,000 elderly patient year . These patient especially vulnerable side effect medication change cause age process fact patient often many common disease already receive medication likelihood drug interaction increase . Two new drug , gabapentin lamotrigine , recently approve FDA antiepileptic drug . These drug demonstrate efficacy treatment partial onset seizure , common seizure elderly . These new compound also favorable side effect profile infrequent drug-drug interaction , therefore , would expect well-tolerated elderly . Thus , primary objective study evaluate tolerability efficacy two new antiepileptic drug individually compare standard antiepileptic drug , carbamazepine , elderly population ( &gt; 60 year age ) new onset , unprovoked epileptic seizure . The study 63-month , randomize , double-blind trial three antiepileptic drug : carbamazepine , gabapentin , lamotrigine . Patient recruitment occur first 51 month patient follow least one year . There 593 patient enrol 18 VA medical center . Patients veterans 60 year age old new onset , unprovoked seizure focal onset , without secondary generalization . Patients seizures secondary toxic-metabolic cause , acute medical neurological condition progressive disease brain brain tumor exclude . A double-dummy design employ preserve blind . Target dose study medication : carbamazepine-600 mg. , gabapentin-1500 mg. , lamotrigine-150 mg . Patients assess biweekly first 8 week , every 4 week week 24 every 8 week week 52 . Patients wish continue study drug 52 week see quarterly additional year . RESULTS : For primary outcome measure retention 12 month , statistically significant ( p=0.0002 ) overall difference treatment group ( lamotrigine=55.8 % , gabapentin=49.0 % , carbamazepine=35.5 % ) . The paired comparison indicate significant difference lamotrigine carbamazepine ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) gabapentin carbamazepine ( p=0.008 ) . Consideration reason early termination indicate significant overall difference ( p=0.001 ) treatment group early termination due adverse event ( lamotrigine=12.1 % , gabapentin=21.6 % , carbamazepine=31.0 % . There significant pair comparison lamotrigine vs carbamazepine ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) lamotrigine v gabapentin ( p=0.015 ) . There differences treatment group percent patient seizure free 3 , 6 , 12 month time first , second , fifth , tenth seizure ( p &gt; 0.05 ) . When individual adverse event first 12 month study drug consider , see gabapentin patient significantly weight gain , severe weight gain ( &gt; 18 pound ) , water retention patient either lamotrigine carbamazepine . Hypersensitivity ( rash degree ) occur frequently carbamazpine lamotrigine ( p=0.007 ) . The overall conclusion lamotrigine gabapentin consider initial therapy old patient newly diagnose seizure .
