	<brief_title>The Identification Prognostic Factors Late Stage Disease , Particularly Those That Are Modifiable , That Might Explain Worsened Prognosis With Colorectal Cancer Among Veterans .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To identify prognostic factor late stage disease , particularly modifiable , might explain worsened prognosis colorectal cancer among veteran also might responsive intervention . Interventions direct factor could lead decreased mortality among veteran . Secondary Objectives : To compare outcome among veteran similar non-veterans participate NCI-funded study : `` Population Study Colon Cancer Blacks Whites '' in-progress University North Carolina Chapel Hill . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome stage disease delay diagnosis . Delay diagnosis determine length time symptom onset medical consultation ( patient delay ) length time first seek medical consultation diagnosis ( physician system delay ) . Stage disease use proxy survival . Intervention : N/A Study Abstract : Colorectal cancer second lead cause cancer death United States year . Approximately one million veteran age 50 old develop colorectal cancer remainder live nearly 433,000 die . Because cancer diagnose local regional spread , nearly half patient diagnosed colorectal cancer die . On national basis , relative five year survival colorectal cancer estimate approximately 40 % among veteran , substantially low SEER estimate general population 61.7 % ( colon ) 59.3 % ( rectum ) . Colorectal cancer preventable screening , however , diagnose early stage ( Dukes ' A B ) , curable . This first study examine factor might explain worsened prognosis veteran colorectal cancer . If modifiable factor physician patient delay diagnosis , poverty , explain increased mortality among veteran , educational program intervention improve process care associate screen diagnosis institute . To-date , 659 subject enrol . Study participation involve obtain demographic , pathology patient contact data colorectal cancer patient 14 participate site conduct one-time telephone interview . Preliminary study data suggests veteran colorectal cancer present evidence regional distant spread colorectal cancer . No significant difference stage presentation among veteran versus population-based SEER patient evident . Fewer veteran present localized disease ( 33 % versus 40 % ) , although statistically significant , could suggest trend toward presentation advance stage . Results study provide profile patient high-risk present advanced colorectal cancer . This profile may useful design patient health care system focus intervention improve stage diagnosis . Final Results : Analyses underway . A Final Report submit Durham ERIC within 90 day study end date ( 03/31/02 ) .</detailed_description>
