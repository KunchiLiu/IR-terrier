	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Treatment Congenital Heart Block ( CHB ) Newborns With Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHB abnormal condition heart beat slowly . This disease strongly associate maternal antibody SSA/Ro SSB/La ribonucleoproteins . This study hop clarify cause CHB develop appropriate treatment . The study two part . The first part study prospective ; determine fluorinated steroid give woman prior birth improves heart function well-being newborn . This part study evaluate fetus diagnose utero CHB third trimester pregnancy . Diagnosis CHB must occur least 6 week baby bear allow sufficient data collection . It decision physician mother whether steroid administer . Fetuses evaluate delivery electrocardiogram ( ECG ) detect abnormal fluid collection ultrasound monitor heartbeat . After birth , newborn assess overall pumping strength heart abnormal heartbeat . Blood drawn mother time enrollment delivery . Visits occur span approximately 5 month . The second part study observational ; purpose identify classic indicator heartbeat dysfunction heart injury newborn CHB . The goal part study good understand stage heart injury , role anti-Ro/La antibody CHB , procedure may reverse heart block . Mothers consider high risk child CHB undergo weekly ECGs 16 week pregnancy Week 24 , ECG every week Week 24 Week 34 . There total 15 visit conduct ECGs . Blood drawn first ECG visit delivery . Visits occur span 4 month . For part study , baby undergo ECGs delivery one year age . Additional test relate study may order physician .</detailed_description>
