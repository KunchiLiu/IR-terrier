Subjects identify pathology report extract VISTA . It determine pathology report alone sufficient source identify case patient come VA treatment diagnostic pathology complete Durham VA . Therefore , add additional protocol subject identification review radiation/oncology clinic record subject refer radiation treatment . To-date , 78 case 66 control enrol study . To increase accrual rate , in-home visit use necessary , Richmond , VA Asheville , NC VAMCs add participate study site . Due patient accrual problem project staff change , Durham ERIC grant study six-month , no-cost extension 7/31/2001 .</detailed_description>
