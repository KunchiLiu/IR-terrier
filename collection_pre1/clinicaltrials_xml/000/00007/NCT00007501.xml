	<brief_title>Shingles Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Immunization live , attenuate ( Oka/Merck ) varicella-zoster vaccine significantly reduce burden illness associate herpes zoster ( HZ ) . Secondary Hypotheses : Immunization live , attenuate ( Oka/Merck ) varicella-zoster vaccine reduce incidence postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . Primary Outcomes : The primary outcome burden illness due HZ define area bad pain versus time curve measure 6 month period follow HZ rash onset subject develop HZ . The burden illness outcome sensitive incidence , severity , duration HZ-associated pain . The secondary outcome incidence PHN , PHN define HZ-associated pain rat great equal 3 ( 0 10 scale ) persist appear 30 day onset HZ rash . Interventions : Immunization 0.5 ml , live , attenuate ( Oka/Merck ) varicella-zoster vaccine versus vaccine placebo . Study Abstract : The incidence severity HZ ( shingle ) , well frequency severity complication , increase markedly increase age . More half case occur person age 60 . Even without complication , HZ interfere elderly patient 's ability perform essential activity daily live , result loss independence emotionally devastate frequently irreversible . The common complication HZ elderly person postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) , frequently result disorder sleep , chronic fatigue , anxiety severe depression . Antiviral therapy modest impact acute phase HZ . However , appear prevent development PHN . This study 5.5 year randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , efficacy trial determine whether vaccination live-attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster decrease incidence and/or severity herpes zoster ( HZ ) complication adults 60 year age old ; 37,200 subject 60 year age randomize 22 site receive either vaccine placebo . At least one third subject 70 year age old . Subjects follow actively HZ least 750 case HZ least 62 case PHN occur . Subjects develop HZ evaluate severity duration associate pain , extent duration rash , change quality life associate disease six month onset HZ rash . All adverse event ( serious non-serious ) occur within 42 day vaccination record . Thereafter , serious adverse event record assess possibly related vaccination . An adverse event substudy enroll 6000 subject record adverse event vaccination Report Card . Substudy participant also follow hospital admission study . The study initiate December 1998 . Patient recruitment begin November 1998 one site , 20 site February 1999 July 1999 , one site add January 2000 . On September 26 , 2001 , enrollment study complete 38,456 randomized subject . The time point study definition PHN change protocol amendment 30 day 90 day HZ rash onset . A formal sample size re-estimation perform June 2003 . The Executive Committee DSMB review result approve increase event size 400 750 evaluable case HZ primary endpoint . It project number evaluable case HZ primary endpoint number evaluable case PHN secondary ( co-primary ) endpoint would observe end September 2003 . Therefore , Study initiate closeout plan begin October 2004 . Follow-up last suspected case HZ complete March 2004 closeout interview 37,000 survive subject complete April 28 , 2004 . The result main efficacy safety analysis unblinded December 1 , 2004 , present DSMB , Executive Committee , representative Merck &amp; Co. , Inc . Letters send study subject inform overall result treatment receive . The main manuscript publish New England Journal Medicine ( June 2005 ; 352:2271-84 ) . The vaccine approve prevention shingle FDA May 25 , 2006 . The main efficacy study close . Additionally , three substudies conduct : A substudy ( CSP # 403B ) initiate November 2005 offer investigational zoster vaccine placebo recipient CSP # 403 . Vaccination complete March 2007 13,681 ( 75 % ) placebo recipient vaccinate . This substudy close . The safety result substudy publish Journal Infectious Diseases ( J Infect Dis . 2013 May 31 epub ) . A short-term persistence substudy ( CSP # 403A ) initiate September 2004 extend follow-up vaccine placebo recipient assess long term effectiveness vaccine . This substudy bridge period end efficacy study vaccination placebo recipient initiation long-term persistence study . The study enrol 14,270 subject complete follow-up May 2007 . This substudy close ongoing analysis . The primary result study publish Clinical Infectious Diseases ( Clin Infect Dis . 2012 Nov 15 ; 55 ( 10 ) :1320-1328 ) CSP # 403C , Long-Term Persistence Substudy , initiate March 2006 enrol 6867 vaccine recipient main efficacy study . Enrollment restrict vaccine recipient main efficacy study history herpes zoster . This study initiate complete additional five-years follow-up post-vaccination . The objective study estimate longer-term durability zoster vaccine efficacy follow cohort vaccine recipient primary efficacy study three study outcome : 1 ) incidence herpes zoster , 2 ) incidence postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) , 3 ) burden illness ( BOI ) due herpes zoster . The study complete surveillance new case herpes zoster December 2010 complete follow-up last case herpes zoster February 2011 . All study site close . This substudy complete final analysis phase .</detailed_description>
