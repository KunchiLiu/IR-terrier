	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis renal biopsy , include follow category : A ) Untreated FSGS B ) Steroiddependent FSGS C ) Steroid resistant FSGS D ) Recurrent FSGS , function allograft E ) FSGS ESRD , receive hemodialysis 2 . Adults great equal to18 eligible study . 3 . Children great 20 kilogram , eligible branch study except treatment steroid resistant FSGS pirfenidone , pirfenidone previously administer pediatric patient set . Children le 20 kilogram exclude study follow reason : plasma exchange patient less 20 kilogram require red blood cell transfusion , significantly increase risk procedure expose patient risk transfusion associate infection , safety aggressive course plasma exchange establish population . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Secondary FSGS : HIVassociated FSGS hyperfiltration FSGS , include FSGS associate congenital renal abnormality , renal mass reduction , reflux nephropathy , interstitial nephritis , sickle cell anemia exclude . 2 . Patients disease associate immunosuppression , chronic renal failure . 3 . The presence malignancy history serious , complicate illness myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident past six month , discretion investigator . 4 . For plasma exchange : A Department Transfusion Medicine consultant evaluate potential plasma exchange patient . Those prolonged PT , PTT , platelet count le 100,000 receiving anticoagulant therapy undergo plasma exchange consultant considers safe . 5 . For prednisone : uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( require great 100 unit insulin/day concurrence Endocrinology consultant ) , active infection include hepatitis B C ( advice Hepatology consultant ) , infection HIV ( patient increase risk avascular necrosis ) , active infection ( advice Infectious Disease consultant ) , history avascular necrosis bone densitometry indicate bone mass le 2SD normal , active ulcer disease , history steroidinduced psychosis , morbid obesity , positive PPD history past positive PPD without adequate treatment exclude . 6 . For Cyclophosphamide : A ) Allergy hypersensitivity cyclophosphamide B ) Leukocyte less 3000 cells/microliter ANC le 1500 cells/microliter evidence bone marrow compromise C ) Prior irradiation heart therapy doxorubicin cardiotoxic medication ( may increase risk cardiotoxicity ) D ) Peritoneal dialysis , publish evidence cyclophosphamide metabolites safely remove . E ) Certain drug use caution avoid . Barbiturates phenytoin induce hepatic enzyme metabolize cyclophosphamide therefore medication require , cyclophosphamide dos may need increase achieve comparable immunosuppressive effect . Drugs inhibit cyclophosphamide metabolism include allopurinol , imipramine , phenothiazine , chloramphenicol chlorpromazine ; drug avoid . NSAID increase risk hyponatremia ; drug avoid .</criteria>
