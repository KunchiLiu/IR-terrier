	<brief_summary>Systemic Sclerosis disease may cause immune system react skin certain organ . It possible , change immune system modify progression disease . Stem cell create bone marrow . They mature different type blood cell need include red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . In study , stimulate bone marrow make extra stem cell . Next collect stem cell , select specific cell , store . We give high dose chemotherapy destroy patient immune system . We give back select stem cell collect . We believe select stem cell may able `` re-create '' immune system without portion cause Systemic Sclerosis . The purpose study try discover stem cell transplantation help patient Systemic Sclerosis . We also try learn side effect treatment patient Systemic Sclerosis . We hope treatment help relieve symptoms patient experience , although know .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplant Treat Patients With Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before transplant research participant receive daily G-CSF ( Neupogen ) 5-6 day . This medication help stimulate production white blood cell ( WBC ) use stem cell transplant . The G-CSF give injection arm . If G-CSF stimulate stem cell sufficiently , patient receive single dose drug call cyclophosphamide ( chemotherapy ) intravenously ( vein ) . This drug cause blood cell count fall . A drug call MESNA also give help protect bladder Cyclophosphamide . After complete chemotherapy , patient start G-CSF blood cell count reach certain level , time patient undergo leukopheresis . Leukopheresis procedure blood remove one arm , pump machine white blood cell separate cell return needle needle arm . This procedure usually take 3 4 hour day 4 day row , depend many cell collected time . After collection white blood cell , special agent ( call monoclonal antibody ) use laboratory select certain type white blood cell ( CD34+ cell ) . The blood cell separate machine pick stem cell . After leukopheresis , patient receive drug call cyclophosphamide Mesna . They also receive drug call Atgam radiation treatment entire body . This treatment kill blood form cell bone marrow . We give CD34+ cell collect leukopheresis . After transplant patient follow closely , patient receives stem cell transplant . This follow-up involve blood test see body recover chemotherapy radiation , bone marrow aspiration year 2 year .</detailed_description>
