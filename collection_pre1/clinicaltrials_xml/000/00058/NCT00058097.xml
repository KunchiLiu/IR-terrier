	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine tipifarnib radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . Tipifarnib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining tipifarnib radiation therapy may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival newly diagnose patient glioblastoma multiforme treat R115777 ( possibly ) radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate adult patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme treat R115777 prior therapy radiation . II . To estimate progression free survival newly diagnose patient glioblastoma multiforme treat R115777 ( possibly ) radiation therapy . III . To describe toxicity associate regimen adult patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily 3 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 3 course . RADIOTHERAPY : Within 14 day completion induction therapy , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 6 week . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Two week completion radiotherapy , patient receive additional tipifarnib induction therapy . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 54 patient accrue study within 11-14 month .</detailed_description>
