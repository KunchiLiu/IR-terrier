	<brief_summary>This study use single photon emission compute tomography , SPECT ( see ) , examine brain nicotine receptor evaluate role chemical call acetylcholine memory problem Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Acetylcholine act bind nicotine receptor . Healthy normal volunteer patient Parkinson 's disease 40 year age old , without dementia , may eligible study . Candidates screen physical neurological examination , pen paper test memory mental function , blood test , , woman childbearing potential , pregnancy test . Patients cognition problem intensive mental function test . All participant undergo follow procedure : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change brain . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) . The time require scanner 1 hour , subject ask lie still 10 15 minute time . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . - SPECT : This nuclear medicine test produce picture receptor brain . On night scan , day scan , 4 day scan , subject take oral dose potassium iodide protect thyroid gland radioactive tracer use SPECT procedure . ( People allergic potassium iodide take potassium perchlorate instead . ) Before scan , small radioactive marker contain 99Tc glue subject 's head . Two catheter ( thin , flexible tube ) place vein arm inject radioactive tracer [ 123I ] 5-I-A-85380 draw blood sample . Another catheter place artery wrist draw arterial blood sample . During scan , subject lie bed head hold still head holder . The scan take 6-hour period injection [ 123I ] 5-I-A-85380 . An electrocardiogram , respiration , blood pressure measure take tracer inject , 5 minute injection , 30 60 minute injection . Blood urine sample collect 5 6 hour start scan . Participants ask urinate least every 2 hour 12 hour injection [ 123I ] 5-I-A-85380 decrease radiation exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Study Receptors Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disorder . PD characterize primarily motor impairment , cognitive impairment common dementia may occur 50 % patient . Cholinergic deficits widely demonstrate PD patient without dementia . Cholinergic deficit profound set PD dementia . The cholinergic system mediate aspect learn memory deficit cholinergic function correlate degree dementia PD . Additionally , cholinergic system may mediate certain aspect motor function PD . Data cholinergic function , particularly relate nicotinic cholinergic receptor , limit post mortem study , little known role cholinergic system vivo relate clinical phenomenon . The aim current study ass feasibility usefulness image high affinity alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor vivo , use SPECT ( single photon emission compute tomography ) imaging patient PD . The long-term goal present study understanding role cholinergic system pathogenesis PD elucidate potential diagnostic therapeutic target .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients : Age great equal 40 . Diagnosis PD . Consent . Responsible Caregiver ( patient dementia ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA Controls : Age great equal 40 . Consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Controls : Secondary cause Parkinsonism , e.g . Wilson 's disease , neuroleptic use . Dementia due PD , abnormal screen labs dementia Or severe dementia MMSE le 15 . Neurological disorder PD would effect protocol ( e.g . stroke , Alzheimer 's disease ) . Use cholinergic anticholinergic agent within 60 day . Abnormal MRI mild atrophy . Claustrophobia . Pregnancy breast feeding . Prior participation research protocols clinical care last year radiation exposure would exceed annual limit . Any condition increase risk MRI ( pacemaker , metallic foreign body , etc. ) . Any medical condition opinion investigator would , interfere safe conduct study . Both healthy subject patient exclude moderate hypertension . The subject may antihypertensive medication . The initial screening must show moderate hypertension i.e . le 160/95 . On baseline evaluation day scan ( i.e. , injection tracer ) , subject must asymptomatic ( headache , dizziness , neurological symptom , blur vision ) AND sustain BP less 180/100 . History smoke tobacco , use nicotine gum patch use nicotine within last 5 year . Inability provide consent .</criteria>
