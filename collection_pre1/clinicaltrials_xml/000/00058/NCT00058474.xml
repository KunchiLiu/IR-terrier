	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy either capecitabine fluorouracil without oxaliplatin compare see well work give surgery treat patient resectable rectal cancer . It yet know whether radiation therapy either capecitabine fluorouracil effective without oxaliplatin treat rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Either Capecitabine Fluorouracil With Without Oxaliplatin Before Surgery Treating Patients With Resectable Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare rate local-regional relapse patient resectable rectal cancer treat chemoradiotherapy comprise radiation therapy either capecitabine fluorouracil without oxaliplatin . Secondary - Compare rate clinical complete response patient treat regimen . - Compare rate pathologic complete response patient treat regimen . - Determine increase number patient able undergo sphincter-saving surgery treatment regimen . - Correlate genetic pattern presence absence specific tissue biomarkers response prognosis patient treat regimen . - Compare preoperative quality life ( QOL ) patient treated oral capecitabine versus continuous infusion fluorouracil . - Determine impact oxaliplatin neurotoxicity patient treat regimen . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . - Compare convenience care patient treat regimen . - Determine impact type surgical management QOL 1 5 year postoperatively patient . - Describe long-term impact cancer treatment symptom ( e.g. , vitality neurotoxicity ) QOL 5 year randomization ( 5-year follow-up visit ) . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , gender , clinical tumor stage ( stage II v stage III ) , surgical intent ( sphincter save vs non-sphincter saving ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm 1 : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5-6 week . - Arm 2 : Patients receive fluorouracil undergo radiotherapy arm 1 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 1 hour weekly 5 week . - Arm 3 : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5-6 week . - Arm 4 : Patients receive capecitabine undergo radiotherapy arm 3 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin arm 2 . Within 6-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient respond stable disease undergo surgery . Patients progressive disease treat discretion investigator continue follow . Quality life assess baseline , completion chemoradiotherapy , 1 5 year surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,606 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must consent participate study must sign date IRBapproved consent form conform federal institutional guideline . Patients must &gt; 18 year age . Patients must life expectancy 5 year , exclude diagnosis cancer ( determine investigator ) , must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ( Zubrod ) performance status 0 1 . Patients must diagnosis adenocarcinoma rectum obtain biopsy technique leave major portion tumor intact . The interval initial diagnosis rectal adenocarcinoma randomization must 42 day . Prior randomization , investigator must specify intent sphincter save nonsphincter save surgery . The tumor must either palpable digital rectal exam accessible via proctoscope sigmoidoscope . Distal border tumor must locate &lt; 12 cm anal verge . The tumor must consider surgeon amenable curative resection . ( Note curative resection include pelvic exenteration . ) The tumor must clinically Stage II ( T34 N0 N0 define imaged lymph node &lt; 1.0 cm ) Stage III ( T14 N12 definition clinically positive node node &gt; 1.0 cm ) . Stage primary tumor may determine ultrasound Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan acceptable provided evidence T4 and/or N12 disease . At time randomization , patient must follow within previous 42 day : history physical examination ; technically feasible , complete colonoscopic examination ; feasible , proctoscopic sigmoidoscopic exam ; clinical staging tumor ; CT MRI abdomen pelvis ( combine PET/CT may substitute ) , chest xray ( PA lateral ) CT scan chest exclude patient metastatic disease . At time randomization : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must &gt; 1,200/mm3 ; Platelet count must &gt; 100,000/mm3 ; There must evidence adequate hepatic function follow : total bilirubin must &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) lab ; alkaline phosphatase must &lt; 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) lab ; Aspartate Amino Transferase ( AST ) must &lt; 2.5 x ULN lab ; If AST &gt; ULN , serologic test Hepatitis B C must perform result must negative ; Calculated creatinine clearance must &gt; 50 mL/min . Patients prior malignancy , include invasive colon cancer , eligible diseasefree &gt; 5 year deem physician low risk recurrence . Patients squamous basal cell carcinoma skin , melanoma situ , carcinoma situ cervix , carcinoma situ colon rectum effectively treat eligible , even condition diagnose within 5 year prior randomization . Findings metastatic disease . On imaging , clear indication involvement pelvic side wall ( ) . Rectal cancer adenocarcinoma , i.e. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid , squamous cell carcinoma , cloacogenic carcinoma , etc . History invasive rectal malignancy , regardless diseasefree interval . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Eligible patient reproductive potential ( sex ) must agree use adequate contraceptive method . Any therapy cancer prior randomization . Synchronous colon cancer . History viral hepatitis chronic liver disease . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient receive chemotherapy treatment option would prevent require followup . Specifically exclude patient active ischemic heart disease ( class III* class IV** myocardial disease describe New York Heart Association ) , recent history ( within 6 month ) myocardial infarction , symptomatic arrhythmia time randomization . *Class III : Patients cardiac disease result marked limitation physical activity . Such patient comfortable rest . Less ordinary physical activity cause fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea , anginal pain . **Class IV : Patients cardiac disease result inability perform physical activity without discomfort . Symptoms cardiac insufficiency anginal syndrome may present even rest . Patients , opinion investigator , uncontrolled hypertension . Active inflammatory bowel disease ( i.e. , patient require current medical intervention symptomatic ) . Prior pelvic radiation therapy reason . Known hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil , capecitabine , oxaliplatin . Clinically significant peripheral neuropathy time randomization ( defined NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 3.0 [ CTCAE v3.0 ] grade 2 great neurosensory neuromotor toxicity ) . Existing uncontrolled coagulopathy . Inability take oral medication . Participation investigational drug study within 4 week prior randomization . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement .</criteria>
