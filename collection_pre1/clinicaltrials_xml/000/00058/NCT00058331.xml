	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production treat anemia patient solid tumor . It yet know whether epoetin alfa give week effective epoetin alfa give every 3 week treat anemia . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial study effectiveness epoetin alfa treat anemia patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Treating Anemia Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effect 2 different schedule epoetin alfa decrease transfusion requirement anemic patient nonmyeloid cancer . - Compare effect regimens increase hemoglobin level patient . - Compare effect regimens overall quality life ( QOL ) anemia-specific component QOL patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy ( yes v ) , concurrent platinum-based ( cisplatin carboplatin ) chemotherapy ( yes v ) , degree anemia ( mild [ hemoglobin least 9.0 g/dL ] v severe [ hemoglobin le 9.0 g/dL ] ) , age ( 60 vs 60 ) , type neoplasm ( plasma cell disorder [ include multiple myeloma ] lymphoproliferative disorder [ include non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ] v neoplasms ) . All patient receive epoetin alfa ( EPO ) subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 3 week . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm .</detailed_description>
