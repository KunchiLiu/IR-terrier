	<brief_title>Perifosine Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess PSA response prostate cancer patient biochemical recurrence local curative therapy treat perifosine . II . To assess secondary endpoint ) six-month increase PSA level compare baseline , b ) PSA double time c ) time PSA progression prostate cancer patient receive perifosine . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity agent patient population . IV . To investigate potential molecular marker predictive decrease PSADT possibly PSA response prostate cancer patient receive perifosine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior therapy ( surgery v radiotherapy without brachytherapy v surgery radiotherapy ) original combine Gleason score ( 7 less vs 8-10 ) . Patients receive oral perifosine daily day 1-28 . On day 1 course 1 , patient receive 2 dos oral perifosine . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease PSA alone may receive 3 additional course therapy documentation progression .</detailed_description>
