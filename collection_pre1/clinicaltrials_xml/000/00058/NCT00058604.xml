	<brief_summary>Patients may infect EBV ( Epstein-Barr Virus ) time transplant high risk develop Lymphoproliferative Disease ( LPD ) may already form disease . This research study use Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . These cell train attack kill ( cytotoxic ) EB virus infect cell . We make cell patient blood first grow EBV infect B cell line infect blood EBV virus call B-95 . We treat EBV infect B cell radiation grow use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill EBV infected cell . We test T cell make sure kill EBV infected cell . The purpose study find large safe dose EBV specific CTLs , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help prevent cure EBV relate cancer solid organ transplant patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study one year . Patients receive treatment either hospital outpatient clinic . Each patient enter one three different dose schedule evaluate . Three six patient evaluate dose schedule . Escalation continue unacceptable side effect see . First , patient give Tylenol ( aches/pains ) Benadryl ( minor allergic reaction itching/rash ) . This call premedication . Next , T cell inject patient ' vein ( intravenously ) approximately 10 minute . Patients closely watched time make sure experience bad effect allergic reaction . If patient respond T cell follow-up examination evidence relapse show , patient may receive another ( high ) dose T cell approximately six week first injection . Patients may decide NOT continue receive therapy ( receive injection ) , however , follow-up period still one year . Each patient see every two week clinic contact every two week research nurse member research team , six week injection ( ) . They see contact monthly 3 month every three month one year relapse occur suspect . To learn way T cell work long last body , 40 ml ( 8 teaspoonful ) blood take injection T-cells , every two week 6 week injection , monthly 3 month every 3 month 1 year . This amount blood less small patient . We also take another blood sample patient relapse suspect . Each patient need physical examination physician check progress . Additionally , injection T-cells , every two week injection 6 week every month 3 month every 3 month one year relapse occurs suspect obtain blood sample patient evaluate transplant rejection . The amount blood take 3-5 ml ( 1/2 1 teaspoon ) . If patient receive heart transplant also ask test ultrasound tomography ( similar x-ray ) do help evaluation .</detailed_description>
