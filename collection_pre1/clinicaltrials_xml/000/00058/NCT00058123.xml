	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy poly-ICLC use different way stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study poly-ICLC work treat patient recurrent , progressive , relapse anaplastic glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Poly-ICLC Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Anaplastic Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate patient recurrent progressive anaplastic glioma treat poly ICLC . - Determine efficacy drug , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient . - Determine safety profile drug patient . - Determine survival patient treated drug . - Determine tumor response rate patient treat drug . - Determine biological effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly 3 time week 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-46 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
