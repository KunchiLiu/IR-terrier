	<detailed_description>There heated debate United States extent waterborne infectious disease may transmit human being drink water meet federal standard pathogen removal . This debate even pronounce among elderly immunocompromised person health care provider prolong illness syndrome ( generally gastrointestinal ) even death may occur person ingestion infectious agent . Concerns drink water heighten finding Payment et . al . Canada suggest approximately 25 % `` highly credible '' gastrointestinal illness community might due drink water . Gastrointestinal illness diarrhea recognize significant cause morbidity mortality elderly . One study show 51 % death cause diarrhea 9-year period occur individual age 74 year ( Lew et al . 1991 ) . In review sensitive population , Gerba et al . ( 1996 ) report case fatality rate specific enteric pathogen 10 100 time higher group compare general population . Although many infectious disease problematic elderly decline immune function high incidence pre-existing malnutrition dehydration , still know principal mode transmission infectious agent responsible . Furthermore , study gastrointestinal illness elderly important expand elderly population heighten interest development vaccine strategy . These development necessitate clearer understanding relative contribution various pathogen gastrointestinal illness population . Although many agent responsible gastrointestinal illness previously difficult identify reliably , state-of-the-art laboratory technology , include molecular method , make study feasible . We use laboratory technique identify specific causal agent gastrointestinal illness intervention placebo group estimate relative prevalence pathogen cause gastrointestinal illness . This study randomize , triple-blinded , placebo-controlled , intervention trial elderly population ( i.e . 55 year age ) . The intervention test household-level treatment drinking water joint use ultraviolet light filtration device form point-of-use , countertop unit . The project site city Sonoma , California , adjacent region southern Sonoma County also serve Sonoma County Water Agency , receive drink water ground water aquifer Russian River . The unit randomization intervention individual household . The unit analysis individual participant within household , adjust intra-household clustering ( i.e . within-household correlation ) . The participant , study investigator data analyst blind assignment individual household active placebo device except one study staff member keep randomization code . This un-blinded staff member contact study participant , he/she access data study participant course study . The primary objective determine incidence gastrointestinal disease group households use home drinking water device ( combined filtration/UV light ) group household receive placebo device inactive identical appearance . This information use estimate burden gastrointestinal illness elderly population due consumption , home , drink water meet regulatory standard receive additional treatment . A secondary objective estimate incidence specific bacterial , viral , protozoan agent stool specimen collect elderly individual gastrointestinal symptom , might related water consumption . To determine rate asymptomatic infection , also test stool specimen individual sick . Further question seroprevalence waterborne pathogen immune response elicit answer test serum sample take participant critical juncture study .</detailed_description>
