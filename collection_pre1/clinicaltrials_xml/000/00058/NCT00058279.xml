	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , MDX-010 , work different way stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy interleukin-2 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness combine monoclonal antibody therapy interleukin-2 treating patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-CTLA4 ) combination high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) patient metastatic melanoma . ( Phase I close accrual 4/13/2004 ) . - Determine activity MDX-CTLA4 administer MTD high-dose IL-2 patient . - Determine whether administration IL-2 alters pharmacokinetics MDX-CTLA4 patient . - Determine safety adverse event profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-CTLA4 ) . - Phase I : Patients receive MDX-CTLA4 IV day 0 , 21 , 42 . Patients also receive high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) IV 15 minute every 8 hour 15 dos begin day 22 43 . Treatment repeat every 63 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ongoing partial response great grade 1 toxicity may receive additional course therapy . Patients require discontinuation MDX-CTLA4 due toxicity may continue receive IL-2 discretion investigator . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos MDX-CTLA4 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . ( Phase I close accrual 4/13/2004 ) . - Phase II : Patients receive treatment phase I MTD MDX-CTLA4 . Patients achieve partial complete response later develop recurrent progressive disease may retreat dose . Patients follow 3 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-51 patient ( 3-18 phase I 19-33 phase II ) accrue study within 1 year . ( Phase I close accrual 4/13/2004 ) .</detailed_description>
