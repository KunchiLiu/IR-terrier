	<brief_summary>Patients type blood cell cancer blood problem hard cure standard treatment s/he receive bone marrow transplant . If patient brother sister whose marrow `` perfect match '' , bone marrow come donor whose marrow best match available . This person may close relative unrelated person whose bone marrow best `` match '' patient 's , agree donate marrow . In normal people , Epstein-Barr ( EB ) virus infection cause flu like illness usually get good immune system control infection . The virus , however , remain hidden body life . After transplant , new immune system grow back , EB virus come infect cell cause grow uncontrolled manner . Patients develop fever , swollen lymph node damage organ kidneys lung . This infection act like cancer cell infect EB virus grow quickly know effective treatment . This sort infection occur 10-30 % patient receive transplant donor perfect match , fatal nearly case . This infection occur immune system control growth cell . We want see prevent happen treat give patient kind white blood cell call T cell grown marrow donor . These cell train attack EB virus infect cell . We grow T cell blood take donor time bone marrow harvest . These T cell stimulate donor 's EB virus-infected cell treat radiation grow . After mix cell together able grow special T cell donor attack EB virus infect cell . We collect T cell make sure kill virus infected cell . These EBV specific T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Giving Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) Specific Killer T Lymphocytes Patients Who Have Had Donor Marrow Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We obtain blood donor first make B cell line call lymphoblastoid cell line LCL infect blood laboratory strain EBV call B95 . We use EBV-infected cell line ( treated radiation grow ) stimulator cell mix blood . This stimulation train T cell kill EBV infect cell result growth EBV specific T cell line . We test T cell make sure kill EBV infected cell normal cell freeze . The marrow donor 's T cell thaw injected intravenous line period 10 minute . The subject may premedicated diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) . We would give one dose cell day 45 follow transplant subject agree well enough . If EBV DNA level remain high subject persistent disease , s/he may eligible receive 5 additional injection T cell original dose monthly interval . After subject receive T cell , s/he contact research nurse another member study team weekly 6 week , every three month year check his/her progress . We continue follow subject BMT clinic injection . To learn way T cell work , extra 40 ml ( 8 teaspoonful ) blood take pre-infusion , 4 hour infusion , 3-4 day post infusion ( optional ) 1 , 2 , 4 6 week T cell infusion , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month post infusion . The blood come central intravenous line , require extra needle stick .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient receive T cell deplete BMT mismatch family member unrelated donor eligible protocol . In addition , patient receive match sibling transplant T replete transplant may eligible high risk develop EBV LPD underlie disease ( e.g WiskottAldrich Ataxia Telangiectasia ) past history EBVLPD EBV associate malignancy . O2 saturation &gt; 90 % room air EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion BMT detail relevant protocol . Exclusion criteria time administration CTLs : Patients GVHD Grade II great . Patients severe renal disease ( i.e. , creatinine clearance less half normal age ) . Patients severe hepatic disease ( bilirubin great twice normal , SGOT great 3 x normal ) . Patients severe intercurrent infection . Patients life expectancy &lt; 6 week</criteria>
