	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy gemcitabine capecitabine use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine gemcitabine capecitabine treat patient advance renal cell cancer ( kidney cancer ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0312 , Gemcitabine Capecitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Renal Cell ( Kidney ) Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial ) patient advance renal cell cancer treat gemcitabine capecitabine . - Determine 6-month time treatment failure rate overall survival rate patient treat regimen . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . - Correlate , preliminarily , tumor response intratumoral content enzyme involve activation degradation drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 38 patient accrue study within 3.8-4.2 month .</detailed_description>
