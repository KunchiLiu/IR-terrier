	<brief_summary>This study examine whether certain polymorphism ( small gene variance ) predispose people develop age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . This eye condition affect people 50 year age cause permanent loss central vision . The study examine compare frequency polymorphisms patient AMD individual without AMD . This information help identify genetic risk factor AMD may lead development effective treatment . Patients 50 year age old advanced AMD healthy normal volunteer may eligible study . All participant provide eye health history 10 milliliter ( 2 teaspoon ) blood drawn arm vein . The DNA blood isolate test certain gene research indicate important age age-related disease . The normal polymorphic gene sequence identify compare patient AMD control subject determine polymorphism relate development AMD . In addition , control subject routine eye examination , include dilation pupil examination back eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause irreversible severe central visual loss old 50 world.1 The incidence progression feature AMD known increase significantly age.2-4 In recent study , Klein et al . report approximately 15.6 % US population age 60 year old 2005-2008 sign AMD.5 In study Iceland , prevalence early AMD 12.4 % age 66 74 year 36 % age 85 year older.6 Currently United States , advance AMD affect 1.75 million people number increase 2.95 million year 2020.7 Epidemiological study genome wide association study ( GWAS ) , candidate gene association , linkage disequilibrium suggest AMD significant genetic component.7-10 Ample evidence support hypothesis variance gene involve DNA repair,11-13 oxidative stress14 , 15 inflammation16-20 play role age age-related disease . Many study document association polymorphism complement factor ( CF ) , oxidative stress , apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) , mitochondrion chaperone proteins gene AMD.21-23 Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ApoE , ApoE C2/BF may protect AMD . On hand , SNP CFH , AMRS2/HTRA-1 CX3CR1 gene may increase AMD risk.24 In study , would like test whether variation biologically plausible gene ( modify gene ) list differentially distributed AMD patient normal population . To end , choose gene believe play crucial role age process analyze frequency SNPs specifically within cod frame biologically plausible gene responsible age age-related disease . Our aim compare allelic frequency candidate gene list cohort AMD frequency normal control subject without AMD . With study hope identify genetic risk factor could functional implication understand treat AMD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : AMD Patients ( case ) : 1 . Diagnosis advance AMD define geographic atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization drusen size least one eye . 2 . Age 50 year old . 3 . If sample previously donate different study , patient give permission use sample ( i.e . marked appropriate selection inform consent ) . Control Patients ( control ) : 1 . Absence drusen 5 drusen less 63 micron , absence diagnostic criterion AMD . 2 . Agrees undergo study examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Presence retinal disease involve photoreceptors and/or out retinal layer AMD loss high myopia , retinal dystrophy , central serous retinopathy , vein occlusion , diabetic retinopathy uveitis similar outer retinal disease present prior age 50 . 2 . Opacities ocular medium , limitation papillary dilation problem sufficient preclude adequate stereo fundus photography . These condition include occlude pupil due synechiae , cataract , vitreous haze opacity due ocular disease .</criteria>
