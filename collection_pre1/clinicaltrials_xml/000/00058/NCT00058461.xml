	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well rituximab together ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide work treat young patient recurrent refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Chemotherapy drug , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Rituximab Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response pediatric patient relapse refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia treat ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide combine rituximab . II . Determine relapse-free survival rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine toxicity profile regimen patient , specifically frequency therapy delay course due prolong grade IV hematologic toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether regimen plus filgrastim ( G-CSF ) result mobilization great 2 X 10^6/kg peripheral blood stem cell ( CD34+ cell , PBSC ) least 80 % patient peripheral stem cell collection perform . II . Determine time course engraftment patient undergo peripheral stem cell transplantation collection stem cell use mobilization regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratified disease ( B-cell large cell lymphoma atypical precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma v small non-cleaved cell lymphoma B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ) . Patients receive ifosfamide IV 2 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 3-5 , rituximab IV day 1 3 , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 3 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin day 6 continue blood count recover . Patients also receive intrathecal ( IT ) chemotherapy comprise methotrexate cytarabine . Patients B-cell large cell lymphoma negative CSF cytology receive IT chemotherapy day 3 first course . Patients small non-cleaved cell lymphoma B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia negative CSF cytology receive IT chemotherapy day 3 . All patient positive CSF cytology receive IT chemotherapy day 3 , 10 , 17 first second course . Treatment repeat every 23 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42-82 patient ( 21-41 per disease stratum ) accrue study within 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
