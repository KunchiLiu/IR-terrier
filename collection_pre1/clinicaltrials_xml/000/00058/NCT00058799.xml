	<brief_summary>This research study determine safety dosage special cell may make patient immune system fight leukemia . To put special gene cell call fibroblast grown laboratory skin sample . The gene put fibroblast make produce substance call CD40 Ligand ( CD40L ) interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . These natural substance may help immune system kill leukemia cell . Some fibroblast produce CD40L IL-2 mixed small quantity leukemic cell put back body . Studies cancer animal cell line suggest substance like CD40L IL-2 mixed cancer cell help body recognize kill cancer cell . A treatment use IL-2 previously use 40 child neuroblastoma similar treatment use adult cancer . Some patient show significant tumor response . However , know treatment work know right amount special cell use , different patient get different combination number cell . The purpose study learn side effect safe dosage special cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating High Risk Leukemia With CD40 Ligand &amp; IL-2 Gene Modified Tumor Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before start treatment part study , leukemia cell skin fibroblast collect patient - call `` procurement '' - allow u make vaccine . These leukemia cell take either peripheral blood , leukopheresis product bone marrow . The fibroblast prepare laboratory specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry IL-2 CD40L gene . The virus `` drop '' gene inside fibroblast . The CD40L IL-2 gene mean help stimulate immune system fight leukemia . The modified fibroblast inject number leukemic cell skin . All cell irradiate injection stop growing . Patients receive three shot . Depending response , patient may able three additional shot . In order collect skin fibroblast begin study , study , perform small skin biopsy . In particular second shot , 1 week later , look modify leukemia cell re-injected skin . We take skin biopsy place cell inject . The area skin biopsy obtain sterilize numbed local act agent . The skin remove `` tissue punch '' cut circle approximately 1/4th inch skin . The site skin remove closed suture , tape stitch . The area cover dry gauze adhesive tape . These test see whether shot kill leukemia cell make sure leukemia cell grow injection site . To study immunity work system , take blood sample first injection , weekly 10 week , week 12 , month year , eventually year fifteen year . These sample approximately 1 tablespoon blood , consider safe amount . If patient additional injection , blood drawn prior injection . Additional office visit may necessary . Also , patient need bone marrow test enrol study week 12 . If patient responding , may treatment chemotherapy radiation . Patients need come clinic day blood draw see Texas Children 's Cancer Center/The Methodist Hospital weekly interval 10 week , every week 6 week , monthly year . Thereafter , patient either see clinic contact one research staff work study year 15 year . Additional visit may necessary .</detailed_description>
