	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety vary route dose monoclonal antibody ACA125 anti-idiotype vaccine patient ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . - Determine optimal dose route vaccine phase II study . - Determine immune response induced vaccination patient . - Determine time development objective tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive lower-dose monoclonal antibody ACA125 anti-idiotype vaccine ( MOAB ACA125 ) intramuscularly ( IM ) week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 IM arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive lower-dose MOAB ACA125 subcutaneously ( SC ) week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm IV : Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 SC arm III . Patients follow every 6-12 week 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient ( 10 patient per cohort ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
