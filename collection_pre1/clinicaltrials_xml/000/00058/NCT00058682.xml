	<brief_summary>Fluconazole FDA-approved drug widely use treat fungal infection due candida . The experimental drug anidulafungin find active treat life-threatening fungal infection . The purpose study determine whether anidulafungin effective fluconazole treat candidemia , invasive form candidiasis . Three hundred patient 16 year age old participate study . Participants randomly assign one two group : one-half receive anidulafungin ; half receive fluconazole . They receive drug 10 day 42 day , depend seriousness infection . The drug give four-hour period first day , two hour remain day . While take study medication , participant require give blood sample every week end treatment . At two week six week follow end therapy , participant return evaluation . Prior participation study , patient undergo follow evaluation : physical exam , eye exam , electrocardiogram , possibly blood work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anidulafungin Versus Fluconazole Treatment Candidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , randomize , double-blind , non-inferiority , multi-center trial safety efficacy anidulafungin versus fluconazole patient candidemia form invasive candidiasis . The objective study determine anidulafungin least effective fluconazole treatment patient diagnosis candidemia and/or form invasive candidiasis . The secondary objective compare safety two study drug determine efficacy prevention late Candida infection patient treat anidulafungin versus fluconazole . Assuming 25 % patient unevaluable end intravenous therapy , 248 patient enrol obtain total 222 evaluable patient . Patients older 16 year age candidemia invasive candidiasis randomize receive either anidulafungin fluconazole . Patients randomized anidulafungin receive IV load dose day one 200mg follow 100mg daily . Patients randomized fluconazole receive IV load dose day one 800mg follow IV daily dose 400mg . Patients maintain IV therapy minimum 10 day maximum 42 day . After 10 day therapy , patient either study drug may treat ambulatory basis oral fluconazole therapy .</detailed_description>
