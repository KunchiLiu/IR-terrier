	<brief_summary>Severe chronic active Epstein-Barr virus ( SCAEBV ) rare Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV commonly know mono kiss disease ) associate disorder . This disorder may cause chronic tiredness fever sometimes complicate life threaten problem multi-organ failure , chronic ( ongoing ) pneumonia , lymphoproliferative disease ( disease involve lymph node could eventually show leukemia tumor ) . The reason body 's inability control EBV infection still unknown effective treatment currently available . This research study use Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . We want see grow special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill EBV infected cell laboratory see cell may help control EBV infection give back patient . The purpose study find large safe dose EBV specific CTLs , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help body fight SCAEBV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Severe Chronic Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) Infection With EBV Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes ( CTLs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten sixty ml ( 2-12 teaspoon ) blood collect patient use grow T cell . These T cell stimulate EBV infected cell ( treat radiation grow ) . This stimulation train T cell kill EBV infected cell . We test T cell make sure kill EBV infected cell . Therapy take place one specifically designated outpatient clinic hospital admission require . First , patient give dos Tylenol ( aches/pains ) Benadryl ( minor allergic reaction itching/rash ) . Next , T cell inject vein 10 minute period . Patients closely watched side effect . If patient show response treatment may receive three additional T cell injection three month interval . Patients need see every week clinic six week injection . Following , patient either see clinic contact one research staff work study , month one year . To learn way T cell work long last body , extra 40 ml ( 8 teaspoonful ) blood take visit . Additionally , 3 ml ( 1/2 teaspoonful ) blood take prior infusion monthly thereafter conduct CBC ( test look component blood ) .</detailed_description>
