	<brief_summary>Treatment phase : The purpose study evaluate safety immune response elicit new anti-cancer therapy patient breast cancer remission high risk relapse . The study product immunotherapeutic consist recombinant dHER2 protein combine immunostimulant call AS15 . The study aim determine optimal three different dose level dHER2 combine fix dose AS15 assess safety immune response elicit series injection study product . Five-year follow-up phase : This part study aim assess late onset toxicity study treatment yearly follow-up visit monitor patient ' survival disease status five year last administration study treatment . The patient ' immune response also measure assess robustness immune response elicit study treatment .</brief_summary>
