	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective overall response rate patient relapse refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat BMS-247550 ( ixabepilone ) . II . Determine safety toxicity drug patient . III . Determine duration response , overall survival , time progression patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient becomes candidate stem cell transplantation . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression .</detailed_description>
