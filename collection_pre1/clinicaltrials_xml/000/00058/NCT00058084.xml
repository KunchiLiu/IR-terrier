	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study ixabepilone see well work compare mitoxantrone prednisone treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond paclitaxel , docetaxel , hormone therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Some tumor become resistant chemotherapy drug . Ixabepilone may reduce resistance drug allow tumor cell kill . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective treat metastatic prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Compared With Mitoxantrone Prednisone Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy ixabepilone ( BMS-247550 ) v mitoxantrone prednisone , term decline prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level , patient taxane-resistant , hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety regimens patient . II . Determine objective response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . III . Determine clinical activity regimens crossover patient experience disease progression originally assign treatment arm switch treatment arm . OUTLINE : This randomize , crossover , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive ixabepilone ( BMS-247550 ) IV 3 hour day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive mitoxantrone IV 30 minute day 1 oral prednisone twice daily day 1-21.In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress treatment least 2 course discontinue treatment reason may cross arm receive treatment , begin within 12 week last study treatment original arm . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
