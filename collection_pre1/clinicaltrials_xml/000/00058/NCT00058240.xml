	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose flavopiridol administer 30 minute load dose follow 4-hour infusion weekly 4 consecutive week every 6 week . II . To determine safety feasibility perform dose escalation 80 mg/m2 ( 30 mg/m2 30-minute IV bolus follow 50 mg/m2 4-hour IV infusion ) begin dose 2 patient experience severe tumor lysis require hemodialysis dose 1 . III . To determine pharmacokinetics cellular pharmacodynamics flavopiridol administer schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response ( CR ) overall response rate ( CR + PR ) flavopiridol patient previously-treated CLL administer 30 minute load dose follow 4 hour infusion weekly 4 consecutive week every 6 week . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive load dose flavopiridol IV 30 minute follow 4-hour infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 6 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos flavopiridol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After MTD determine , 12 additional patient accrue treat recommended phase II dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 month every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
