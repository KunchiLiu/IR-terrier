	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine bryostatin 1 vincristine treat patient progressive relapse non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma autologous bone marrow transplantation autologous stem cell transplantation . Drugs use chemotherapy vincristine use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Bryostatin 1 may help vincristine kill cancer cell make cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 Plus Vincristine Treating Patients With Progressive Relapsed Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma After Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate bryostatin 1 give combination vincristine patient low intermediate grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma progress relapse follow autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant . II . To determine blunt apoptotic response ( two consecutive apoptotic fraction ) follow treatment use annexin V stain peripheral blood CD5+ CD19+ lymphocytes flow cytometry predictive outcome ( i.e . lack clinical response ) . III . To prospectively evaluate incidence &gt; grade 3 myelotoxicity regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV 24 hour day 1 15 vincristine IV day 2 16 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without disease progression 6 course may continue therapy bryostatin 1 IV 24 hour day 1 22 vincristine IV day 2 23 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2-5 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
