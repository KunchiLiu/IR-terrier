	<brief_summary>This research study determine safety dosage special cell may make patient immune system fight cancer . To , put special gene cancer cell take patient . This do laboratory . This gene make cell produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , natural substance may help immune system kill cancer cell . Additionally , stimulate cancer cell another natural protein call CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) , preclinical human animal study suggest help IL-2 perform well . Some cell put back body . The cell grow normal embryonic fibroblast . Studies cancer animal cancer cell grown laboratory suggest combine substance like IL-2 CD40L help body kill cancer cell . The purpose study learn side effect safest effective dose special cell disease</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before start treatment cancer cell take patient separated laboratory . A specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry IL-2 gene put cell . The rest cancer cell stimulate express surface substance call human CD40 ligand . These substance ( IL-2 CD40L ) , already naturally present body , mean help immune system fight cancer . In study , modify cancer cell inject skin . There six shot . We know best amount special cell use , different patient get different number cell . After first three shot ( modified cancer cell available ) , patient may able three additional shot . After receive six shot , may able additional shot cancer get small cell available . A complete history physical examination necessary patient enrol study . A physical examination also perform weekly ten week injection , week twelve , monthly one year . Patients yearly checkup next fifteen year . After first second shot , remove modify cell injected skin , study . We remove section skin ( refer skin biopsy ) place cell inject . These test help u see whether modified cell kill cancer cell whether cancer cell grow . If suspect cancer cell grow , may repeat procedure third fourth shot . To study immunity work patient system , take blood sample first injection , weekly 10 week , week 12 , month year , eventually year fifteen year . These blood sample must take The Methodist Hospital . The total amount blood obtain approximately two three tablespoonful , consider safe amount . If patient additional injection , blood drawn prior injection . Additional office visit may necessary . If patient decides withdraw time study sample data collect study maintain identifier safety reason .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible administration vaccine present BCLL ( Richter 's transformation ) ( group A ) without ( group B ) measurable disease . Untreated complete remission patient enrol vaccine administration therapeutic ( i.e . chemotherapy ) window three month . If three month ( necessary complete vaccine study ) patient present rapid clinical progression , exclude current study receive treatment accord standard institutional guideline . IMPORTANT NOTE : Vaccine production complete remission patient achieve tumor cell collect BEFORE enter complete remission . Patients must life expectancy least 10 week . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior chemotherapy enter study , must absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 500/uL , absolute lymphocyte count &gt; /= 200/uL , hemoglobin &gt; /= 8g/dL platelet count &gt; /= 50,000/uL . Patients must infect time protocol entry , receive antibiotic ( prophylactic trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole ) . Patients must HIVnegative . Patients must willing practice appropriate birth control method study 3 month study conclude . Patients must suffer autoimmune disease ( include active graftversushost diseaseGvHD , refractory immune thrombocytopeniaITP refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemiaAIHA ) receive immunosuppressive drug . Patients must adequate liver function ( total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5mg/dl , SGOT &lt; /= 2 time normal , normal prothrombin time ) . Patients must adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 3 time normal age creatinine clearance &gt; 80mg/min/1.73m2 ) . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware research study tell possible benefit toxic sideeffects . Patients give copy consent form . Patient must receive treatment investigational agent within last 4 week . Richter 's transformation ( aggressive nonHodgkin 's lymphoma ) active infection significant autoimmune disease ( include active GvHD , ITP AIHA ) requirement immunosuppressive drug inadequate liver and/or renal function pregnancy lactation refusal practice birth control method seropositive HIV life expectancy le 10 week</criteria>
