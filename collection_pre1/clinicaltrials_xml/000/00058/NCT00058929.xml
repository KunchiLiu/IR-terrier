	<brief_summary>This trial study Remodulin patient pulmonary arterial hypertension transition Flolan therapy . The study consist Screening , Baseline Treatment Phases . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion Screening Phase enter Baseline Phase , baseline exercise capacity , vital sign , clinical sign symptom disease assess . After confirmation inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient assign study drug ( Remodulin placebo ) enter Treatment Phase . The Treatment Phase begin Dose Transition Period , patient begin receive subcutaneous study drug low dose determine patient 's current dose Flolan . The study drug dose increase gradually Flolan dose decrease gradually period 14 day . The dose change continue Flolan therapy discontinue patient stable study drug . Patients transition Flolan , stable study drug discharge clinic , continue receive study drug outpatient basis . The patient return clinic Weeks 4 8 assessment . Patients remain study drug 8 week first dose study drug . At Week 8 , final assessment conduct patient dismiss study . Patients successfully complete Week 8 assessment may offer Remodulin therapy therapy , investigator 's discretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Transition Study From Flolan® Remodulin® Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial multicenter , randomize , parallel placebo-controlled study Remodulin patient pulmonary arterial hypertension WHO Functional Class II III clinical status transition Flolan therapy . The study consist Screening , Baseline Treatment Phases . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion Screening Phase enter Baseline Phase , baseline exercise capacity , vital sign , clinical sign symptom disease assess . After confirmation inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient randomize study drug ( 1:1 Remodulin : placebo ) enter Treatment Phase . The Treatment Phase begin Dose Transition Period , patient begin receive subcutaneous study drug low dose determine patient 's current dose Flolan . The study drug dose increase gradually Flolan dose decrease gradually period 14 day . The dose change do accord recommended schedule , may modify necessary accord patient 's clinical status . The dose change continue Flolan therapy discontinue patient stable study drug , patient meet primary endpoint criterion . Patients transition Flolan , stable study drug , demonstrate ability properly self-administer study drug discharge clinic , continue receive study drug outpatient basis . The patient return clinic Weeks 4 8 assessment . At week Weeks 1 , 4 , 8 , site staff contact patient ass progress adjust study drug dose necessary . Patients remain study drug 8 week first dose study drug . At Week 8 , final assessment conduct patient dismiss study . Patients successfully complete Week 8 assessment may offer Remodulin therapy therapy , investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>

Be receive Flolan dose least 15 ng/kg/min , 75 ng/kg/min , maintain current dose Flolan unchanged least 30 day screen . Unless contraindicate , able receive one follow anticoagulant : warfarin achieve INR 2.0 3.0 heparin produce aPTT 1.3 1.5 time control , unless high level clinically indicate . Be mentally physically capable learn administer study drug use subcutaneous infusion pump . Exclusion Criteria Patients must : Be nurse pregnant woman ( woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test ) .
