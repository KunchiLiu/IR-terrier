	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Suramin may increase effectiveness fluorouracil make tumor cell sensitive drug . This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose fluorouracil chemosensitizer suramin see well work treat patient metastatic renal cell ( kidney ) cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil Low-Dose Suramin Chemosensitization Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell ( Kidney ) Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose suramin fluorouracil would result plasma concentration suramin 10-50 uM patient metastatic renal cell cancer . ( Phase I ) II . Determine objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine preliminary efficacy regimen patient . ( Phase I ) II . Determine pharmacokinetics low-dose suramin patient . ( Phase I ) III . Determine time tumor progression progress rate 3 6 month patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation phase I study follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive suramin IV 30 minute fluorouracil IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos suramin fluorouracil dose level allow 10-50 uM suramin patient 's blood determine without 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive suramin fluorouracil ( dose level determine phase I ) phase I . In phase , course repeat every 8 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
