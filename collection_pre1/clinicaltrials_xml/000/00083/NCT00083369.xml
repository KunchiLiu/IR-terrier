	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertriglyceridemia emerge important predictor atherosclerosis , recent evidence suggest related phenotype triglyceride ( TGs ) , TG remnant particle small lactate dehydrogenase ( LDL ) particle , particularly atherogenic . There considerable variation response TGs relate phenotype environment . The study response Request Applications ( RFA ) entitle `` Interaction Genes Environment Shaping Risk Factors Heart , Lung , Blood , Sleep Disorders '' . The RFA release October , 2001 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Measurements collect dietary fat challenge ass postprandial TGs relate atherogenic phenotype ( VLDL TGs , chylomicron TGs , TG remnant particle , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) low density lipid ( LDL ) particle size , total cholesterol , LDL-C , HDL-C ) . In family 2 member sibship high TGs ( &gt; = 130 mg/dl ) , author conduct short-term , placebo-controlled , randomized trial fenofibrate willing eligible family member ( anticipated sample size = 1,200 ) . A two-period crossover design execute 2-week washout two 3-week treatment period ( placebo micronized fenofibrate , 160 mg ) . About 1,000 family member Marshfield genome marker set available part national Heart Lung Blood ( NHLBI ) FHS ; remain 1,400 type use marker set . They conduct genome-wide linkage analysis use state-of-the-art method localize novel genetic locus contribute TG response context fat load fenofibrate treatment . They type 15 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) ten candidate gene know contribute response TGs dietary fat fenofibrate , create haplotype association study . They use combinatorial partitioning method neural network test association individual SNPs haplotype response two environmental intervention . The identification genetic locus predict TG response presence two disparate context , fat load fibrate therapy , may provide insight genetic pathway ( ) predispose hypertriglyceridemia , ultimately lead avenue primary prevention , ( b ) predict response TG lowering , lead new drug target hypertriglyceridemia .</detailed_description>
