	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It well recognize increase exercise associate number health benefit , include decrease level obesity improvement lipoprotein level . Differences find exist , however , individual response increase exercise , suggest genetic factor may involve mediate response . The elucidation specific gene responsible difference manner interact increase exercise influence lipoprotein level body weight would contribute significantly increase current understanding way gene environment operate determine characteristic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : As part National Runners ' Health Study , Dr. Williams colleague identify 1,350 runner identical ( MZ ) twin . Their recruitment experience show additional 3,120 MZ twin locate nationally Runner 's World race participation program.Twenty-eight percent MZ twin pair expect discordant vigorous exercise ( sedentary versus run 10 mile per week ) otherwise eligible study . The investigator propose obtain blood genotyping , detailed lipoprotein subfraction measurement , clinic weight , proximal ( diet record ) long-term ( food frequency questionnaire ) nutrient intakes 400 discordant MZ twin pair test whether gene affect lipoprotein weight response vigorous exercise . The analysis assume sedentary twin represent ( theoretically ) body weight lipoprotein concentration active twin sedentary . They compare co-twin lipoprotein weight difference across genotype adjust diet . Candidate gene include single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) identify others affect lipoprotein , weight , propensity exercise , mitigate response lipoproteins exercise . They also compare co-twin phenotype difference SNPs haplotypes linkage disequilibrium map suggest characterize major genetic variation gene affect lipoprotein metabolism . The lipoprotein include detailed measurement high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) subclasses use gradient gel electrophoresis . The individual HDL subclass also analyze separate HDL immunoaffinity chromatography particle contain apo A-I apo A-II ( HDL ( A-I A-II ) ) contain apo A-I apo A-II ( HDL ( A-I without A-II ) ) . The design provide advantage cross-sectional association study ( large phenotypic effect ) training study ( control genotype ) without self-selection bias cross-sectional association study small phenotypic response training study . Their first pilot study 35 pair MZ twin reveal 5.2 mg/dL difference HDL-cholesterol 12 pound weight difference active sedentary twin . By comparison , major recent training study produce small average increase HDL cholesterol ( men : l.1 mg/dL ; woman : l.4 mg/dL ) small decrease weight ( men : 0.9 pound ; woman : 0.4 pound ) 20 week training . The large effect size discordant twin study provide great statistical power detect gene-environment interaction train study . DNA sample share institution cross-validate gene association identify train study design .</detailed_description>
