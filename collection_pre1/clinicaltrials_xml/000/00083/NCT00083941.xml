	<brief_title>A Study TroVax Vaccine Given Conjunction With IL-2 Treatment Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary - To assess safety tolerability TroVax injection give therapeutic vaccine patient metastatic renal cell cancer - To assess immune response induce treatment TroVax Secondary - To assess impact treatment TroVax tumour response rate , time disease progression two year survival . Study design This open label evaluation combination TroVax IL-2 . The dosage regimen injection TroVax give three weekly interval commence treatment IL-2 ( one treatment ) conjunction IL-2 four treatment . Following completion treatment IL-2 , booster injection TroVax give three monthly interval three injection patient whose disease respond stabilises treatment IL-2 TroVax . The first dose TroVax give alone allow initial safety assessment . The second dose give standard institutional regimen high dose IL-2 . IL-2 give 5 consecutive day every three week two ( typically four ) cycle provide patient respond treatment ( i.e . tumour response stabilisation ) . The first dose IL-2 give start day second TroVax injection . If patient tolerate treatment IL-2 , dose TroVax continue three weekly cycle total 5 injection give ( week 12 ) . Following , TroVax booster give every six , nine 12 month provide disease remain stable respond . The total treatment period may last 12 month follow period 12 month ( total study period 24 month ) . All patient follow assess tolerability , induction humoural cellular immunity 5T4 cell surface antigen immune response vector . The tumour restaged every two cycle IL-2 treatment CT scan , accordance current institutional clinical guideline . Once treatment IL-2 stop , boost restaging occur every 3 month total treatment period one year . Once treatment stop , patient follow twelve month , CT scan every 3 month ( standard care ) . If end period , patient still stable respond disease , patient follow three monthly interval disease progression occurs . If patient ' disease progress stage serious severe adverse drug reaction relate TroVax occur , treatment TroVax cease patient keep study follow three monthly study 24 month . Other treatment cancer record CRF . A total 25 patient enrol . Study population Inclusion criterion 1 .

Able give write informed consent comply protocol . 13 . Women must either post menopausal , render surgically sterile practise reliable form contraception ( hormonal , intrauterine device barrier ) . Men must practise effective form birth control , barrier protection . 14 . Normal cardiac stress test patient older 50 year age symptoms cardiac disease . 15 . Normal pulmonary function test patient smoker know primary lung disease . Exclusion criteria 1 . Pregnancy , lactation lack effective contraception fertile men woman childbearing potential . 2 . Intercurrent serious infection within 28 day prior entry trial . 3 . Known HIV positive HIV infection lead serious adverse event vaccination and/or high-dose IL-2 . 4 . Life threaten illness unrelated cancer . 5 . Cerebral metastasis . 6 . History allergic response previous vaccinia vaccination . 7 . Participation clinical trial within previous 30 day . 8 . Previous malignancy within last two year successfully treat squamous carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix treat cone biopsy . 9 . Previous history major psychiatric disorder require hospitalisation current psychiatric disorder would impede patient 's ability provide inform consent comply protocol . 10 . Corticosteroids unless use antiemetic . 11 . Family contact active eczema , exfoliative skin disorder , pregnancy cause immunocompromise . Withdrawal criteria 1 . Non-compliance protocol . 2 . Patient request . 3 . Physician decision . 4 . Concurrent involvement clinical trial drug . Treatment plan method This open label evaluation combination TroVax IL-2 . The dosage regimen three injection TroVax give every three week . The first vaccine give alone . The second third vaccine give week 3 6 IL-2 commence immediately vaccination . If evidence disease progression week 9 CT scan ( chest , abdomen , pelvis ) , additional two cycle TroVax IL-2 give week 9 12 . Following completion treatment IL-2 , booster injection TroVax give three monthly interval three injection , provide patient stable respond disease . Patients comply entry criterion invite enter study . After give fully inform consent , patient subject medical history physical examination document general fitness proceed trial . Previous exposure small pox vaccine note . The diagnosis confirm histologically patient 's record . If possible , retained sample obtain stain 5T4 . If fresh sample take , may cryopreserved also examine 5T4 . At time , metastasis document use relevant CT scan ( chest , abdomen , pelvic ) . An MRI scan brain obtain . A cardiac stress test pulmonary function test obtain appropriate patient . Blood also draw haematology clinical chemistry , full blood count differential white cell platelet count , urea electrolyte , liver function test ( total bilirubin , AST , ALT , GGT , alkaline phosphatase ) , serum protein , calcium , phosphate , glucose creatinine ) , pituitary hormone screen ( ACTH , TSH , LH , FSH ; ) , antinuclear anti-skeletal muscle antibody immunological testing ( antibodies 5T4 vector , cellular response 5T4 ; 100 ml ) . In potentially fertile woman , pregnancy test obtain . A urine sample obtain urinalysis protein blood . This screen occur two week immunisation schedule begin . At week 0 , patient immunise single intramuscular injection 1 ml TroVax 10x . This dose give without IL-2 . Then , every three four week four injection , TroVax give morning . These dos may give conjunction IL-2 . Immediately injection , blood drawn immunological testing ( 100 ml ) . Before injection , blood also draw clinical pathology ( full blood count clinical chemistry ) . A urine sample obtain urinalysis protein blood . IL-2 give intravenously ( IV ) dose 600,000 IU/kg every eight hour 15 injection cycle . The first dose give afternoon day second TroVax injection . These cycle TroVax IL-2 repeat every 3-4 week depend upon patient tolerance clinical response . Cycles IL-2 always commence afternoon TroVax give morning . If IL-2 tolerate , may suspend treatment TroVax continue long well tolerate . TroVax may give three month ( i.e . injection 5 ) patient progressive disease long anticancer treatment ( i.e . chemotherapy , interferon alpha radiotherapy ) consider indicated . CT scan ( chest abdomen , pelvis ) obtain restage disease week 9-10 15-16 ( i.e . two four dos IL-2 and/or 3 5 dos TroVax ) . A blood sample immunological testing ( 100 ml ) obtain three eight week fifth TroVax injection ( 4 5 month ) . Following CT scan 15-16 week patient follow three monthly interval , commence six month . Patients whose disease progress point may treat TroVax may keep study observe three monthly interval . Patients whose disease stabilise respond offer three injection TroVax month 6 , 9 12 . Patients whose disease progress experience serious severe adverse event related TroVax stop treatment TroVax may keep study review three monthly interval . If patient require treatment establish anticancer agent , record CRF . At visit , week 12 month 12 , regardless disease status , blood obtain ( prior injection TroVax , indicate ) clinical pathology , pituitary hormone screen , autoantibodies immunological testing ( 100 ml ) . A urine sample obtain urinalysis protein blood . The disease restaged use CT scan ( chest abdomen , pelvis ) . When TroVax administer , patient return 3 week TroVax injection immunological testing ( 100 ml ) . After month 12 , patient return three monthly interval 12 month . At visit , disease restaged use CT scan ( chest abdomen , pelvis ) accordance current institutional guideline . Blood ( 100 ml ) obtain immunological testing , autoantibody pituitary function test . A urine sample obtain urinalysis protein blood . Patients , end period , stable respond disease may follow three monthly interval disease progression occurs .</detailed_description>
