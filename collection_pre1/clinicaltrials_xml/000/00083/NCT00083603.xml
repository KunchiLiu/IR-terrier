	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Two HIV Vaccine Formulations ( rMVA-HIV rFPV-HIV ) Alone Combination HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pox virus use investigational vaccine human accommodate large amount foreign DNA , infect mammalian cell , access cytotoxic T-cell response believe important control HIV infection disease . Two pair match recombinant HIV vaccine develop use study . One pair use modify vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) vector pair use fowlpox vector ( FPV ) . Each vaccine pair consist one vaccine contain env/gag sequence one vaccine contain modify tat/rev/nef-RT sequence . The HIV sequence identical vertically transmit pediatric primary isolate . The control study MVA vector FPVs without HIV gene . The study evaluate safety immunogenicity vaccine pair . There two part study . Participants Part A randomly assign one five different vaccination group . Within group , participant randomly assign receive either vaccine control injection . Group 1 participant receive FPV vaccine pair FPV control vaccine visit . Groups 2 , 3 , 4 receive one three different dos MVA vaccine pair MVA control study entry Month 1 , fix dose FPV vaccine pair FPV control Months 3 , 5 , 7 . Group 5 participant receive MVA vaccine pair MVA control maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vaccine visit . Groups 1 2 enroll simultaneously ; Groups 3 , 4 , 5 enroll safety data previous group become available . In Part B , participant randomly assign receive study vaccine control vaccine one three vaccination group . Group 6 participant receive FPV vaccine pair FPV control vaccine visit . Group 7 participant receive MVA vaccine pair MVA control study entry Month 1 , fix dose FPV vaccine pair FPV control Months 3 , 5 , 7 . Group 8 participant receive MVA vaccine pair MTD MVA control vaccine visit . Enrollment Groups 6 , 7 , 8 begin simultaneously completion safety data evaluation Groups 1 2 . Study vaccination give study entry Months 1 , 3 , 5 7 . Tests cardiac injury perform screen 2-week follow-up visit vaccination . Participants electrocardiogram ( ECG ) screen 2 week first last vaccination . Study visit occur screen , study entry , 11 visit 13 month . Study visit consist physical exam , risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling , cardiac symptom assessment , blood urine collection . Women pregnancy test study entry Months 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 13 .</detailed_description>
