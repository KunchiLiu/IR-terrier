	<brief_summary>Primary objective ass effect nesiritide decrease leave ventricular ( LV ) filling pressure , define pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) group patient admit acute diastolic heart failure . Secondary objective include : improvement symptom , exercise tolerance , improvement Doppler diastolic fill parameter patient diastolic heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Nesiritide Management Acute Diastolic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diastolic heart failure often high pressure heart lungs many symptom shortness breath , low energy , fluid retention , fatigue . Decreasing pressure heart lung may help patient feel well . The drug nesiritide design help treat heart failure . It also show help decrease pressure lung . Before treatment start , ask question medical history medication currently take . You complete physical exam . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) . You ultrasound heart call echocardiogram measure heart function pressure lung . Your ability breathe evaluate . With aid research nurse , 6-minute walk test . You may stop sit time test . This test do evaluate energy level . You also ask complete questionnaire symptom . This questionnaire take 10 minute complete . In order measure pressure heart lung , procedure call `` right heart catheterization '' . This procedure may do part standard care even enrol study . For procedure , small tube place vein neck . A longer tube insert first tube feed vein heart . This tube use measure pressure heart lung . After pressure measure , receive treatment nesiritide right heart catheterization procedure . Nesiritide give continuous infusion ( 48 hour ) vein . The pressure heart lung measure 15 , 30 , 60 minute begin receive nesiritide . The tube remove heart . You awake procedure lie flat back . An anesthetic use numb area neck tube place . The entire procedure ( include treatment ) take long 1 hour . You ultrasound heart perform immediately right heart catheterization . Within 15 minute end procedure echocardiogram , 6-minute walk test , questionnaire symptom repeat breathe re-evaluated . The nesiritide infusion remain go vein arm next 48 hour . During infusion remain hospital telemetry floor researcher monitor blood pressure watch irregular heartbeat . After receive drug 48 hour , drug stop . Within 24 hour stop treatment , echocardiogram 6-minute walk test perform . You also answer question breathe quality life . These take 15 minute time complete . You take study condition get bad intolerable side effect occur . At 2 4 week hospitalization right heart procedure , follow-up visit schedule . At visit , complete physical exam , possibly blood work do require doctor part routine care . A blood test check BNP ( B-type natriuretic peptide ) level also perform . This special blood test give researcher information heart much extra fluid may carry heart disease . Only 1 teaspoon blood need test although 3 teaspoon blood may need drawn depend blood test doctor order follow-up visit . This investigational study . Nesiritide FDA approve commercially available treatment heart failure . However , use nesiritide diastolic heart failure research . About 20 patient take part study . All enrol UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
