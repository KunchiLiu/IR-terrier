	<brief_summary>STR ( Skeletal Targeted Radiotherapy , 166Ho-DOTMP ) investigational radiopharmaceutical delivers radiation directly cancer cell bone bone marrow . Conventional method deliver radiation therapy , total body irradiation , expose non-target tissue radiation cause serious side effect . In contrast , STR 's targeted approach deliver radiotherapy concentrate radiation need , minimize exposure normal tissue . STR compose bone-targeting molecule , DOTMP , stable complex radionuclide holmium-166 . When injected patient 's bloodstream , STR rapidly bind bone mineral , deliver brief , intense dose radiation destroy cancer cell bone marrow . The high-energy long path-length holmium-166 beta particle provide optimal penetration uniform irradiation disease sit marrow bone . STR bind bone rapidly eliminate urinary tract . STR treatment follow autologous stem cell transplantation . The short half-life holmium-166 allows treatment out-patient basis , minimizes time require STR administration transplantation . The phase III study STR multi-center , randomize , control study , design evaluate safety efficacy STR patient primary refractory multiple myeloma . These patient fail achieve least partial response conventional therapy undergo treatment le 18 month . The trial expect enroll approximately 240 evaluable patient , half experimental arm half control arm . Patients experimental arm receive STR dose 750 mCi/m2 plus chemotherapy drug melphalan 200 mg/m2 , follow autologous stem cell transplantation . Patients control arm receive melphalan , follow transplantation . Patients study arm evaluate response treatment six month transplantation , use immunofixation assay detect myeloma protein patient sample . Analysis patient sample conduct central laboratory , blind result review independent panel expert . The study 's primary endpoint complete response , determine complete disappearance myeloma protein six month post-transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing STR ( Skeletal Targeted Radiotherapy ) Plus Melphalan Melphalan Alone , With Stem Cell Transplant Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : 1.To determine efficacy STR ( 166Ho-DOTMP ) . The primary endpoint study compare CR rate 6 month post-transplant ( absence therapy ) subject primary refractory multiple myeloma treatment 750 mCi/m2 166Ho-DOTMP plus 200 mg/m2 melphalan follow autologous PBSCT treatment 200 mg/m2 melphalan alone follow autologous PBSCT . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To compare treatment group respect survival progression-free survival . 2 . To compare treatment group respect overall response rate ( CR+VGPR+PR ) , best response within 6 month , duration response . 3 . To compare safety profile treatment group . 4 . To assess biodistribution estimate radiation absorb dose kidney first 20 subject . METHODOLOGY : Informed consent participation study obtain , eligibility determine , subject register . All subject receive tracer dose 30 mCi 166Ho-DOTMP determine skeletal uptake biodistribution 166Ho-DOTMP therapy . Subjects may receive therapy dose 1 ) tracer dose show aberrant distribution , 2 ) skeletal residence time least 5.8 hour ( equivalent F x Te &gt; 4 hr ) . Subjects adequate skeletal uptake aberrant distribution stratify base length time since first induction therapy , response prior therapy , undergo randomization determine whether receive 166Ho DOTMP plus melphalan ( Arm A ) melphalan alone ( Arm B ) condition regimen prior autologous PBSCT . Subjects randomize Arm A treat 750 mCi/m2 166Ho DOTMP intravenously 4 12 day tracer dose , total dosage exceed 1500 mCi . Five 9 day 166Ho-DOTMP therapy dose , subject receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan IV . Subjects randomize Arm B receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan least 10 day 3 week tracer dose . For patient , cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cell infuse 24 48 hour melphalan . Subjects follow safety assessment 10 year death . Efficacy evaluate 3 year respond subject , disease relapse progression survival document Year 10 . An analysis estimate radiation dose kidney perform first 20 patient . Additionally , 6 month follow-up complete first 20 subject arm , analysis CR rate conduct rule lack efficacy 166Ho-DOTMP . A planned interim analysis determine efficacy treatment perform 60 patient arm complete 6 month follow-up . Enrollment trial continue interim analysis perform . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : Two hundred forty subject meet eligibility criterion receive study treatment follow protocol .</detailed_description>
