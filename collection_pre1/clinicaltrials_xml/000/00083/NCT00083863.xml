	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent experimental clinical study support concept vascular inflammation central development atherosclerosis , systemic inflammatory marker predict wide array cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event . There increase interest role genetic variation inflammation contribute susceptibility CVD . To date mostly small case-control study suggest polymorphisms inflammatory gene associate subclinical clinical CVD , study differ regard gene central . The investigator previously measure systemic marker vascular inflammation ( e.g . CRP , sICAM-1 , MCP-1 , IL-6 ) oxidative stress ( isoprostanes ) , population-based sample 3800 middle-aged elderly men woman Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort . They propose genotype inflammatory candidate gene Framingham offspring cohort phenotyped CVD risk factor , subclinical CVD.They also propose measure systemic inflammatory marker Framingham Study Generation III cohort , child offspring cohort . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Dr. Benjamin colleague genotype inflammatory candidate gene Framingham offspring cohort phenotyped CVD risk factor , subclinical CVD . They also measure systemic inflammatory marker Framingham Study Generation III cohort , child offspring cohort . The central hypothesis study systemic vascular inflammation represent complex phenotype evolves lifetime influence environmental genetic factor . They postulate variation inflammatory phenotype ( marker level ) genotype predispose development CVD . The purpose study determine contribution genetic environmental factor vascular inflammation , define extent inflammatory phenotype genotype predict subclinical clinical CVD , enhance risk prediction model . The specific aim : Aim 1 . To examine environmental determinant systemic inflammation community . Aim 2 . To investigate genetic determinant systemic inflammation . Aim 3 . To identify inflammatory phenotypic genetic determinant subclinical CVD . Aim 4 . To determine contribution inflammatory phenotype versus genotype prevalent incident CVD incident hypertension . The investigation increase understand whether inflammation core risk factor CVD merely marker presence burden CVD risk factor . These insight fundamentally contribute knowledge pathophysiology CVD may lead improved prevention , risk stratification management CVD .</detailed_description>
