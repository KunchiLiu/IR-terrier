	<brief_summary>This study identify area brain mediate interaction people involve economic decision-making . Healthy , right-handed native English speaker 21 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen telephone interview , questionnaire determine handedness , neurological examination one perform within last year NIH physician . Participants bargain money play two-person trust game , undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During procedure , subject lie stable slide scanner , wear earplug muffle loud knock sound occur electrical switch magnetic field . Functional MRI involve take MRI scan subject performs task-this learn brain region involve perform task . For test , subject play watch two-person game involve trust . The game may play stranger friend . The winner receive cash payoff . The subject perform one follow two task MRI scanning : - Playing trust game indicate quickly possible press right leave button whether want stop continue playing , - Observing game others play predict quickly possible press right leave button whether player want stop continue game . The test take 90 minute . After scan , participant complete write questionnaire experience scanner view issue related participate competitive game .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective . The purpose protocol identify brain region mediate social cooperation involve economic decision-making , include whether negative mood perceive interpersonal similarity affect behavior brain region utilized . Study Population . Healthy , normal adult volunteer play observe two-person reciprocal trust game functional neuroimaging either real people computer masquerade real people . Design . A between/within-subject , rapid event-related fMRI design employ two series experiment . In first experiment , two persons-each separate MRI scanner-will interact one another play two-person reciprocal trust game brain simultaneously scan . In second experiment , third person later observe play game scanner , try predict decision two player first experiment . In third experiment , sad mood induce half participant examine affect level cooperative behavior pattern brain activation two type trust game describe . Four additional series experiment employ between/within subject design subject scan alone , deception playing simultaneously another subject . Outcome Measures . The data collect consist behavioral measure cognitive performance , self- other-mental representation , trust trustworthy behavior , correspond fMRI image , personality scale , rating relationship status , type strategy use . The result gain protocol value identify set neural region mediate dynamic social interaction people engage economic decision-making .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , subject consist healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( Oldfield , 1971 ) . Subjects range age 21 55 year old include regardless race . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude mention , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 21 old 55 exclude . A urine pregnancy test employ woman childbearing age . The result must negative order proceed MRI . Participants follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , e.g . metal shaving ; permanent eyeliner ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body . Participants take central nervous system active medication exclude .</criteria>
