	<brief_summary>TransMID treatment best standard care patient advance glioblastoma multiforme Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) type brain tumour . GBM tumours usually treat surgery radiotherapy . Unfortunately , type brain tumour may continue grow come back ( recur ) despite treatment . This trial compare new drug call TransMID best standard treatment currently available . TransMID drug combination protein call transferrin poison call diphtheria toxin . Cancer cell need iron order continue grow . They need iron normal cell . Transferrin help cell take available iron . So cancer cell attach transferrin TransMID , diphtheria poison kill . The aim treatment kill cancer cell affect normal brain cell . This treatment brain tumour may fewer side effect treatment target cancer cell . The best standard treatment involve give chemotherapy . You may chemotherapy part treatment diagnose . Or may keep reserve treat brain tumour come back continue grow . Your cancer specialist ( consultant ) decide chemotherapy drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Therapy With TransMID™ Compared Best Standard Care Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Multicenter , open label , randomize study compare TransMID™ chemotherapeutic regimen consider best standard care consist either nitrosoureas , platinum compound , temozolomide , procarbazine , PCV , ( procarbazine , lomustine ( CCNU ) &amp; vincristine ) , CPT-11 , Etoposide . A plan interim analysis primary efficacy endpoint conduct approximately 50 % required event observe . In order patient eligible enrollment trial , he/she must diagnose glioblastoma multiforme confirm histologically undergone conventional treatment , include surgery ( biopsy debulking ) and/or radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy , recurrent and/or progressive tumor ≥1.0 cm ≤4.0 cm diameter .</detailed_description>
