	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Pivanex Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) disease characterize accumulation mature lymphocytes . These CLL lymphocytes block undergoing terminal differentiation apoptosis . Patients CLL limit option therapy , especially failure standard chemotherapy regimen . Histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACs ) comprise new class drug evaluate treatment various malignancy . In vitro data suggest HDAC inhibition lead terminal B-cell differentiation may therefore play therapeutic role treatment CLL . Pivanex ( pivaloyloxymethyl butyrate ) HDAC inhibitor show induce apoptosis CLL lymphocytes vitro . In previous clinical trial , Pivanex well tolerate . The goal protocol determine effect Pivanex patient CLL . Purpose : This open-label trial determine response rate Pivanex patient CLL . Objectives : ( 1 ) Determine response rate Pivanex patient relapse CLL ; ( 2 ) Determine time disease progression patient relapse CLL treat Pivanex ; ( 3 ) Determine safety profile Pivanex CLL . Design : This open label , single arm , multiple dose , pilot study patient relapse CLL . Patients treat 2.5 g/m2 Pivanex administer intravenously 6 hour daily Days 1 â€“ 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day disease progression patient withdrawn treatment protocol-specified reason . Disease status assess prior every odd-numbered treatment cycle use response criterion base upon Revised National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group Guidelines CLL . Patients withdraw due disease progression follow survival . Patients withdraw study reason disease progression follow disease progression survival .</detailed_description>
