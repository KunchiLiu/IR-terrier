	<brief_summary>This phase II , multicenter , open-label study cetuximab patient epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) negative , metastatic colorectal carcinoma progress receive least one standard chemotherapeutic regimen include fluoropyrimidine . Target enrollment 80 evaluable patient . Patients EGFR-negative metastatic colorectal carcinoma progress receive least one standard chemotherapeutic regimen include fluoropyrimidine , receive initial dose cetuximab , 400 mg/m2 , intravenously ( i.v . ) 120 minute , follow weekly treatment cetuximab , 250 mg/m2 i.v . 60 minute . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity progressive disease ( PD ) receive cetuximab therapy . Patients evaluate tumor response minimum every 6 week cetuximab therapy . Patients stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) may continue receive weekly cetuximab therapy , unless dose-delayed discontinued toxicity . Patients PR CR must confirmatory tumor assessment le 4 week initial evaluation demonstrate response . To evaluate objective response rate , single-stage design use study .</brief_summary>
