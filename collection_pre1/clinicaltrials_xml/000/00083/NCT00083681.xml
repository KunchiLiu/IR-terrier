	<brief_summary>The purpose investigational trial find well patient respond long response last treat four day chemotherapy regimen involve dexamethasone , cytoxan , etoposide , cisplatinum , DCEP without thalidomide . Another purpose find kind side effect patient experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DCEP Combination With Thalidomide Salvage Therapy Post Transplantation Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient enrol study assign either receive DCEP alone , combination thalidomide . Since known time treatment best , place chance one two group . Treatment consist three cycle combination chemotherapy , four day . Three drug , Cytoxan , etoposide , cisplatin give vein continuous four-day infusion . Decadron give mouth four day . G-CSF also give daily shot skin help bone marrow recover . After 3 cycle combination chemotherapy , myeloma reassess . If myeloma stable responding , patient receive additional 3 cycle chemotherapy . Then myeloma reassess find stable responding,3 final cycle chemotherapy give . Following completion chemotherapy , sooner physician feel chemotherapy side effect great , patient receive maintenance therapy dexamethasone . Patients originally assign receive thalidomide , continue take thalidomide daily throughout protocol treatment . The major reason conduct research gather biologic information patient myeloma . Information gain research may contribute great understanding reason treatment failure may assist selection appropriate treatment individual patient .</detailed_description>
