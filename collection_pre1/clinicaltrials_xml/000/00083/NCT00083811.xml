	<brief_title>HYPGENE-Genetics Fitness Obesity &amp; Risk Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension multifactorial disease genetic environmental factor contribute disease process . HYPGENE investigate gene-fitness gene-obesity interaction relate development hypertension adulthood . The study use cohort Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study ( ACLS ) Cooper Clinic . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The HYPGENE Study collaborative effort Pennington Biomedical Research Center , Cooper Institute , Washington University St. Louis . The aim study investigate contribution DNA sequence variation candidate gene well interaction cardiorespiratory fitness obesity risk hypertension participant Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study ( ACLS ) . In first phase ( 12/01/03 ) , group 1000 subject , normotensive free cardiovascular disease diabetes time first preventive medical examination ( 01/1987 02/2001 ) select ACLS cohort . Half subject ( n=500 ) develop hypertension follow-up period ( duration 2 16 year ) , whereas half remain normotensive . In second phase ( 12/03 11/05 ) , sample size increase 1500 subject ( 750 case 750 control ) . Cases define individual normotensive baseline develop essential hypertension follow-up . Comparison individual also normotensive baseline remain normotensive follow-up . The ascertainment case-control status do subject ' return visit Cooper Clinic . A panel biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms candidate gene locus type . The candidate gene select base putative role physiological pathway pertain regulation blood pressure fitness obesity , evidence linkage association previous study . The candidate include endothelial factor contribute vasodilation vasoconstriction , beta-adrenergic receptor kinase , mediate effect autonomic nervous system cardiac function vascular tone , renin angiotensin system , signal molecule mediate effect laminar shear stress vascular wall enzyme activity gene expression . Logistic regression model classification regression tree methodology use analyze contribution genotype , fitness level obesity , well interaction , risk hypertension . The HYPGENE study produce novel data effect genetic factor presence either high low cardiorespiratory fitness level obesity normal body weight development hypertension . These data could ultimately lead efficient use physical activity body weight control primary secondary prevention hypertension .</detailed_description>
