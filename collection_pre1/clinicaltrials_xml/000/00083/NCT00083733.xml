	<brief_summary>This study collect , analyze , compare gene proteins normal breast tissue various tissue woman breast cancer look change unique breast cancer cell . Information difference may lead effective breast cancer treatment few side effect . The study follow objective : - To define molecular ( genetic protein ) profile normal breast tissue pre- post-menopausal woman different age vary number child ( child ) , different phase menstrual cycle - To define molecular profile primary breast tumor tumor metastasize ( spread ) beyond primary site - To characterize breast cancer stem cell establish cell line pleural fluid ( fluid around lung ) woman metastatic breast cancer . ( A cell line collection cell grown laboratory original tissue specimen . ) The following woman may eligible study : - Women undergo cosmetic breast surgery require removal breast tissue ( e.g. , breast reduction surgery ) - Women 18 year age old undergoing biopsy surgical procedure sample remove know suspected primary metastatic breast tumor - Women 18 year age old undergoing pleurocentesis , procedure remove fluid around lung suspect know cause spread breast cancer Participants undergo require procedure ( e.g. , surgery , biopsy , pleurocentesis ) provide information may include follow : - Age , race/ethnicity - Age first menstrual period ( menarche ) - Age first pregnancy age first child bear - Age menopause - Information primary breast cancer - Family history breast cancer - Information previous breast biopsy , , hormone take ( birth control pills hormone replacement therapy ) , - Copy pathology report procedure ( surgery , biopsy , pleurocentesis )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Defining molecular profile ( gene protein expression ) normal breast tissue essential identifying marker cellular subtypes normal human breast . These marker could serve biomarkers prevention trial represent new therapeutic target also express early breast cancer . The gene protein expression normal breast tissue may dependent stage menstrual cycle , whether woman pre- post-menopausal , prior pregnancy breast feed history , age . The molecular profile metastatic breast tumor may differ primary tumor differ metastasis different anatomic site . Identification genes/proteins unique lesion may help identify process responsible metastatic spread molecular level lead development new molecularly target drug . Similarly , isolation characterization breast cancer stem cell could provide new approach treatment prevention breast cancer . Objectives : To define molecular profile normal breast tissue pre- post-menopausal woman vary age parity ( nulliparous multiparous ) different phase menstrual cycle ; study molecular profile primary metastatic breast cancer lesion ; identify characterize breast cancer stem cell establish cell line pleural fluid woman breast cancer malignant pleural effusion . Eligibility : Women undergo cosmetic breast surgery entail resection portion breast ( e.g. , reduction mammoplasty ) history breast cancer ; woman know suspected breast cancer primary tumor biopsied resect metastatic lesion biopsied resect ; woman breast cancer undergoing pleurocentesis suspect know malignant pleural effusion . Design : Normal breast tissue cosmetic breast procedure perform woman without history breast cancer Suburban Hospital snap frozen liquid nitrogen send NCI storage analysis . Demographic information collect woman undergoing procedure . Similarly , portion biopsy obtain primary metastatic lesion woman suspect known breast cancer Suburban Hospital NIH collect material obtain diagnostic purpose , snap frozen liquid nitrogen , send NCI demographic information . The unneeded fluid pleurocenteses perform woman breast cancer malignant pleural effusion transport ( unfrozen ) NCI lab immediate processing ( FAC sort isolate breast cancer stem cell ) . RNA extract tissue cDNA microarrays use study gene expression . Proteomic analysis normal malignant breast tissue study use reverse-phase tissue lysates .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects age undergoing cosmetic breast surgery entail resection breast tissue ( e.g. , reduction mammoplasty ) reason . 2 . Women ( 18 year age old ) know suspected breast cancer undergo diagnostic biopsy resection primary breast lesion site metastatic tumor . 3 . Women ( 18 year age old ) breast cancer undergo pleurocentesis removal fluid know suspected malignant pleural effusion . 4 . All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year age ) must sign document inform consent indicate understanding specimen collect demographic information provide research purpose . Written assent obtain pediatric patient ( less 18 year age ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects undergoing cosmetic breast procedure reduction mammoplasty ( collection normal breast tissue ) exclude prior history breast cancer .</criteria>
