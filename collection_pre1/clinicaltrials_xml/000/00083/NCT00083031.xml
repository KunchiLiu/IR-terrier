	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide methotrexate , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Bevacizumab may stop growth breast cancer stop blood flow tumor . Giving metronomic ( regularly time ) low-dose cyclophosphamide methotrexate together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide methotrexate see well work compare metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , bevacizumab treat woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metronomic Low-Dose Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate With Without Bevacizumab Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall response rate woman metastatic breast cancer treat metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide methotrexate without bevacizumab . Secondary - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Correlate marker angiogenesis , include vascular endothelial growth factor circulate endothelial cell , baseline treatment , response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive low-dose oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-28 , low-dose oral methotrexate twice daily day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 23 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . - Arm II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide methotrexate arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm II progressive disease option discontinue treatment cross arm I . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36-66 patient ( 18-33 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 7-12 month .</detailed_description>
