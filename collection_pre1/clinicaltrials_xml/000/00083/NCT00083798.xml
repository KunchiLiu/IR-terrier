	<brief_title>Family Linkage Study Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Iceland</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There family aggregation obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) show United States , Europe recently Iceland . Iceland represent unique opportunity genetic research . It community settle founder 9 th Century , develop relative isolation since time present size 285,000 person . Moreover , commitment record keep allow deCODE Genetics , collaborator grant , develop computerized genealogy data base permit ancestry individual trace century . This tool , together founder nature population , make possible unique genealogy-driven approach study genetics complex disorder , approach already successful . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use patient obstructive sleep apnea , already diagnose Iceland large family pedigree identify . The study involve genome-wide family linkage investigation . This conduct affect approach examine allele sharing affected individual use 1,100 marker space across genome . The investigator plan oversample relatively non-obese subject provide opportunity evaluate linkage relatively non-obese obese subject . The linkage study complement association study , unrelated case control , match age , gender , menopausal status . In association study , , primary aim , test candidate gene arise linkage study , secondary aim , evaluate candidate gene believe identify ongoing Cleveland Family Study . A subset subject family linkage association study in-depth phenotyping determine whether sub-phenotypes complex disorder , , whether aggregate family . This depth phenotyping involve upper airway magnetic resonance image evaluate upper airway soft tissue craniofacial structure , acoustic rhinometry quantify nasal resistance , know risk factor disorder , insulin resistance . They explore whether distinct pattern linkage different sub-phenotypes . To accomplish large genetic study , put together resource three major organization -- University Pennsylvania , University Iceland Hospitals , deCODE Genetics . They propose leverage truly unique infrastructure develop deCODE Genetics , clinical research program sleep apnea University Iceland Hospitals , in-depth phenotyping expertise University Pennsylvania accomplish goal .</detailed_description>
