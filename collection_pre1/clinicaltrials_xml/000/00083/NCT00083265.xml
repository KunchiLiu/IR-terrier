	<brief_summary>This study try identify gene increase risk develop panic disorder-an anxiety disorder characterize recurrent unexpected panic attacks-and contribute abnormality associate . It compare reaction patient panic disorder normal volunteer caffeine , compound induce anxiety , placebo , inactive substance . Caffeine believe induce anxiety block protein call adenosine receptor surface nerve cell brain . One study find people specific adenosine receptor gene call 1976T/T great anxiety response caffeine challenge people adenosine receptor gene group . There also evidence people 1976T/T genotype vulnerable panic disorder . Normal volunteer patient panic disorder ( without agoraphobia ) 18 60 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen physical psychiatric examination , diagnostic interview , mood anxiety rating , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , include genetic study . Participants two caffeine/placebo challenge session least 3 day apart . Each session last 4 hour . For least 1 week session , subject follow diet exclude food caffeine refrain drink alcoholic beverage least 48 hour procedure . The morning session , follow overnight fast , subject swallow either placebo capsule caffeine capsule equivalent 5 cup coffee . During session , subject take battery neuropsychological test document change cognitive emotional functioning , include attention , memory , motor performance . In addition , heart rate blood pressure measure 15 minute 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 minute caffeine placebo dose . At end study , patient panic disorder eligible receive routine clinical treatment 3 month may participate plan long-term treatment care local health care provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Causes Panic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caffeine , widely use psychoactive drug world , exert behavioral effect antagonize adenosine receptor ( AR ) . Four different human AR subtypes find evidence stimulatory effect caffeine mainly cause inhibition transmission via adenosine A ( 2a ) receptor . A significant association find healthy infrequent caffeine user caffeine-induced anxiety two link polymorphism A ( 2a ) receptor gene , 1976C great T 2592C great Tins polymorphism . In one study look monozygotic dizygotic twin pair , much evidence individual difference caffeine use , intoxication , tolerance , withdrawal substantially influence genetic factor . Family twin study show genetic factor may increase vulnerability panic disorder . In one study systematic mutation screen association study A ( 1 ) A ( 2a ) adenosine receptor gene panic disorder show significant association 1976T allele 1976T/T genotype A ( 2a ) receptor gene panic disorder . As 1976T/T genotype A ( 2a ) receptor gene associate increase caffeine-induced anxiety healthy control , associate increased vulnerability panic disorder , wish study whether 1976T/T genotype panic disorder patient associate increase caffeine-induced anxiety . This study study subject panic disorder healthy control . Based previous study follow hypothesis test ( 2 replication 2 new hypothesis ) : Replication ; ( 1 ) panic disorder subject report high anxiety caffeine challenge healthy control subject . ( 2 ) healthy control the1976 T/T polymorphism report increase anxiety caffeine challenge compare healthy control 1976 C/T 1976 C/C genotype , New hypothesis ; ( 3 ) panic patient ( two separate group : currently ill remit ) 1976 T/T polymorphism report increase anxiety caffeine challenge compare panic patient 1976 C/T 1976 C/C genotype , ( 4 ) panic patient ( two separate group : currently ill remit ) 1976 T/T polymorphism report increase anxiety caffeine challenge compare healthy control 1976 T/T polymorphism report increase anxiety caffeine challenge compare healthy control 1976 T/T genotype .</detailed_description>
