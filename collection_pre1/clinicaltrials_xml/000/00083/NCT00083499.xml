	<brief_summary>This study collect blood , urine , tissue sample patient Pentalogy Cantrell ( POC ) inherit disease may involve mutation non-muscle myosin II-B heavy chain ( MYH10 ) . We also collect sample relative affect individual . POC rare disorder patient combination severe defect middle chest include sternum ( breastbone ) , diaphragm , heart , abdominal wall . The defect apparent birth birth . Participants may undergo medical evaluation could include medical history routine blood test , urine collection , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram . In addition , blood , urine , saliva , buccal swab tissue sample may collect protein gene study . The blood drawn small needle place arm vein . Children may choose buccal ( cheek ) sample take instead blood draw . Buccal sample collect cheek swab , soft brush rub inside line mouth , child hold tablespoon mouthwash mouth full minute spit mouthwash container . In addition , tissue sample may collect patient undergo surgical procedure may require part general medical care . Some cell obtain patient relative may use establish cell line ( live tissue sample ) grown laboratory use experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol collect protein , DNA , RNA blood , sputum , urine and/or tissue sample patient diagnosis Pentalogy Cantrell ( POC ) relate syndrome order identify possible causative gene . We use whole exome/genome sequence probands , parent , , available , affected relative probands look exomic/genomic mutation could associate syndrome . We produce mouse model mutant mouse exhibit problem ventral wall closure include extrathoracic location heart ( ectopia cordis ) , defect abdominal wall protrusion gut liver . The mouse , single amino acid substitution nonmuslce myosin II-B , severe defect heart brain , resemble human born POC , manifest abnormality .</detailed_description>
