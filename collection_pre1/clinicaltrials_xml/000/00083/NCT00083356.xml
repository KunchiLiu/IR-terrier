	<brief_summary>This study examine whether bradykinin receptor produce site wisdom tooth extraction contribute amount inflammation pain follow surgery . Bradykinin molecule produce enzyme site injury bind receptor cause pain . The study also evaluate role genetic factor production bradykinin receptor pain associate minor surgical procedure . Patients 16 35 year age refer NIH dental clinic removal two wisdom teeth may eligible study . Candidates must good health must allergic aspirin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , sulfites , amide anesthetic . They screen medical history oral examination , include x-rays confirm need wisdom tooth extraction . On morning surgery follow overnight fast , participant blood sample drawn extract DNA gene study . Just surgery , give intravenous ( IV ) sedative induce drowsiness local anesthetic numb mouth . They also give IV either Ketorolac , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , placebo , look-alike medication active ingredient . After extraction , small piece plastic tubing place extraction site , every 20 minute next 3 hour inflammatory fluid collect tube measure chemical believe cause pain swell . Patients rate pain answer pain-related question every 20 minute . Patients pain relieved study medication ( Ketorolac placebo ) give , upon request , 50 mg pain reliever tramadol ( Ultram ) . Patients remain clinic least 3 hour 7 hour surgery order monitoring effect study drug local anesthetic wear . Patients undergo two biopsy study - one one extraction - measure change chemical produce response surgery . The second biopsy do either 3 , 7 , 24 hour extraction . Patients 3- 7-hour group give small dose local anesthetic gum second biopsy remain clinic biopsy do ; 24-hour group give form record pain rating home return clinic follow morning 2-hour follow-up visit . All patient give standard pain medication ( flurbiprofen ) take home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bradykinin B1 receptor natural agonist know rapidly induced local tissue variety inflammatory stimulus . Preclinical evidence , demonstrate interruption B1 receptor function cause analgesia variety condition , well establish use selective antagonist genetically modify mouse . Accordingly , effort underway several laboratory develop novel B1 receptor antagonists potential novel analgesic agent . The proposed study examine kinetics local induction B1 receptor kinin formation common situation acute inflammatory pain human - tooth extraction . In addition , examination expression additional gene interest condition use microarray analysis conduct .</detailed_description>
