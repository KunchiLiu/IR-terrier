	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine HIV infection see cause immune response HIV . The vaccine give injection ( shot ) upper arm . It make DNA code three HIV protein . The DNA insert adenovirus carry muscle cell . The adenovirus normally cause eye upper respiratory infection , cold ; however , vaccine , modify cause illness . Nor vaccine cause HIV infection , code three nine HIV protein . Healthy , normal volunteer 18 44 year age HIV-infected may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination blood urine test . Participants randomly assign receive either experimental vaccine placebo ( inactive substance look like vaccine ) . The vaccine placebo administer participant group , accord entry study . The first group receive low study dose vaccine . If dose safe , second group receive high dose . If dose also safe , third final group receive high study dose . Clinic staff observe subject side effect 30 minute injection , subject keep diary card next 5 day , record temperature symptom may appear . Subjects contact nurse 2 day injection follow-up . Participants see clinic follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 week injection , contact telephone follow-up year 5 year injection . The clinic visit include physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , HIV counseling , need . Women pregnancy test screen evaluation study week 24 . All subject test HIV screen study week 12 24 , subject complete `` social impact questionnaire '' week 24 . All subject ask question sexual behavior drug use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded study examine safety , tolerability immune response multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine uninfected adult . The hypothesis vaccine safe elicit immune response HIV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP uninfected subject secondary objective include immunogenicity evaluation adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) antibody titer Week 4 social impact Week 24 . Exploratory evaluation include immunogenicity evaluation Weeks 12 24 Ad5 antibody titer Week 24 . Product Description : VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP recombinant product compose 4 adenoviral vector ( Ad ) ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C , respectively . The final formulation buffer , VRC-DILUENT013-DIL-VP use diluent placebo control . Injections administer intramuscularly ( IM ) . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer ( 18 44 year old ) . Study Plan : Thirty-six volunteer receive one 1.0 mL injection study agent placebo deltoid muscle show schema . Dose escalation occur three week last injection dose group follow interim safety data review DSMB , provide significant toxicity . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 5 clinical visit 24 week study injection , follow annual telephone mail contact subsequent 4 year . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety vaccine administer dose 1 x 10 ( 9 ) , 1 x 10 ( 10 ) 1 x 10 ( 11 ) particle unit ( PU ) intramuscular injection . Secondary endpoint immunogenicity indicate HIV-specific antibody cellular immune response Week 4 , Ad5 antibody titer Week 0 Week 4 social impact Week 24 . Exploratory analyse immunogenicity Weeks 12 24 Ad5 antibody titer Week 24 also perform .</detailed_description>
