	<brief_summary>This study examine use new radioactive tracer call [ 18F ] FECNT positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan measure dopamine transporter ( DAT ) brain . DAT find brain neuron ( nerve cell ) release chemical messenger dopamine . By take picture DAT , scientist hope learn function neuron . Normal , healthy volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , psychological assessment , blood urine test . Subjects enrol study participate one follow procedure : Brain Imaging Study : Part 1 Two catheter ( small plastic tube ) place vein subject 's arm inject [ 18F ] FECNT collect blood sample scan . A third catheter place wrist artery obtain arterial blood scan . With catheter place , subject lie scanner bed head place special mask limit movement brain scan . The scan begin initial x-ray like picture 10 minute , [ 18F ] FECNT inject actual PET scan start . The entire procedure take 6 hour , include 2 hour continuous scan session , subject require lie still . Subjects relax scanner scan . They monitor throughout procedure . Vital sign measure electrocardiogram take twice injection tracer . At end scanning , additional blood urine sample collect . Subjects ask urinate every 2 hour lessen radioactivity body . Whole Body Imaging Study : Part 2 For procedure , catheter place vein inject [ 18F ] FECNT tracer . A total five scan take , one span head upper thigh . During course scan , x-ray like picture obtain . The first scan take 100 minute . Four additional 1-hour scan do every 100 minute . The total time scan 6 hour , total time entire procedure 9 hour . About 2 tablespoon blood drawn needle stick one time image . Subjects leave PET scanner scan . They ask urinate every 2 hour 6 hour time tracer injection collect urine radioactivity measure . Brain Imaging Study : Part 3 Part 3 study Part 1 , except two PET procedure do separate day , second within 4 week first . In addition , participant may also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning , test use magnetic field radio wave obtain picture brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dopamine system play important role various neurological psychiatric disorder Parkinson 's disease , schizophrenia , mood disorder , attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . Several positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute topography ( SPECT ) tracer develop include [ 11C ] CFT [ 123I ] beta-CIT . These tracer successfully applied patient , particularly stage Parkinson 's disease . However , tracer lack selectivity among monoamine ( dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine ) transporter . Recently new PET tracer , [ 18F ] FECNT brain uptake washout develop , high selectivity affinity dopamine transporter ( DAT ) . Part 1 study measure kinetics [ 18F ] FECNT brain uptake washout . Part 2 estimate radiation-absorbed dos healthy human subject perform whole body PET image study . Part 3 assess reliability measure DAT density brain perform test retest brain PET study healthy human subject . The result overall study require apply tracer various neurological psychiatric disorder future .</detailed_description>
