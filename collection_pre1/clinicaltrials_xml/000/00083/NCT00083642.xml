	<brief_summary>This study determine people stroke learn perform movement observation , compare people stroke . Normally , person learn new hand movement automatically observe movement perform others . Improvement practice also rely visual feedback . This `` observational training '' - i.e. , repeat observation movement - sufficient normal individual learn movement . This study examine brain activity relate motor learn stroke patient healthy control subject see whether stroke patient process visual-motor information way normal subject . Normal volunteer stroke patient 18 75 year age may eligible study . Patients must paralysis one side body due stroke occur least 3 month enter study . Candidates recent health screen clinical neurological examination . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , one do recently . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The subject lie table slide cylindrical scanner wear earplugs muffle loud noise cause switch magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , session last 45 90 minute . - Task training . The subject practice task perform functional MRI ( see ) . The subject make finger tap movement , watch finger movement video screen several minute , time movie stops time time without warn . When movie stop , subject must reproduce last finger movement appear screen . During session , electrical signal subject 's forearm muscle record skin surface . This session last 3 hour . - Functional MRI . The subject undergo MRI scan perform task do train session . This session last 3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In normal subject , learn new hand movement initially rely automatic ability elaborate motor plan simple observation movement perform others . The improvement motor performance practice also rely correct visuomotor process visual feedback demonstrate repeated observation gesture , name observational training sufficient induce motor learning . However , know stroke patient process visuomotor information manner normal subject . Objectives : The purpose protocol determine pattern brain activation related motor learning induce observational training stroke patient compare normal volunteer . We hypothesize observational motor learn stroke patient rely increased activity premotor cortex compare normal volunteer . Study population : This protocol include chronic stroke patient subcortical lesion good motor recovery initial upper-limb paresis , control population age gender match normal volunteer . Design : We conduct functional MRI ( fMRI ) experiment assess observational training finger sequence . Three condition finger sequence compare : 1 ) sequence visually trained fMRI session , 2 ) non-trained sequence ( control 1 ) , 3 ) sequence visually trained fMRI session ( control 2 ) . The fMRI session split 3 separate run . The first run assess brain activity related motor performance 3 finger sequence . The second run explore brain activity observational training sequence . The third run re-assess brain activity related motor performance 3 finger sequence . Outcome measure : The endpoint measure experiment increase number activate voxels premotor cortex motor learn induced observational training stroke patient compare normal volunteer .</detailed_description>
