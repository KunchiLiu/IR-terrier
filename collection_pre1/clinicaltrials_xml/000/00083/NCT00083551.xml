	<brief_title>UARK 98-026 TT II : Multiple Myeloma Evaluating Anti-Angiogenesis With Thalidomide Post-Transplant Consolidation Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment give 4 phase step : Induction , Transplant 1 2 , Consolidation , maintenance . Induction design induce ( bring ) myeloma remission . Each patient enrol study randomly assign receive treatment alone combination drug call thalidomide . Some patient may eligible receive transplant outpatient , base general health factors.After recovery transplant phase study ( approximately 6 week ) , patient originally assign thalidomide resume take continue take throughout rest study treatment . All patient receive post-transplant consolidation treatment , early study find helpful maintain patient response transplant . Therefore , patient receive combination drug call `` D PACE '' consist Dexamethasone , Cis-Platinum , Adriamycin , Cyclophosphamide , Etoposide . If also take thalidomide , continue take throughout , treatment call `` DT PACE '' include thalidomide . No sooner 4 week , later 12 week consolidation myeloma remain remission consolidation therapy complete , begin last phase study , maintenance . Maintenance design keep myeloma remission long-term .</detailed_description>
