	<brief_summary>RSR13 ( efaproxiral ) radiation sensitizer show positive result Phase 3 , randomize clinical trial patient brain metastasis . Of 111 eligible breast cancer patient brain metastasis trial , 59 patient receive RSR13 prior radiation therapy median survival time twice long 52 patient receive RSR13 prior radiation therapy . RSR13 ( efaproxiral ) experimental drug increase amount oxygen release blood tissue . It well know certain type cancer tumor , include brain metastasis , lack oxygen . Lack oxygen tumor reduce effect radiation therapy ( RT ) . RSR13 may increase oxygen level brain tumor radiation therapy work well . This study enroll 360 woman brain metastasis breast cancer , evaluate whole brain radiation therapy give RSR13 well treatment effect whole brain radiation therapy alone . RSR13 infuse intravenously ( IV ) central catheter place central vein . Women randomize ( assign ) receive RSR13 , therefore , need central catheter place treatment unless one already place .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Brain Radiation Therapy With Oxygen , With Without RSR13 , Women With Brain Metastases From Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The screening process include documentation cancer , require brain scan may include liver scan . Other screen measurement include Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) assessment , measurement amount oxygen blood , use non-invasive device often place finger , lung function test require blow machine , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . About 2 teaspoon , 10 mL , blood take specific laboratory test , pregnancy test do blood woman childbearing potential . All study patient receive supplemental oxygen whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) ( 30 Gy , 3 Gy fraction ) every weekday 2 week . Half patient randomize ( assign ) receive RSR13 prior WBRT , need central catheter place treatment unless one already place . Patients receive RSR13 also need continue receive oxygen clinic amount oxygen blood near normal . This level return near normal patient within 1 2 hour . During treatment follow-up visit , physical neurological exam , KPS assessment , weight , height , vital sign measurement , 2 teaspoon blood may require . Patients need return follow-up visit 1 month completion treatment , 2 month later , every 3 month thereafter doctor tell otherwise .</detailed_description>
