	<brief_title>Huperzine A Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Huperzine A natural cholinesterase inhibitor derive Chinese herb Huperzia serrata . There evidence huperzine A may compare favorably symptomatic efficacy cholinesterase inhibitor currently use . In addition , huperzine A antioxidant neuroprotective property suggest may useful disease-modifying treatment Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The drug currently available nutraceutical country , use U.S. clinician treat AD . However , control clinical trial outside China assess toxicity efficacy . The present study evaluate huperzine A treatment AD randomize control trial effect cognitive function . The primary aim multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled therapeutic Phase II trial determine whether treatment huperzine A 200µg twice day improve cognitive function individual AD . Secondary aim study : ) determine whether treatment huperzine A 400µg twice day improve cognitive function individual AD ; b ) determine effect huperzine A treatment global clinical status , activity daily live , behavior AD ; c ) evaluate tolerability huperzine A treatment dosages 200µg twice day 400µg twice day AD ; ) determine relationship blood cholinesterase activity cognitive function individual AD treat huperzine A . A total 150 participant randomly assign three group equal size . This allow comparison huperzine A 200µg twice day , huperzine A 400µg twice day , placebo . The primary outcome measure change score ADAScog 16 week visit . Secondary outcome measure include ADCS clinical global impression change ( CGIC ) ( Schneider et al 1997 ) activity daily live ( ADL ) ( Galasko et al 1997 ) scale , Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( Cummings 1997 ) . Volunteers must able participate study 24 week make 9 visit trial site . At end double-blind study , participant invite continue huperzine A treatment 6 month open-label extension phase . Participants receive 200µg huperzine A twice day six consecutive month , assess 3-month interval ( month 6 , 9 , 12 , month 6 assessment coincide final visit double-blind phase ) .</detailed_description>
