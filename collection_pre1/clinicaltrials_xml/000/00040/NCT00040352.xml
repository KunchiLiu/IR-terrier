	<brief_summary>This study investigate genetic environmental factor contribute development melanoma , type skin cancer , related condition . Individuals age personal family history melanoma may eligible study . Participants : - Fill one two questionnaire personal family medical history . - Provide write consent researcher review medical record pathology material relate care decease relative melanomas , tumor , cancer , related illness next-of-kin legally authorize representative . - Donate blood cheek cell sample use genetic study . ( The blood sample collect needle arm vein . The cheek cell sample obtain either gently brush inside mouth soft brush swish tablespoon mouthwash spit container . ) - Undergo skin biopsy ( removal small piece skin tissue ) genetic study . For procedure , area skin remove numbed local anesthetic 1/4-inch piece skin excise cookie cutter-like instrument . The wound cover band-aid . Participants may ask travel NIH Clinical Center evaluation , include medical history , physical examination , follow procedure : - Full body skin examination evaluate type number mole document evidence sun damage skin . The examination involve skin scalp bottom foot . After examination , medical photographer photograph skin , close-ups skin lesion mark examiner . If part skin participant want examine photograph , tell examiner . - Blood draw 120 milliliter ( 4 ounce ) less - Skin biopsy - Cheek cell sample - X-rays , ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study detect tumor change tumor type change specific tissue . MRI diagnostic test use strong magnetic field radiowaves examine body tissue . The subject lie table move large tunnel-like machine ( scanner ) 45 minute 1 hour . When test finish , doctor discus result participant need , , clinical follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Persons may prone develop melanoma variety reason include : family history ; environmental exposure ; malignant premalignant condition may may heritable ; immune deficiency ; , preneoplastic condition dysplastic nevus . - Investigations individual family high risk melanoma lead etiologic clue important general population . - Identification melanoma susceptibility gene , estimation effect , gene-covariate gene-gene interaction could improve prevention , screen treatment cancer . Objectives : - To evaluate define clinical spectrum natural history disease syndromes predispose melanoma . - To evaluate potential precursor state disease family risk . - To quantify risk melanoma , pancreatic cancer , cancer family member . - To map , clone , determine function tumor susceptibility gene melanoma-prone family , include modifier gene pigmentation dysplastic nevus gene . - To identify genetic determinant gene-environmental interaction confer melanoma ( cancer ) risk individual family . - To evaluate gene-gene gene-environment interaction melanoma ( cancer ) formation . - To educate counsel study participant melanoma risk method primary secondary prevention melanoma . - To develop educational material medical professional high-risk family member . Eligibility : Persons age consider , - There family personal medical history melanoma unusual type , pattern , number ; , - There know suspected factor ( ) predispose melanoma , either genetic congenital factor , unusual demographic feature . - For familial melanoma , three living affect case invasive melanoma among family member require . Design : - This prospective study . Families study long-term use cohort approach . - Two melanoma susceptibility gene identify , likely others yet find . We also explore potential modifier gene participate family . - The affection status participant , information skin examination , sun exposure history , medical photograph ( overview close-up ) blood draw localize genetic locus , identify gene evaluate phenotype/genotype correlation , constitute workup newly recruit family . - Study volunteer reevaluate every year document change skin exam time . This essential establish natural history dysplastic nevus melanoma .</detailed_description>
