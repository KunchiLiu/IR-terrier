	<brief_summary>This study two purpose : 1 ) understand effect decline dopamine brain normal age patient Parkinson 's disease , 2 ) investigate medicine use treat Parkinson 's disease improve movement performance patient . Patients Parkinson 's disease difficulty perform precise finger movement , mainly dramatic decrease substance call dopamine part brain . Medicines levodopa , help restore dopamine level , greatly improve function ; however , little known drug work . In normal aging , dopamine decrease slightly certain part brain , importance decline poorly understood . This study may provide new information Parkinson 's disease normal age might lead well treatment strategy . Patients mild moderate Parkinson 's disease healthy volunteer 21 year age old may eligible study . All participant must right-handed . All candidate screen medical history physical neurological examination , include memory test mood examination . Brain function study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Participants may ask stop use medication affect central nervous system , sleep pill drug depression anxiety , 1 week study visit . Patients Parkinson 's disease may also ask stop use antiparkinsonian medication least 12 hour visit . In addition , participant ask abstain alcoholic beverage least 24 hour fMRI PET scan , nicotine caffeine least 12 hour scan . Participants fMRI , use strong magnetic field radio wave create image brain . The subject lie table tunnel-like cylinder ( scanner ) 1 2 hour , lie still 5 15 minute time . He communicate technician researcher time test intercom system . Scans do subject rest performing finger movement . The movement involve push five button box-each button every 3 second average specific order . Patients Parkinson 's disease study off- on- medication restore level levodopa brain . Some participant may ask undergo PET scan separate visit . A PET scanner doughnut-shaped machine similar appearance CT ( compute tomography ) scanner . PET scan detect radioactivity use provide information brain activity . Before test begin , subject give dose carbidopa-a medicine increase amount levodopa brain . A catheter ( thin , plastic tube ) insert arm wrist vein , radioactive form levodopa call 18Fluorodopa injected catheter . A moldable plastic mask large opening eye , nose , mouth place face help keep head still scan . The total scan time 2 hour less .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : In central nervous system , short-term plasticity define change connection strength induce receive presynaptic input . Dopamine ( DA ) , neuromodulatory neurotransmitter , believe play role short-term plasticity . [ 18F ] dopa positron emission tomography ( PET ) study show progressive impairment presynaptic dopaminergic ( DAergic ) function healthy elderly subject ( HES ) patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Both PD HES characterize progressive decline performance motor task change activity brain area involve motor control ( include motor control cognitive function ) show functional imaging study . However , little know exact neurobiological mechanism link DAergic function , brain activity motor ( cognitive ) performance PD HES . In present study , hypothesize impaired performance motor task subject group related dysfunction task-specific functional connection area participate motor control . In addition , brain activation fMRI across session across subject healthy group examine investigate reliability fMRI technique . Study population : We study two group participant : one group patient mild-to-moderate PD one group healthy subject . Design : We measure cerebral activity baseline condition execution sequential finger movement use perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) three subject group . The reliability fMRI data across session across subject healthy young group brain activity patient PD study `` '' `` '' medication . Outcome measure : Imaging data compare term regional activity effective connectivity use statistical parametric mapping ( SPM ) software . These experiment lead good understanding pathophysiology mesencephalic DAergic system human motor control may lead good treatment strategy PD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include PD patient stable clinical response LDOPA DAergic agent . We recruit patient early mildtomoderate PD ( score Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale 148 less 3 ) . To obtain homogeneous group , PD cohort comprise nondemented , nondepressed , parkinsonian symptom sign primarily akinetorigid . If rest tremor present , patient mild moderate tremor ( UPDRS tremor rating 1 2 right upper limb ) include study . Our group healthy volunteer include follow age range : 2130 year , 3140 year , 4150 year , 5160 year , 6170 year , 70 year . Research subject may male female must righthanded . Pregnant woman participate study . Research subject ask refrain caffeine nicotine least 12 hour abstain alcohol least 24 hour fMRI . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects belong one follow group exclude study : Subjects familial history PD . Patients mark rest tremor ( score UPDRS scale 3 right upper limb ) . Patients score Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale equal 3 . Patients progressive neurological disorder PD . Subjects cognitive impairment ( i.e. , score Mattis scale 123/144 ) . Subjects significant mood disturbance ( i.e. , score BDI scale 10 ) . Subjects abnormal MRI finding visual inspection ( prominent normal variant mega cisterna cavum septum pellucidum , sign severe cortical subcortical atrophy , brain tumor , vascular disease , trauma AVMs ) . Subjects history significant medical disorder , require chronic treatment drug stop . Subjects prior exposure neuroleptic agent drug use . Subjects significant past present history hypertension , cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . Subjects severe orthopedic rheumatologic pathology right upper limb . Subjects past present neuropsychiatric illness , head trauma loss consciousness , epilepsy , cerebrovascular disease , past present history alcohol substance abuse , include cigarette , medical condition may alter cerebral functioning Subjects cancer . Subjects pacemaker , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include heart valve cochlear implant ) shrapnel fragment . Subjects incapable give informed consent . Subjects positive pregnancy test . Subjects preexist eye condition . Subjects unable tolerate antiparkinsonian medication 12 hour . Children exclude study PD infrequent age 30 .</criteria>
