	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness drug call amifostine reduce bowel side effect radiation treatment prostate cancer . Amifostine 'radioprotector ' medicine protects normal tissue radiation damage . This study determine whether place amifostine rectum radiation treatment prostate cancer decrease common side effect treatment , include diarrhea , painful bowel movement , bleeding , gas . Patients 18 year age old prostate cancer may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , bone scan recent one available , possibly compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan pelvis . They also liquid retention test , give enema 4 tablespoon salt water must retain 20 minute . Participants receive standard radiation therapy prostate cancer-5 consecutive day 8 weeks-in National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Radiation Oncology Clinic . Amifostine place rectum mini-enema radiation treatment cover line rectum . To determine side effect treatment , patient undergo proctoscopic examination begin radiation therapy , two time therapy , follow-up visit 5 year treatment end . This examination involve insert proctoscope ( thin flexible tube light end ) rectum take picture . Patients follow clinic visit schedule 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month treatment physical examination routine blood test , proctoscopic examination , review bowel symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal tissue tolerance rectum limit dose radiation deliver prostate curative treatment prostate cancer . Amifostine radioprotector , agent reduces tissue damage incur ionizing radiation . It well study human approve intravenous use . Rectal administration result preferential accumulation Amifostine rectal mucosa , neither free parent compound free active metabolite detect systemic circulation . This trial propose observe rate early late bowel toxicity group patient prostate cancer receive standard high dose , 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy concurrent intra-rectal application Amifostine . Primary measure rectal toxicity ( RTOG radiation morbidity score ) also compare self-assessment measure quality life , rectal radiation dose assess dose-volume histogram .</detailed_description>
