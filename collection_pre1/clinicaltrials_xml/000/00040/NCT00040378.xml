	<detailed_description>Studies show increase oxidative stress ( excess free radical ) may damage brain cell link Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Many study show increased oxidation brain lipid ( fat ) , proteins , carbohydrate ( sugar ) DNA AD . Although cause AD known , believe oxidative stress part damage brain cell AD probably brain disease . Animal tissue culture study vitamin E selenium suggest protect brain cell damage . This research study do see safe effective vitamin E selenium may prevent AD brain illness . These illness common people age 60 65 . A potential benefit participate PREADVISE study early detection memory change lead early diagnosis treatment . Also , participant may decrease risk get AD supplement effective . The finding study may also help research understand AD . Only participant take part SELECT study ( study look use vitamin E selenium prevent prostate cancer ) may apply participate PREADVISE study useful vitamin E selenium might prevent memory change age ( include Alzheimer 's disease disease affect brain ) . African American Hispanic men age 60 older may take part . Men ethnic group age 62 older may take part .

If long memory screen also suggest problem participant 's memory , participant ask see family doctor PREADVISE doctor complete medical exam find possible cause memory change . Results doctor 's medical exam , consent participant , send PREADVISE doctor review help diagnosis . Results memory check give participant . However , participant medical workup memory change , information give family doctor medical workup complete . A portion blood sample take participant enter SELECT might analyze test genetic risk factor associate Alzheimer 's disease , call Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) . The result test use research purpose .</detailed_description>
