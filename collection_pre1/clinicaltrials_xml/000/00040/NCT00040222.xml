	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals age 18 consider inclusion study : Family history neoplasia unusual type , pattern , number include breast cancer consistent identify suspected familial cancer syndrome include breast and/or ovarian cancer , Personal history neoplasia ( ) benign condition unusual type unusual demographic feature ( young age onset , multiple primary site , rare tumor type pathologic characteristic ) consistent identify suspected familial cancer syndrome include breast and/or ovarian cancer , A know mutation associate one breast/ovarian cancer family syndrome . Eligibility restrict bloodline individual age 18 family already enrol 02C0212 know BRCA mutation Personal family medical history must verify questionnaire , interview , review pathology slide medical record . For know suspected familial syndrome gene identify , two living affected case among family member require participation . The type familial syndrome active accrual study predominantly investigatorand hypothesisdriven . This approach permit CGB investigator remain alert opportunity afford unexpected cluster rare tumor family individual , tailor accrual family specific type syndromes meet programmatic goal . This require CGB investigator remain abreast general knowledge stateof theart development clinical oncology , genetics , epidemiology molecular biology , critical research opportunity recognize present , thoughtful decision make regard commitment resource need conduct study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals family refer evaluation report diagnosis verifiable . Inability provide inform consent .</criteria>
