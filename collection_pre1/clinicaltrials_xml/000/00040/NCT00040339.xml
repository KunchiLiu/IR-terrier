	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine hypothermia ( body cool ) , administer soon severe brain injury improve functional outcome . This pilot trial end July 2005 . Please see clinicaltrials.gov record number NCT00178711 Phase III version trial ( see link ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermia Treat Severe Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After brain injury , brain produce certain chemical harmful injured tissue . Moderate hypothermia—also call body cooling—may slow prevent production chemical . Hypothermia also decrease amount oxygen need brain , may provide protection critical period . Earlier study show maintenance moderate hypothermia may helpful effect head injury patient age 16 45 arrive hospital low body temperature suggest early cooling may beneficial . In study scientist initiate hypothermia body cool 35˚C within two hour severe brain injury determine body cool improves functional outcome . Patients may enter study one two way . They may evaluate surface cool begin scene emergency medical service ( EMS ) personnel affiliate study ; patient arrive emergency department ( ED ) study hospital within 2 hour injury—and already evaluate EMS personnel affiliate study—will evaluate cooling begin , applicable , NABISH study personnel . NABISH-trained EMS personnel reach patient suspect severe head injury within 2 hour injury induce hypothermia 35˚C scene , transit , ED . NABISH study personnel induce hypothermia 35˚C ED patient suspect severe head injury reach ED within 2 hour injury cool already begin . Patients meet entry criterion ( base upon past study ) moderate hypothermia 48 hour cool 33˚C gradually rewarmed 48 hour 33˚C . Patients initially cool 35˚C within 2 hour injury prove trauma evaluation exclusion criterion 48 hour moderate hypothermia warm 35˚C 37˚C . This pilot trial end July 2005 . Please see clinicaltrials.gov record number NCT00178711 Phase III version trial ( see link ) .</detailed_description>
