ARTexperienced subject define great 4 week ( 28 day ) therapy NRTI ( ) length therapy NNRTI ( ) and/or PI . PIexperienced subject eligible previously treat &lt; three PIs , exclude AGENERASE . Prior therapy RTV boost PI regimen consider 1 prior PI long RTV dose recommend use RTV antiretroviral agent . This specific criterion applicable subject screen and/or enrol approval Amendment No . 4 . For subject screen and/or enrol approval Amendment No.4 , PI naive subject define ART experience subject less one week therapy PI prior experience AGENERASE . Prior treatment NNRTIs NRTIs permit ( however , subject NOT permit receive concurrent NNRTI therapy participate study ) Prior history receive amprenavir .
