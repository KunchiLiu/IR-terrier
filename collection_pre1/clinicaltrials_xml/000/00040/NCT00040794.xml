	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial study well combine different regimen chemotherapy gefitinib radiation therapy work treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth non-small cell lung cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving different regimen combination therapy together gefitinib radiation therapy may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether ZD1839 ( gefitinib ) 250 mg orally every day administer concomitantly radiotherapy induction treatment consist paclitaxel , carboplatin , ZD1839 among patient inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer Common Terminology Criteria ( CTC ) performance status 2 poor risk performance status 0-1 tolerable . II . To determine whether ZD1839 250 mg orally every day administer concomitantly paclitaxel , carboplatin , radiation induction treatment consist paclitaxel , carboplatin , ZD1839 among patient inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer CTC performance status 0-1 tolerable . III . To determine overall response rate , failure-free survival , survival treatment induction chemotherapy daily ZD1839 , concomitant radiotherapy daily ZD1839 , post-radiotherapy single agent daily ZD1839 among patient CTC performance status 2 poor risk performance status 0-1 inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer . IV . To determine overall response rate , failure-free survival , survival treatment induction chemotherapy daily ZD1839 , concomitant chemoradiotherapy daily ZD1839 , post-radiotherapy single agent daily ZD1839 among patient CTC performance status 0-1 inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer . V. To determine elevated circulate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) level prior treatment , determine either quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) measurement , may predict response therapy EGFR inhibitor . OUTLINE : All patient receive induction therapy comprise paclitaxel IV 3 hour follow carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients receive therapy base assign stratum . STRATUM I : Patients receive gefitinib orally ( PO ) daily 7 week . Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily 5 day week 7 week . STRATUM II : Patients receive gefitinib radiotherapy stratum I concurrently paclitaxel IV 1 hour follow carboplatin 30 minute weekly 7 week . Patients receive gefitinib PO daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
