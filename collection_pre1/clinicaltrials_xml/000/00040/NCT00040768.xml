	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate , time progression , survival patient advance non-small cell lung cancer treat bortezomib . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Correlate toxicity activity drug marker proteasome inhibition blood peripheral mononuclear cell patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive prior bortezomib achieve least partial response least 6 month duration may also receive therapy .</detailed_description>
