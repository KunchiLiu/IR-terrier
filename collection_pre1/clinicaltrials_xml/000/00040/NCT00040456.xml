	<brief_summary>Subjects form sickle cell disease , call hemoglobin SC disease . This result abnormally shape red blood cell get 'stuck ' blood vessel result episode severe pain ( pain crisis ) . Patients common form sickle cell disease , call hemoglobin SS disease , also suffer pain crisis . Treatment drug hydroxyurea available help prevent pain crisis hemoglobin SS disease , good treatment help prevent pain crisis hemoglobin SC disease . It show one reason formation abnormally shape red blood cell patient SC disease fact cell contain enough water ; dehydrate . Drinking water increase amount water cell . Certain salts mineral however effect amount water red blood cell . One important mineral influence call magnesium . Magnesium present food also certain medication use treat heartburn . Magnesium use successfully animals people increase amount water red blood cell well tolerated people . Investigators use new form magnesium know magnesium pidolate form magnesium may help symptoms disease without cause diarrhea ( common side effect magnesium product ) . Purpose The purpose study find whether treatment magnesium pidolate increase amount water red blood cell result few painful crisis patient hemoglobin SC disease cause diarrhea . The study last 64 week ( 16 month ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This placebo-controlled study mean effectiveness magnesium medication ( chemical form know Mg pidolate ) compare placebo . A placebo look like drug study ( case magnesium ) contain active drug kind . Comparing magnesium placebo help decide whether magnesium well treatment placebo . The study last 64 week ( 16 month ) divide 2 part , part last 32 week ( 8 month ) . During first part study medication ( magnesium placebo ) take twice daily 24 week ( 6 month ) , follow study medication 8 week . These 8 week call washout period , time effect study medication 'washed-out ' body . After washout 8 week , patient enter second part study . During second part , study medication ( magnesium placebo ) take twice daily 24 week . During second part study participant receive whichever study medication take first part study . Following second 24 week , observation period 8 week ( time study medication take ) . The study complete end 8-week observation period . Participants take magnesium 24 week placebo 24 week . The decision whether participant receive magnesium placebo first make randomly computer . This double-blind study mean neither participant study doctor know study medication take part study . However , study may unblinded safety issue necessary . If participant responds study medication , continue completion 24 week . The study medication form liquid , take two time day ( morning evening ) actual amount take depend participant 's weight . During study participant see clinic regular basis ; initially every 2 week , later month . There total 21 clinic visit study . Three clinic visit would normally take place routine management disease . The 18 visit require study . At visit participant blood test measure amount magnesium blood , especially red blood cell , also look change might occur . The total amount blood collect 16 month study 120 ml ( 24 teaspoon ) , safe amount . Three ml ( half teaspoon ) draw 13 visit , 5ml ( 1 teaspoon ) 4 visit , 15ml ( 3 teaspoon ) 4 visit . At 4 clinic visit urine test perform . During study participant ask keep record episodes pain , change notice , form diary .</detailed_description>
