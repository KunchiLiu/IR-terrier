	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect experimental drug call JP-1730 Parkinson 's disease symptom dyskinesias ( involuntary movement ) develop result long-term treatment levodopa . JP-1730 affect chemical messenger believe affect Parkinson 's disease symptom . Patients 30 80 year age relatively advance Parkinson 's disease may eligible 3-phase study . - Phase 1 - Baseline evaluation Participants evaluate medical history , physical examination , detailed neurologic evaluation , routine blood test , urinalysis electrocardiogram . They also 24-hour holter monitor ( heart monitoring ) cardiology consultation . A chest X-ray MRI CT scan brain do need . Patients , possible , stop take antiparkinsonian medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) one month study begin throughout duration . ( If necessary , patient may use short-acting dopamine agonist , Mirapex Requip . ) - Phase 2 - Dose Finding Phase For 2 3 day , patient admit NIH Clinical Center levodopa ( dopamine agonist ) dose-finding procedure . For procedure , patient stop take Sinemet instead levodopa , subsequently apomorphine , infused vein . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly either 1 ) parkinsonian symptom improve , 2 ) unacceptable side effect occur , 3 ) maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently find optimal dose . ( Patients dose infusion last 3 month undergo phase study . ) - Phase 3 - Active Study Phase Within 3 month dose-finding phase , treatment begin . Patients receive seven dos JD-1730 placebo ( inactive substance ) via puff oral spray together levodopa infusion 3-week period . The dos give day 1 , 2 , 3 first week approximately twice week next 2 week . For dos , patient hospitalize 4 day first week 2 day next 2 week . All participant receive placebo time study , patient , select random , receive placebo entire 3 week . The procedure infusions dose-finding phase , frequent evaluation symptom . Also , small blood sample draw three time study day . At end third week , patient discharge hospital . Their anti-parkinsonian medication may readjust , need . Patients contact 2 week end study check side effect , necessary , schedule follow-up evaluation clinic . In addition procedure , patient ask optional lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) first last day study measure various brain chemical drug level measure blood urine . For procedure , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone ( vertebra ) low back . About 2 tablespoon fluid collect needle .</brief_summary>
