	<brief_summary>This study determine safety effectiveness sirolimus ( RapamuneÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) treat focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) , disease involve kidney scar increase protein urine . About one-half patient FSGS go develop end-stage kidney disease within 6 year , require dialysis kidney transplant . Therapies reduce urine protein likely stop progression renal scarring reduce chance develop kidney failure . However , current treatment FSGS , prednisone , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , effective many patient cause serious side effect . This study see sirolimus , drug anti-scarring immune suppress property , low amount protein urine slow stop kidney disease . Patients 13 year age old FSGS least one standard treatment FSGS may eligible 24-month study . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , review medical record kidney biopsy , 24-hour urine collection , blood test . Participants take sirolimus tablet day 1 year . Three 24-hour urine collection do start treatment . Blood drawn measure drug level every week first month start treatment , every week 1 month , every 2 month treatment stop . Patients complete response drug low level dose increase . Patients see NIH clinic Bethesda , Md. , screen visit 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 15 month blood urine test . Additional urine collection blood test do periodically throughout 24-month study period patient 's local physician . Patients whose urine protein decrease therapy ask wait 3 month start another treatment monitor time determine response sustain . Patients whose urine protein level decrease sirolimus ask wait 3 month start another therapy . Follow-up local physician continue 18 24 month start study . Patients whose urine protein level increase sirolimus treatment take study may seek treatment time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sirolimus immunosuppressive agent recently approve use organ transplantation . We propose carry pilot study whose objective determine safety efficacy profile sirolimus focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . Current therapy FSGS limit efficacy . Sirolimus select follow reason : 1 ) sirolimus reduces proliferation mesangial cell endothelial cell , 2 ) sirolimus reduces fibrosis experimental model liver kidney disease , 3 ) sirolimus potent immunosuppressive , immunosuppressives include glucocorticoid cyclosporine show efficacy FSGS , 4 ) sirolimus may direct anti-proteinuric effect , suggest vitro study . We recruit 30 patient , include adult child great equal 13.0 year age . The study design open label , therapy one year use dos adjust achieve trough level 5-15 ng/mL first 4 month complete remission achieve sustain , 10-20 ng/mL remainder study . The primary outcome reduction proteinuria , categorize complete remission partial remission , compare baseline value 12 month value . The study recruit patient two group : 1 ) drug washout group , patient tolerate receive immunosuppressive therapy 4 week prior initiate sirolimus therapy , 2 ) drug overlap group , patient tolerate cessation immunosuppressive therapy due severe edema complication nephrotic syndrome ; patient receive prednisone 6 month take sirolimus ( target prednisone less 20 mg QOD month 3 ) receive cyclosporine , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil 4 week initiate sirolimus therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Renal biopsy show FSGS , include variant exception HIVassociated FSGS . Nephrotic range proteinuria , define 24 hour urine protein excretion great equal 3.5 g/d adult child weigh great equal 70 kg great equal 50 mg/kg adult child weigh less 70 kg . Proteinuria assess least three 24 hour urine collection obtain baseline period ( collection , minimum period , maximum period 3 month prior study entry , recent must within 1 month entry ) . These measurement obtain angiotensin antagonist therapy ( tolerant medication ) exclude urine collection judge inadequate base creatinine appearance . For patient drug overlap group , baseline proteinuria determine patient 's record demonstrate least one urine collection , proteinuria great 3.5 g/d immunosuppressive therapy . Ability willingness provide inform consent ( adult great equal 18.0 year ) assent ( child great equal 13.0 year ) . Completion therapeutic trial least one following , without sustain CR : Steroid therapy great equal 8 week , either daily alternate day intermittent ( oral parenteral ) Cyclosporine tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil great equal 3 month Cyclophosphamide ( either oral intravenous ) chlorambucil great equal three month EXCLUSION CRITERIA Intolerance sirolimus prior use sirolimus FSGS . Estimated GFR le 30 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) . The rational 1 ) sirolimus therapy likely beneficial early phase FSGS , progressive fibrosis glomerulus interstitium become dominant abnormality may irreversible , 2 ) wish enroll patient unlikely progress ESRD within one year treatment period . Patients follow renal transplant . We wish rest sirolimus minimum immunosuppressive therapy . Children le 13.0 year . Uncontrolled hypertension , define BP great 140/90 great 25 % measurement . Pregnancy , lactation , unwillingness inability practice effective contraception . The rationale safety sirolimus pregnancy determine excretion via breast milk may alter pharmacokinetics . Chronic active infection require treatment , include untreated reactive PPD , infection sufficiently severe require parenteral antibiotic precede 30 day . The rationale immunosuppression may exacerbate infection . HIV1 infection hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection ( define detectable RNA antiviral therapy ) . The rationale immunosuppression may exacerbate infection . Chronic liver disease sufficiently severe impair sirolimus metabolism ; would include prolonged prothrombin time . Basal thrombocytopenia less 100,000 cells/microliter absolute neutrophil count less 2000 cells/microliter hematocrit le 30 . The rationale sirolimus may lower cell count . Cancer diagnosis cancer recurrence within precede 5 year , exclude basal cell carcinoma skin . The rationale cancer progression may accelerate immunosuppression .</criteria>
