	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis disease may cause immune system react nervous system . It possible , change immune system modify progression disease . In study , try learn whether treatment bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) help patient multiple sclerosis . We also try learn side effect treatment patient multiple sclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To participate study , patient need central line ( thin plastic catheter tube place surgery one large vein neck chest ) . Central line use give intravenous medication draw blood . Before transplant test patient blood virus cause problem transplant . These virus include Hepatitis B , cause liver damage , cytomegalovirus , cause lung disease HIV cause AIDS . If patient positive AIDS virus , able undertake transplant . In addition blood test patient also MRI ( picture create use magnetic rather x-ray energy ) brain evaluation standard patient transplant . Before transplant patient receive daily G-CSF ( Neupogen ) . This medicine help stimulate production white blood cell ( WBC ) use bone marrow transplant . In addition , 6 tablespoon blood collect look immune system function transplant . After white blood cell reach certain level , patient undergo leukapheresis . Leukapheresis procedure blood remove patient arm , pump machine white blood cell separate cell , return patient needle needle arm . After collection white blood cell , use device lab select certain type white blood cell ( CD34+ ) . After leukapheresis , patient receive antibody horse call Atgam ( ATG ) help destroy immune system also drug call cyclophosphamide . After , radiation treatment give entire body . This do 2 time day 3 day . This treatment kill blood-forming cell bone marrow . We give CD34+ white blood cell collect leukapheresis . Blood collect immune reconstitution study monthly 3 month 6 , 9 , 12 month transplant look immune system function . The amount blood take 90ml ( 6 tablespoon ) . After first year treatment patient continue 90ml ( 6 tablespoon ) blood take immune reconstitution study every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : The diagnosis primary secondary progressive multiple sclerosis relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis . Patients relapsing/remitting MS demonstrate sustain accumulate disability base upon accepted standard . Relapsing/remitting MS characterize unpredictable recurrent attack neurologic dysfunction follow complete , partial recovery . By Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) measure disability equal exceed 5.0 exceed 7.5 . For primary secondary progressive MS , progression disease use EDSS criterion proceed 12 month equal exceed 1.0 . Symptoms manifestation MS activity respond conventional treatment , e.g . high dose prednisone , beta interferon , conventional dose cytoxan , glatiramer acetate etc . The patient able undergo collection sufficient number HSCs meet protocol requirement , i.e . 3X10e6 CD34+ cell . Males females &lt; 60 year old . Patient must life expectance &gt; 6 week . Patients receive prior lymphoid irradiation . Patients history hypersensitivity murine proteins E.coli derive protein . Patients history lack compliance medical care medical psychiatric condition would compromise ability comply protocol . Patients evidence myelodysplasia active malignancy . Patients receive concurrent beta interferon therapy high dose prednisone . The patient exhibit significant organ toxicity cause . Significant organ toxicity include : Creatinine great twice normal ; glomerular filtration rate le 40 ml/min . FEV1 FVC le 75 % predict ; DLCO le 50 % predict . Significant cardiac dysfunction define life endanger arrythmias shorten ejection fraction ( le 26 % ) . Hepatic transaminase great two time normal ; total bilirubin great 3.0 mg/dl . The patient able give inform consent . Both male female patient must agree use effective contraception minimum 12 month post transplant . Effective contraception include total abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , contraceptive implant skin ( Norplants ) , contraceptive injection , contraceptive foam condom . In addition , male partner use condom . Exclusion : Active infection . Unable tolerate MRI . HIV positive patient . Pregnant lactating woman</criteria>
