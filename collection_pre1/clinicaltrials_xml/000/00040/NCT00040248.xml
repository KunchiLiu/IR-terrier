	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness daclizumab ( also call Zenapax anti-CD25 ) patient Wegener 's granulomatosis , type vasculitis ( blood vessel inflammation ) . Wegener 's granulomatosis affect many part body , include brain , nerve , eye , sinus , lung , kidney , intestinal tract , skin , joint , heart , site . Standard treatment combination prednisone cytotoxic agent ( drug interferes cell growth ) , usually cyclophosphamide methotrexate . However , many patient treat regimen disease relapse , others take drug severe side effect . This study focus effectiveness daclizumab prevent disease relapse . The Food Drug Administration approve daclizumab 1997 prevent kidney transplant rejection , drug also study people eye infection call uveitis . The drug work bind protein T lymphocyte ( white blood cell immune system ) call CD25 . This prevent another protein , call interleukin-2 , bind site , thereby prevent series event normally result inflammation . Patients 10 75 year age Wegener 's granulomatosis may eligible study . Participants medical history review physical examination , include laboratory study . If medically indicate , x-ray , consultation biopsy ( surgical removal small tissue sample ) affect organ also conduct . All patient begin treatment prednisone cyclophosphamide daily . Those improve regimen reduce prednisone gradually continue cyclophosphamide disease remission . While take cyclophosphamide , patient must blood urine test do every 1 2 week . Those achieve disease remission stop cyclophosphamide start take methotrexate week , usually mouth possibly injection muscle skin . Blood urine test conduct week 4 week dosage adjust month duration treatment . Patients methotrexate whose prednisone dose reduce 10 30 mg every day randomly assign either receive receive daclizumab addition methotrexate . Daclizumab give intravenously ( plastic tube insert vein ) day randomization , 2 week , 4 week , month 18 month . All patient continue taper prednisone dose stop . Methotrexate continue 2 year . Patients whose disease remain remission time decrease methotrexate dose . If active disease prednisone methotrexate stop , treatment give . If disease recurs later time , treatment reinstituted . The treatment determine severity disease , medical condition , history side effect . Patients randomize daclizumab relapse still take methotrexate may offer re-treatment daclizumab . Patients evaluate outpatient clinic every 4 8 week randomization . Patients take daclizumab follow every 4 12 week ; take drug see every 2 week first month , every month 18-month treatment period , every 4 12 week medication stop . Follow-up evaluation include physical examination , blood draw , medically indicate , X-rays . The total study duration 60 70 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety efficacy daclizumab adjunctive treatment methotrexate maintain remission induce cyclophosphamide glucocorticoid patient Wegener 's granulomatosis . In study , patient initially receive daily cyclophosphamide glucocorticoid disease remission , cyclophosphamide discontinue patient receive methotrexate remission maintenance . Following switch methotrexate prednisone dose taper 20mg QOD ( plus minus 10mg QOD ) , patient remission randomize receive daclizumab receive daclizumab . Those randomized receive daclizumab treat 1 mg/kg intravenously day 0 , week 2 , week 4 every month thereafter total 18 month ( 20 dos ) . Regardless arm patient randomize , continue receive methotrexate . Two year methotrexate start , patient remain remission , taper discontinue . Patients prospectively monitor evidence disease relapse drug toxicity . Specific parameter obtain include time disease remission , rate time disease relapse , incidence drug-related adverse event .</detailed_description>
