	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine tumor response rate patient recurrent , unresectable , metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat BAY 56-3722 . - Determine duration response , time progression , survival patient treat drug . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BAY 56-3722 IV 30 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-140 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
