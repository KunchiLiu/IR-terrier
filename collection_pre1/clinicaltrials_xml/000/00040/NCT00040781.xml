	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose gefitinib child refractory solid tumor . II . Determine dose-limiting toxicity drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . IV . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity drug patient . V. Correlate pharmacogenetic polymorphism drug pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . If myelosuppression find dose-limiting toxicity , patient stratify accord prior therapy ( 2 multiagent chemotherapy regimens radiotherapy 20 % bone marrow stem cell transplantation without total body irradiation vs 2 single-agent phase I phase II agent ) extent disease ( bone marrow involvement v meet none stratum I criteria ) . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos gefitinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-45 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
