	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness drug memantine treat major depression . Major depression serious public health concern contribute significant morbidity mortality . Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , proportion patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Recent study suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression . Memantine agent reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent novel class antidepressant . The study consist three phase . In Phase 1 , participant taper psychiatric medication 2-week washout period . In Phase 2 , participant randomly assign receive either memantine placebo ( inactive pill ) three time day 8 week . Participants respond treatment 8 week take study offered standard treatment . Weekly psychiatric evaluation evaluate treatment response . During Phase 2 , participant respond well treatment enter Phase 3 , 16-week continuation phase either memantine placebo . Interviews conduct every week first month , monthly thereafter . Participants physical examination , neuropsychological test , eye blink test baseline end study . Pulse , blood pressure , blood sample take throughout study . Participants undergo electrocardiogram well positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Memantine Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major affective disorder common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Major depression contribute significant morbidity mortality . Impairment physical social function result depression severe chronic medical illness . Suicide cause death 10-20 % individual recurrent depressive disorder . Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic unipolar bipolar depression . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system . Furthermore , grow body data suggest mood disorder associate regional volumetric reduction , cell loss atrophy . It thus noteworthy lamotrigine , , among effect reduces glutamate release , antidepressant effect , pilot study suggest NMDA antagonist may antidepressant effect . Together , data suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression , agent , directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission , may represent novel class antidepressant . Memantine ( Akatinol memantine ) , agent approve Germany dementia syndrome , Parkinson 's disease significant antiglutamatergic neuroprotective property , may prove antidepressant property depress patient . In study , propose investigate potential efficacy memantine , agent reduces glutamatergic output via open-channel block NMDA receptor-associated ion channel . Most importantly , memantine block channel period abnormal , excessive activity , leave relatively spared normal neurotransmission . This finding basis minimal side effect profile display memantine . Patients , age 18 80 , diagnosis major depression ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment outpatient study receive either memantine ( 5-20mg/day ) placebo period 8 week . Following acute period , patient fully respond could enter 16-week continuation phase . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Approximately 112 patient acute major depression enrol study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects may include study meet follow criterion : Male female subject , 18 80 year age . Female subject childbearing potential must use medically accept mean contraception . Each subject must level understanding sufficient agree test examination require protocol . Subjects must consider reliable . Each subject must understand nature study must sign informed consent document . Subjects must fulfill criterion major depression , recurrent without psychotic feature define DSMIV base clinical assessment confirm structured diagnostic interview SCIDP . Subjects must initial score Visit 1 Visit 2 least 22 MADRS . Subjects must decrease total score MADRS great 20 % washout ( Visits 1 2 ) . Current major depressive episode least 4 week duration . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude study follow reason : Lack response 2 antidepressant ( adequate dose duration ) . Participation clinical trial another investigational drug within 1 month ( 30 day ) prior study entry ( Visit 1 ) . Female subject either pregnant nursing . Serious , unstable illness include hepatic , renal , gastroenterologic , respiratory , cardiovascular ( include ischemic heart disease ) , endocrinologic , neurologic , immunologic , hematologic disease . Subjects uncorrected hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism . Subjects one seizures without clear resolve etiology . Documented history hypersensitivity intolerance amantadine prior treatment memantine . DSMIV substance abuse dependence ( except nicotine caffeine ) within past 90 day . Treatment injectable depot neuroleptic within less one dosing interval depot neuroleptic injection prior Visit 2 . Treatment reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor , guanethidine , guanadrel within 1 week prior Visit 2 . Treatment fluoxetine within 6 week prior Visit 2 . Treatment concomitant medication primarily CNS activity . Treatment clozapine within 4 week prior Visit 2 . Treatment amitriptyline ( elavil ) within 4 week prior Visit 2 since amitriptyline similar TCAs may manifest mild NMDA receptor antagonism , demonstrate electrophysiological study . Treatment anticonvulsant carbamazepine ( tegretol , carbatrol , tegretol XR similar derivative ) , gabapentin ( neurontin ) felbamate ( felbatol ) within 4 week prior Visit 2 drug may interfere NMDA receptor function . Treatment electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) within 3 month ( 90 day ) prior Visit 2 . Current diagnosis schizophrenia psychotic bipolar disorder define DSMIV . Judged clinically serious suicidal risk .</criteria>
