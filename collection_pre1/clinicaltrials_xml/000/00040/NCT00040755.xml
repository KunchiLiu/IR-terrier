	<brief_title>BMS-275291 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time disease progression patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat two different dos BMS-275291 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat two different dos BMS-275291 . II . To assess rate response BMS-275291 , use PSA measurable disease . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxic effect agent patient population . IV . To investigate correlation tumor response change level serum osteocalcin , alkaline phosphatase , procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide ( PICP ) , procollagen I amino-terminal propeptide ( PINP ) , N-telopeptide ; correlation tumor response change level urine pyridinoline deoxypyridinoline . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Gleason score ( 2-4 v 5-7 vs 8-10 ) , PSA level ( le 10 ng/mL vs 10-50 ng/mL v 51-100 ng/mL v 100 ng/mL ) , concurrent bisphosphonate therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral BMS-275291 daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive oral BMS-275291 twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-68 patient ( 12-34 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 5-14 month .</detailed_description>
