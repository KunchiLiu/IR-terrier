	<brief_title>Benefits Medical Therapy Plus Stenting Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis common problem clear consensus diagnosis therapy . There likely exist progression renal ischemia lead neuroendocrine activation , hypertension , renal insufficiency result acceleration atherosclerosis , renal dysfunction , development leave ventricular hypertrophy . These event turn lead adverse clinical event . Renal artery stenosis one two major know cause hypertension occur 1-5 % hypertensive patient . In patient accelerated hypertension , prevalence renal artery stenosis much high , range 10-40 % . Renal artery stenosis , occur bilaterally , solitary kidney , significant cause end-stage renal disease , account several percent patient end-stage renal disease . Clinically , atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis major problem primarily old patient , often see long-standing hypertensive whose blood pressure become difficult control . Of major significance progressive nature atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis , progress rate 10 % per year ( 45-60 % progression rate 4-7 year follow-up ) . Over time period , 10-15 % patient develop total renal artery occlusion . If renal artery stenosis great 75 % detect , 40 % patient develop total occlusion . Due progressive nature atherosclerotic lesion , decline renal function individual , difficult-to-control hypertension , medical community seek detect patient intervention would beneficial . This extremely difficult achieve test date uniformly predictive , include peripheral vein plasma renin activity , renal vein renin activity , captopril-stimulated nuclear medicine renal scan , etc . Since approximately 50 % patient unilateral renal artery stenosis significant degree ( definition vary ) benefit surgical intervention , enthusiasm continue advent renal artery angioplasty . The entire field move quickly . However , neither current data prospective study indicate benefit renal artery angioplasty plus stent . Studies last decade show balloon angioplasty alone associate high rate recurrence patient atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis . In present climate , great enthusiasm perform angioplasty plus stent placement atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis , without support data efficacy compare medical management alone . Angioplasty stent placement renal artery domain interventional radiologist , recently , interventional cardiologist also perform procedure . The question benefit intervention intervention use answer . Renal artery angioplasty stent placement subject patient procedural risk , well increase cost , compare aggressive antihypertensive medication risk factor medication therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , multicenter clinical trial contrast effect optimal medical therapy alone stenting optimal medical therapy , composite cardiovascular renal endpoint : cardiovascular renal death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization congestive heart failure , stroke , double serum creatinine level , need renal replacement therapy . These endpoint evaluate clinical event committee mask treatment assignment . The secondary endpoint 1 ) evaluate mechanism link clinical event ; 2 ) describe differential effectiveness critical end-organs ; 3 ) determine value stenting patient health policy perspective , measure quality life cost-effectiveness ; 4 ) evaluate clinically relevant difference treatment effectiveness within primary endpoint . Patients undergo baseline evaluation determine eligibility . Approximately 1,080 patient randomize optimal medical therapy alone stenting optimal medical therapy estimate 100 clinical site . Initially , patient follow 2-week interval , blood pressure target 2 month . Follow-up visit mandate 2 week , every 3 month first year annually thereafter . Coordinator visit also occur semi-annually . The CORAL Study Chair Lance Dworkin , MD , Brown University , Providence , RI .
