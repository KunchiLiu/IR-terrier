	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , 3-AP cisplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give 3-AP together cisplatin work treat patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP Cisplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity 3-AP cisplatin patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . II . Determine effect prognostic variable , include initial performance status , age , mucinous ( clear cell ) histology , patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized study . Patients receive 3-AP IV 2 hour day 1-4 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 2 3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 23-48 patient accrue study within 13 month .</detailed_description>
