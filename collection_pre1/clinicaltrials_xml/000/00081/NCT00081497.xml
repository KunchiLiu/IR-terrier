	<brief_summary>People Fabry Disease alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency alpha-galactosidase A enzyme . Fabrazyme ( agalsidase beta ) drug help break remove certain type fatty substance call `` glycolipids '' . These glycolipids normally present within body cell . In Fabry disease , glycolipids build various tissue liver , kidney , skin , blood vessel a-galactosidase A present , present small quantity . The build glycolipid ( globatriaosylceramide GL-3 ) level tissue particular thought cause clinical symptom common Fabry disease . This study analyze safety efficacy Fabrazyme treatment patient Fabry disease previously participate AGAL-008-00 ( NCT0074984 ) study .</brief_summary>
