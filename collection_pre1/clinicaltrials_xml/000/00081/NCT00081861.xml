	<brief_title>Avastin Plus Rituximab Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab new research drug may help stop slow growth blood vessel tumor . These blood vessel need tumor grow . Rituxan commercially available drug commonly use treat relapse refractory lymphoma . Before treatment start , ask question medical history surgery . You complete physical exam include blood ( around 3 tablespoon ) urine test . You sample bone marrow collect learn lymphoma spread bone marrow . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . You either CT scan MRI neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis , gallium PET scan . You ask medication take , include over-the-counter medication . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Additional blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) collect start therapy every 2 month study test help doctor researcher learn Bevacizumab work . During study , give dose rituximab vein week 8 week row , dose Bevacizumab every week . The drug contain bag give needle one vein . This method give drug call infusion . The infusion Bevacizumab may take 1 2 hour , infusion rituximab may take 3 6 hour . This method give drug call infusion . In first week , infusion rituxan Bevacizumab give day . During infusion drug , vital sign check often watched side effect . If experience side effect , infusion may slow stop symptom go away . Within 2 week 8th dose rituximab , ( 4th dose Bevacizumab ) follow-up visit schedule evaluate status disease . During follow-up visit , physical exam blood ( around 4 tablespoon ) collect lab test . You CT scan MRI , gallium PET scan , bone marrow biopsy ( need ) . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . If take study doctor decide stop study treatment , ask return M. D. Anderson schedule follow-up visit check long term side effect drug check status disease . If disease remain stable shrink 8 week therapy , may continue receive Bevacizumab treatment every 2 week maximum total 6 month . Even treatment show benefit , doctor may continue give additional treatment Bevacizumab beyond total 6 month . After treatment , follow-up visit schedule check status disease . These visit schedule every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month disease get bad . During visit , physical exam , blood test ( around 2 tablespoon ) , either CT scan MRI . You also sample bone marrow collect . This investigational study . Bevacizumab authorize FDA use research . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available . There cost Bevacizumab test procedure consider part standard care . Up 40 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Hemoglobin &lt; 9gm/dl ( may transfuse receive epoetin alfa [ e.g. , Epogen ] maintain exceed level ) . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History CNS disease ( include CNS involvement primary cancer ) hemorrhagic thrombotic stroke within last 6 month . History hemoptysis require transfusion and/or hospitalization within last 5 year . Anatomic lesion increase risk serious hemorrhage ( e.g. , invasion major vessel tumor ) . Current , ongoing treatment fulldose warfarin equivalent . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 0 . Fine needle aspiration , indwell catheter placement , core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 0 . Anticipation need major surgical procedure course study .</criteria>
