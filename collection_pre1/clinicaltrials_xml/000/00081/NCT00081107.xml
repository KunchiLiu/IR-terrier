	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , epothilone D , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well epothilone D work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer respond platinum-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epothilone D Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity epothilone D , term confirm objective response rate , patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer fail prior initial platinum-containing chemotherapy . Secondary - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine response duration patient achieve complete response partial response , time tumor progression , survival patient treat drug . - Compare power associate estimate treatment effect drug patient vs standard treatment . - Correlate efficacy safety plasma concentration drug major metabolite patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive epothilone D IV 90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 33-85 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
