	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness intratumoral ( tumor ) PV701 treat patient advanced recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma ( cancer ) head neck . Vaccines make specially-modified virus PV701 may make body build immune response kill tumor cell leave normal cell undamaged . Injecting PV701 directly tumor may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intratumoral PV701 Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Unresectable Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PV701 administer direct intratumoral injection patient advance recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma head neck . II . Determine toxicity intratumoral PV701 patient . III . Determine response rate time progression injection site patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive intratumoral PV701 weekly 3 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos PV701 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , least 6 evaluable patient treat dose . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 30 patient accrue study within 6-10 month .</detailed_description>
