	<brief_summary>There two previous Total Therapy study multiple myeloma ( MM ) Myeloma Institute Research Therapy ( MIRT ) : Total Therapy I ( 1989 1994 ) Total Therapy II ( 1996 2004 ) . Results show patient treated study well outcome ( mean patient live longer well response treatment ) compare patient treated standard chemotherapy . With new study , Total Therapy III , researcher take learn first two study add new treatment strategy try improve outcome even , especially patient chromosome abnormality .</brief_summary>
