	<brief_summary>This study use dynamic light scatter ( DLS ) technology study normal lens age early cataract formation . Cataract cloud lens interferes passage light retina , impair visual acuity . DLS use low intensity laser light ( similar use supermarket checkout ) measure lens cloudiness . It detect change human lens early molecular stage cataract development , anti-cataract treatment would effective reversing , delay prevent cataract formation . Healthy normal volunteer patient age-related cataract 18 80 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Medical history Eye examination , include follow : - Measurement visual acuity ( vision chart ) - Measurement eye pressure - Dilation pupil slit lamp ( microscope ) examination grade lens opacity - Ultrasound examination eye determine distance cornea , lens ( include lens thickness ) , retina - Examination retina back eye - Dynamic light scatter lens ( see ) - Lens photography use camera bright flash For DLS procedure , patient sits front DLS device chin place chin rest fix yellow target center camera lens . When eye properly align , DLS measurements take lens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A new non invasive , vivo technique study molecular change human lens , call Dynamic Light Scattering Device ( DLS ) , recently develop . Preliminary study show potential detect early change cataract , stage anti-cataract treatment would effective reversing , delay prevent cataract . A new miniaturize version device develop NASA use low energy laser , NASA-NEI Inter Agency Agreement , successfully developed clinical device NEI . We recently conduct pilot study evaluate usefulness reproducibility instrument quantitating human lens change , find good reproducibility . We also derive useful parameter use new technique , log mean particle size , derive particle size distribution data . Preliminary study also show NASA-NEI DLS device use detect monitor molecular change early cataract formation well normal age . We therefore propose conduct large cross sectional clinical study detect monitor molecular change lens early cataract formation normal aging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients aged 1880 year admit study . There racial gender bias recruitment . 227 patient AREDS nuclear cataract grade 2 le enrol study . 40 patient AREDS nuclear cataract grade 3 4 also enrol . For patient enrol study , eye evaluate protocol . However , participant right choose undergo measurement one eye . In case , eye examine determined partipantt 's birth month . If patient 's birth month even number , right eye examine ; patient 's birth month odd , leave eye examine . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects tear film disorder , corneal opacity disorder , uveitis , glaucoma difficulty fixating , exclude . Subjects think risk adverse reaction pupil dilation , history allergic reaction one dilating agent use , exclude .</criteria>
