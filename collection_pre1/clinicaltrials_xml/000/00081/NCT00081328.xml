	<brief_summary>The National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) sponsor consortium investigator conduct clinical treatment trial , Treatment Options type 2 Diabetes Adolescents Youth ( TODAY ) . The primary objective TODAY trial compare efficacy three treatment arm time treatment failure base glycemic control . The secondary aim : - compare evaluate safety three treatment arm ; - compare effect three treatment pathophysiology type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) regard beta cell function insulin resistance , body composition , nutrition , physical activity aerobic fitness , cardiovascular risk factor , microvascular complication , quality life , psychological outcome ; - evaluate influence individual family behavior treatment response ; - compare relative cost effectiveness three treatment arm . The three treatment regimen : ( 1 ) metformin alone , ( 2 ) metformin plus rosiglitazone , ( 3 ) metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention call TODAY Lifestyle Program ( TLP ) . The study recruit patient three-year period follow patient minimum two year . Patients randomize within two year diagnosis T2D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Options Type 2 Diabetes Adolescents Youth ( TODAY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T2DM dramatically increase throughout world many ethnic group among people diverse social economic background . Over last decade , increase number child youth T2DM label `` epidemic '' . Before 1990s , rare pediatric center patient T2DM . By 1994 , T2DM patient represent 16 % new case diabetes child urban area , 1999 , depend geographic location , range percent new case due T2DM 8-45 % disproportionately represent minority population . T2DM child youth , adult , due combination insulin resistance relative β-cell failure . It appear host genetic environmental risk factor insulin resistance limit β-cell reserve . The epidemic pediatric T2DM coincident rise number child overweight risk overweight decrease physical activity pattern youth . There strong association T2DM onset puberty , positive family history T2DM , elements metabolic syndrome acanthosis nigricans polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . Preceding development frank diabetes , child youth experience period prediabetes . Prediabetes define either elevated fast glucose impair glucose tolerance . Despite dramatic increase number case prediabetes T2DM pediatric population , publish large-scale study investigate pathophysiology , treatment , complication disorder child youth . The long-term complication cost associate T2DM make study imperative . Between 1997 2002 , estimate cost diabetes regard direct medical cost increase $ 44 billion $ 92 billion , total cost increase $ 98 billion $ 132 billion . The vast majority monies spend long-term complication disorder . Since long-term microvascular cardiovascular complication relate duration diabetes control glycemia , could hypothesize increase number child youth diagnose T2DM , effectively treat , could dramatically add economic burden disease ensue decade . Except American Indian youth , population-based data available regard prevalence T2DM . Instead , clinic-based report indicate tremendous increase number child adolescent T2DM . T2DM occur almost exclusively child youth overweight risk overweight ( BMI &gt; 85th percentile age ) . At time diagnosis , pediatric patient midst Tanner Stage 2-4 puberty . Puberty contribute insulin resistance due augmentation growth hormone secretion , normal pubertal physiologic change compensate increased insulin secretion , frank diabetes develop . Half three-quarters patient parent close ninety percent least one first second degree relative T2DM . The clinical presentation T2DM youth range mild asymptomatic hyperglycemia severe ketoacidosis . In present clinical symptom due hyperglycemia , glycosuria weight loss present 20-40 % , ketonuria present 33 % ketoacidosis find 5-10 % . Patients without clinical symptom diagnose result routine blood urine test health care visit investigate variety complaint chronic infection , sleep apnea , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , hirsutism irregular period associate PCOS . It may difficult distinguish T1DM T2DM presentation . The absence autoantibodies prerequisite diagnosis T2DM . In addition , evidence residual insulin secretion suggestive T2DM rather T1DM . Patients T2DM dual abnormality insulin resistance insulin deficiency . It hypothesize achieve level glycemic control require optimize long-term outcome decrease prevent microvascular complication , treatment regimen theoretically design improve insulin resistance preserve residual β-cell function . The available anti-diabetic agent adequately evaluate pediatric patient . This particularly relevant regard use combination therapy improve glycemic control lifestyle intervention aim obesity sedentary behavior .</detailed_description>
