	<brief_title>SES , Health Behaviors CVD Among Vietnam-Era Twins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) affect approximately 60,800,000 Americans year , claim life nearly one million people ( American Heart Association , 2001 ) . CVD likely complex etiology , reflect combine effect gene environment , well gene x gene gene x environment interaction . Examination environmental factor think affect CVD risk context genetically informative design help elucidate relative contribution genetic environmental factor potentially aid identifying environmental factor may interact genetic vulnerability predict CVD . Cardiovascular morbidity mortality over-represented among individual low socioeconomic stratum , behavior increase likelihood cardiovascular event , include smoking , heavy alcohol consumption physical inactivity ( Adler et al. , 1994 ; Anderson &amp; Armstead , 1995 ) . Thus , commonly assume socioeconomic status ( SES ) serve important environmental influence health health behavior . Twin study partition genetic environmental variance detect gene x environment interaction provide unique opportunity study association SES health . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study characterize nature association socioeconomic status ( SES ) , health behavior cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) exist Vietnam Era Twin ( VET ) registry , sample 4000 male twin pair mean age 51 1999 . Specifically , study : 1 ) determine strongly environmental factor contribute individual difference SES , health behavior CVD , relative genetic factor ; 2 ) examine whether measure SES associate health behavior CVD mortality control concomitant genetic influence ; 3 ) investigate whether SES interact genetic vulnerability predict health behavior CVD ( gene x environment interaction ) . Using VETdatasets , primary method analysis twin structural equation modeling .</detailed_description>
