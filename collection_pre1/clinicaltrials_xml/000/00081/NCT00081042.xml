	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , ABI-007 , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well ABI-007 work treat patient inoperable ( unresectable ) locally recurrent metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABI-007 Treating Patients With Inoperable Locally Recurrent Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity ABI-007 patient inoperable locally recurrent metastatic melanoma . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . Secondary - Determine time disease progression , term rate duration response stable disease , patient treat drug . - Determine survival patient treated drug . - Determine effect drug biomarkers melanoma patient . - Correlate biomarker level response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort accord prior cytotoxic chemotherapy ( previously treat vs chemotherapy-naïve ) . - Cohort I ( previously treat ) : Patients receive ABI-007 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . - Cohort II ( chemotherapy-naïve ) : Patients receive high dose ABI-007 cohort I . In cohort , course repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow monthly 6 month every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-70 patient ( 12-35 per cohort ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
