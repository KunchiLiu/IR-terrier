	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Celecoxib may also make tumor cell sensitive chemotherapy radiation therapy . Giving celecoxib capecitabine radiation therapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give neoadjuvant celecoxib together capecitabine pelvic irradiation work treat patient stage II stage III adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) rectum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Celecoxib Capecitabine Combined With Pelvic Irradiation Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Adenocarcinoma ( Cancer ) Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine pathological complete response rate patient stage II III adenocarcinoma rectum treat neoadjuvant celecoxib capecitabine combination pelvic irradiation . Secondary - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine rectal function patient treat regimen . - Determine time recurrence progression survival time patient treated regimen . - Correlate cellular molecular marker pretreatment tumor sample response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-7 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 . Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat weekly 5.5 week . - Surgery : Patients undergo surgery 4-6 week completion neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . - Adjuvant chemotherapy : Patients curative resection receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
