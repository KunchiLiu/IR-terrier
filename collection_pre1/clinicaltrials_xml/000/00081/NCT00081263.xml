	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well celecoxib work prevent cervical cancer patient CIN . Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development cancer treat early cancer . Celecoxib may effective preventing development cervical cancer patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy celecoxib , term achieve histologic complete partial response , patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) 2/3 3 . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect drug change lesion size patient . II . Determine effect drug human papillomavirus ( HPV ) viral load patient . III . Correlate histologic response , HPV viral load , lesion size , proliferation index , apoptosis index , angiogenesis ( VEGF ) COX-2 tissue , amount VEGF bFGF serum , serum celecoxib level treatment patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord lesion size ( cover ≤ ½ area cervix v cover &gt; ½ area cervix ) degree cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) ( CIN 2/3 v CIN 3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral celecoxib daily 14-18 week . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo daily 14-18 week . Patients undergo colposcopy week 8 week 14 18 . Between week 14 18 , patient evidence disease also undergo large loop excision transformation zone ( cone biopsy ) cervical biopsy patient evidence disease undergo cervical biopsy confirm absence disease colposcopy .</detailed_description>
