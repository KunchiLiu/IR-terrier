	<brief_summary>This study examine brain control movement people Tourette syndrome chronic tic disorder determine time movement important whether someone feel `` control '' movement . Although movement tic disorder often characterize `` involuntary , '' patient claim movement make voluntarily , unable decide voluntary involuntary . Previous experiment show people ask look clock report time first decide make movement report time later first brain wave associate movement appear . When ask report time first initiate movement , report time muscle actually begin move . This study may help determine sense willing initiate action alter patient Tourette syndrome chronic tic disorder , people may feel less `` control '' movement . Normal volunteer patient Tourette syndrome chronic tic disorder 18 65 year age may eligible study . Control subject must neurological psychological disorder , patient Tourette syndrome chronic tic disorder must neurological disorder . Patients attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) may enroll study . All participant medical history , physical examination , test determine level attention . Patients interview symptom complete psychiatric rating scale . In addition , participant undergo follow procedure : Electric shock Participants look clock computer screen , hand revolves quickly . While look clock , participant give small , non-painful electric shock ask , accord clock , say receive shock . The shock repeat 40 time . Arm movement Participants ask lift arm table repeatedly , random time , look computer clock . This exercise repeat 80 time . Of 80 , participant ask 10 time consecutively say time first desire move arm , 10 consecutively time first felt move arm . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) Electromyography ( EMG ) Participants undergo EEG EMG durin ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The purpose study determine subjective sense willing initiate action alter patient Tourette Syndrome Chronic Tic Disorder . Although many definition disease include characterization tic 'involuntary ' , patient claim movement voluntarily make , unable decide voluntary involuntary . Recent study show time order someone will voluntary movement begin movement central subjective sense causality . We propose examine tic well normal , voluntary movement patient Tourette Syndrome Chronic Tic Disorder identify time course decision move onset movement . Using Libet 's paradigm , intend subject watch fast-rotating clock report time associate willing ( time W ) initiating ( time M ) movement ; also determine electroencephalographic/electromyographic ( EEG/EMG ) measure movement . STUDY POPULATION : We intend study adult patient Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders diagnosis tic disorder frequent tic well normal , healthy volunteer control . DESIGN : We ask tic patient rate `` voluntariness '' tic use rating scale . We ask tic patient look fast-rotating clock computer screen note movement will ( time W ) initiate ( time M ) , tics well normal voluntary movement . Patients also report time somatosensory stimulus . Surface EMG determine time actual movement , EEG record brain potential associate movement . The design normal volunteer exception volunteer complete rating scale experience tic . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure study latency time W M ( EMG onset ) tic patient correlate voluntariness patient associate tic , compare time W M report normal voluntary movement normal volunteer .</detailed_description>
