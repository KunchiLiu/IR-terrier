	<brief_summary>This Phase II single arm study novel T cell immunotherapy patient indolent non-Hodgkin ’ lymphoma ( NHL ) . Eligible patient relapse refractory disease receive least one four prior regimen . Patients receive Xcellerated T CellsTM , ex vivo activate expand autologous T cell product , attempt enhance immune response anti-tumor activity . The primary endpoint study evaluate efficacy Xcellerated T Cells patient indolent NHL . Secondary endpoint evaluate safety therapy patient population , evaluate change number phenotype T- B-lymphocytes , well change T cell receptor repertoire , hemoglobin level , platelet count quantitative immunoglobulin level . In subset patient , fine-needle aspirate malignant lymph node perform assess change lymphocyte composition phenotype . Bone marrow aspirate similarly evaluate . Finally , anti-tumor immune response evaluate patient amenable biopsy enlarge lymph node .</brief_summary>

Other subtypes require approval Medical Monitor . At least 16 patient small lymphocytic lymphoma , eight patient mantle cell lymphoma enrol . Stage III IV disease time past Relapsed refractory disease follow recent treatment . Patients consider refractory disease last treatment course result complete partial response , time disease progression six month less . Patients consider relapsed disease time disease progression six month . Patients achieve partial complete response follow recent therapy must demonstrate progressive disease . Patients must receive least one prior course systemic therapy NHL four prior course therapy . Repeat course therapeutic regimen separate time six month consider separate treatment course , exception singleagent rituximab . Patients four prior course therapy may enrol discretion Medical Monitor discussion Investigator . Radiographically bidimensionally measurable disease .
