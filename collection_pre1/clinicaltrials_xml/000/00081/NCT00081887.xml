	<brief_title>Study Weekly Clofarabine Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofarabine new chemotherapy drug design interfere growth development cancer cell . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical examination . You also ask medication take currently level daily activity . Routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) do within 14 day start study make sure increase risk develop side effect . You may bone marrow sample collect . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . If find eligible , receive clofarabine 1-hour infusion vein every 2 week 4 week . This cycle make one treatment course . The drug evaluate different dose level . The first three patient start low dose . Unless serious side effect occur , next group patient ( usually group 3 patient , although expand include patient need ) receive high dose . If show response experience severe side effect , receive total 6 course therapy . During course , clofarabine give way first course . However , dose clofarabine may lower late course decrease risk side effect may occur previous course . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Before every treatment course , doctor perform physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . You ask level daily activity feel . At least every two week ( often doctor feel necessary ) , blood sample ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine lab test . Repeat bone marrow collect third sixth course . However , complete study third course , bone marrow may take . No bone marrow may take condition disease obvious blood . You need stay Houston first 4 week treatment . After , may return home still return Houston receive clofarabine treatment . You may choose check-up visit blood test local doctor . After finish treatment , long participate study , schedule every 3-6 month check status disease overall health . This investigational study . Clofarabine authorize FDA use research . Up 36 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
