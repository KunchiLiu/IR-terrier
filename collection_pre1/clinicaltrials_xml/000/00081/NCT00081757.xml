	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis normal , physiological process grow embryo , wound heal ovulation . Progressive recruitment blood vessel tumor site think result self perpetuate loop help drive growth tumor . This new vasculature also allow competent tumor cell find access vascular system facilitate distant spread tumor cell . Neovascularization apparently absolute prerequisite physical expansion solid tumor grow beyond volume 1-2 mm diameter . Several molecular cellular mechanism identify tumor parenchyma may exert angiogenic effect host endothelial cell . There also evidence endothelial cell , like stromal cell , may act reciprocally alter behavior adjacent tumor cell paracrine cell contact mediate fashion . There known diverse family angiogenic growth factor , foremost among basic FGF VEGF . Several angiogenic peptide gene sequence clone . The degree vascularization acquire importance independent prognostic indicator various type solid tumor . More recently , note increase angiogenesis may also important feature hematologic malignancy , e.g . leukemia .</detailed_description>
