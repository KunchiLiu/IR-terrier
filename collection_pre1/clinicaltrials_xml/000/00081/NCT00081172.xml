	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Androgen-Independent Adenocarcinoma ( Cancer ) Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate patient progressive metastatic androgen-independent adenocarcinoma prostate treat lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal antibody J591 . - Determine measurable disease response rate patient treat drug . Secondary - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine duration biochemical PSA and/or measurable disease response patient treated drug . - Determine incidence human anti-J591 antibody ( HAHA ) response patient treated drug . - Correlate hematological toxicity drug bone marrow involvement ( bone scan index ) patient . - Determine survival rate patient treat drug . - Determine targeting drug know tumor sit patient . - Determine tumor-absorbed radiation dose patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive single dose lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal antibody J591 IV day 1 . Patients undergo radionuclide scan day 6-8 confirm tumor target study drug . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-32 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
