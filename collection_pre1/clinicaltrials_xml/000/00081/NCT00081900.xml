	<brief_summary>Approximately 18-45 patient Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) treat DENSPM approximately 5 center United States . First , try determine high dose give safely well tolerate ( call maximally tolerate dose , MTD , short ) . Once establish , enroll additional patient learn potential side effect see whether DENSPM slow growth HCC tumor . We also want learn safety DENSPM . Many medication use treat cancer cause side effect ( discomfort illness ) . In study , want understand side effect occur patient HCC treat DENSPM.Study terminate initial assessment insufficient data support clinical benefit population .</brief_summary>
