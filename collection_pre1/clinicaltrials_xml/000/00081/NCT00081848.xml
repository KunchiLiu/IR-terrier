	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effect vaccine treatment plus radiation liver patient solid tumor spread liver . The vaccine treatment consist three part : 1 ) `` prim vaccine '' call rV-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM , make vaccinia virus ; 2 ) `` boost vaccine '' call rF-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM ) , make fowlpox virus ; 3 ) fowlpox virus inject DNA GM-CSF , chemical boost immune system , call rF-GM-CSF . Human DNA insert prim boost vaccine virus cause production protein enhance immune activity also produce carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) - protein normally produce patient 's tumor cell . The study also use radiation , laboratory animal study show low dos radiation tumor produce CEA make tumor sensitive effect vaccine . Patients 18 year age old solid tumor spread liver may eligible study . Candidates must least one course chemotherapy metastatic disease tumor must produce CEA . Candidates screen medical history physical examination ; blood urine test , test pathology slide surgery determine presence CEA marker , image study assess extent tumor , electrocardiogram ( cardiologic evaluation , clinically indicate ) . Participants receive prim vaccination study day 1 . After 3 week every 2 week 2 month ( study day 21 , 35 , 49 63 ) , receive boost vaccine . All vaccine inject skin . With every vaccination also receive injection rF-GM-CSF increase number immune cell vaccination site . The day first four boosting vaccination , patient undergo 4 consecutive day radiation tumor liver ( study day 22-25 , 36-39 , 50-53 64-67 ) . Patients may continue treatment monthly booster vaccination ( without radiation therapy ) long cancer get bad develop serious treatment side effect . Patients monitor safety treatment response follow test procedure : - Blood urine test clinic visit every 2 4 week monitor liver , kidney , organ function . - Imaging study assess tumor around study day 91 every 2 month study . - Apheresis ( procedure collect immune cell call lymphocyte ) - Apheresis do first vaccination study day 1 around study day 91 . For procedure , blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component spin , lymphocytes extract . The rest blood return patient needle . The collected lymphocyte study measure immune response treatment . - Liver biopsy ( optional ) - This test do start radiation treatment around 3 7 day complete first dose radiation . The biopsy provide information type cancer , level CEA produce tumor , immune status tumor . For procedure , skin liver numb anesthetic , needle place liver tumor , small sample tumor withdrawn needle . After treatment complete , patient monitor 15 year , include yearly medical history physical examination 5 year follow last vaccination . Information beyond 5 year collect year telephone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Radiation Liver Metastasis Patients With CEA-Positive Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - A phase I clinical trial vaccine alone associate stable disease ( least 4 month ) 40 % patient 1 pathologic complete response . - Radiation therapy upregulates Fas tumor cell allow easy kill antigen specific activate T cell . Dominant negative fa transfected tumor cell demonstrate anti-tumor effect fas mediate . - Radiation show up-regulate ICAM , tumor associate antigen MHC class I human tumor cell line vitro . - TRICOM vaccine act synergistically radiation tumor treatment model . - Radiation therapy dose propose appear favorable safety profile . - Clinical trial use PSA vaccine show local radiation tumor inhibit vaccine efficacy . Objectives : - 1 : Safety combination CEA base vaccine radiation - 2 : clinical response - 2 : Immunohistochemistry - ( FAS , MHC , p53 CEA tumor radiation therapy ) - 2 : Immunological response ( ELISPOT assay ) . Eligibility : - Solid Tumors express CEA positive cancer radiographically visible metastatic liver lesion . - Completed least one chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . - Life expectancy great equal 6 month - Adequate organ function - ECOG 0-1 - No autoimmunity - No serum positivity HIV , Hepatitis B C viruses Design : - Single cohort pilot study vaccine radiation therapy liver lesion 10 evaluable patient . All vaccine radiation give NIH Clinical Center . - Vaccine : rV-CEA ( 6D ) /TRICOM , ( 1.2 x 10 ( 8 ) ) PFU subcutaneously ( s.c. ) day 1 rF-CEA ( 6D ) /TRICOM , ( 4 x 10 ( 8 ) ) PFU s.c. , day 21 , 35 , 49 , 63 All vaccination give rF-GM-CSF , 1 x 10 ( 7 ) pfu s.c. -Radiation : 2 Gy/d 4 day dose rF-CEA ( 6D ) /TRICOM day 22-25 , 36-39 , 50-53 , 64-67 ( total plan radiation dose per patient 32 Gy ) .</detailed_description>
