	<brief_summary>This study evaluate patient eye complication related vaccination smallpox learn condition . Vaccinia vaccination use 100 year prevent smallpox . A small number people receive vaccination ( less 1 1,000 ) develop complication , sometimes eyes . This usually result accidental transfer infection vaccination site face eye , perhaps touch vaccination area face eyelid wash hand . The study also examine whether experimental treatment call NP-016 vaccinia immune globulin reduce corneal scar sometimes associate serious vaccinia complication impair vision . Children adult keratitis , severe conjunctivitis , blepharitis follow exposure vaccinia vaccination may eligible study . Children must weigh least 10 kg . Participants undergo follow test procedure enrollment , test repeat schedule study visit : 1 . Medical history physical examination 2 . Infectious disease consultation 3 . Complete eye evaluation include : - Fundus photography examine back eye - dilation pupil eye drop examine photograph back eye - Slit lamp biomicroscopy - evaluation front part eye slit lamp microscope - Eye pressure measurement - Eye swab look vaccinia virus cause disease 4 . Blood test 5 . Photographs documentation eye skin lesion 6 . Vaccinia diagnostic test , skin mucosa scraping ; blood , throat , urine culture ; tissue biopsy , need Patients begin treatment standard medication eye disease , trifluridine ( ViropticÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) anti-viral eye drop . Patients whose condition become serious offer additional treatment intravenous ( vein ) infusion either VIG placebo ( salt water solution active drug ) randomly assign one treatment group . All patient continue standard-of-care treatment well . Follow-up visit NIH eye clinic schedule require patient 's condition . Patients mild complication take standard medication may need see 1 month initial visit 6 month 12 month later . Patients serious condition qualify VIG placebo treatment may see daily week , week rest first month , 6 month 12 month , unless frequent treatment observation require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vaccinia virus ( live relatively weak relative smallpox cowpox ) use vaccinate people development smallpox ( variola ) result infection viral genus Orthopoxvirus . Although , smallpox thought eradicate worldwide 1970 's , smallpox culture retain laboratory several country may pose potential threat use biological weapon . This recently lead program mass-inoculations vaccinia initiate throughout U.S. Vaccination smallpox use vaccinia result complication . Reactions rarely serious life threatening , one common serious complication occur around eye . This occur person transfer vaccinia virus touch primary inoculation site eye ( auto-inoculation ) . Accidental exposure also occur laboratory contact vaccinate person . Ocular involvement may confine lid conjunctiva may easily transfer cornea . Keratitis result scarring could severe permanent impact vision . Even cornea affect , extensive lesion lid ocular tissue lead additional sight-threatening complication . Recently , US Food Drug Administration licence Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) ( VIGIV , formerly know NP-016 ) . It indicate `` treatment and/or modification follow condition , complication result smallpox vaccination : ( ) Eczema vaccinatum ; ( b ) Progressive vaccinia ; ( c ) Severe generalize vaccinia ; ( ) Vaccinia infection individual skin condition burn , impetigo , varicella-zoster , poison ivy ; individual eczematous skin lesion either activity extensiveness lesion ; ( e ) Aberrant infection induce vaccinia virus include accidental implantation eye ( except case isolated keratitis ) , mouth , area vaccinia infection would constitute special hazard . '' The precautionary statement regard isolate vaccinia keratitis appear though uncertain whether VIGIV use decrease increase corneal scar human . The implication increase scarringis base evidence animal model indicate extensive corneal cloud occur follow VIG therapy . To investigate implication clinical significance , two hundred study participant corneal involvement follow vaccinia vaccination exposure randomize receive either placebo VIGIV . All enrol participant provide standard-of-care antiviral treatment ocular complication . One-year proportion corneal scar compare two group . Further knowledge biologic mechanisms complication associate vaccinia vaccination rapid diagnostic test may lead effective form therapy .</detailed_description>
