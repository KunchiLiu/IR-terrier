	<brief_title>Creatine Treating Patients With Cancer-Associated Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare weight-gain effect creatine vs placebo patient cancer-associated weight loss and/or anorexia . - Determine effect regimens quality life patient . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . - Compare survival rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord primary cancer type ( lung vs gastrointestinal v ) , weight loss severity ( &lt; 10 lbs v ≥10 lb ) , age ( &lt; 50 year vs ≥ 50 year ) , plan concurrent chemotherapy ( yes v ) , gender , prognosis . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral creatine daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity long treatment consider beneficial . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 300 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
