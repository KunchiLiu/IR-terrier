	<brief_summary>This study try identify understand genetic factor lead inner ear malformation call `` enlarge vestibular aqueduct '' , associate hearing loss . Patients sensorineural hearing loss without inner ear malformation parent sibling may eligible study . Participants immediate family member , may undergo follow test procedure : - Medical family history , include question hearing , balance ear-related issue , review medical record . - Routine physical examination . - Blood draw buccal swab ( brush inside cheek collect cell ) - Tissue collect DNA analysis look change gene may relate hearing loss . - Hearing test - The subject listen tone emit small earphone . - Balance test ( VEMP ) see balance function inner ear associate hearing loss Electrodes place behind ear base neck . From recline position , ask raise head click sound played ear . - Ultrasound test - An inner ear malformation call EVA ( enlargement vestibular aqueduct ) indicate genetic disorder call Pendred syndrome may cause . Because thyroid abnormality also associate Pendred syndrome , ultrasound examination thyroid gland may do . - Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan - These test show structure inner ear . For CT , subject lie still short time X-ray image obtain . For MRI , patient lie stretcher moved cylindrical machine strong magnetic field . The magnetic field radio wave produce image inner ear . The radio wave cause loud thumping noise muffle use earplug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Genetic Analysis Enlarged Vestibular Aqueducts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment genetically heterogeneous disorder cause mutation one least 60 different gene . Enlargement vestibular aqueduct ( EVA ) radiologic find know associated mutation one gene , Pendred syndrome gene ( SLC26A4 , formerly know PDS ) . EVA may thus serve clinically useful marker facilitate diagnosis hear impairment . Recent data laboratory others indicate subset individual EVA SLC26A4 mutation , therefore EVA case likely cause gene , nongenetic factor , combination etiology . Families two individual hear impairment EVA enrol study order identify genetic factor cause EVA . Siblings parent may also enrol order define inheritance perform molecular genetic analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must family member participant know nonsyndromic SNHL associate inner ear malformation There must least two participate affect family member . Adults must able provide inform consent Minors must parent guardian able provide consent Age 099 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects know exposure physical chemical teratogen utero could account inner ear malformation thalidomide radiation Any hearing loss associate syndrome , , branchiootorenal ( BOR ) syndrome , comprise system malformation branchial cleft abnormality cause heterozygous mutation EYA1 gene . Previous genetic test identify two pathogenic mutant allele SLC26A4 .</criteria>
