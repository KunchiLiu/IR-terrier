	<brief_summary>This study examine whether transplanted stem cell turn salivary gland cell stem cell recipient . If , stem cell might use restore salivary gland function patient Sjogren 's syndrome cause dry mouth . People severe dry mouth may develop difficulty swallowing , severe tooth decay , infection mouth pharynx , mouth sore . Female patient 18 year age old enrol National Heart , Lung Blood Institute 's protocol 97-H-009 97-H-0202 received stem cell transplant male donor may eligible study . Five patient graft-versus host disease ( GVHD ) five without GVHD include . GVHD transplantation reaction donor 's cell mount immune response recipient 's tissue . Patients chronic GVHD mouth ulceration dry mouth similar patient Sjogren 's syndrome . Five healthy female volunteer also enrol . Participants medical dental history . Then , cell collect inside cheek ( buccal cell scrap ) salivary gland ( labial gland biopsy ) describe : Buccal cell scrap - Cells collect inside cheek wipe 5 second plastic brush . Labial gland biopsy - The low lip numb small incision make inside low lip . Six small salivary gland lower lip remove incision close four stitch . Cells collect procedure examine see donated stem cell turn salivary gland cheek cell . Patients return clinic 5 10 day biopsy stitch remove assess healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Sjogren 's syndrome ( 1-2 million U.S. ) , patient expose ionize radiation therapy head neck cancer ( ~40,000 new patients/year U.S. ) , experience severe salivary gland hypofunction . In patient group , via different pathogenic mechanism , acinar cell glands lose . These cell sole site fluid production salivary gland , patient produce adequate level saliva , lead considerable morbidity ( xerostomia , dysphagia , dental caries , oro-pharyngeal infection , mucositis ) . In many patient , parenchymal tissue may lose . For latter group , available therapy candidate either pharmacological gene therapy little epithelial tissue remain . Recent report suggest organ-specific stem cell differentiate cell organ . These finding carry significant implication possible clinical use . This protocol investigate adult human hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transdifferentiate salivary gland oral mucosal epithelial cell . We recruit female bone marrow transplant recipient ( exist NHLBI protocol ) receive HSC male donor . This gender-mismatched strategy allow u detect cell donor origin use RNA probe specific human Y chromosome . A biopsy labial minor salivary gland cheek scrap obtain female transplant patient . The biopsy cause minimal discomfort cheek scrap non-invasive technique . Both procedure use routinely clinical diagnosis . The sample co-stained specific genetic protein marker salivary gland oral mucosal epithelial cell , respectively . Cells positive marker ( Y chromosome , cytokeratins , mucin 1 , NKCC1 ) would indicate donor 's HSC become functionally competent salivary gland epithelial cell . This protocol also examine bone marrow transplant recipient chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) . These patient show similar complication ( xerostomia oral mucositis ) encounter patient Sjogren 's Syndrome . We hypothesize GVHD may provide positive recruitment signal HSC home salivary oral mucosal site . This protocol recruit 5 female bone marrow transplant recipient without GVHD 5 GVHD . The primary potential benefit study HSC turn salivary gland cell , could use regenerate lose salivary gland tissue seed artificial salivary gland patient irreversible salivary gland damage .</detailed_description>
