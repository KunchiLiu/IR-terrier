	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity flavopiridol patient recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 10-24 month .</detailed_description>
