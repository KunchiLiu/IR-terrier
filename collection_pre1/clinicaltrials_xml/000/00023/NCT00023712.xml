	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity bortezomib patient persistent recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV twice weekly 2 week . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
