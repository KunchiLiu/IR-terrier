	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development cancer . The use celecoxib may effective way prevent development basal cell carcinoma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial determine effectiveness celecoxib prevent basal cell carcinoma patient basal cell nevus syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Preventing Basal Cell Carcinoma Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether celecoxib prevents development basal cell carcinoma patient basal cell nevus syndrome . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily . Treatment continue 2 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
