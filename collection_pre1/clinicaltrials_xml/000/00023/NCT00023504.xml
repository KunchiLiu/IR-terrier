	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immune function people know suspected immune disorder . It determine participant immune response vaccine measure blood antibody level vaccination . Patients enrol NIH protocol involve immune reconstitution ( bone marrow transplantation gene therapy ) know suspected primary immune disorder may eligible study . Participants may ask one vaccine , base age , use IVIG , past immunization history underlie immune problem . The possible vaccination include : Rabies vaccine Diphtheria tetanus booster 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine The diphtheria , tetanus , pneumococcus rabies vaccine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use routinely protect disease . Study participant blood sample drawn vaccination . The number additional sample collect vary accord vaccine administer ; 1 rabies ; 1 tetanus ; 1 2 pneumococcal vaccine . Each sample 5 teaspoonful . Participation study may last year , depend blood sample schedule</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate immune response vaccine subject ( child adult ) know suspected primary immune disorder . We intend characterize immune responsiveness standard , well characterize antigen ( vaccine ) subject primary immune disorder , and/or subject receive treatment correct primary immune disorder . This open label , prospective study investigate functional status adaptive immune system . Up 50 subject may enrol . It anticipate subject refer investigator NIH study inherited disorder immune system protocol . After give standard vaccine , test specific antibody . The vaccine include license universally mandate diphtheria tetanus toxoid , two license pneumococcal vaccine formulation recommend protection child pneumonia , rabies vaccine license 1997 ( formerly available reaction-prone formulation ) . We obtain peripheral blood sample subject vaccination specific time interval vaccination . Measurement specific antibody titer conduct immunology laboratory Department Laboratory Medicin NIH . Subjects may offer one vaccine base available information exposure history immune status , vaccine may offer sequentially combination shorten study time . While vaccine use often medically indicate give outside research protocol provide protection ass immune response , investigator elect use protocol follow reason : - Enhancement subject understanding use vaccine vivo assessment immune response . - Emphasis importance obtain pre- post-immunization blood sample monitor well body 's immune system work . - Administration rabies vaccine subject would ordinarily need . - Recognition vaccine side effect widely publicize may concern potential enrollee .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals evaluate NIH investigator know suspected primary immune disorder . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) least 21 day prior receipt vaccine duration study participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Documented HIV infection . Active malignancy . Immunosuppressive therapy , steroid . Symptomatic cardiac disease ongoing treatment . Pregnant lactate woman ( due restriction use vaccine ) . Surgery two week prior entry . Serious , ongoing , uncontrolled infection . Platelet count le 40,000/microL coagulation disorder . Any major illness , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate patient 's participation study . History previous systemic reaction particular vaccine product consider administration . For RabAvert , person know sensitive : Processed bovine gelatin Chicken protein Neomycin Chlortetrycyline Amphotericin B For Prevnar , person know possible latex sensitivity .</criteria>
