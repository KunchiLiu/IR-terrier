	<brief_title>Comparison Surgical Medical Treatment Congestive Heart Failure Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congestive heart failure afflict approximately five million Americans leading cause hospitalization Americans age 65 . Most case congestive heart failure due CAD . Surprisingly little know relative benefit medical versus surgical therapy patient obstructive coronary disease congestive heart failure . Randomized study medical therapy versus bypass surgery obstructive coronary disease conduct 1970s include systematic use aspirin , arterial conduit , lipid-lowering medication . In addition , patient ejection fraction 35 % specifically exclude three large randomize study medical therapy versus bypass surgery . While observational data 1970s early 1980s suggest survival advantage associate bypass surgery patient low ejection fraction congestive heart failure , bias favor referral fit patient bypass surgery may confound comparison . In addition , medical therapy congestive heart failure improve dramatically past two decade . Thus , choice medical therapy versus bypass surgery patient congestive heart failure obstructive coronary disease usually decide guesswork . This study design provide solid answer . PURPOSE : STICH multicenter , international , randomized trial address two specific primary hypothesis patient clinical heart failure ( HF ) leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction coronary artery disease amenable surgical revascularization . The first hypothesis restoration blood flow mean coronary revascularization recovers chronic LV dysfunction improve survival , compare intensive medical therapy alone . The second hypothesis surgical ventricular restoration ( SVR ) normal LV size improves survival free subsequent hospitalization cardiac cause compare CABG alone . Patients eligible either medical therapy CABG , eligible SVR procedure ( Stratum A ) , randomize equal proportion medical therapy alone versus CABG plus medical therapy . Patients eligible three therapy ( Stratum B ) randomize equal proportion medical therapy alone , CABG plus medical therapy , CABG plus SVR plus medical therapy . Patients whose severity angina CAD make inappropriate medical therapy alone ( Stratum C ) randomize equal proportion CABG plus medical therapy versus CABG plus SVR plus medical therapy . The overall target recruit 1200 patient Hypothesis One 1,000 patient Hypothesis Two . Secondary endpoint include role myocardial viability , morbidity , economics , quality life . Core laboratories quality life/economics , cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) , echocardiography ( ECHO ) , neurohormonal/cytokine/genetic ( NCG ) , radionuclide ( RN ) study ensure consistent test practice standardization data necessary identify eligible patient address specific question relate stated hypothesis . IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH : The common cause HF long hypertension valvular heart disease previous decade , rather CAD . HF common worldwide disease CAD frequent cause HF initiation progression . HF responsible approximately 1 million hospitalization 300,000 fatality annually . The prevalence HF increasing , largely due enhance survival follow acute myocardial infarction manifestation CAD . No randomize trial ever compare directly long-term benefit surgical , medical , combined surgical medical treatment patient ischemic HF . The STICH trial first trial compare long term benefit surgical medical treatment patient ischemic HF . Although modern medical therapy HF modestly improve quality life , aggressive approach surgical therapy study STICH trial may produce even great improvement . The common clinical practice offer CABG patient LV dysfunction region find nonviable noninvasive study evidence-based . Since patient intensive medical therapy reasonable therapeutic alternative exclude study , result STICH trial applicable patient CAD , HF , systolic LV dysfunction . The result STICH trial also establish whether measurement neurohormonal cytokine level genetic profile useful direct patient management decision , monitor effectiveness therapy , refine optimal approach select treatment strategy likely effective many patient . ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OTHER ISSUES : The study currently extend follow-up mode patient enrol Hypothesis 1 ( H01 ) . The last patient follow-up anticipated late fall 2015 . Patient recruitment Hypothesis 2 ( H02 ) complete January 2006 , 1,000 patient enrol worldwide . All recruitment end May 4 , 2007 , total 2,212 patient enrol , 1,212 patient enrol Hypothesis One ( H01 ) . To date , study already recruit patient ( 815 ) number patient enrol landmark clinical trial bypass surgery know Coronary Artery Surgery Study ( CASS ) . The CASS trial , conduct almost 30 year ago , large trial bypass surgery current STICH trial .</detailed_description>
