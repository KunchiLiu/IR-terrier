	<brief_title>Three Months Weekly Rifapentine Isoniazid M. Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PRIMARY objective open-label Phase III clinical trial compare effectiveness three-month ( 12-dose ) regimen weekly rifapentine isoniazid ( 3RPT/INH ) effectiveness nine-month ( 270-dose ) regimen daily isoniazid ( 9INH ) prevent tuberculosis ( TB ) among high-risk tuberculin skin-test reactor , include child HIV-infected person , require treatment latent TB infection ( LTBI ) . The 3RPT/INH regimen give direct observation 9INH regimen self-administered . SECONDARY Objectives : - Compare rate drug discontinuation due adverse drug reaction associate 3RPT/INH 9INH . - Compare rate drug discontinuation reason associate 3RPT/INH 9INH . - Compare rate grade 3 , 4 , 5 drug toxicity associate 3RPT/INH 9INH . - Compare treatment completion rate 3RPT/INH 9INH . Compare efficacy ( i.e. , among person complete study-phase therapy ) 3RPT/INH 9INH . - Compare effectiveness tolerability 3RPT/INH 9INH HIV-infected person . - Compare effectiveness tolerability 3RPT/INH 9INH child &lt; 18 year old . - Compare rate methadone withdrawal associate 3RPT/INH 9INH among person concomitantly receive methadone . - Describe pattern antibiotic resistance among M. tuberculosis isolate patient develop TB despite treatment latent infection . Amendment study protocol allow extension enrollment child &lt; 12 year old HIV-infected person : For assessment primary outcome , development TB , sample size approximately 4,000 person per arm require . To assess tolerability ( one secondary outcome ) sub-groups , child le 12 year old HIV-infected person , sample size 644 per stratum require . A sample size 8,053 patient primary outcome reach February 15 , 2008 ( expect follow-up completion time 2010 ) , leave approximately 454 additional young child 200 HIV-infected person enrol achieve target 644 group . The additional data tolerability sub-groups available analysis 2013 .</detailed_description>
