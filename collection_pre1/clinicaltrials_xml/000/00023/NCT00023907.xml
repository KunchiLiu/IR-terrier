	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness paclitaxel treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity paclitaxel patient recurrent persistent platinum- paclitaxel-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 19-51 patient accrue study within 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
