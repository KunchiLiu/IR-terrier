	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chagas ' disease lead cause heart disease throughout Latin America , affect 16 18 million individual . The disease , name Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas first describe 1909 , exist American Continents . It cause flagellate protozoan parasite , Trypanosoma cruzi , transmit human blood-sucking triatomine insect know popularly different country `` vinchuca '' , `` barbeiro '' , `` chipo '' etc . The geographical distribution human T.cruzi infection extend Mexico south Argentina . In Brazil alone , approximately 10 percent population seropositive T. cruzi . Given large pool primary host zoonotic disease , complete eradication Chagas ' disease control arthropod vector unlikely . Research humans animal model indicate variation susceptibility infection , disease outcome , variation may due genetic factor . Thus , form heart disease represent complex phenotype potential genetic determinant susceptibility infection differential disease pathogenesis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The genetic epidemiology project study estimate 1,125 Black individual age 18 year old small community Posse , Brazil study population may draw four five large pedigree vary blood relationship . Preliminary pilot data appear promise regard primary hypothesis specific genetic factor influence susceptibility complex zoonotic disease . The investigation divide three part involve phenotypic characterization , statistical genetic analysis determine relative proportion phenotypic variance due additive genetic effect , localization gene influence development Chagas ' disease . The phenotypic characterization involve clinical history , infection status , immunologic study , cardiac status . The chronic phase T. cruzi infection result Chagas ' disease manifest cardiomyopathy heart block , conduction disturbance , ventricular tachyarrhythmia , heart failure , sudden arrhythmic death . The cardiac phenotyping involve electrocardiographic time interval ( PR interval , QRS duration , QT interval duration ) well abnormal pattern ( leave anterior fascicular block , leave ventricular hypertrophy , right bundle branch block ) , possibly measure heart failure term New York Heart Association functional classification . Right bundle branch block probably frequent early manifestation chronic cardiac involvement . The genetic linkage study attempt localize gene influence susceptibility T. cruzi infection , ECG parameter ( e.g. , right bundle branch block ) , immunologic factor use marker place approximately every 10 centimorgans ( cM ) throughout genome . About 375 individual sample per year . Each subject donate two 10 ml sample blood use immunoassay seropositivity T. cruzi , genotyping 382 polymorphic short tandem repeat . During initial visit , population subject also interview gather information demographic , pedigree , socioeconomic makeup . Additionally , question pregnancy status , household ecology ( year house , room share , pet , rodent , food storage , triatomid bug history , etc ) residence history determine survey . In fourth year , investigator return collection site administer ECGs 375 individual per year . The blood collect Brazil send San Antonio high-throughput genotyping use 382 polymorphic short tandem repeat ( STRs ) spread throughout genome . A population specific 10cM map expect useful linkage analysis .</detailed_description>
