	<brief_summary>The purpose study look 2 different anti-HIV drug treatment affect liver . The use anti-HIV drug like nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) may link liver problem like fatty change , scarring , abnormal liver function test ( LFTs ) , lactic acidemia ( increase lactic acid blood ) . Increased liver enzymes may mean liver damage . The way liver change people abnormal LFTs lactic acidemia completely understood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study provide unique opportunity prospectively assess relationship lactic acidemia liver dysfunction determine whether lactic acidemia liver dysfunction likely secondary NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity . If lactic acidemia hepatic fatty infiltration ( steatosis ) study population secondary NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity , withdrawal NRTI medication expect result partial improvement resolution finding . Furthermore , study examine possible additive ill effect NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity liver function individual coinfected hepatitis C. This study design stand-alone ACTG protocol provide NRTI-sparing regimen study coenrollable simultaneously A5116 . Patients enrol A5133 stand-alone study : Patients NRTI-containing regimen elevate lactate ALTs enrol single open-label NRTI-sparing treatment regimen efavirenz ( EFV ) plus lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , provide study . These patient follow virologic failure/toxicity management guideline detail protocol . Patients coenrolling A5116 : Patients study assigned A5116 antiretroviral regimen medication provide A5116 . Those randomized A5116 NRTI-sparing regimen EFV LPV/r identical offer A5133 assess together patient enter A5133 stand-alone study . Individuals assign A5116 continue NRTI arm 2NRTIs plus EFV enrol separate observational arm A5133 . The impact continue NRTI therapy liver histology assess observational arm . Virologic failure/toxicity management accordance A5116 protocol . The definition virologic failure A5116 identical definition use A5133 . Arm 1 consist patient assign NRTI-sparing regimen without evidence HCV coinfection . Arm 2 consist patient assign NRTI-sparing regimen evidence HCV coinfection . Arm 3 consist patient coenrolled NRTI-containing arm A5116 without evidence HCV coinfection . All patient evaluate safety virologic immunologic response . In addition , individual undergo liver biopsy upper abdominal CT scan within 30 day prior entry within 30 day prior week 24 . The biopsied tissue review evidence fatty infiltration , inflammation , fibrosis . The CT scan assess degree fatty infiltration . If sufficient liver tissue available , biopsied tissue assess parameter . Plasma , PBMCs , serum collect explore role oxidative stress parameter development hepatic fatty infiltration ( steatosis ) hyperlactatemia . The effect change liver fatty infiltration plasma lactate lipoprotein explore . Finally , PBMC mtDNA content correlate liver mtDNA content .</detailed_description>
