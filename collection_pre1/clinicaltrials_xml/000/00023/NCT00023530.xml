	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Several new development field allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation substantially decrease transplant-related morbidity promise make major improvement safety efficacy transplantation , allow transplantation extend patient . Use match unrelated marrow donor , unrelated cord blood unit , partially match family donor greatly expand option patient lack HLA identical sibling donor . Use stem cell mobilize collected peripheral blood rather harvest bone marrow speed engraftment may improve treatment outcome . Manipulation transplant adjust dose stem cell lymphocytes optimum number ( graft engineering ) may also beneficial . The use non-myeloablative transplant ( mini-transplants ) promise extend safe application stem cell allograft individual 60 year patient non-lethal hematologic disease . Recently identify human minor histocompatibility antigen may provide another variable predict severity graft-versus-host disease . There urgent need evaluate promising new therapeutic approach hematopoietic stem cell transplantation disseminate finding health care professional , patient public . Each year , thousand patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant United States , yet patient offer option enroll research protocol study improve outcome life-saving toxic expensive procedure . There several reason blood marrow transplant clinical research network would accelerate clinical research evaluate new approach transplantation . The heterogeneity hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Multi-center trial reduce number patient need clinical center allow accrual complete rapidly . Further , common treatment protocol reduce variable contribute patient outcome allow valid comparison treatment . Finally , Network approach increase number comparative trial conduct provide framework rapid initiation important study , focus randomized study , efficient use pool clinical expertise data management resource . The Request Applications release January , 2001 . Awards make September , 2001 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Protocols development . Three approve currently accrue patient follow . The Trial Fluconazole versus Voriconazole Prevention Invasive Fungal Infections Allogeneic Blood Marrow Transplant Recipients ( BMT CTN Protocol 0101 ) . The trial Phase III , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , multicenter comparative study fluconazole versus voriconazole . Recipients stratify center donor type ( sibling vs. unrelated ) randomize either fluconazole voriconazole arm 1:1 ratio . The primary objective compare fungal free survival rate study arm day 180 . Secondary objective compare frequency invasive fungal infection , time invasive fungal infection , survival rate , duration amphotericin B therapy possible invasive fungal infection , time neutrophil platelet engraftment , time severity acute chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , utility galactomannan assay detection aspergillis . There estimate 600 subject leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome receive myeloablative , 6/6 HLA-matched allogeneic blood marrow transplant , two year age old , adequate physical function . Subjects receive study drug day 0 continue day 100 post-transplant invasive infection occur , subject develop toxicity attributable study drug . For recipient type graft receive least 1.0 mg/kg/day prednisone day 100 recipient T-cell deplete graft whose CD4+ count &lt; 200 uL day 100 , study drug continue day 180 . Follow-up continue least one year post-transplant . A Trial Tandem Autologous Stem Cell Transplants +/- Post Second Autologous Transplant Maintenance Therapy Versus Single Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Followed Matched Sibling Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Patients Multiple Myeloma ( BMT CTN Protocol 0102 ) . The study phase III , multicenter trial tandem autologous transplant versus strategy autologous follow HLA-matched sibling non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant . Study subject biologically assign appropriate arm depend availability HLA-matched sibling . There nested randomize phase III trial observation versus maintenance therapy follow second autologous transplant patient tandem autologous transplant arm . The primary objective post-tandem autologous transplant randomize trial maintenance versus observation compare progression-free survival three year two arm . The secondary objective post-tandem autologous trial compare 'current ' myeloma-stable survival , three-year overall survival , incidence progression . The primary objective tandem autologous transplant versus autologous transplant follow HLA-matched sibling non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant compare progression-free survival three year two arm . The secondary objective tandem trial compare 'current ' myeloma-stable survival , three year overall survival , incidence progression . Mobilization therapy specify study . All patient undergo first autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSC ) high-dose melphalan give day 2 . Melphalan give 2 8 week initiation mobilization therapy . Patients adequate recovery receive either second autologous PBSC transplant non-myeloablative PBSC allogeneic transplant HLA-matched sibling . This post-transplant therapy initiate least 60 day ( preferably 60-120 day ) follow initial autologous transplant . Patients without HLA-matched sibling donor randomize either observation one year maintenance therapy dexamethasone thalidomide begin follow recovery second autologous PBSC transplant . This post-transplant therapy initiate least 60 day ( preferably 60-120 day ) follow second autologous transplant . A total 150 standard risk multiple myeloma patient HLA-matched sibling donor accrue . During time , expect least 350 standard risk multiple myeloma patient without sibling donor also enter trial . In addition , high-risk patient without HLA-matched sibling also enter trial period . The estimated accrual period three year . Patients follow least three year second transplant . A Phase III Randomized Multicenter Study Comparing G-CSF Mobilized Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Marrow Transplantation HLA Compatible Unrelated Donors ( BMT CTN Protocol 0201 ) . The study compare granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) versus marrow unrelated donor transplantation patient hematologic malignancy . Recipients stratify transplant center disease risk randomize either PBSC marrow arm 1:1 ratio . The primary objective compare two-year survival rate patient two study arm use intent-to-treat analysis . Patients randomize two study arm actually transplant compare follow endpoint : survival , incidence neutrophil platelet engraftment , graft failure , acute chronic graft-versus-host-disease , time immunosuppressive therapy , relapse , infection , adverse event , immune reconstitution , quality life . Donors arm study compare time return baseline functional score , toxicity score , CBC WBC differential value donation quality life . Eligible patient 66 year age , acute leukemia , myelodysplasia , chronic myeloid leukemia myeloproliferative disorder , Autologous v Non-myeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ( HCT ) Patients Relapse Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( BMT CTN Protocol 0202 ) . A minimum 360 patient diagnose low grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma accrue . This study design Phase II/III , multi-center trial , compare two transplant strategy , determine whether non-myeloablative allogeneic HCTwill improve long-term progression free survival compare autologous HCT . Recipients biologically assign appropriate arm depend availability HLA-matched sibling . The estimated accrual period three year . The primary objective compare progression-free survival three year two transplant arm . The following trial development . Initial System Treatment Acute GVHD : A Phase II Randomized Trial Evaluating Etanercept , Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) , Denileukin Diftitox ( Ontak ) Pentostatin Addition Corticosteroids ( BMT CTN Protocol 0302 ) . In trial , patient newly diagnose GVHD receive corticosteroid plus one four new agent . A control arm corticosteroid use . Each agent assess safety efficacy . The primary objective estimate cumulative incidence complete response ( CR ) day 28 therapy . Patients follow 9 month follow initiation therapy . In addition prescribe study drug plus corticosteroid , patient receive transfusion support per institutional practice , anti-infective prophylaxis cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , gram positive bacteria , pneumocystis carinii , fungal infection . Transplants HLA-Matched , CD34+ Enriched , T Cell Depleted Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Isolated CliniMACS System Treatment Patients AML Second Complete Remission ( BMT CTN Protocol 0303 ) . The single arm , multicenter phase II trial ass event-free survival six month post-transplant . Death occurrence grade II-IV acute GVHD graft failure ( primary secondary ) relapse consider event endpoint . A total 35 patient , age 18 80 , acute myelomonocytic leukemia ( AML ) second remission HLA-identical sibling donor enrol .
