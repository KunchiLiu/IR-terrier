	<brief_summary>This study provide long-term monitoring two patient receive gene therapy leukocyte adherence deficiency ( LAD ) Food Drug Administration investigational new drug study BB-IND-7949 . The IND protocol close . No patient eligible study . Patients previously enrol BB-IND-7949 ( Retrovirus-Mediated Transfer cDNA Human CD18 Peripheral Blood Repopulating cell Patients Leukocyte Adherence Deficiency ) follow least yearly indefinite period time evaluate medical status look treatment side effect . The follow-up visit NIH Clinical Center involve follow : - Interview regard health status past year - Blood draw approximately 15 milliliter 3 year , 5 ml annually thereafter study relate LAD make sure unexpected effect gene therapy occur The blood sample collect follow-up visit frozen store . If serious medical problem arises , sample may check replication competent virus . If gene therapy suspect related medical problem , investigation may include review patient 's medical record collection additional blood tissue test . If patient die , family ask permission perform autopsy , regardless cause death . Tissues take autopsy test long-term effect gene therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients leukocyte adhesion deficiency LAD deficiency leukocyte integrin CD18 leukocyte cell surface suffer severe bacterial infection . Two patient LAD enrol Phase I clinical trial conduct University Washington School Medicine 1999 determine safety potential efficacy use retroviral vector contain CD18 transduce correct CD34+ peripheral blood stem cell . This protocol aim continue long-term follow-up patient National Cancer Institute Dr. Hickstein Senior Investigator . Blood sample collect follow-up visit yearly anniversary treatment date ( either locally off-site patient ' personal physician ) archive potential test replication competent retrovirus , complete blood count . Patients also undergo history physical examination visit . Results test forward investigator report NIH FDA .</detailed_description>
