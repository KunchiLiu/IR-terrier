	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor cytostatic activity gefitinib , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal carcinoma . - Determine nature degree toxicity patient treated drug . - Determine partial complete response rate patient treated drug . - Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 22-60 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
