	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2 ( delete CH2 region ) patient colorectal cancer . II . Determine toxic effect , plasma pharmacokinetics , whole body biodistribution , conjugate stability drug patient . III . Determine ability drug localize tumor sit patient . IV . Determine immune response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive tracer dose iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2 IV day 1 therapy dose 30 minute day 8 . Cohorts 3-5 patient receive escalate dos iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 3 5 patient experience grade 3 great toxicity 0-2 5 patient experience reversible grade 4 hematologic toxicity . Patients follow weekly minimum 7 week every 6 week disease progression .</detailed_description>
