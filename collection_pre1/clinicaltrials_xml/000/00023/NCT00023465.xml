	<brief_summary>It show neutrophil ( specific type cell ) involve inflammation lung CF patient . Neutrophil level CF patient measure bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , sample cell fluid lining lung . Other study measure neutrophil level inflammation part body use PET scan . This study aim show PET scan use non-invasive marker inflammation lung patient CF , would useful tool treatment . The primary goal study draw connection level inflammation show PET scan number neutrophil obtain BAL . This study also look PET image relate inflammatory molecule lung FEV-1 obtain spirometry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantification Pulmonary Neutrophil Activity Cystic Fibrosis Using Radiolabeled Fluorodeoxyglucose PET Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient involve study PET scan perform . This involve inject small amount radiolabelled glucose ( sugar ) blood . A scan performed obtain image body glucose use . Patients also spirometry do . Spirometry simple procedure measure functioning lung ( FEV-1 ) measure amount air patient blow inhale ( patient breathes machine ) . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) perform . This involve put small amount fluid section lung , suction retrieve cell molecule contain substance lining lung . Subjects patient cystic fibrosis . Ten subject stable either mild moderate disease . These subject receive PET scan , spirometry , BAL . This portion study make 10 stable CF patient , 5 mild disease , 5 moderate disease . These patient receive PET scan , spirometry BAL 2 consecutive day . On day 1 , patient PET scan spirometry . On day 2 , patient BAL . Patients arrive first day fast least 6 hour take PET facility . PET scan consist 2-minute scan follow 15-minute scan , injection radiolabelled sugar vein , 66 minute scan . The patient instruct empty bladder reduce total radiation exposure . The patient give meal . Next , patient take spirometry , last test day 1 , simple involves breathe machine measure amount air inhale exhale . Upon report GCRC day 2 , patient take BAL ( patient fast least 6 hour prior admission ) . BAL involve small tube place mouth , throat , lung ( lidocaine use numb entire area ) . Less 3 tablespoon saline ( salt water ) pour tube , immediately suck back collect doctor . This repeated twice , total 8 tablespoon liquid .</detailed_description>
