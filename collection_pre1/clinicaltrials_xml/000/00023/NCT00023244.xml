	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect withdraw steroid graft rejection kidney function kidney transplant recipient age 0 20 year ( prior 21st birthday ) . Graft survival improve recent year child kidney transplant . One bad side effect steroid maintenance therapy growth retardation . Doctors believe steroid might safely withdraw patient receive maintenance therapy . If steroid remove , child might catch growth also might fewer side effect kind . This study evaluate whether steroid therapy withdrawn way increase graft rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steroid Withdrawal Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children receive kidney ( renal ) transplantation face distress issue post-transplantation include limited growth retardation directly attributable corticosteroid ( steroid ) . It hypothesize robust immunosuppression sirolimus calcineurin inhibitor ( cyclosporine tacrolimus ) conjunction induction therapy enable successful steroid withdrawal . A steroid-free environment could lessen side effect enable child achieve catch-up growth , reduce need anti-hypertensive therapy , reduce risk cardiovascular disease . This trial test objective provide steroid-free state without incur risk increase incidence acute transplant rejection . Patients enrol prior kidney transplantation receive standard evaluation . Patients receive induction therapy basiliximab preoperatively Day 4 surgery . Immunosuppressive therapy begin sirolimus either cyclosporine tacrolimus Day 1 follow surgery , corticosteroid day surgery . Infection prophylaxis Bactrim begin Day 1 surgery center-specific anti-cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) therapy give recipient CMV positive kidney . At 6 month post-transplantation , patient episode acute rejection undergo renal graft biopsy . Patients confirm free subclinical rejection randomize either undergo complete steroid withdrawal continue maintenance daily steroid . Patients receive either steroid placebo , continue immunosuppressive medication . Patients segregate weight group steroid withdrawal occur month 7 13 . Any acute rejection event withdrawal confirm renal biopsy manage methylprednisolone treatment . Patients follow 3 year post-transplantation analysis growth rate , blood pressure , lipid profile renal function measure serum creatinine calculate creatinine clearance . Post-transplantation clinic visit weekly first 2 month , every 2 week 13 month , weekly Month 13 , every 2 week Month 18 , monthly study end . Patients exhibit evidence acute subclinical rejection continue steroid withdrawal trial care manage pediatric renal transplant center physician .</detailed_description>
