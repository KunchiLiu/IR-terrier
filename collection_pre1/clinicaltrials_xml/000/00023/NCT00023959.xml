	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy radiation therapy may effective treatment head neck cancer . This phase I trial see combine bevacizumab , fluorouracil , hydroxyurea radiation therapy work treat patient advanced head neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Fluorouracil , Hydroxyurea Plus Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity bevacizumab give combination fluorouracil , hydroxyurea , radiotherapy patient advanced head neck cancer . II . Determine time progression , pattern failure , local control , distant failure rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine local toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study bevacizumab . Patients receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hour day 1-6 , fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 , bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily day 1-5 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously day 6-12 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient treat MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27-39 patient accrue study within 5.4-19.5 month .</detailed_description>
