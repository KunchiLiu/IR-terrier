	<brief_summary>This study compare health well child treat modified stem cell transplantation procedure chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) child receive standard care treatment . CGD inherit disorder neutrophils-a type infection-fighting white blood cell-that leave patient vulnerable life-threatening infection . Standard treatment antibiotic , sometimes surgery , always successful , patient persist infection poor long-term prognosis . Transplantation donate stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature white red blood cell platelet ) improve immune function patient CGD possibly cure disease . However , procedure carry significant risk death , require complete suppression immune system high-dose chemotherapy . In addition , lymphocytes-another type infection-fighting white blood cell-from donor may cause call graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) , donor cell 'see ' patient 's cell foreign mount immune response reject . To try reduce risk , patient study give low-dose chemotherapy easy body tolerate involve short period complete immune suppression . Also , donor 's lymphocyte remove rest stem cell transplant , reduce risk GvHD . Patients CGD 2 17 year age 1 ) currently free active infection , 2 ) history least one life-threatening infection family member CGD history least one life-threatening infection , 3 ) family member suitable donor may eligible study . Candidates medical history , physical examination blood test , lung heart function test , x-rays CT scan body , dental eye examination . They fill questionnaire measure emotional well , quality life , intelligence ( ability learn understand ) . Stem cell collect patient donor . To , hormone G-CSF injected skin several day move stem cell bone marrow bloodstream . Then , stem cell collect apheresis . In procedure blood drawn needle place one arm pump machine require cell separate remove . Then , rest blood return needle arm . Several day transplant procedure , patient start 'conditioning regimen ' chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , fludarabine Campath 1H . When condition therapy complete , donor 's stem cell infuse . To help prevent rejection donor cell , cyclosporine give mouth vein start 1 month transplant procedure . The average hospital stay stem cell transplantation 21 day . After discharge , patient return NIH clinic follow-up clinic visit weekly twice weekly 2 3 month . These visit include symptom check , physical examination blood test . Subsequent clinic visit schedule 1 3 time year least 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Granulomatous Disease With Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Versus Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) one several inherited disorder leukocyte function . Patients profoundly immunocompromised plague early life recurrent often life threaten infection . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly improve immune function patient CGD . The primary objective study investigate efficacy novel approach allogeneic stem cell transplantation , design promote partial complete donor stem cell engraftment ( hematopoietic chimerism ) reduce transplant related morbidity mortality . In attempt reduce toxicity pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning , highly immunosuppressive , low intensity bone marrow condition regimen use . Patients transplant peripheral blood stem cell HLA identical family member . The graft enrich hematopoietic stem cell attempt decrease risk graft versus host disease . Donor T-cells infuse various time point follow transplant augment donor hematopoietic chimerism aid immune reconstitution . Patients treat approach compare patient consider transplant-eligible lack HLA identical family member . These patient treat use current standard care . The primary end point study demonstrate reduce incidence CGD-like infection transplant patient compare control ( efficacy ) acceptable incidence acute chronic graft versus host disease transplant relate mortality ( safety ) . Long term follow data transplant patient concurrent control analyze confirm association establishment hematopoietic chimerism clinical benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA The following condition must meet patient may enrol study : Patients age 2 17 year ; minimum weight 12 kg . DHR proven chronic granulomatous disease gp91 phox p22 phox deficiency . History least one lifethreatening infection ( defined infection require treatment intravenous antibiotic therapy ) family member CGD history lifethreatening infection . Free active infection . Patients consent HLAmatched related donor meet donor selection criterion ( test patient ) , patient without eligible HLAmatched relate donor ( control patient ) . Patients eligible donor choose undergo stem cell transplantation patient eligible nonconsenting donor may enrol control arm study . Patients enrol control arm complete 24 month followup period may enroll transplant arm eligible , consent donor become available . Patients adequate organ function measure : Cardiac : Asymptomatic , symptomatic , leave ventricular ejection fraction rest must great 35 % . Hepatic : SGOT within 4 time normal range total bilirubin less 2mg/dL . Renal : Creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min/ 1.73m ( 2 ) . A maximum age adjust serum creatinine use patient unable provide accurate 24 hour urine collection . For child le equal 5 year age , maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 0.8 ; child whose age great 5 less equal 10 , maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.0 ; child whose age great 10 less equal age 15 , maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.2 ; child whose age great 15 , maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) 1.5 . Pulmonary : DLCO ( diffusion capacity ) FEV1 great 45 percent predict ( correct hemoglobin ) . Minors pulmonary function test possible evaluated significant pulmonary dysfunction pulmonary consultant . Written inform consent/assent conform institutional guideline obtain patient parent . Absence coexist medical problem would significantly increase risk transplant procedure judgment principal investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any one following condition eliminate patient participate protocol : Female patient pregnant lactate . ECOG performance status 2 less 50 percent Lansky scale age 010 . Seropositivity HIV due excessive risk infection neurotoxicity antiretroviral medication . Evidence rapid deterioration due progressive infection and/or organ damage . Malignant disease liable relapse progress within 5 year . DONOR SELECTION : Donors must fit receive GCSF give peripheral blood stem cell ( normal blood count , normotensive , history stroke , history severe heart disease , great 12kg ) . Related patient HLAphenotypically identical patient HLAA , B DRB1 allele . Matching assess minimally serology Class I DNA type Class II antigens . Female xlinked CGD carrier must great 30 percent normal neutrophil . If donor sibling minor , he/ old eligible sibling adult sibling eligible donor . Written inform consent donor . Donors minor evaluate social worker , psychologist psychiatrist prior assent process determine willingness participate . If willingness participate confirm , inform consent obtain adult parent legal guardian . Informed assent obtain minor donor presence third party assess comprehension voluntary participation .</criteria>
