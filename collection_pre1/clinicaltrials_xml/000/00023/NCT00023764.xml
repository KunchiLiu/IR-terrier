	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Lymphoproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine frequency duration complete partial response rate patient grade I , II , III follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma treat bortezomib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response minimal residual disease polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) detectable clonotypic PCR minimal residual disease bone marrow patient treat regimen . II . Determine time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . III . Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease type ( follicular lymphoma v mantle cell lymphoma ) . Patients receive infusion bortezomib 3-5 second weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least partial response last least 6 month may receive retreatment . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 4 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
