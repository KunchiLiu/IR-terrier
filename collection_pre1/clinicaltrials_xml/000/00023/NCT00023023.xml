	<brief_summary>This study follow blood transfusion recipients 6 9 month follow transfusion monitor quality safety blood transfusion . Improved viral test careful donor screen last several year dramatically reduce rate transfusion-related HIV hepatitis . Nevertheless , ongoing surveillance transfusion-related infection essential maintain high safety standard determine transfusion risk infectious agent , cytomegalovirus , Epstein-Barr virus , parvovirus B-19 , HHV-8 ( Kaposi sarcoma virus ) possible hepatitis virus might blood-transmitted . Transfused patient blood test various infectious agent . Their blood sample blood sample donor freeze store repository new infectious agent rapidly evaluate danger safety blood supply . Adult patient National Institutes Health child Children National Medical Center schedule receive blood transfusion undergo surgery blood transfusion may need eligible study . All participant 20- 25-milliliter ( 2 tablespoonful ) blood sample drawn transfusion 1 , 2 , 3 6 month transfusion . Patients transfuse one occasion course study provide three additional monthly sample . Patients develop transfusion-transmitted infection study provide four sample study infection effect . Participants complete brief questionnaire end study regard prior blood transfusion development illness , hepatitis , might cause transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improved viral screening assay intensive question donor high-risk behavior result dramatic decline rate transfusion-transmitted hepatitis AIDS . Nonetheless , need continue vigilance safety blood supply . This study enroll blood donor prospectively follow blood recipient order : 1 ) establish ongoing surveillance incidence breakthrough infection transfusion-transmitted agent exist donor-screening assay ( e.g . HBV , HCV , HIV , human T cell lymphotropic virus [ HTLV ] ) ; 2 ) monitor transfusion risk establish infectious agent routinely screen blood donor include CMV , parvovirus B-19 , HHV-8 [ Kaposi 's sarcoma virus ] ; 3 ) establish repository link donor recipient sample newly emerge infectious agent rapidly evaluate threat blood supply . The risk blood transmit infectious assessed molecular serologic assay adult patient NIH Suburban Hospital child Children 's National Medical Center . Blood sample recipient transfuse one occasion obtain pre 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 week post-transfusion . Recurrently transfused patient additional sample 16 20 week index transfusion 24 week last eligible transfusion . After initial infectious disease testing , recipient sample link donor sample store off-site biorepository . The availability repository allow assessment transfusion risk newly emerge pathogen also know agent practical assay currently available . For example , would allow future test prion new variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease ( human variant mad cow disease ) test trypanosome cause Chagas disease . Informed consent obtain store late test sample repository . Testing limited infectious agent potentially threaten blood supply . No genetic testing perform .</detailed_description>
