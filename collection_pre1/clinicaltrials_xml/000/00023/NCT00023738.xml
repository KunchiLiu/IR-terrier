	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Drugs SU5416 may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy , SU5416 , radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness chemotherapy , SU5416 , radiation therapy , surgery treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose SU5416 administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy patient high-grade stage IIC-III soft tissue sarcoma . - Determine disease-free survival , local control , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine histological response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine quantitative antiangiogenic effect SU5416 patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study SU5416 . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine IV continuously day 1-3 , 22-24 , 43-45 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin day 5 continue blood count recover . Patients undergo 2 course radiotherapy , give daily 11 dos per course day 7-20 28-41 . Patients also receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly begin day 1 continue 2 day surgery . Patients undergo surgical resection day 80 . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine IV continuously day 101-103 , 122-124 , 143-145 . Patients also receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly begin day 101 continue end adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients positive surgical margin receive additional radiotherapy begin 2 week resection total 8 dos . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SU5416 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 68-80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
