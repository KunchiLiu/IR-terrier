	<brief_summary>This study try identify genetic cause hereditary hearing loss balance disorder . People hear balance disorder affect one family member may eligible study . They immediate family member may undergo follow procedure : - Medical family history , include question hearing , balance ear-related issue , review medical record . - Routine physical examination . - Blood draw buccal swab ( brush inside cheek collect cell ) Tissue collect DNA analysis look change gene may relate hearing loss . - Hearing test The subject listen tone emit small earphone . - Balance test see balance function inner ear associate hearing loss In one test subject wear goggles watch move light cold warm air blown ear . A second test involve sit spin chair quiet , dark room . - Photograph A photograph may take record eye shape color , distance eye , hair color . - Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan These test show structure inner ear . For CT , subject lie still short time X-ray image obtain . For MRI , patient lie stretcher moved cylindrical machine strong magnetic field . The magnetic field radio wave produce image inner ear . The radio wave cause loud thumping noise muffle use earplug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Hereditary Disorders Hearing Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary hearing impairment genetically heterogeneous disorder cause mutation one hundred different gene . Approximately 20 gene identify mutation cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss . The identification analysis gene mutation provide critical insight development , structure , function auditory system , well molecular mechanism associate disruption process . In contrast , molecular mechanism underlie familial disorder affect peripheral vestibular function appear rare , well describe , less well understood . The peripheral auditory vestibular system share many common feature health disease , many hereditary hearing loss disorder also affect vestibular function . The purpose study identify gene mutation cause hereditary disorder hear , balance , . Members family segregate hereditary disorder hear balance enrol propose study order : ( 1 ) define characterize phenotypes natural history ; ( 2 ) identify underlie causative mutation gene linkage , positional cloning , and/or candidate gene mutation analysis ; ( 3 ) correlate observe phenotype correspond mutation function underlie gene .</detailed_description>
