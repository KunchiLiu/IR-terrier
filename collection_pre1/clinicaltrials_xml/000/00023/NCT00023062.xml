	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) explore brain control movement send message spinal cord muscle go wrong process disease . Activity motor cortex-the out part brain-will examine use TMS patient Parkinson 's disease healthy volunteer . Normal volunteer patient Parkinson 's disease ( stage I III ) 21 year age old may eligible study . All participant transcranial magnetic stimulation . For procedure , insulated wire coil place subject 's scalp brief electrical current pass coil . This create magnetic pulse pass brain generates small electrical current cortex , briefly disrupt function brain cell stimulate area . This may cause muscle twitch tingle face , jaw limb . During stimulation , participant ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The electrical activity muscle record computer electrode tap skin muscle . In case , study last le 3 hour . Participants also fill questionnaire aspect personality test ability perform certain cognitive ( think ) movement task . Patients Parkinson 's disease , addition , administer Uniform Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale measure disease severity . Patients request stop Parkinson 's disease medication 12 hour study . They may resume medication immediately study . Patients wish may admitted hospital day even study medication stay feel ready leave .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) provide measure balance inhibitory facilitatory activity evokable motor cortex . Studies several diverse disorder basal ganglia outflow cortical regulation show alteration direction decrease inhibition increase facilitation . In general , quite small , data different interstimulus interval pool analysis , , therefore , disease state-specific information may miss . A deep understanding technique tell u pathological normal cortical regulation require detailed study within population look correlation physiological clinical/behavioral variable large , uniform , head-to-head comparison clinical population . This proposal contain project combine correlational comparative approach Parkinson 's disease healthy individual . Data project comparable future similar study disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : Patients establish , doparesponsive PD , Hoehn Yahr stage IIII , age 21 older include . Patients recruit NINDS HMCS ETB clinical program community . Healthy Controls : Healthy control 21 older recruit NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program community . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusionary criterion : significant medical psychiatric illness ( PD ) , pregnancy , history epilepsy , concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug could lower seizure threshold significantly affect cortical excitability . Persons surgically traumatically implanted foreign body head ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation also exclude . Patients : Patients persistent `` rest '' tremor precludes test rest may exclude well patient screen physician make judgment withdrawal medication pose significant risk due immobility risk fall . Patients longacting dopamine agonist also exclude . Patients Hoehn Yahr stage IV also exclude , since least likely tolerate medication withdrawal also unlikely able maintain muscle relaxation TMS testing . No significant medical psychiatric illness ( PD ) , pregnancy , history epilepsy , concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug could lower seizure threshold significantly affect cortical excitability . Must surgically traumatically implanted foreign body head ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation . HEALTHY CONTROLS : Ages 21 older recruit NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program ( CRVP ) community . All individual process CRVP participate . Recruitment focus optimize age , sex , educational , racial matching patient group . Patients ' spouse invite participate . No significant medical psychiatric illness ( PD ) , pregnancy , history epilepsy , concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug could lower seizure threshold significantly affect cortical excitability . Must surgically traumatically implanted foreign body head ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation .</criteria>
