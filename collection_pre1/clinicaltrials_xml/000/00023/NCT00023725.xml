	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs SU5416 may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . It yet know radiation therapy effective without SU5416 treat soft tissue sarcoma . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial compare effectiveness radiation therapy without SU5416 treat patient stage IB stage IIA soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without SU5416 Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose SU5416 combine neoadjuvant radiotherapy patient stage IB IIA soft tissue sarcoma . - Determine antiangiogenic effect SU5416 patient . - Determine synergistic antiangiogenic effect SU5416 radiotherapy patient . - Compare disease-free survival , local recurrence , distant metastasis , overall survival rate patient treat neoadjuvant radiotherapy without SU5416 . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study SU5416 follow phase II randomize study . Phase I : - Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5 week . Patients also receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly begin week 1 continue 2 day surgery . - Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SU5416 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : - Once MTD determine , additional patient accrue randomized receive either treatment phase I MTD v preoperative radiotherapy alone . All patient undergo surgical resection 70-80 day begin therapy . Patients positive surgical margin receive additional radiotherapy daily 8 day SU5416 IV 1 hour day 2 , 4 , 9 . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 18 patient accrued phase I study within 1 year . Approximately 28 patient accrue phase II study .</detailed_description>
