	<brief_title>OmniHeart Trial : Macronutrients Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While widespread consensus optimal diet reduce cardiovascular risk low saturate fat , type macronutrient replace saturate fat ( carbohydrate , protein unsaturated fat ) major , unresolved research question substantial public health implication . The study evaluate three dietary approach study effect establish coronary risk factor select group emerge risk factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study design randomize , three period cross-over feeding study compare effect blood pressure plasma lipid carbohydrate-rich diet pattern DASH diet ( CARB ) two diet , one rich protein ( PROTEIN ) another rich unsaturated ( UNSAT ) fat , predominantly monounsaturated fat . The DASH diet show reduce blood pressure LDL-cholesterol substantially , currently recommended policy maker . During one week run-in , participant feed sample three study diet ( CARB , PROTEIN UNSAT ) . Using three period cross-over design , participant randomly assign CARB , PROTEIN UNSAT diet . Each feed period last six week ; washout period least two week separate feeding period . Throughout feed ( run-in three intervention period ) , participant feed sufficient calorie maintain weight . Trial participant 30 year age old , systolic blood pressure 120-159 mmHg diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mmHg . Primary outcome variable blood pressure establish plasma lipid risk factor ( LDL-C , HDL-C triglyceride ) . Secondary outcome include total cholesterol , apolipoproteins VLDL-apoB , VLDL-apoCIII , apolipoprotein B , non-HDL cholesterol , lipoprotein ( ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Trial participant generally healthy adult , age 30 year old , systolic blood pressure 120 159 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure 80 99 mm Hg . This range include individual prehypertension ( systolic , 120139 mm Hg diastolic , 8089 mm Hg ) stage 1 hypertension ( systolic , 140159 mm Hg diastolic , 9099 mm Hg ) . Prehypertensive individual group high risk develop hypertension CVD , justify special attempt low blood pressure . Major exclusion criterion diabetes , active prior CVD , LDL cholesterol great 220 mg/dL ( &gt; 5.70 mmol/L ) , fast triglyceride great 750 mg/dL ( &gt; 8.48 mmol/L ) , weight 350 lb ( &gt; 159 kg ) , take medication affect blood pressure blood lipid level , unwillingness stop take vitamin mineral supplement , alcoholic beverage intake 14 drink per week .</criteria>
