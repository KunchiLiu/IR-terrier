HIV-infected volunteer recruit screen . This protocol use determine volunteer meet eligibility requirement participation trial vaccines HIV-infected subject . Subjects : Approximately 1,000 adult HIV infection . Study Plan : Subjects evaluate eligibility participate vaccine trial receive counsel HIV-related issue . Women receive counseling avoidance pregnancy clinical trial . If determine volunteer might eligible vaccine trial , additional information trial option provide telephone , mail and/or visit study coordinator . Study Duration : Approximately six month subject . Study Evaluations : Evaluations usually include history physical examination CBC , differential , platelet , PT/PTT , chemistry panel , urinalysis , pregnancy test woman reproductive potential , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , RPR , ELISA Western blot HIV , anti-dsDNA , quantitative immunoglobulin , adenovirus serology T cell subset ( CD4/CD8 ) .
