	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Study Benzydamine Oral Rinse Treatment Oral Mucositis ( Mouth Sores ) Resulting From Radiation Therapy Cancer Oral Cavity , Oropharynx , Nasopharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , vehicle-controlled study include open-label standard care arm , determine effectiveness safety benezydamine hydrochloride 0.15 % oral rinse compare vehicle oral rinse , vehicle oral rinse compare care normally use treatment radiation-induced oral mucositis . The hypothesis benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15 % oral rinse well vehicle oral rinse measure proportion patient reach WHO mucositis score 3 5500 cGy vehicle bad standard care measure proportion patient reach WHO mucositis score 3 5500 cGy . Patients receive benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15 % vehicle double-blind oral rinse place 15 mL mouth 2 minute , gargle second begin end rinse , expectorate entire dose . Dosing oral rinse every 2 - 3 hour awake minimum 4 time daily maximum 8 time per day . Double-blind oral rinse continue daily throughout duration subject radiation treatment regimen plus 2 additional week</detailed_description>
