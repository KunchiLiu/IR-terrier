	<brief_summary>This two-part study use transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ( see ) , explore brain form memory . People remember event experience every day , face perceive , word read , speech hear interpret , forth . The event remember save formed brain . Part 1 study involve test material Part 2 , TMS experiment . Part 2 us TMS examine part brain involve forming memory . Information gain study may use develop method enhance memory healthy people patient memory impairment . Healthy right-handed volunteer 18 35 year age may eligible study . Candidates may screen medical interview physical examination brief test short- long-term visual verbal memory . Eligible volunteer may participate Part 1 Part 2 study , follow : Part 1 - Preparation Words Picture Materials Participants look several word shape appear random order computer screen try remember well possible memory test give 20 minute later . Each image appear screen 3/4 second , 1-1/4-second interval . For test , word shape show computer screen time interval . When item appear , subject press one three button quickly possible , determine recognize item high low level confidence . The entire procedure last 1 hour , break . The purpose experiment find appropriate word picture use stimuli TMS study describe . Part 2 - TMS Experiment For TMS , subject sits comfortable chair . An insulated wire coil place scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The pulse may cause pull sensation skin coil twitch muscle arm leg . Electrodes tap skin muscle hand record electrical activity muscle . Pulses deliver train short burst impulse , last half second . Participants receive 90 train total 900 pulse . TMS apply first part memory study , word shape first present computer screen , second presentation memory test . The entire procedure take 2 hour , break . Before TMS session , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determine place coil TMS . For MRI , subject lie still 30 minute time table slide scanner , narrow metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . Earplugs worn muffle loud knock sound occur scanner take picture . Subjects communicate MRI staff time ask stop procedure time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent functional imaging study show memory retrieval associate activation prefrontal cortex encode process . However , cause-effect link prefrontal activity encode demonstrate . The purpose protocol test hypothesis inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) leave prefrontal cortex interferes encode verbal item ( word ) episodic memory , thereby identify region substrate mediate verbal encoding . Identification role prefrontal cortex verbal memory encode first step try develop strategy enhance encode process patient memory impairment , issue relevance neurorehabilitation . We plan apply rTMS leave prefrontal cortex two control site , encode verbal nonverbal item episodic memory . Normal , healthy volunteer study . The outcome measure performance subsequent memory test word present leave prefrontal rTMS , compare performance word present rTMS control sit without rTMS . This measure indicate leave prefrontal stimulation disrupt memory encode word relative stimulation sit stimulation . A secondary outcome measure performance subsequent memory test word present leave prefrontal rTMS , compare performance picture present leave prefrontal rTMS . This measure indicate disruption leave prefrontal function TMS affect verbal non-verbal memory encoding .</detailed_description>
