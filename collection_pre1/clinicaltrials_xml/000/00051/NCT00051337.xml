	<brief_summary>This study use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) determine area brain responsible paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder . Patients disorder sudden , brief attack movement , similar epileptic seizure , without loss consciousness . SPECT nuclear medicine test produce three-dimensional image brain , show blood flow function different brain region . This test , detect focus epileptic seizure , use study scan patient experience hyperkinetic movement attack , attack , simulate attack . Patients 18 year age old paroxysmal movement attack easily induce specific trigger , sudden movement prolong exercise , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history review medical record , physical examination , videotape attack , , woman , pregnancy test . Participants three SPECT scan , separate least 48 hour . Before scan , subject perform activity ordinarily precipitate movement attack , stand chair , assume certain posture , something strenuous . Each scan try record one follow condition : - The subject perform trigger activity , attack ; - The subject perform trigger activity involuntary attack result ; - The subject perform trigger activity attack , mimic attack voluntarily . After condition record , subject give injection radioactive agent call 99m Technetium relax quietly 40 60 minute SPECT scan . For scan , subject lie examination table SPECT camera move near around head image brain . The scan take 40 minute . Participants also undergo one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . For test , subject lie narrow cylinder ( scanner ) , picture brain take . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit use scan process . The procedure take 30 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) Study Paroxysmal Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine area brain responsible paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder . Paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder clinically recognize long time , although exact neurophysiological mechanism lead paroxysm hyperkinetic movement attack well understood . Paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder heterogenous , exact mechanism may differ subcategory . In paroxysmal dyskinesia , idiopathic form paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder , speculate transient functional abnormality cellular level occur basal ganglion without organic irreversible damage . Ion channel dysfunction attractive hypothesis explain transient dysfunction . Some patient paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder psychogenic etiology . A promising technique evaluate physiological change brain attack ictal single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) scan . Ictal SPECT reliable method detect seizure focus epileptic seizure . We utilize ictal SPECT scan technique , attack , simulate attack . The differential activation attack hyperkinetic movement voluntary movement may shed light region brain neurophysiological mechanism responsible generation paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Paroxysmal Dyskinesia Patients : Established diagnosis paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder . The diagnosis establish preliminary screening NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic , base review medical record , history , clinical evaluation , video tape attack . Age 18 old . A reproducible trigger paroxysmal hyperkinetic attack , sudden movement , prolong exercise , produce attack least 50 % consistency . Patients paroxysmal attack hyperkinetic movement . Patients whose attack precipitate easily . Patients whose typical attack last least 15 second . Patients take medication may influence central nervous system , phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , clonazepam , antidepressant ( limit ) paroxysmal dyskinesia ( seizure ) ask hold medication prior study . A sufficient drug washout period establish dependant upon individual drug . Subjects may admit NIH necessary . They ask abstain alcohol caffeine 24 hour prior study well . INCLUSION CRITERIA Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkenetic movement attack patient : Established diagnosis psychogenic hyperkinetic movement disorder . The diagnosis establish preliminary screening NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic , base review medical record , history , clinical evaluation , video tape attack . Patients clear onset , stereotype , define evaluable hyperkinetic attack . Patients paroxysmal attack hyperkinetic movement . Age 18 older . A reproducible trigger paroxysmal hyperkinetic attack , sudden movement , startle prolonged exercise , produce attack least 50 % consistency . Patients whose attack precipitate easily . Patients whose typical attack last least 15 second . Patients take medication may influence central nervous system , phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , clonazepam , antidepressant ( limit ) ask hold medication prior study . A sufficient drug washout period establish dependant upon individual drug . Subjects may admit NIH necessary . They ask abstain alcohol caffeine 24 hour prior study well . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age young 18 year old . Previous history MRI finding consistent brain tumor , stroke , trauma arterial venous malformation . Contraindication MRI device compatible MRI ( pacemaker , implant medical pump , brain stimulators etc . ) , metallic prosthesis body ( metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant etc . ) , history work metal past , since person may potentially small metal fragment eye without aware . Any diagnosis progressive neurological disorder paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder . Any history significant medical disorder require chronic treatment drug affect CNS , stop . Ongoing radiation therapy medical condition cancer . Women pregnant nursing . Female subject child bear potential specific interview pregnancy test prior study ( imaging procedure require ) ensure pregnant nursing . Any subject capable give informed consent . This determined initial evaluation NINDS clinic . Patients Mini Mental Score less 25 significant psychiatric history evaluate detailed neuropsychiatric testing , consultation psychiatrist .</criteria>
