	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness modify stem cell transplant procedure treat cancer blood immune system . Patients cancer pre-cancerous condition originate blood immune system cell sometimes benefit greatly , even cure , transplant stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature blood cell ) . In addition produce new bone marrow restore normal blood production immunity , donate cell fight residual tumor cell might remain body , call graft-versus-tumor effect . However , severe problem , sometimes death , may follow transplant result high-dose chemotherapy radiation accompany procedure . Also , donate immune system cell call T cell sometimes attack healthy tissue reaction call graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) , damage organ liver , intestine skin . This study use follow strategy try reduce risk : - induction chemotherapy reduce patient immunity attempt prevent rejection donate stem cell ; - reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy easy body tolerate involve short period complete immune suppression ; - donation immune cell call Th2 cell instead T cell try reduce risk serious GVHD ; - treatment methotrexate cyclosporine try reduce risk serious GVHD . Patients 12 75 year age non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , chronic myelogenous leukemia , acute myelogenous leukemia , acute lymphocytic leukemia , myelodysplasia , idiopathic myelofibrosis , polycythemia vera , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia may eligible study . Candidates medical history , physical dental examination , blood urine test ( include blood test genetic match donor ) , lung heart function test , X-ray study . A bone marrow biopsy may do evaluate disease status . Patients lymphoma may nuclear medicine test call positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Participants central venous line ( large plastic tube ) place major vein . This tube stay body used entire treatment period deliver donate stem cell give medication , include chemotherapy drug , antibiotic blood transfusion , withdraw blood sample . Treatment start induction chemotherapy , include drug fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone . Some patient may also receive antibody call rituximab . Patients receive one three cycle treatment , depend response drug . ( One cycle consist 5 day drug therapy follow 16-day rest period . ) Several day transplant procedure , patient start condition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine . Three day condition therapy complete , stem cell infuse . To help prevent GVHD , patient take four dos methotrexate ( vein ) shortly transplant , cyclosporine ( mouth vein ) 6 month transplant . The average hospital stay stem cell transplantation 3 4 week . After discharge , patient return frequent follow-up visit 3 month . Monthly visit schedule next 3 month , every 3 month next 18 month , less frequently total least 5 year post-transplant . These visit include bone marrow aspirate biopsy , blood draw , test monitor disease status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) potentially curative refractory hematologic malignancy , application limit historically morbidity mortality conventional transplant preparative regimens graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Donor T cell mediate GVHD also help eradicate malignancy immune-dependent graft-versus-tumor effect . Efforts decrease preparative regimen toxicity lead reduced-intensity 'nonmyeloablative ' regimen , facilitate study allogeneic HSCT broad population . As promising strategy reduce GVHD , donor Th2 cell show abrogate Th1-mediated GVHD without impair engraftment murine model allogeneic HSCT . These finding lead phase I/II clinical study donor Th2 cell prevention GVHD reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT ( CC 99-C-0143 ) ; preliminary result suggest randomize trial necessary evaluate donor Th2 cell . In CC 99-C-0143 , novel induction chemotherapy regimen , EPOCH-Fludarabine ( EPOCH-F ) , well tolerated effective sequential host immune depletion . However , significant proportion patient fail achieve satisfactory disease control transplant , provide basis intensify induction regimen . Furthermore , initial 20 patient treat study experience relatively high rate acute GVHD considerable morbidity associate cyclosporine monotherapy GVHD prevention , indicate future study use aggressive prophylaxis . These observation warrant modify approach allogeneic HSCT undertake randomize study donor Th2 cell . We propose pilot study HLA-matched , relate , reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT refractory hematologic malignancy , use intensified EPOCH-F induction chemotherapy regimen rituximab added patient CD20+ malignancy ( EPOCH-F/R ) . This regimen evaluate toxicity disease control transplantation . GVHD prophylaxis consist standard dual-agent regimen , cyclosporine/methotrexate ; impact change hematopoietic recovery , donor/recipient chimerism , incidence acute GVHD assess . Immune reconstitution follow allogeneic HSCT important research interest among Experimental Transplantation Immunology Branch Investigators . Current evidence suggest critical role interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) CD4+ T cell homeostasis , interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) appear crucial CD8+ T cell NK cell homeostasis . The relationship cytokine lymphocyte subpopulation study set allogeneic HSCT ; analysis may enhance understanding engraftment kinetics , graft-versus-host disease , immune reconstitution . We correlate serum IL-7 IL-15 level change circulate T-cell NK-cell subpopulation EPOCH-F/R induction chemotherapy , transplantation , development GVHD .</detailed_description>
