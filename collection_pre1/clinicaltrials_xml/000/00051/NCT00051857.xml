	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound image study muscle , tendon , bone work together cause motion . The procedure one several tool develop characterize normal impaired musculoskeletal function , goal develop improve method diagnosis treatment movement disorder . Healthy normal volunteer must age 5 unlimited , without joint impairment , may eligible study . Volunteers joint impairment may serious injury joint study , previous surgery joint study , extreme pain joint study . MRI use strong magnet radio wave create image inside body . The subject lie long narrow couch inside metal cylinder ( scanner ) 3 hour scanner gather data . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise cause electrical switching radiofrequency circuit use scan process . A special pad tube may place around region scan improve quality data . The subject ask repeatedly move specific joint , knee , brief period , usually less 5 minute . The subject communicate via intercom person perform study time procedure , may request stop study time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal technology development initiative greatly advance clinical diagnosis treatment musculoskeletal impairment relate joint function . The primary focus protocol initially develop ultimately validate combine set tool ( virtual functional anatomy - VFA ) enable accurate precise measurement , analysis visualization three-dimensional ( 3D ) static dynamic musculoskeletal anatomy ( i.e. , bone shape , skeletal kinematics , tendon ligament strain , muscle force , joint space ) image data . We plan merge extend exist MR image analysis capability ultrasound image analysis development implementation highly accurate , imaging-based measurement analysis technique non-invasive quantification complete joint anatomy tissue dynamic functional movement . In short , plan develop method create 3D digital image load move joint tissue ( bone , cartilage , connective tissue ) reveal joint contact pattern tissue load . In conjunction building tool , evaluate variability bone shape across subject , sensitivity define joint posture ( translation rotation one bone relative another ) osteo-based coordinate system definition , ability ultimately use tool document evaluate function normal impaired joint structure ( e.g. , ACL rupture , patella track syndrome ) simulate condition experienced activity daily live . The principal investigator previously develop tested primary component VFA package , cine-phase contrast fast-phase contrast ( fast-PC ) MRI , demonstrate highly accurate precise measurement normal 3D knee joint kinematics biceps femoris strain . Additional investigator previously develop technique image musculoskeletal structure use ultrasonography , demonstrate technique , likewise , highly accurate precise measurement biomechanical property soft tissue surround knee tendon quadriceps femoris . Under protocol propose develop additional numerical reconstruction , image analysis , display method test applicability fast-PC MRI ultrasound study various normal impaired joint ( e.g. , ankle , wrist , knee ) . This development process require data human subject obtain static dynamic MR ultrasound image . This development guide philosophy impaired joint function likely occurs due abnormal bone shape , abnormal musculoskeletal movement force , abnormal bone shape musculoskeletal movement force . Thus , long-term vision non-invasively quantify vivo 3D joint kinematics , bone shape tissue load healthy impaired normal volunteer population , translate method finding interventional research ultimately common clinical practice .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ALL VOLUNTEERS : All subject must age 5 unlimited . For subject 18 year age , must capable give assent parent legal guardian providing informed consent . For subject age 18 , must able provide inform consent . Subjects either healthy control healthy volunteer specific musculoskeletal impairment , pathology , variant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA UNIMPAIRED VOLUNTEERS : 1 . Any relevant medical problem ( connective tissue problem , active arthritis , etc . ) 2 . Any clinical sign impairment joint study , mechanical joint abnormality include abnormal range motion , muscle weakness , malaligment . 3 . Any serious injury joint study , previous surgery joint study extreme pain joint study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ALL VOLUNTEERS : All potential volunteer MR portion must complete NIH Radiology screen questionnaire . If potential contraindication find , either volunteer doctor ( knowledge potential contraindication ) radiology department NIH contact determine potential contraindication would exclude specific MR scan propose . Subjects exclude deem condition , would preclude participate MRI study ( e.g . paralyze hemidiaphragm , morbid obesity , claustrophobia etc . ) present unnecessary risk ( e.g . pregnancy , surgery uncertain type , symptom pheochromocytoma insulinoma , etc. ) . Lastly , woman pregnant exclude participate study order prevent possible damage fetus .</criteria>
