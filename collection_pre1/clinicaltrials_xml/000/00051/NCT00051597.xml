	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate multi-dose regimen SGN-30 , novel chimeric monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , patient refractory recurrent CD30+ hematologic malignancy . This single-arm , open-label phase I/II study design define toxicity profile , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , anti-tumor activity multi-dose regimen SGN-30 patient refractory recurrent CD30+ hematologic malignancy . The phase I study modify dose escalation SGN-30 . Based preclinical pharmacology toxicokinetics ( TK ) first use human single-dose phase I study , SGN-30 administer weekly schedule . An initial dose 2 mg/kg escalate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach weekly dose 12 mg/kg achieve .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histologically confirm CD30+ hematologic malignancy . Immunohistochemistry flow cytometry may perform either original diagnostic biopsy material biopsy relapse disease . Patients must least one follow : Patients HD must fail systemic chemotherapy either initial therapy advance stage disease salvage therapy initial radiotherapy ( XRT ) early stage disease ineligible , refuse treatment stem cell transplantation Patients CD30+ malignancy must beyond 1st remission refractory front line chemotherapy Patients refractory chemoresistant multiple myeloma ( MM ) , defined failure respond ( &lt; 50 % reduction Mprotein level ) , disease progression le 2 month receive least two conventional chemotherapy regimens Patients MM Plateau Phase disease may include study . Plateau phase define persistent ( 6 week ) Mprotein serum urine despite significant initial reduction ( &gt; 50 % ) response previous therapy . These patient receive least two conventional chemotherapy regimen list prior enrollment study .
