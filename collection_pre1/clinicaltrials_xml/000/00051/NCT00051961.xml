	<brief_summary>This study examine effect drug Ropinirole spinal cord reflex symptom restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) . Patients RLS uncomfortable sensation leg , usually even early part night . Most patient also periodic involuntary leg movement . The condition tend worsen time , result severe discomfort sleep disturbance . Ropinirole affect chemical messenger think involve spinal cord function modulate RLS symptom . Healthy normal volunteer patient RLS 18 80 year age may eligible study . Patients must mild moderate RLS periodic limb movement . All candidate screen medical history , physical neurological evaluation , electromyogram ( see ) , polysomnogram ( see ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood urine test . They may also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan chest x-ray . Participants must stop take medication prohibit study least 1 week study start throughout duration . The study last approximately 2 3 week healthy volunteer 7 8 week patient . Participants undergo follow baseline evaluation : electroencephalography ( EEG ) , measure brain wave activity ; polysomnography ( PSG ) , overnight sleep study ; electromyography ( EMG ) , measure muscle activity ; spinal flexor reflex study ( spinal cord responses electrical stimulation ) . For study , several electrode attach scalp leg arm use cream help conduct brain signal cable record . The nervous system activity assess rest stimulation electric current . For EMG , small needle inserted muscle subject ask relax contract muscle . The electrical activity muscle cell record analyzed computer . Spinal flexor reflex study usually involve stimulate nerve legs brief electric current mild moderate intensity . Flexor reflex study do early night subject awake also sleep . Brain , muscle breathing activity monitor continuously sleep . A suggested immobilization test ( SIT ) do around 10 p.m. During test , subject sits still 1 hour , leg muscle activity record use special electronic device attach skin . At end test , volunteer ask question symptom may experience test , patient ask question RLS symptom test . After baseline test , participant randomly assign take either Ropinirole tablet placebo ( look-alike inactive substance ) daily 5 week . They admit NIH Clinical Center 3 4 night end second week 2 night end study repeat baseline test describe . Volunteers take Ropinirole placebo daily 1 week . They admit Clinical Center 3 4 day begin end study repeat test . Medical examination , ECGs blood test do various time study safety monitoring . Patients ' blood pressure monitor weekly . Small amount blood drawn three time day routine study , research drug level . Throughout study volunteer complete questionnaire evaluation possible RLS symptom , patient symptom assess use RLS Severity Rating Scale . Two week study end , participant interview telephone adverse experience .</brief_summary>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow exclusion criterion either Day 0 study enrol immediately exclude study , appropriate : 1 . History medical condition reasonably expect subject individual unwarranted risk compromise scientific integrity study ; 2 . History presence gastrointestinal , hepatic renal disease condition know interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug 3 . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality include liver enzyme elevation great twice upper limit normal ; 4 . Patient unwilling unable stop usual medication RLS ; 5 . Subjects unable unwilling discontinue prohibit concomitant medication ; 6 . Subjects receive prescribed medication within 7 day prior first dose day ( define Day 1 ) , opinion Principal Investigator interfere study procedure compromise safety . 7 . Withdrawal , introduction , change dose hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and/or drug know substantially inhibit induce CYP1A2 within 2 week prior first dose ( Day 1 ) . 8 .
