	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II clinical trial evaluate combination monoclonal antibody-based drug ( SGN-15 ) chemotherapeutic agent compare chemotherapy give alone patient non-small cell lung cancer fail least one prior systemic therapy . The objective study determine safety clinical benefit , measure tumor response quality life , combination regimen . Monoclonal antibody therapy use type cancer target therapy tumor , thereby allow chemotherapeutic agent lesser effect normal , healthy tissue .</brief_summary>
