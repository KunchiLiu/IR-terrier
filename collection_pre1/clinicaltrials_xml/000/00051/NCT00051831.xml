	<brief_summary>HIV replication rest CD4 cell minimal anti-HIV drug often fail destroy virus cell . Enfuvirtide , also know T-20 , type anti-HIV drug call fusion inhibitor . The purpose study test ability T-20-enhanced treatment regimen decrease number rest CD4 cell become infected HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Enfuvirtide-based Anti-HIV Drug Regimen Latent HIV Reservoirs Treatment Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While current HIV treatment combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) reduce morbidity mortality , eradicate cure HIV infection . A possible explanation failure persistence virus long-lived reservoir . Resting memory CD4 cell propose provide cellular reservoir . Most patient initiate ART chronic HIV-1 infection experience detectable reduction HIV latent reservoir ; may due low level ongoing viral replication maintains rest CD4 cell reservoir . Increasing potency therapy inhibit new viral target may result decrease number latently infected cell clearance latent reservoir . Addition fusion inhibitor T-20 ART include reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor ( PIs ) may help achieve goal . This study evaluate whether treatment naive , chronically infected HIV patient treat T-20 plus emtricitabine ( FTC ) , ritonavir ( RTV ) , saquinavir ( SQV ) , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) measurable decline latently infect CD4 cell reservoir . Patients physician may choose different PIs RTV SQV , provide study . Patients study receive injection T-20 twice daily addition oral FTC TDF daily oral RTV SQV twice daily . At Week 24 , patient latent cell reservoir sample . Patients whose HIV viral load le 50 copies/ml Week 24 prior Week 48 continue treatment regimen end study ; latent cell reservoirs test Weeks 48 , 72 , 96 . Patients whose viral load 50 copies/ml 200 copies/ml continue treatment regimen latent cell sampling , regimen may intensify determine study team . Patients whose viral load 200 copies/ml great Week 24 may continue study regimen , long contribute latent cell sample . This study last 96 week . During first 4 month study , patient 7 study visit ; , study visit every 8 week end study . Medical history , clinical assessment , blood collection occur every study visit . Pill ENF vial count assess , patient ask complete medication adherence questionnaire select study visit .</detailed_description>
