	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess safety effectiveness TNFerade™ Biologic administer concurrently 5-FU radiation therapy first-line treatment unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer . TNFerade™ replication deficient adenovirus vector contain gene TNF-alpha control chemoradiation inducible promoter . This allow expression TNF-alpha great area receive radiation . TNF-alpha cytokine show potent anti-cancer activity , due systemic toxicity , could deliver effective dos . TNFerade™ Biologic novel way selective delivery TNF-alpha tumor cell . TNFerade™ Biologic inject five weekly injection session , concomitant radiation 5-FU . TNFerade™ Biologic administer direct intratumoral injection use percutaneous approach ( PTA ) endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) .</brief_summary>
