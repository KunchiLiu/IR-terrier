	<detailed_description>HIV-1 present several challenge vaccine design , include : 1 ) high mutation rate result tremendous diversity virus envelope , target neutralize antibody , antibody elicit one envelope may protect virus distinct envelope ; 2 ) envelope infect person differs envelope obtain T-cell line culture , usual source envelope vaccine ; 3 ) envelope glycoprotein exist oligomers virion surface , monomer use previous vaccine . This study test new vaccine design meet challenge deliver diverse , patient-derived , oligomeric envelope induce multiple type-specific response capable recognize native envelope natural variant . The vaccine vector use vaccine trial recombinant vaccinia virus base NYCDH vaccinia isolate . Participants study receive PolyEnv1 HIV vaccine follow one year . Laboratory test perform 10 study visit monitor participant ' immunologic response ass safety vaccine . Patients also numerous HIV test throughout study period .</detailed_description>
