	<brief_summary>The body produce natural compound , nitric oxide ( NO ) , know improve elasticity blood vessel effect cardiac function play role remodel process heart attack . The primary source NO one amino acids body use form new protein , L-Arginine ; although many individual heart disease also take medicine increase concentration NO nitroglycerine . The VINTAGE-MI trial intend investigate wether supplementation body supply NO oral administration L-Arginine improve functional recovery older patient recently suffer first heart attack .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : As age , blood vessel heart muscle naturally become stiff loose ability flex heart beat blood pressure change . This believe worsen blood vessel cardiac function old individual . The stiffened tissue likely less able adapt stress remodel occur heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) loss functional heart tissue predispose heart poor function heart blood vessel undergo various change order increase supply blood damage area . DESIGN NARRATIVE : VINTAGE-MI randomized , double blind study enrol patient recently suffer first heart attack . There two recruitment clinic within Johns Hopkins University Network , Johns Hopkins Hospital Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . Following preliminary test establish eligibility baseline function heart blood vessel , study participant randomly assign receive either L-Arginine placebo pill identical except contain L-Arginine . These pill take orally 3 time day 6 month . Participants return clinic 1 , 3 , 6 month begin take medication functional testing repeat . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
