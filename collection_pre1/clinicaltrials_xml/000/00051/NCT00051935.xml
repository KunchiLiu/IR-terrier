	<brief_summary>GSD-II ( also know Pompe disease ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient GSD-II , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . This study conduct evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics efficacy recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase ( rhGAA ) potential enzyme replacement therapy pair sibling GSD-II . To eligible study , patient must confirm diagnosis GSD-II sister brother also confirm diagnosis GSD-II .</brief_summary>
