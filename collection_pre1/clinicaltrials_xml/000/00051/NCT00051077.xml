	<detailed_description>The emergence liver disease HIV infect patient coinfections HBV and/or HCV become increasingly important disease progression post-HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) era . The overall rate HBV HCV infection HIV infect person 5 % 10 % . There convince evidence HIV infection exacerbate severity viral hepatitis progression liver disease . Hepatitis treatment study generally exclude HIV patient HBV HCV . As , influence HBV HCV treatment HIV infect patient unknown . This study investigate safety anti-HBV efficacy ADV + PEG-INF + RBV triple therapy patient HCV , HIV , 3TC-resistant HBV . The study also evaluate effect HBV HBV therapy HCV HIV disease progression . Patients document HIV , 3TC-resistant HBV , HCV randomize one two treatment regimens 48 week . Patients group receive daily oral RBV weekly subcutaneous injection PEG-INF . Patients Group A receive daily ADV ; patient Group B receive placebo . After 48 week study treatment , study medication discontinue patient undergo liver biopsy . Patients follow additional 24 week . Throughout study , investigator monitor numerous lab value patient ask complete multiple adherence questionnaire . Subjects confirm 2 point increase Child-Pugh-Turcotte liver disease prognosis score time study permanently discontinue PEG-INF RBV register Step 2 receive open label ADV .</detailed_description>
