	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE inhibitor ) may prevent cardiovascular event high risk person improve skeletal muscle function heart failure patient mean mechanisms independent blood pressure change . However , limited knowledge mechanism underlie therapeutic benefit ACE inhibition . ACE inhibitor may favorably modify marker fibrinolysis , inflammation , endothelial function , extracellular tissue remodeling , associate atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease . But , clinical trial evidence effect limit . In addition , polymorphisms ACE , angiotensinogen , PAI-1 IL-6 gene may modify therapeutic response ACE inhibitor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This double-blind cross-over , randomize , placebo control trial 286 person high cardiovascular risk compare effect 6 month treatment fosinopril 6 month placebo follow primary outcome : plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) antigen , C- reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 ) . The secondary objective ( ) ass effect fosinopril IL-6/IL-6 Soluble Receptor ratio , PAI-1 activity , tissue plasminogen activator ( TPA ) antigen , fibrinogen , endothelin-1 , TNF-alpha , soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) , E-selectin , matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) ; ( b ) explore effect ACE , angiotensinogen , PAI-1 , IL-6 gene polymorphism biomarkers , test interaction gene polymorphisms effect fosinopril . The study sufficient power detect small change several biomarkers compare placebo . The assessment biological mechanism clinical relevance identify patient may benefit ACE inhibition . While focus study novel cardiovascular risk factor , result may also future implication develop new indication ACE inhibitor , , example , prevention age-related muscle waste physical disability older person , inflammation may causal factor .</detailed_description>
