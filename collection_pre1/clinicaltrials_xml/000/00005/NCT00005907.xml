	<brief_summary>This study compare immune system response booster vaccine tetanus/diphtheria hepatitis B healthy volunteer patient blood transplant . ( A blood transplant infusion donate stem cells-i.e. , cell mature white blood cell , red blood cell platelet ) . The study also look age blood cell donor recipient , type blood transplant , amount certain type white cell donor blood , variable may influence vaccine response among transplant patient . This study include normal volunteer patient blood transplant . Healthy volunteer age 18 60 previously vaccinate hepatitis B tetanus/diphtheria vaccine hepatitis B may eligible study . Patients enrol blood cell transplant study NIH 5 60 year old , vaccinated tetanus/diphtheria , hepatitis B may eligible . Candidates screen medical history blood test . Those enrol study 2 tablespoon blood draw vaccination standard tetanus/diphtheria booster shot . Volunteers previously vaccinate hepatitis B vaccine blood transplant patient also receive hepatitis B vaccination . Participants blood drawn ( 1 5 tablespoon ) week vaccination 8 week evaluate immune response vaccination .</brief_summary>
