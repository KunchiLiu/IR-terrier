	<brief_title>Lipoprotein Subfractions Coronary Heart Disease During 25 Year Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prospective epidemiologic study cholesterol , blood pressure , cigarette use provide much evidence link establish risk factor coronary heart disease , example Framingham Study , Western Electric Study , Chicago Peoples Gas Company Study . Concurrent well known study , effort Dr. John Gofman measure lipoprotein subfraction concentration 2,880 male female employee Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , establish prospectively association HDL2 , HDL3 , LDL , IDL , small VLDL large VLDL coronary heart disease . After 10 year follow-up , Dr. Gofman present finding Lyman Duff Memorial Lecture October 13 , 1965 . The finding subsequently publish Circulation 1966 . He report increased risk coronary heart disease association high serum mass concentration LDL , IDL , small VLDL low concentration HDL2 HDL3 . This pioneering effort Dr. Gofman precede recognition importance lipoprotein subfractions nearly decade , detailed statistical analysis follow-up cohort defer indefinitely . Most importantly , 1952 Gofman use essentially methodology measure lipoprotein subfractions practice 1988 Donner Laboratory numerous in-house collaborative study include study atherosclerotic progression Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project , effect exercise weight loss lipoproteins Stanford Exercise Training Study Weight Control Projects , metabolism genetic transmission part Donner Laboratory NIH program project entitle Lipoprotein Subclasses : Structure , Origin Metabolism . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Serum lipoprotein subfraction concentration measure 1,961 men 423 woman employ applied employment Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 1954 1957 . Computer file create Dr. Gofman Donner Laboratory epidemiologic study lipoprotein fraction . The file include name , age , gender follow medical information : cholesterol , lipoprotein subfraction concentration , blood pressure , weight , smoke history , hemoglobin , red white blood cell count , blood protein . Dr. Gofman provide computer file study . The vital status history coronary disease cohort determine state national mortality surveillance system , public record , medical hospital record , autopsy report , telephone interview cohort member . All medical document examine physician endpoint assign accord international diagnostic criterion . The data use extend Dr. Gofman 's initial study 10 30 year follow-up . Survival analysis use assess independent contribution specific lipoprotein subclass coronary disease control risk factor . Other issue examine whether HDL2 HDL3 show different relationship coronary disease , whether relationship lipoprotein subfractions coronary disease independent establish risk factor , whether measurement lipoprotein subfraction concentration offer significant improvement total cholesterol predict coronary disease risk . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
