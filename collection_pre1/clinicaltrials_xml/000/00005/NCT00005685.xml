	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Control -- Racial Psychosocial Influences</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Environmental psychosocial factor relate hypertension cardiovascular disease incompletely understood , particularly woman African Americans . Recent research suggest job strain strongly link elevated work blood pressure men woman . In contrast , combination high status job plus trait high effort cop style ( John Henryism ) relate high work blood pressure woman African American men , Caucasian men . The grant ongoing since September 1983 . The original study purpose ascertain similarity difference etiology hypertension Blacks white identify biobehavioral factor contribute excess risk hypertension among Blacks . Myocardial , blood pressure , renal response ( sodium potassium handle ) laboratory naturalistic stressor evaluate young adult normotensive marginally hypertensive Black white men . Behavioral stressor include competitive , reaction time task ( active coping ) well passive cop condition . Data collect family history hypertension , family social class background , Type A behavior , propensity anger hostility , cop style . The role sympathetic nervous system mediate effect assess use beta-adrenergic antagonist . When grant renew 1991 , goal research evaluate interactive effect environmental stressor sodium chloride ( NACl ) potassium ( K ) intake relate hypertension development biracial population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There two study current grant . Study 1 reexamine hypothesize relationship high effort cop job strain elevate ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) work home sample 288 Black white men woman stratify job status . Also , assessment make relationship trait increase epinephrine norepinephrine response , measure sympathetic activation , adverse lipid profile , cardiac vascular structural change . Job strain high effort cop also relate hypertension prevalence 576 black white men woman stratify job status . The influence additional psychosocial variable ( social support , hostility , anger-in , depressed mood , anxiety ) also examine . Study 2 build prior research gender difference total peripheral resistance stressor enhance alpha-adrenergic activity , recent observation among young adult , slow sodium excretion stress see five time many men woman . It also build recent work suggest estrogen may attenuate total peripheral resistance response stress reduce vasoconstrictive effect alpha-adrenergic activity . The study design examine cardiovascular , lipid , epinephrine , norepinephrine , sodium excretion response stressor 120 subject maintain week control high salt diet . Thirty subject test group : 1 ) premenopausal woman , 2 ) postmenopausal woman use hormone replacement therapy , 3 ) postmenopausal woman use hormone replacement , 4 ) men . Each group include 15 Black 15 white subject , subject test twice , receive placebo receive either alpha- beta-receptor antagonist . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
