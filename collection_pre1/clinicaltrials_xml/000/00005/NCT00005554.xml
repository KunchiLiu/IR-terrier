	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure increasingly use treatment coronary artery disease , approximately 300,000 intervention perform year . Despite new development cardiology intra-coronary stent anticoagulant pharmacological treatment , major problem remain frequent occurrence coronary restenosis new cardiac event within six month intervention . These adverse outcome occur one four patient substantial impact cost medical care patient ' quality life . Research indicate hemostatic factor ( e.g. , fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor , plasminogen activator inhibitor ) promote formation blood clot factor predict coronary restenosis . Moreover , prior longitudinal study also demonstrate psychosocial trait hostility depression affect clinical progression coronary disease . These psychosocial factor significantly predict adverse long-term outcome revascularization hostility depression know affect blood clot factor . In addition , acute mental physical stress report affect blood clot factor ( coagulation fibrinolysis ) responses stress report pronounced hostile individual . However , previous research predictor adverse clinical outcome percutaneous coronary revascularization examine stress-induced change hemostatic factor consequence response progression coronary artery disease . Therefore , study investigate whether psychosocial factor response acute mental stress affect measure blood clot process involve progression coronary disease , thereby increase risk adverse prognosis follow percutaneous coronary revascularization . This study may improve identification patient risk recurrent cardiac event provide understand pathophysiological mechanism involve progression coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study investigate whether psychosocial factor response acute mental stress affect measure blood clot process involve progression coronary disease , thereby increase risk adverse prognosis follow percutaneous coronary revascularization . This study help improve identification patient risk recurrent cardiac event provide understanding pathophysiological mechanism involve progression coronary artery disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
