	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . AE-941 may help shrink slow growth non-small cell lung cancer cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy effective without AE-941 non-small cell lung cancer . This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy radiation therapy give AE-941 see well work compare combination chemotherapy radiation therapy alone treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy With Without AE-941 Treating Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival patient unresectable stage IIIA IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treat induction platinum-based chemotherapy radiotherapy without AE-941 ( Neovastat ) . II . Determine progression-free survival , tumor response , tumor response duration , metastasis-free survival patient treat regimen . III . Determine tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord stage ( IIIA v IIIB ) , type platinum-based induction chemotherapy receive ( cisplatin vinorelbine v carboplatin paclitaxel ) , gender . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral AE-941 ( Neovastat ) twice daily begin day 1 within 10 day initiation chemotherapy . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily begin day 1 within 10 day initiation chemotherapy . All patient receive induction chemotherapy 1 follow platinum-based regimen : cisplatin IV day 1 , 22 , 50 , 71 vinorelbine IV day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 , 50 , 57 , 71 , 78 carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 , 22 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 . All patient receive radiotherapy begin day 50 6 week . Treatment arm continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 756 patient ( 378 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 36 month .</detailed_description>
