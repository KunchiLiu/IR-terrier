	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although consumption trans-fatty acid hydrogenate fat consistently show elevate concentration total LDL cholesterol , effect HDL-c Lp ( ) inconsistent , especially fat consume moderate level . In addition , little known mechanism trans-fatty acid increase total LDL cholesterol level may alter atherogenecity lipoprotein subfractions . The study intervention employ commonly use hydrogenate fat wide range trans-fatty acid level ( 1.5-9.8 percent ) . The impact assess within guideline currently recommend individual moderately elevate plasma level dietary modification often first approach treatment . The result study may lead improve public health recommendation concern trans-fatty acid hydrogenate fat intake . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Forty subject ( 20 male , 20 female ) age 50 older , LDL cholesterol concentration great 130 mg/dl feed five diet eight week period . The baseline diet consist 36 percent energy fat ( 15 percent saturate , 15 percent monosaturated , 6 percent polyunsaturated ) 160 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal . The experimental diet contain 30 percent energy fat , 2/3 derive following : 1 ) unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil , 2 ) soybean oil margarine tub form , 3 ) commercial shortening , 4 ) butter randomize double blind , cross-over design . With exception experimental fat , food reduce fat diet identical . The study assess impact consume diet enrich hydrogenated fat ) plasma lipid lipoprotein concentration , b ) apolipoproteins A-1 B Lp ( ) concentration , c ) parameter relate HDL cholesterol [ particle size , composition , subfraction distribution ( HDL2 HDL3 , HDL without A-II ) ] , ) susceptibility LDL oxidation , e ) activity lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) cholesterol ester transfer protein , f ) rate endogenous cholesterol synthesis . The study renew FY 2000 ass impact new approach dietary modification intent reduce risk develop cardiovascular disease . The specific aim study follow : 1 ) ass impact substitute two class fat specifically formulate substitute hydrogenate fat ( i.e. , trans-free margarine genetically modified/selectively breed oil ) serum lipid level ( total , VLDL , LDL , HDL , HDL2 HDL3 cholesterol ; triglyceride ; apo A-l B ; Lp [ ] ) , immune function , prostaglandin level , 2 ) address unresolved issue relate plant sterol , include relative efficacy currently available preparation , impact fat cholesterol content diet , effect dose frequency serum lipid , endogenous cholesterol synthesis , cholesterol absorption , fat soluble vitamin level . Study subject old ( 50-75 ) hypercholesterolemic female male subject ( LDL cholesterol 130-160 mg/dl ) . Each 5-week diet phase schedule randomized order ; food drink provide . In Part 1 , Study 1 , subject consume 3 diet ( 30 percent fat [ 2/3 experimental fat ] , 80 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal ) follow experimental fat : conventional soft margarine ; trans-free margarine ( interesterified palm kernel + liquid oil ) ; trans-free margarine ( fully hydrogenate soybean oil + liquid oil ) . In Part 1 , Study 2 , subject consume 6 diet ( ) follow experimental fat : hydrogenate soybean ( shorten ) , high oleic sunflower , high oleic soybean , high oleic canola , low saturate soybean low linolenic soybean oil . In Part 2 , Study 1 , subject consume 4 diet ( 38 percent fat [ 15 percent SFA , 14 percent MUFA , 6 percent PUFA ] , 200 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal ) , baseline following : sitostanol ester ; sitostenol ester , genetically modify high sterol oil . In Part 2 , Study 2 , subject consume 4 plant sterol enrich diet , high fat ( ) high ( 200 mg ) low ( 80 mg ) cholesterol/1000 kcal , low fat ( 20 percent fat [ 5 percent SFA , 7.5 percent MUFA , 7.5 percent PUFA ] ) high low cholesterol . In Part 2 , Study 3 , effect dose regime assess use efficacious plant sterol identify Study 1 diet Study 2 ( single bolus 3 divided dos ) .</detailed_description>
