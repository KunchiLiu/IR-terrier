	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascribe variety host-environmental characteristic -- cigarette smoking , modern-day dietary practice , abnormal blood lipid blood glucose pattern , obesity , psychosocial factor , genetics , etc . -- together decline vigorous job activity mechanization related development industry transportation . To extent job assignment limit exercise opportunity , leisure-time physical activity may increase importance control reduction coronary heart disease . There need determine level , frequency , intensity exercise exist modern American lifestyle -- particularly trend exercise enthusiasm , change period increase decrease cardiovascular incidence 1912-1967 1968 date , respectively . There need know physical demand human body essential maintain cardiac vascular well-being successive age group , include old age , conversion sedentary active lifestyle mean betterment detriment man 's health . The present study begin intramural project National Heart Institute 1961 continue date , become extramural project 1968 . Approval receive NIH university concern use baseline data collect college physical examination , social athletic record male student examine Harvard University 1916-1950 University Pennsylvania 1931-1940 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This longitudinal study begin 1984 built college data entrance physical examination , social athletic record 1916-1950 , self-assessed mail questionnaire response six occasion 1962-1980 death certificate 1916 date . A seventh lifestyle health questionnaire send live alumni 1988 . Exercise finding gather former questionnaire convert physical activity index basis estimate energy output rating express kilocalorie per unit time kilocalorie per kilogram per unit time . The 1988 questionnaire preserve comparability earlier observation allow assessment endurance , body weight , standard caloric value specific physical activity , intensity frequency effort . It felt distinction would aid attempt devise exercise prescription men differ age condition health . To obtain current historical medical data alumnus , permission request study subject contact personal physician . Results physical examination complete staff 1962-1965 provide personal physician study subject . Similar result provide personal physician alumni undergo treadmill clinical testing 1988 . The study renew 1996 order : refine extend observation continuity change physical activity relation cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity mortality , functional capacity quality life , longevity ; direct special emphasis type , intensity , duration , time exercise distinguish effect light , moderate , vigorous activity health . In accomplish aim , confound , interaction , trend relation personal characteristic health habit take account . Resources study include : 1 ) college student data 1916-1950 collect health , social , athletic record ; 2 ) contemporary alumnus ( ae ) data collect eight occasion , 1962-1993 , mail questionnaire pertain physician-diagnosed disease , physical exercise , cigarette smoking , body size shape , diet , alcohol consumption , life way element , family disease pattern ; 3 ) annual cause-specific mortality certification , 1916-1998 . Anticipated death ( 1989-1998 ) CHD approximate 5,500 ; stroke , 1,000 ; cause , 14,500 . Non-fatal CHD stroke event increase already large number substantially . Using prior redefined definition physical activity , investigator direct attention continue altered exercise pattern , increase decrease energy expenditure , 1960s 70 , 70 80 , 80 90 relation 1998 incidence non-fatal fatal CVD , quality-adjusted year life remain . Statistical power detect relation exercise CVD considerable alumnus , although weak alumna . Special effort make collect data woman Pennsylvania cohort . The study end June , 2000 .</detailed_description>
