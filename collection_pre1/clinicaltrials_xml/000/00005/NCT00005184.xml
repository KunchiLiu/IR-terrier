	<brief_title>Immunogenetic Factors Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although familial cluster coronary heart disease well document , unclear whether familial clustering explain share environmental factor member family cluster risk factor genetic component blood pressure , familial hyperlipidemia and/or diabetes . Studies indicate family history coronary disease may independent risk factor . Major histocompatibility complex genetic marker identify individual risk within family may useful . In 1985 study begin , paucity data deal interrelationship family history , genetic marker , immunological marker , traditional risk factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In case-control study , study population consist incident case present Georgia Heart Clinic La Grange , Georgia coronary heart disease . The majority subject three county mideastern Alabama county midwestern Georgia . All subject undergone diagnostic coronary angiography . A determination make patient control association major histocompatibility complex genetic marker HLA-A , -B , -C , -DR , C4 BF , C3 , restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP 's ) flanking apolipoprotein AI insulin gene , presence autoantibody , family history coronary disease , diabetes , hypothyroidism . The frequency variable compare standard coronary risk factor family history , hypertension , lipid abnormality , lifestyle , Type A behavior , obesity disease diabetes hypothyroidism . An analysis make strength variable predict individual risk whether variable predict severity disease base 1 , 2 , 3 vessel involvement . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
