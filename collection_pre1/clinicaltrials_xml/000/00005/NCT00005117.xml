	<brief_summary>There significant evidence HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , commonly use class cholesterol lower medication , reduce risk death coronary disease . Although medicine low cholesterol level , study suggest additional effect improve blood vessel functioning . It also show consumption fatty meal temporarily alters blood vessel functioning , cause endothelial dysfunction . This study examine pravastatin , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , improve blood vessel function fatty meal . We plan enrol 32 subject , age 18-40 year , healthy history diabetes , smoking , high blood pressure , heart disease . These subject randomly assign initially receive four day pravastatin inactive substance , cross group . Blood vessel function monitor technique call flow mediate vasoactivity , use ultrasound measurement forearm artery response temporary occlusion . This primary measure flow mediate vasoactivity do consumption fatty meal . We hope show treatment pravastatin prevents blood vessel dysfunction know occur high fat meal . Secondary outcome include measurement endothelin-l , mediator blood vessel functioning , assessment change lipid profile . If pravastatin prevent endothelial dysfunction setting , could lead study use acute medical setting , include heart attack stroke .</brief_summary>
