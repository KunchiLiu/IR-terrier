	<brief_title>Prevalence Sleep Apnea Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Often sleep apnea accompany considerable morbidity ; associate excessive daytime sleepiness , cardiovascular abnormality cognitive impairment impact greatly daytime functioning . The obese , hypertensive , elderly postmenopausal woman report increased risk sleep apnea . The investigator publish prevalence sleep apnea several special population : elderly subject without sleep complaint insomniac , narcoleptic , hypertensive obese patient . They establish prevalence sleep apnea men base sleep laboratory evaluation approximately 1,000 men randomly select randomly generate telephone sample 4,364 men general population . Their preliminary estimate prevalence 2.2 percent adult male population clinically diagnosable sleep apnea . Further , male sample , age distribution linearly relate age . Rather , peak approximately age 55 . Finally , major risk factor appear obesity snoring . The difference male/female ratio clinical select population range 10.0:1 1.9:1 . One recent study suggest prevalence sleep apnea woman two-fold less men . However , study sample general population use restrict age range ( 30 60 year ) allow assessment influence menopause . Thus , prevalence sleep apnea woman general population remain largely undetermined . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In order establish prevalence woman reasonable precision , prevalence study employ two-stage sample modify prevalence study men follow two way : expand telephone sample ( N=12,219 woman ) select randomly general population evaluate , clinically relevant risk factor sleep apnea ; 2 ) second sample ( N=1,000 ) select randomly first sample base high risk sleep apnea ( include additional risk factor menopause ) evaluate sleep laboratory determine presence sleep apnea . This strategy yield adequate power order establish prevalence sleep apnea require treatment sleep disorder breathe woman general population well result large enough sample establish association risk factor sleep apnea woman . In order perform gender analysis , study compare previously publish data total 4,364 men interview expand telephone sample 741men evaluated sleep laboratory .</detailed_description>
