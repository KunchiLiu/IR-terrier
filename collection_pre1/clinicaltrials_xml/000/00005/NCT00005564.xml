	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma common costly . Neither risk factor poor outcome predictor well outcome well understood . Illness severity clearly important predictive factor asthma , may explain less variability outcome determinant , patient-perceived asthma control , asthma-related psychosocial measure , kind extent subspecialty care asthma . By quantify predictor asthma-specific quality life , functional status , service utilization , direct indirect illness cost asthma , study address major research gap secondary tertiary prevention effort . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A random sample pulmonary allergy subspecialists initially enrol 600 person asthma identify patient visit log . This establish panel complete 45 minute baseline follow-up computer-assisted telephone interview ( CATI ) ; 539 ( 90 % ) successfully re-interviewed 18 month follow-up . A supplemental sampling frame person asthma identify family practitioner complete group rhinitis without asthma . Interviews assess disease severity covariables use validate survey instrument . Pulmonary function medical record use validate severity sub-sample subject . The study extend longitudinal follow-up study initial cohort . Its analysis test predictive model asthma outcomes interest . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
