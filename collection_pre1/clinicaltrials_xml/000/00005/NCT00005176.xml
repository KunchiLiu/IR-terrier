	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Long QT Syndrome ( LQTS ) infrequently occur disorder unknown cause affect individual unusual electrocardiographic repolarization abnormality propensity syncope fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias . The first family LQTS describe Jervell Lange-Nielsen 1957 . Three sudden death occur four deaf child QT prolongation ; two child parent healthy normal hear normal electrocardiogram . The finding interpret pattern autosomal recessive inheritance . Subsequent report identify LQTS family normal hearing ( Romano-Ward Syndrome ) pattern occurrence suggest autosomal dominant inheritance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1985 , patient unaffected relative longitudinally follow multicenter study develop validate widely applicable clinical criterion stratify risk life-threatening arrhythmia . A population genetically deaf student survey identify additional family unique association Long QT Syndrome congenital deafness order expand data base genetic study recessive form disorder , Jervell Lange-Nielsen Syndrome . Pedigrees select Long QT Syndrome family record well understand inheritance dominant form disorder , Romano-Ward Syndrome . Genetic study conduct use human leukocyte antigen protein marker order investigate gene locus autosomal dominant form syndrome . A select group 30 patient 30 unaffected relative 24-hour Holter monitoring , treadmill exercise , Valsalva maneuver handgrip stress test determine patient unique cardiovascular response autonomic dysfunction . The study renew 1993 . The renewal six aim . The first examine genetic heterogeneity LQTS test Harvey-ras-1 gene linkage exist well-characterized LQTS family evidence major gene segregation analysis ; LQTS family show Harvey-ras- 1 linkage , search closely link genetic marker initiate . The second aim explore segregation analysis likelihood second gene coexist Harvey-ras-1 gene explain malignant disease process LQTS family others . The third establish normal standard six quantitative repolarization parameter healthy population ( n=4,000 ) use digitize ECG recording , biomedical statistical technique adjustment age , gender , race , heart rate . The fourth aim continue exist LQTS registry ongoing enrollment new family follow-up new exist LQTS pedigree ( n=370 family ) order provide central repository disorder , especially related natural history disorder ongoing genetic analysis . The fifth aim investigate static ( 12-lead ECG ) dynamic ( 24-hour Holter ECG ) aspects ventricular repolarization LQTS family show Harvey-ras gene linkage upgrade ECG categorization delay repolarization use Harvey-ras- 1 marker gold standard identify affect unaffected individual . The sixth aim continue prospective longitudinal follow-up study LQTS family well understand long-term clinical course disorder ; time-dependent survivorship analysis perform evaluate effect various clinical feature , repolarization severity ( QTc length ) , Harvey-ras-I gene linkage , therapeutic efficacy antiadrenergic therapy ( data permit ) outcome event rate ( syncope sudden death ) LQTS probands . The study renew several time : expand pedigree LQTS family family member enrol registry ; identify new LQTS gene mutation expand number gene-identified affected unaffected member LQTS family know gene mutation ; investigate phenotype-genotype relationship 200 genotyped family involve 1,200 affected unaffected family member regard clinical course LQTS , T-wave repolarization , trigger factor cardiac event , co-morbidity association , genotype . The study remain multicenter project six clinical center , genetic component involve four molecular genetic lab , statistical genetic component , biostatistical component , coordinate center .</detailed_description>
