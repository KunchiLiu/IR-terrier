	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The investigator hypothesize increased platelet activation coronary artery vasoconstriction exist African Americans , due great vascular endothelial dysfunction , heighten adrenergic drive , great vascular reactivity , result excess sudden death occurrence myocardial infarction people less severe angiographic coronary disease . The study one eight grant award part Request Applications `` Mechanisms Underlying Coronary Heart Disease Blacks '' . The initiative release October 1991 award September 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Previous study demonstrate high prevalence coronary disease risk factor occult coronary disease sibling population . Subjects recruit come one day screening , measurement coronary disease risk factor ( blood pressure , smoking , lipid profile , apolipoproteins B A1 , lipoprotein ( ) , blood glucose , insulin , fibrinogen ) , maximal treadmill test tomographic thallium image identify occult coronary disease . Platelet function assess spontaneous in-vitro aggregation , activate IIa/IIIb receptor density , serum thromboxane B2 concentration . Factors contribute sudden cardiac death assess echocardiogram leave ventricular mass , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) QRS late potential , 24 hour ECG monitoring ventricular arrhythmia , episode silent ischemia , heart rate variability ( assess adrenergic drive ) . Vascular reactivity characterize heart rate blood pressure change Stroop color card cold pressor test . Siblings abnormal exercise ECG and/or thallium scan offer coronary arteriography ass severity angiographic coronary disease vasomotor responses isometric handgrip intracoronary acetylcholine , endothelium-dependent vasodilator . In coronary artery minimal angiographic disease , change coronary vascular resistance handgrip acetylcholine also measure doppler flow velocity catheter proximal artery image intravascular ultrasound . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
