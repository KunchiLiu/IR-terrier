	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A study investigator show method base principle antecedent control , namely provision food participant , successful almost double weight loss twelve month period compare attained standard behavioral weight control program . These weight loss associate substantial improvement cardiovascular risk factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There several study two-center project ( R01HL41330 R01HL41332 ) . Obese subject , male female , recruit University Pittsburgh University Minnesota . The subject randomly assign one five treatment group : treatment control , standard behavioral nutrition program , standard program incentive , standard program food provision , standard program incentive food provision . The effectiveness treatment analyze assess change body weight , coronary heart disease risk factor ( lipid , blood pressure , insulin , glucose ) process variable ( eat exercise behavior , knowledge , barrier adherence ) six month interval eighteen month . The project renew April 1992 include four study . Study 1 determine whether long-term benefit food provision reexamine 202 participant original study one year end treatment . Study 2 investigate factor relate successful food provision intervention compare additive effect standard behavioral treatment three central component food provision : structure meal plan , prepackaged food subsidy food . It also explore theoretical mechanism might underlie food provision effect , specifically decision make stimulus control . Study 3 evaluate effectiveness extend food provision methodology family . Overweight spouse pair randomize treatment either one member pair participate treatment receive food , member pair participate provide food . Study 4 determine whether principle antecedent control could also apply exercise . Participants randomize weight control program include either usual exercise instruction structure plan exercise free pass exercise facility near home . It hypothesize provide food obese spouse well patient , provide antecedent control exercise structure plan free pass would improve maintenance weight loss . The study renew FY 1998 April , 2002 compare long-term weight loss achieve standard behavioral program obtain enhance exercise intervention . The exercise goal standard program 1000 kcal/week , enhanced exercise program 2500 kcal/week . The study conduct 180 subject divide equally men woman , half recruit Minneapolis half Pittsburgh . The primary hypothesis enhance exercise intervention group would significantly great weight loss standard intervention group end 18 month treatment program 30-month follow-up . In addition , two condition compare 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 30 month regard exercise level , variable might relate exercise weight loss , measure relate quality life . Furthermore , investigator attempt determine predictor long-term weight loss exercise behavior , examine effect social support exercise level weight loss enhance exercise intervention group . Include R01HL41330 R01HL41332 .</detailed_description>
