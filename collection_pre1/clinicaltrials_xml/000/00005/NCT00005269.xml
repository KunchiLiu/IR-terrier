	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension , complex disease involve interplay genetic environmental factor , affect estimate 50 million Americans major predispose factor myocardial infarction , vascular disease , stroke , renal failure . It estimate segregation analysis twin study approximately 45 percent interindividual difference blood pressure account genetic difference . The identification gene whose variant contribute high blood pressure far-reaching effect understand pathophysiology circulation may suggest new preventive measure rational therapeutic approach . One principal advantage genetic approach identifies primary molecular defect . As result , possible stratify general hypertensive population subgroup base genotype intermediate phenotype thereby evaluate preventive strategy therapeutic approach homogeneous group . In addition , identification hypertensive gene also provide basis understand interaction gene environmental factor . It likely particular environmental variable exert effect presence certain genotype . Until recently , technique dissect genetic determinant high blood pressure available developed extent would make Family Blood Pressure Program initiative feasible . However , several recent advance technology analytical method , together rapid construction genetic map , substantially improve chance detect genetic factor . The concept Family Blood Pressure Program conceive Report Expert Panel Genetic Strategies Heart , Lung , Blood Diseases . The initiative approve Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee ( AHLMAC ) March , 1993 . The genetic-epidemiological aspect approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee ( CAPAC ) February , 1993 . The Request Applications release March , 1994 . Awards make September , 1995 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : GENOA , Genetic Epidemiology Network Arteriopathy , consist network three field center biochemical genetic core lab study common polymorphic genetic variation determine individual difference blood pressure essential hypertension 1,500 sibling pair three racial group . Linkage analyse perform use extensive array candidate gene anonymous marker throughout genome . Each collaborate investigator responsible essential element network : Eric Boerwinkle genotyping linkage analysis , Robert Ferrell genotyping , Craig Hanis recruit Mexican-Americans , Richard Hutchinson recruit African-Americans , Sharon Kardia cladistic prediction analyse data management , Stephen Turner recruit Non-Hispanic white measure physiologic variable . Between 1995 2000 , network carry five specific aim localize characterize genetic determinant high blood pressure . Aim 1 use robust sibling pair linkage method 500 hypertensive sibling pairs racial group ( total 1,500 sibling pair ) localize gene influence interindividual difference occurrence essential hypertension . Aims 2 3 take advantage previously collect blood pressure intermediate predictor trait data 1,488 normotensive sibling pair Rochester Family Heart Study localize gene contribute essential hypertension . The linkage analyse ( Aims 1-3 ) use extensive array candidate gene large number anonymous marker throughout genome . Aim 4 use multiple diallelic sequence polymorphism cladistic analysis within link gene identify haplotype DNA sequence order identify candidate functional DNA sequence variation contribute interindividual difference BP level essential hypertension status . Aim 5 evaluate ability candidate functional DNA sequence variation predict essential hypertension status three racial group . The study renew September 2000 pursue two line investigation . The first identify characterize gene contribute atherosclerotic coronary heart disease use electron beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) quantify coronary artery calcification measure preclinical disease . Robust sibling-pair linkage method use determine whether 375 highly polymorphic tandem repeat marker loci span genome link gene influence EBCT measure coronary artery calcification least 500 GENOA sibships Rochester , Minnesota . Association analysis use determine whether biallelic marker DNA sequence variation candidate gene identify GENOA others influence blood pressure level diagnostic category also influence EBCT measure coronary artery calcification least 500 GENOA participant Rochester , Minnesota . The second line investigation extend analytical method ( linkage disequilibrium regression combinatorial partitioning ) finely localize positional candidate gene loci , identify gene-gene gene-environment interaction effect influence measure Family Blood Pressure Program GENOA phenotype . In next phase FBPP extend study FY 2008 , major emphasis place make Program share resource hypertension researcher United States throughout world . In Aim 1 , intestigators build , maintain update publicly available knowledge-base facilitate research non-FBPP investigator genetics hypertension , risk factor complication . In Aim 2 , use state-of-the-art genetic linkage analysis method identify additional linkage region use subgroup pedigree physiologically relevant combination phenotype aid localize hypertension gene . In Aim 3 , use combination bioinformatics , dense array SNPs , state-of-the-art data analysis follow-up region interest identify underlie hypertension gene . The region followed-up include identify current phase FBPP Aim 2 renewal phase . In Aim 4 , evaluate hypertension gene identify Aim 3 association multiple measure reflect cardiovascular renal complication hypertension , include leave ventricular mass microalbuminuria . It long-term goal FBPP hypertension genetics community develop comprehensive picture genetic architecture human hypertension , include risk factor , complication , response treatment .</detailed_description>
