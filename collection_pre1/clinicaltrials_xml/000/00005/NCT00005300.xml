	<brief_title>Investigation Selected Patient Groups From The Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease initiate 1977 determine natural history sickle cell disease birth death order identify factor contribute morbidity mortality disease . Patients study follow previously CSSCD . Follow-up newborn cohort provide data demonstrate life-threatening septicemia occur early four month age , incidence septicemia child sickle cell disease high previously report . Serial measurement pock vesiculated red blood cell determine onset splenic dysfunction . The loss splenic function characterize genotype observe pattern loss splenic function different developmentally depend sickle hemoglobinopathy syndrome . Growth retardation , become obvious around seven year age , relationship report family income . Prophylactic oral penicillin decrease morbidity mortality associate pneumococcal septicemia . The newborn infant cohort unique determine issue related natural history disease information prospective capture database . The complex database permit opportunity determine outcome , risk factor , application severity index determine spectrum severity . Follow-up over-35 cohort important long ago estimate 50 percent patient sickle cell anemia United States die twentieth birthday . However , data accumulate past eight year CSSCD demonstrate incorrect . Survival beyond age forty suggest survive patient somehow different patient high mortality earlier year . Therefore , constitute cohort special interest , reason prolong survival disease remain well document prospectively . Technology available identify genetic difference may influence survival . Based finding earlier CSSCD , Blood Diseases Resources Advisory Committee Red Cell Working Group recommend initiative approved May 1987 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Proposals release February 1988 award make October 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Follow-up newborn cohort continue order well understand severity , onset early organ damage , risk factor . Patients give entry evaluation consist interim history , complete physical examination , complete blood count , urinalysis , blood drawn haplotype determination serum bank , magnetic resonance imaging brain , pulmonary function test arterial blood gas , psychomotor test . Patients interim assessment six month annual assessment well exit assessment fourth fifth year . The exit assessment entry assessment . Follow-up over-35 cohort continue order well understand factor contribute longevity . Entry evaluation consist interim history , complete physical examination , complete blood count , urinalysis , blood drawn haplotype determination serum bank , cardiac MUGA , renal pulmonary function test . Follow-up yearly exit evaluation fourth fifth year .</detailed_description>
