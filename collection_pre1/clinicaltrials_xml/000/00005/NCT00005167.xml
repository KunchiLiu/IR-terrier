	<brief_title>Diet Modification Blood Pressure Young People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : An inadequate dietary intake calcium postulate factor development essential hypertension , long consider important development osteoporosis among woman . Furthermore , animal experiment limited study human suggest increase intake calcium may also beneficial effect blood cholesterol level . Despite limitation research data support benefit , increase calcium intake widely advocate public calcium-enriched product increasingly purchase consumed Americans . The study measure effect modest increase calcium intake , currently advocate general public . Previous work study measure effect blood pressure variation dietary intake sodium linoleic acid adolescent two New England boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy Phillips Andover Academy . During first year , din room food one school prepare 50 percent less sodium ; total intake sodium student include din hall food , outside food snack reduce approximately 35 percent . The school serve control . During second year , intervention take place second school . During third fourth year , sodium intake keep usual level change make food preparation double polyunsaturated fatty acid intake four percent eight percent dietary calorie . Food diary , duplicate food sample , 24-hour urine collection approximately 200 student school use monitor dietary modification student compliance . Weekly blood pressure measurement perform 200 student school . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A number food product modify increase dietary intake calcium average 500 mg/day . Calcium-enriched food serve alternately one school year two college . Similar product without added calcium serve alternate year . It postulate , end school year , student intervention school would lower systolic blood pressure , low blood cholesterol , increase bone density student control school . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
