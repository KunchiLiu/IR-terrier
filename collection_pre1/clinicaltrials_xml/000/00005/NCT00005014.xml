	<brief_summary>This study design determine effectiveness risperidone , drug treatment interfere symptom Autistic Disorder child adolescent age 5 17 . Between 100 120 patient participate research study five academic medical center United States . The primary aim treatment reduce impair behavioral symptom aggression , explosive outburst , self-injurious behavior , without significant side effect . A secondary aim evaluate possible improvement level social relatedness , attention , motor coordination , short-term memory . This study placebo-controlled , double-blind study ( neither investigator patient know treatment give risperidone inactive substance , placebo ) . Patients ask participate 6 8 month . For first 8 week , patient receive either risperidone placebo , randomly choose . At end 8 week , patient improve risperidone ask continue medication another 4 month . The last two month study double-blind ( neither patient investigator know treatment ) . Patients either continue risperidone treatment gradually taper risperidone ( placebo-substitution ) . This blinded discontinuation phase last 2 month patient closely monitor recurrence worsening symptom . Patients treat placebo first 8 week study improve treated risperidone . Weekly visit require first 8 week study , monthly visit follow 4 month , weekly visit last 2 month study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study compare relative safety efficacy risperidone placebo treatment child adolescents autistic disorder . HYPOTHESES : ( 1 ) Risperidone effective placebo reduce impulsive aggression , agitation , self-injurious behavior , troublesome repetitive behavior associate autism . ( 2 ) Risperidone result sedation ( transient ) weight gain placebo . ( 3 ) Patients continue risperidone significantly less likely experience exacerbation symptom irritability , aggression , agitation , stereotypy randomize placebo , measure Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) , Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale , compulsion scale Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) . ( 4 ) Patients continue risperidone would show superior adjustment function end trial , evidence low Clinical Global Impression rating , compare patient randomize placebo . Design Phase I : Double-Blind Phase - Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group design . Eight-week double-blind treatment risperidone placebo . Eight-week open trial risperidone placebo non-responders ( patient randomize placebo show improvement ) . ( Risperidone responder eligible enter four-month extension study . Placebo responders risperidone non-responders manage clinically appropriate research site . ) Phase II : Extension Study - Four-month , open treatment risperidone . Dose adjustment permit accord clinical assessment ( efficacy adverse event ) . Two-month , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled discontinuation , parallel group design . Completers four-month Extension Phase protocol maintain significantly improve status ( decrease great 25 % ABC Protocol I Baseline rating CGI much much improve ) randomize end four month placebo substitution risperidone continuation . Group assign placebo substitution undergo weekly blind reduction entry dose ( dosage end Phase I ) 25 % per week three consecutive week . After full placebo substitution , placebo group remain placebo total 5 week ( three-week taper , five-week remain placebo ) . Group assign continue active treatment maintain entry dose level full 8 week Phase II , assume behavioral deterioration . Active treatment patient may dose reduce treatment emergent effect . Randomization - Balanced within site Tanner Stage ( pre-pubertal : Tanner I II measure absence pubic hair ; post-pubertal : Tanner III great ) , gender , anticonvulsant use .</detailed_description>
