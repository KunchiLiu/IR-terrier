	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand change immune system HIV-infected patient affect risk 3 serious infection : Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis , CMV organ disease . The purpose also understand anti-HIV medicine may improve immune system patient . ( This purpose reflect change AIDS-related [ opportunistic ] infection study . ) Presently , HIV-infected patient PCP CMV disease stay lifelong therapy prevent return disease . This study try see special lab test help identify patient stop preventive therapy without another episode PCP CMV organ disease . ( This rationale reflect change AIDS-related infection study . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison HIV-Infected Patients With Without Opportunistic ( AIDS-Related ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To good understand relationship immunologic response , immune reconstitution , occurrence OIs , observational data need collect ( 1 ) patient present OI initiation potent antiretroviral therapy , ( 2 ) patient history OIs secondary prophylaxis maintenance therapy withdrawn develop OI recurrence potent antiretroviral therapy , ( 3 ) control expose pathogen interest never risk disease immunity severely compromise . Immunologic comparison may identify correlate protection group patient develop OI potent antiretroviral therapy-induced immune reconstitution . Conversely , subpopulation patient may identify lack critical host factor protection likely develop OI immune reconstitution , therefore would benefit continued prophylaxis , regardless CD4 cell count . This study consist 3 group 8 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/17/01 : 6 ] subgroup . Clinical microbiological data collect sample obtain immunologic assay ( pathogen-specific general ) group entry ( time OI presentation Group 1 patient ) 12 week ( except Group 3b ) . Group 1b patient also evaluate 24 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/17/01 : The follow text delete : time diagnosis immune-recovery vitreitis , develop ] . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/17/01 : Once patient Groups 1 , 2 , 3a complete Week 12 evaluation , off-study . ] Blood sample , 1 7 day apart , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , LPA , inducible cytokine expression interferon gamma , interleukin-2 , interleukin-4 , interleukin-10 obtain .</detailed_description>
