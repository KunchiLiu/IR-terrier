	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The potential role omega-3 PUFA intake prevention coronary heart disease support study among Greenland Eskimos , Japanese , Dutch , data Western Electric Study . The low incidence coronary heart disease among Eskimos Japanese population attribute high dietary intake fish oil . In addition , large cohort study Netherlands find inverse relationship regular fish consumption coronary heart disease mortality . Mortality coronary heart disease increase 2.5 fold among person consume fish compare consume least 30 grams/day equivalent 1-2 fish meal per week . There evidence increase fish intake 30 gram per day provide additional benefit ; moderate intake great effect coronary heart disease mortality . Dietary omega-3 PUFA intake , though modest , also inversely related coronary heart disease mortality . Analysis dietary data Western Electric Study cohort also suggest inverse relation fish consumption coronary heart disease mortality . In contrast , cohort study Hawaii Norway observe relation fish consumption coronary heart disease . However , fish consumption high population individual consume fish . Prior present study , study relation dietary fish intake risk primary cardiac arrest . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study case-control design . Beginning July 1990 , Emergency Medical Service incident report , case primary cardiac arrest , age 25-74 , without prior clinical heart disease , identify Seattle suburban King County , Washington period April 1990 March 1994 . Controls identify community use random digit dialing . Blood specimen case control analyzed determine red-cell membrane fatty acid composition . Spouses case control interview assess dietary intake long-chain omega-3 PUFAs ( function amount seafood consume ) , usual fat consumption , change dietary intake , presence absence risk factor primary cardiac arrest . Analyses conduct assess relation dietary intake red-cell membrane omega-3-fatty acid level ass whether threshold dose response effect fatty acid . The study renew 1996 June , 2000 . During initial funding period study conduct relationship primary cardiac arrest dietary intake long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid seafood . The investigator extend population-based , case-control study determine whether dietary intake trans-fatty acid derive partially hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acid measure biomarker directly associate risk primary cardiac arrest . Cases PCA attend paramedic King County , Washington identify . Demographically similar control identify community use random digit dialing . Blood specimens previously identify newly identify case ( collected paramedic field ) control analyzed red cell membrane total trans-fatty acid level . This serve biomarker dietary trans-fatty acid intake . Spouses subject interviewed obtain information usual saturate fat intake , recent change diet risk factor . Additionally , among spouse newly identify subject , type fat use cooking spread assess . Analyses focus relationship red cell membrane total trans-fatty acid level risk PCA adjust saturate fat intake risk factor . The investigator also plan extend detailed diet substudy subset control subject confirm relationship dietary intake trans-fatty acid red cell membrane level evaluate whether relationship independent nutrient . The study renew March 2006 .</detailed_description>
