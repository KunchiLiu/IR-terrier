	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : With recent advance diabetes treatment , especially evidence tight control glycemia , diminishes glycemia related complication become apparent main barrier increase longevity patient insulin-dependent ( type 1 ) diabetes mellitus long-term cardiovascular complication condition . However , development effective strategy prevent cardiovascular complication diabetes impede uncertainty relative importance pathogenesis hyperglycemia , early renal dysfunction excess level conventional risk factor . In context , research elucidate predictor cardiovascular complication diabetes well-characterized population follow long term potential considerable clinical public health importance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study population-based , longitudinal , cohort study determine prevalence incidence rate cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality people Type 1 diabetes long duration . The mean age cohort long duration diabetes provide opportunity document prevalence incidence coronary heart disease , myocardial infarction , angina , congestive heart failure , stroke , transient ischemic attack , peripheral vascular disease cardiovascular disease mortality large population-base group person Type 1 diabetes . Standardized protocols exam interview use baseline , 4- , 10- , 14-year follow-up exam . Retinal photograph study participant take baseline examination . This permitted investigator test predictive ability focal generalize retinal arteriolar narrow arteriovenous crossing change ( i.e. , A/V nick ) subsequent macrovascular event control risk factor . These factor include blood pressure , cigarette smoking , serum lipid , body mass index , duration diabetes , glycemia . The cohort re-examined obtain ECGs , blood lipid fraction previously measure , fibrinogen , well upper low extremity blood pressure , urine specimen , medical record . This provided information silent infarction cardiographic abnormality well previously doctor-diagnosed macrovascular event long-term survivor Type 1 diabetes . Study examination perform mobile van . Participants provide two urine specimen determination urinary albumin excretion . Fasting blood obtain determination glycosylated hemoglobin A1c , blood sugar , serum cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , VLDL-cholesterol , LDL particle size , serum creatinine , fibrinogen . Additional study procedure include measurement weight height , waist hip girth , brachial ankle blood pressure . Electrocardiography also perform . A questionnaire administer . Participants subsequently interview yearly clinical hospital record death certificate collect document new cardiovascular disease event .</detailed_description>
