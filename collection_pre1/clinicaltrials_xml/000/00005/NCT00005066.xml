	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine O6-benzylguanine carmustine treat patient recurrent , metastatic , locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>O6-benzylguanine Carmustine Treating Patients With Recurrent , Metastatic , Locally Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient recurrent , metastatic , locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma treat O6-benzylguanine carmustine . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient population . III . Determine duration response , time progression , survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV 1 hour follow 1 hour later carmustine IV 15 minute . Treatment continue every 6 week minimum 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients progressive disease follow every 6 month death . Patients without progressive disease follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-35 patient accrue study within 14 month .</detailed_description>
