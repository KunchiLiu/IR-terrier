	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : CATI ( Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing ) become primary mean obtain quality epidemiological data . Its use steadily increase 1995 major technology use almost every NIH Institute . Although CATI use many year , implementation keep technological development computer . Available CATI software product deficient feature , inflexible , difficult learn use copious problem . Modern computer technology potential satisfy grow need improved product . This product application 3000 U.S. company engage public opinion market research . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Phase I investigators identified approach could use develop software ; justified choose approach ; create requirement design specification tool ; develop prototype ; produce detailed project plan implementation . In Phase II , investigator complete improved prototype software test several area</detailed_description>
