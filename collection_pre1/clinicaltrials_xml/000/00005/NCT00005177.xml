	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The treatment obesity meet limited success clinically significant weight loss difficult achieve maintain . Screening determine patient benefit treatment , emphasis maintenance weight loss understand individual weight trend goal , demonstrate significant impact long-term treatment outcome . Stunkard establish new classification obesity accord severity predict outcome treatment , distinguish mild moderate overweight severe form obesity . Those classified mildly obese likely successful traditional form treatment . A comprehensive study mildly obese population normal weight maintenance behavior provide important information build future treatment intervention and/or effective strategy . This would particular importance prevention obesity progressive escalation obese state . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects study retrospectively history prospectively natural set five year . A 2 x 2 x 5 multifactorial design use sex ( male versus female ) weight ( obese versus normal ) cross five different age group accord decade ( 20-29 , 30-39 , 40-49 , 50-59 60 year ) respectively . A total 50 ( 25 normal 25 obese ) recruit age/sex group . Dependent variable include : weight , weight trend , fluctuation , body composition ; diet ; activity exercise ; weight maintenance behavior adaptive response ; general well-being , emotional state , psychopathology ; routine blood urinalysis ; cardiovascular disease risk profile include lipid , blood pressure , sodium , potassium , calcium phosphorus level , diet , smoking , alcohol caffeine use , onset menopause change medical status medication use . Comprehensive assessment do yearly . The study renew 1992 extend follow-up evaluation RENO Diet Heart Study complete extend test primary hypothesis . The three major hypothesis test include : 1 ) weight fluctuation affect cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor weight change alone ; 2 ) weight change , fluctuation pattern interact nutritional , behavioral , psychological medical factor , factor also affect CVD risk independent weight ; 3 ) retrospective , self-reported weight , fluctuation pattern predictive prospective weight weight fluctuation . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
