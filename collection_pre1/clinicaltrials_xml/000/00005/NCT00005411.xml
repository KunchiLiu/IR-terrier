	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study contribute understanding development pattern eat exercise , focus environmental influence promote healthful life style prevent risk behavior CVD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The data set include additional measure activity nutrition preschool child well measure activity old sibling mother . The data gather home school child include self-report direct measurement activity nutrition . Additional assessment activity , lipid fraction apolipoproteins , Type A Behavior Patterns Life Stress preschool child , i.e. , target child , old sibling child 's mother add considerably complexity value data set permit additional question regard development activity , influence sibling parent development , relationship CVD risk status Type A Behavior Patterns . Hypotheses address include 1 . Activity level activity select show increase stability age preschool old Black child . 2 . The influence parental prompt family environment activity increase asymptotically age : The effect increase early childhood ; effect increase significantly old child . 3 . Older sibling 's influence target child 's behavior increase age . The target child 's CVD risk status become like old sibling 's age . 4 . Perceptions recent Life Stress rating Type A Behavior Patterns target child , old sibling , mother predispose variable positively related target child 's activity . 5 . Long-term patterns physical activity associate HDL apo A-1 target child older sibling ; effect strong old sibling . Long-term pattern target child 's nutrient intake associate his/her lipid level . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
