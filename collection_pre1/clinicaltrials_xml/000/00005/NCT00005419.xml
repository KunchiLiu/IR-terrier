	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic investigation influence physical activity incidence specific chronic disease encounter problem confound interaction eat behavior , tobacco use , social habit , host personal characteristic . These influence life style chronic disease mutually exclusive , operate independently . Rather , blend , amplify diminish effect one another . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use data collect since 1960 part College Alumni Health Study -- cohort 50,000 former student attend Harvard College , 1916-1950 , University Pennsylvania , 1931-1940 , report questionnaire health habit health status post-college year 1988 . Over 17,000 Harvard alumnus follow 1962 1988 non-fatal fatal chronic disease . These predictor ( risk factor ) outcome ( specific disease ) data analyze test hypothesis different kind amount ( frequency , intensity , duration , constancy ) physical activity affect differently incidence rate hypertension , NIDDM , CHD . Continuities change specific life style chronic disease measure continually return-mail questionnaire 1962 , 1966 , 1972 , I977 , 1988 . Cause-specific mortality monitor continuously span time , 1962-1988 . Using data , investigator compute relative attributable risk develop hypertension , NIDDM , CHD relate alumnus patterns physical activity , body size , alcohol consumption , cigarette use , personal characteristic ways-of-living . In discrete population , search relative importance physical activity potential predictor influence occurrence hypertensive-metabolic-atherosclerotic disease .</detailed_description>
