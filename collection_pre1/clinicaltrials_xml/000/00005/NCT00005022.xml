	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining one chemotherapy drug radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness radiation therapy plus combination chemotherapy treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Plus Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose thoracic radiation use accelerate boost concurrent chemotherapy patient small cell lung cancer . II . Evaluate response rate overall survival patient . III . Reduce toxic effect treatment esophagus lung . OUTLINE : This radiation dose escalation study . Patients sequentially accrue one four radiation dose level . Dose level 1 : Patients receive radiotherapy 5 day week 4 week follow radiation boost give daily 2 day , twice daily 3 day week 5 . ( Closed accrual 6/98 ) Dose level 2 : Patients receive radiotherapy 5 day week 4 week follow radiation boost give twice daily 5 day week 5 . ( Closed accrual 9/24/99 ) Dose level 3 : Patients receive radiotherapy 5 day week 18 day follow radiation boost give evening day 19 20 , twice daily 5 day week 5 . ( Closed accrual 5/5/00 ) Dose level 4 : Patients receive radiotherapy 5 day week 16 day follow radiation boost give evening day 17-20 , twice daily 5 day week 5 . The fifth dose level first dose level . ( Closed accrual 3/19/99 ) Cohorts 5 patient entered radiation dose level . If one patient experience nonhematologic dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , 5 additional patient treat level . If DLT occur , escalation next arm proceeds . Patients receive cisplatin IV plus etoposide IV day 1 radiotherapy oral etoposide day 2 3 every 3 week 4 course . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 5-10 month .</detailed_description>
