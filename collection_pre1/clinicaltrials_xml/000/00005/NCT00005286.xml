	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Sleep Apnea Syndrome consist sleep-induced disturbance breathe breathing-induced disturbance sleep . Symptoms pathologic sleepiness , less commonly , frequent awakening light sleep reflect fragmentation sleep repeat respiration-related arousal . Snoring , intermittent choking , nocturnal dyspnea reflect vary degree upper airway obstruction associate Sleep Apnea Syndrome . Observations breathe sleep show vary combination degree periodic breathing , apneas , hypoxemia . In severe case , cardiovascular complication , include systemic pulmonary hypertension cardiac arrhythmia , occur . The clinical spectrum thus vary asymptomatic patient , one chronic cardiac respiratory failure risk sudden death . Most patient disable vary degree pathologic sleepiness . The rapid increase clinical activity Sleep Apnea Syndrome create urgent need complete description condition . Clinical description derive case series severely afflicted patient . Limited epidemiologic data , however , indicate symptom objective manifestation Sleep Apnea Syndrome occur commonly population . It unknown whether subject finding unrecognized patient , premorbid individual risk , normal subject special impairment . There need define frequency sign symptom Sleep Apnea Syndrome general population , determine health effect related finding . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects recruit previous survey , Belen Health Study , conduct July 1984 November 1985 . Based data earlier survey , 421 subject identify recruitment 275 actually participate . The Belen Health Study questionnaire include item direct Sleep Apnea Syndrome . Subjects sleep study select base response initial questionnaire . For sleep study , additional questionnaire use , well new technique home monitor breathe sleep , polysomnography define prevalence symptom manifestation Sleep Apnea Syndrome . An assessment health effect Sleep Apnea Syndrome make reference demographic , socio-economic , health data Belen Health Study . Diagnostic criterion utility home monitor clinical diagnosis also determine .</detailed_description>
