	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Human Hypertensive End Stage Renal Disease ( H-ESRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although hypertension predispose factor end stage renal disease , underlie hypothesis study select African-American family genetic factor predispose develop ESRD face hypertension . An inherited basis H-ESRD support familial cluster H-ESRD among African Americans could explain socioeconomic status , access medical care , prevalence diabetes hypertension . DESIGN NARRATIVE : DNA sample collect , identify , clinically characterize African-American sib-pairs ( family member hypertensive end-stage renal disease ) . This aspect study base fact Dr. Freedman , principal investigator , already develop unique `` family history end-stage renal disease '' database independently fund End-Stage Renal Disease Network Six . This registry serve large unique collection African-American end-stage renal disease patient . He begin candidate gene approach linkage hypertensive end-stage renal disease patient sample use variety growth factor gene , gene involve sodium transport vascular tone , well human homologues rodent gene , identify future contribute ESRD organism . If initial first pas candidate gene fail demonstrate linkage hypertensive end-stage renal disease , systematic genome-wide scan perform available simple sequence length polymorphism ( SSLP ) polymorphic marker . Hypertensive end-stage renal disease condition enormous clinical economic importance identification associate causative renal-failure gene would form genetic basis detection high-risk individual assist development intervention treatment strategy prevent condition . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
