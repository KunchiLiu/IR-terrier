	<brief_title>Cardiac Arrhythmias Perception Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : One hundred seventy-five consecutive patient refer continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic ( Holter ) monitoring palpitation study . The investigator assess cardiac symptom , psychiatric diagnosis , life stress , beliefs heart disease , somatization , bodily absorption amplification . Cardiac awareness , cardiac symptom cardiac activity assess Holter monitoring exercise tolerance testing ( ETT ) . The refer physician complete instrument rating diagnostic impression clinical intervention . The patient ' clinical course follow ensue 12 month telephone interview in-person assessment . These data permit description distinguish three subgroup palpitation patient : panic disorder , symptom result sympathetic nervous system arousal ; somatizing life event cause suspect heart disease , palpitation result cognitive misattribution benign bodily sensation ; clinically significant arrhythmia , whose symptom result major cardiac irregularity . These finding use develop clinical algorithm aid differential diagnosis palpitation identify patient appropriate Holter monitoring . The patient ' longitudinal course follow determine predictor continue somatization chronicity , study medical care examine refer physician ' diagnostic impression intervention . By compare cardiac symptom concurrent cardiac activity Holter monitoring ETT , investigator hop develop measure cardiac awareness . They would able describe inter-individual difference cardiac awareness , examine several psychological factor amplify modulate awareness , investigate relationship somatization accuracy symptom reporting . It hop finding would ultimately lead improved cognitive educational technique reassure palliate palpitation patient , early identification patient unlikely obtain symptomatic relief antiarrhythmic therapy . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
