	<brief_title>Population-Based Modeling Cholesterol Lowering United States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study part Institute-initiated Request Applications ( RFA ) title `` Cost-Effective Strategies Cholesterol-Lowering '' release NHLBI 1990 . The RFA stimulate controversy concern cost cost-effectiveness follow 1987 report National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Expert Panel Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Cholesterol Adults . The RFA intend support broad thorough quantitative exploration potential health benefit cost cholesterol-lowering multiple perspective . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study add CHD Policy Model capability model consequence reduction LDL cholesterol increase HDL/LDL ratio United States population . The CHD Policy Model use several study , include : compare implication use alternative epidemiologic study basis estimate association cholesterol level CHD risk ; derive cutting point initiate cholesterol reduction , specific age , sex , CHD risk factor , base cost-effectiveness criterion ; compare cost-effectiveness specific target population-wide strategy cholesterol reduction ; incorporate effect treatment quality life , include adverse effect cholesterol-lowering drug reduction CHD morbid event ; finally , perform cost-effectiveness analysis cholesterol screening , incorporate cost screen , effect measurement error misclassification patient , variation individual cholesterol level time . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
