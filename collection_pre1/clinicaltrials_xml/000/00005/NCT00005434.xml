	<brief_title>Opioid Compromise Hypertension -- Modulating Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Opioids exert depressor effect cardiovascular response sympathetic nervous system inhibition . Research suggest opioid inhibition sympathetic activity may compromise hypertension . Preliminary study Principal Investigator suggest nature compromise may influence age race . Additionally , literature suggest hypertension chronicity may modulate opioid sympathoinhibitory action . The receptor mechanisms mediate observed modulating effect age , race , hypertension chronicity opioidergic inhibition regulation blood pressure remain determined . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Two double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study conduct evaluate effect naltrexone hydrochloride , oral opiate antagonist , adrenergically-mediated cardiovascular response old young , Black White normotensives hypertensive vary lengths hypertension duration . Cardiovascular opioid response measure response stressor combine either placebo naltrexone pretreatment . Results study assist ( ) elucidate opioidergic mechanism underlie increase rate hypertension morbidity mortality among Blacks elderly , ( b ) ultimately optimized design pharmacological intervention prevention treatment hypertension . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
