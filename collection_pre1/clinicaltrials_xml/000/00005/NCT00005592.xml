	<brief_title>Radioimmunotherapy Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy safety rituximab ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy patient refractory relapse , low-grade , follicular , transform B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 8 immediately follow IDEC-In2B8 IV 10 minute day 1 . Patients also receive ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute day 8 . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 400 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
