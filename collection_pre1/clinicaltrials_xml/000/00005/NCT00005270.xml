	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension , complex disease involve interplay genetic environmental factor , affect estimate 50 million Americans major predispose factor myocardial infarction , vascular disease , stroke , renal failure . It estimate segregation analysis twin study approximately 45 percent interindividual difference blood pressure account genetic difference . The identification gene whose variant contribute high blood pressure far-reaching effect understand pathophysiology circulation may suggest new preventive measure rational therapeutic approach . One principal advantage genetic approach identifies primary molecular defect . As result , possible stratify general hypertensive population subgroup base genotype intermediate phenotype thereby evaluate preventive strategy therapeutic approach homogeneous group . In addition , identification hypertensive gene also provide basis understand interaction gene environmental factor . It likely particular environmental variable exert effect presence certain genotype . Until recently , technique dissect genetic determinant high blood pressure available developed extent would make Family Blood Pressure Program initiative feasible . However , several recent advance technology analytical method , together rapid construction genetic map , substantially improve chance detect genetic factor . The concept Family Blood Pressure Program conceive Report Expert Panel Genetic Strategies Heart , Lung , Blood Diseases . The initiative approve Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee ( AHLMAC ) March , 1993 . The genetic-epidemiological aspect approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee ( CAPAC ) February , 1993 . The Request Applications release March , 1994 . Awards make September , 1995 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study focus attention Asian population order reduce heterogeneity genetic background . In 1995 , genetic network establish San Francisco Bay Area , Hawaii , Taiwan , recruit estimate 1,700 affected hypertensive sibpairs plus several multigenerational hypertensive pedigree Asian Pacific Chinese Japanese . Linkage analysis use map identify gene hypertension ethnic group . A new genetic map human genome 2041 order polymorphic marker average interval less 3 cM report . Such dense map polymorphic marker make plausible propose linkage analysis complex trait . A total genomic search perform 1700 affected sibpairs family member . In addition , candidate gene approach also use . To address possibility heterogeneity hypertensive trait , number intermediate phenotype study may help identify homogeneous subgroup hypertension . For example , Asians Pacific Islanders increase risk hypertension , dyslipidemia , glucose intolerance ( Syndrome X ) associate hyperinsulinemia . Therefore , hypertension investigate accord insulin sensitivity vs. resistance well intermediate phenotype relate hypertension pathophysiology renin , Ang II , endothelin . The hypothesis focus possible hypertensive subset well define phenotype , possibility enhance gene identification hypertension patient . The third approach examine hypothesis exist dominant locus determine hypertension subset affect individual use analysis multigenerational pedigree 10-13 meiosis separate affected member . If subset exist , approach would reduce likelihood heterogeneity increase probability reveal genetic linkage . Once major gene locus identify , important determine prevalence locus overall population risk associate loci development hypertension . Therefore , genetic epidemiology locus study use epidemiological methodology association study case control analysis well characterized population Hawaii Taiwan study prospectively many year . The Family Blood Pressure Program , include SAPPHIRe Network , renew FY 2000 . The Family Blood Pressure Program whole carry five specific aim renewal period . These aim group accord two complementary theme : First , investigator create analyzed database blood pressure-related phenotype genotype data FBPP participant ( Aim 1 ) . Within link region , identify allelic variation within positional candidate gene evaluate relationship polymorphism blood pressure level hypertension status ( Aims 2 3 ) . Second , use quantitative measure target organ damage identify gene influence susceptibility develop hypertensive heart kidney disease ( Aims 4 5 ) . In addition Program specific aim , network , include SAPPHIRe , carry specific aim alone , base unique aspect population interest expertise investigator . SAPPHIRe investigator refine hypertensive phenotype study population assess intermediate phenotype insulin resistance use oral glucose tolerance test steady state plasma glucose assay . They also use novel molecular genetic approach enrich genomic DNA common genetic variation develop proteomic approach identify protein differentially express plasma urine SAPPHIRe participant . In next phase FBPP extend August , 2008 , major emphasis place make Program share resource hypertension researcher United States throughout world . In Aim 1 , investigator build , maintain update publicly available knowledge-base facilitate research non-FBPP investigator genetics hypertension , risk factor complication . In Aim 2 , use state-of-the-art genetic linkage analysis method identify additional linkage region use subgroup pedigree physiologically relevant combination phenotype aid localize hypertension gene . In Aim 3 , use combination bioinformatics , dense array SNPs , state-of-the-art data analysis follow-up region interest identify underlie hypertension gene . The region followed-up include identify current phase FBPP Aim 2 renewal phase . In Aim 4 , evaluate hypertension gene identify Aim 3 association multiple measure reflect cardiovascular renal complication hypertension , include leave ventricular mass microalbuminuria . It long-term goal FBPP hypertension genetics community develop comprehensive picture genetic architecture human hypertension , include risk factor , complication , response treatment .</detailed_description>
