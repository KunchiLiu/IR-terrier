	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure blood level amprenavir ( APV ) alone , APV combine efavirenz ( EFV ) , APV/EFV combine third drug ( nelfinavir [ NFV ] , indinavir [ IDV ] , ritonavir soft gel capsule [ RTV sgc ] , saquinavir soft gel capsule [ SQV sgc ] ) . Anti-HIV therapy 3 4 drug currently recommend approach treat HIV infection . Doctors need know best dosage certain drug give combination .

	<detailed_description>Triple-drug antiretroviral regimens become recommended approach therapy HIV infection . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : The clinical use multiple-drug antiretroviral regimen contain various combination nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) become widespread approach therapy HIV infection , especially patient previously treat PIs . ] Since introduction PIs , great awareness relationship optimal suppression viral replication , genotypic resistance , viral rebound lead design potent antiretroviral drug combination . Two ACTG clinical trial address issue virologic failure utilize antiviral regimen include 2 NRTIs , 2 PIs ( one APV ) , EFV ( NNRTI ) . Although drug combination logical , limited PK data guide dose selection . This study enroll healthy volunteer obtain PK profile metabolic assessment APV/EFV addition second PI [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : APV alone , APV combine EFV , APV/EFV combine second PI ] . Upon study entry , volunteer receive APV plus EFV 2 week . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : Volunteers receive single dose APV alone Day 0 , EFV alone Days 1 10 , APV combine EFV Days 11 13 . ] After 2 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : After completion second PK visit ] , volunteer randomize 1 5 treatment arm add second PI APV/EFV drug combination 2 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : least 1 week ] . The treatment arm follow : Arm A ( control arm ) : APV EFV alone . Arm B : APV EFV plus IDV [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : APV EFV plus NFV ] . Arm C : APV EFV plus NFV [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : APV EFV plus IDV ] . Arm D : APV EFV plus RTV sgc . Arm E : APV EFV plus SQV sgc . On Day 14 , 15 , 16 , volunteer return clinic PK test follow dual-drug regimen , Day 29 , 30 , 31 follow triple-drug regimen ( continue dual-drug regimen Arm A ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : Volunteers attend clinic PK test Days 0 1 ( first visit ) , take dual-drug regimen least 3 day ( second visit , e.g. , Day 14 ) , take triple-drug regimen ( , Arm A , continue dual-drug regimen ) least 7 day ( third visit ) . ] Before PK testing , volunteer complete Adherence Questionnaire . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : The Adherence Questionnaire administer second third PK visit . ] Volunteers maintain food diary . Two three week complete drug regimen [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/4/00 : Within 2-3 week third PK visit ] , volunteer return clinic evaluation urine blood sampling .</detailed_description>
