	<brief_summary>The overall objective Center develop scientific data base control prevention acute chronic lung injury cause inhalation variety agent workplace environment . There two epidemiologic study . Respiratory Effects Exposures Irritant Gases : To collect longitudinal lung function symptom data chemical manufacturing worker expose chemical irritant ammonia , chlorine , phosgene , isocyanate , sulphur dioxide , nitrous oxide , formaldehyde , organic acid , hydrochloric acid fluoride , aldehyde , acid anhydride . Workers Cotton Textile Industry : To detect quantitate risk development chronic obstructive airway disease occur worker expose cotton dust textile manufacturing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The two project part Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Occupational Immunologic Lung Disease . Since inception 1972 , researcher SCOR conduct epidemiologic study asbestosis , silicosis sandblaster , respiratory reaction worker expose detergent enzyme polyvinyl chloride film fume . Irritant gas vapor utilized herbicide , pesticide , pharmaceutical , household cleaner , explosive , fertilizer , refrigeration , plastic , paint , fumigant variety product . These chemical produce use immediately shipped end-users . The potential chemical accident great . A report Environmental Protection Agency estimate 6,928 chemical accident occur United States since 1980 , average five accident day . As result , 1,500 people injured 135 kill . More information need consequence chemically-induced sublethal acute lung injury long term outcome chemical vapor/gas specific injury order differentially treat exposure chemical . Byssinosis recognize respiratory disorder associate cotton dust exposure two century . This respiratory disorder characterize clinical symptom bronchoconstriction work week periodicity later decline lung function work shift , mark follow absence job . Byssinosis risk probably influence length exposure type mill textile mill , cottonseed oil crushing mill , gin mill . Prevalence seem influenced age , sex , race . This study attempt answer question whether long-term exposure cotton textile dust lead clinically important pulmonary functional impairment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Respiratory Effects Exposures Irritant Gases Vapors : Workers fill respiratory questionnaire underwent spirometry test plant baseline follow-up every one two year five-year period . Initial total IgE measure 20 percent sample determine ability detect longitudinal change lung function whether mediated immunoreactivity . In worker exposed chemical spill , determination make short-term , high level chemical exposure without lung injury short-term , high level chemical exposure lung injury affect lung function longitudinally affect acquisition respiratory symptom . In injured worker match control group , spirometry perform immediately , two week , six week , one year episode . In week acute injury , circulate biochemical indication cell tissue injury measure . Total specify IgE measure injury compare baseline measurement . The longitudinal study two component . In first , Tulane SCOR investigator collect pulmonary function , respiratory health , immunologic , industrial hygiene data 300 worker nine textile plant ( six cotton three synthetic ) comparison company 's data . In second component , Tulane investigator work closely participate company insure quality data company collect respiratory health surveillance program worker nine plant . Data collect sex , race , smoking , age , atopic status , degree bronchoconstriction response cotton dust exposure measure Monday shift change FEV1 , length employment , past current exposure cotton dust , job type , grade cotton process , geographical location plant , bacterial contamination cotton . Lung function test conduct annually five year obtain pre- post-shift spirometric data . Data available company 's dust measurement past ten year . Dust measurement make study reconstruct complete exposure profile various job title production area total period employment worker participate study . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
