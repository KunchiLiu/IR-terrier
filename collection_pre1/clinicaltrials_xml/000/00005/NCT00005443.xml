Analyses evaluate whether different magnitude class-based difference health characteristic detect diverse measure social class , use multivariate technique correct correlation error within twin pair . The effect use different class measure also examine analysis test hypothesis social class inversely related risk hypertension among woman , adjust relevant covariates . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
