	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Dramatic advance medical interventional treatment clinically overt CHD contribute substantially , perhaps predominately , decline past three decade CHD mortality occur despite relatively unchanged rate myocardial infarction . By analogy , attractive assume substantial benefit could also give individual significant asymptomatic coronary artery disease could accurately diagnose . In context , research determine whether non-invasive method like EBCT sufficient independent predictive value CHD event play useful role process potentially considerable clinical public health importance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Follow-up 5,400 woman 12,600 men average 2.75 year approximately 15,000 woman-years 35,000 man-years observation available analysis June 30 , 2000 . An important strength study self-reported key health variable baseline study participant . In addition , objective measure blood pressure , total cholesterol , HDL- cholesterol , triglyceride , plasma glucose , rest exercise electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , maximal health rate , cardiorespiratory fitness , clinical biochemical measurement available half participant . CAC EBCT associate prevalent CHD incident CHD recent small prospective study . However , unclear whether CAC predictive MI CHD death , currently available study individual evidence hard CVD endpoint . The large cohort CAC measurement provide power investigate association CAC CHD morbidity , stroke , all- cause mortality term thresholds dose-response effect . Exercise test result measure conventional CHD risk factor , include several health behavior biochemical marker , available 50 percent participant . This allow evaluation separate independent predictive value CAC exercise test result combination two exposure relation study outcome . Furthermore , CAC score , exercise test result , presence conventional risk factor use together identify participant high risk develop CHD outcome .</detailed_description>
