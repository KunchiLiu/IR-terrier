	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiac tachyarrhythmias refractory either conventional experimental antiarrhythmic therapy , antitachycardia pacemaker , , may result serious symptom death . Catheter ablation develop nonpharmacologic , closed-chest alternative management patient . The technique first apply man 1981 report Scheinman et al Gallagher et al 1982 . Hartzler report first catheter ablation procedure treatment ventricular tachycardia 1983 . In year , Weber report first use catheter ablation accessory atrioventricular pathway . The standard method energy delivery closed-chest catheter ablation attempt involve direct current deliver use defibrillator , begin 1985 , radiofrequency energy employ man . This promised revolutionize field catheter ablation , offer hope precise destruction tissue , avoid need general anesthesia significantly lower complication rate , since involve level energy use direct current attempt . The Catheter Ablation Registry ( CAR ) evolve pilot study , Percutaneous Cardiac Mapping Ablation Registry ( PCMAR ) form 1983 . There scientific limitation voluntary registry . Further prospective study need well define procedure , multicenter international prospective cohort study design allow rapid assessment ablation 's danger potential usefulness . Results study use guide physician patient would would benefit new procedure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Data collect prospectively sixteen clinical center United States Europe attempt catheter ablation atrioventricular junction , accessory atrioventricular pathway ventricular tachycardia . Each three ablation technique study separate subset two method energy delivery , direct current radiofrequency energy , compare within subset . A standardized protocol use direct current ablation result variety protocols two procedure radiofrequency energy observe . Patients evaluate quarterly first post-procedure year , biannually subsequent duration study . Statistical analysis perform determine distribution specific patient characteristic age , sex , clinical status , underlie heart disease , variety procedural category include energy level , map data , catheter position . A determination make frequency successful outcomes include cessation arrhythmia , production third degree atrioventricular block , disappearance symptom adverse effect , include procedure-related complication death . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
