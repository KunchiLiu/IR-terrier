	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent research show sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) much common previously think . While know clinic sample , SDB associate hypertension , cardiovascular disease mortality , little known natural history disorder , particularly general population , causal role know risk factor . The knowledge obtain result study help advance field sleep disorder medicine . Information longitudinal effect causal relationship may apply clinical situation , thus reduce morbidity mortality associate disorder . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In longitudinal study , follow-up polysomnography protocol conduct establish cohort men woman ( age 30-60 year time initial recruitment 1989 ) , currently enrol Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study . The study aim : 1 ) describe natural history SDB across middle old age ; 2 ) investigate association SDB early intermediate marker cardiovascular dysfunction , damage , cardiovascular disease ; 3 ) investigate longitudinal association SDB accelerate cognitive decline ; 4 ) investigate association SDB adverse sleep characteristic age-related risk factor outcomes .</detailed_description>
