	<brief_title>Epidemiology Insulin Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate Coronary Heart Disease Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1972 , Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial begin recruit 12,866 men , age 35 57 , select elevation one risk factor free coronary heart disease follow average seven year randomization risk factor modification group control group refer physician treatment . The serum MRFIT store since 1972 . Detailed follow-up cohort complete 1985 extended 1988 use National Death Index . The role insulin major risk factor atherosclerosis resurface 1980s subject much research basic science , clinical , epidemiological level . The MRFIT serum data base probably remain serum bank United States could test relationship insulin level coronary heart disease mortality include detailed measurement major cardiovascular risk factor , well baseline two-hour post-load glucose level predominantly non-diabetic population . DHEAS abundant circulate steroid hormone man readily convert DHEA potent non-competitive inhibitor glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , rate limit enzyme pentose cycle . Several study suggest key role DHEAS obesity , lipid metabolism , cellular proliferation , atherosclerosis . Barrett-Connor 1986 report low level hormone risk factor cardiovascular disease men . Other study report administration DHEAS laboratory animal appear delay age , prevent obesity , low serum cholesterol level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A nested case-control study conduct use store blood serum . Laboratory measurement do blindly without knowledge whether specimen case control . Insulin measure 600 specimen . DHEAS measure 200 case 100 control . The mean distribution insulin DHEAS level compare case control . The analysis do separately coronary heart disease death survive myocardial infarction case , difference case group , pool comparison control . The relationship determine among potential confounders , coronary heart disease morbidity mortality serum insulin DHEAS level . This analysis also include data baseline serum cholesterol , systolic diastolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , serum thiocyanate , HDL LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , basal metabolic index , fast one-hour blood glucose . Alcohol intake , physical activity , pulmonary function , education also evaluate . The relationship among insulin DHEAS coronary heart disease morbidity mortality evaluate adjust possible confounders . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
