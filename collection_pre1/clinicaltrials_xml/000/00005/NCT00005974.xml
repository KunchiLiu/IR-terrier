	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Recurrent , Locally Advanced , Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy flavopiridol term response rate patient previously untreated metastatic locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Determine time progression , early progression rate , response duration patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour daily day 1-3 . Treatment continue every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month disease progression death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
