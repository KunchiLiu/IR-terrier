	<brief_title>Genetic Epidemiologic Studies Premature Coronary Artery Disease - SCOR Arteriosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Preliminary work project carry part Johns Hopkins Coronary Artery Disease study ( R01-HL-34791 ) provide extensive data family ascertain equal number white male female probands undergo elective angiography . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study , subproject within Arteriosclerosis SCOR , three component . In Component 1 , group 203 probands study R01HL34791 expand additional 50 black patient undergo angiography , meet identical criterion . In Component 2 , segregation analysis carry lipoprotein , apolipoproteins , select non-traditional risk factor family probands etiologic heterogeneity among different group family test . In Component 3 , linkage test putative Mendelian locus define Component 2 marker around candidate locus involve lipid metabolism . Preliminary result provide evidence Mendelian control apolipoprotein A1 B , candidate locus examine include apo B , lipoprotein lipase , A1-CIII-A4 gene cluster . The major hypothesis apolipoprotein level non-traditional risk factor might genetic control . Genetic analysis risk factor use direct molecular study identify specific mutation . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
