	<brief_title>Familial Aggregation Stress Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Given recent advance analyse genetic epidemiologic data , database present unique opportunity address timely issue pertinent contribution genetic environmental factor individual difference cardiovascular reactivity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Secondary data analysis perform family data obtain ongoing hypertension genetic study conduct University Utah Roger R. Williams principal investigator . The available data represent one large study cardiovascular reactivity among genetically relate individual . During 1981-83 , total 2,548 subject , member 98 extended family ( multiple generation multiple nuclear family ) participate extensive cardiovascular examination assess comprehensive battery cardiovascular test . Annual follow-up questionnaire obtain information onset hypertension new medication prescribe . In 1991-92 , follow-up exam conduct 1,500 subject . The data analysis attempt confirm refute hypothesis postulate reactivity-hypertension association ; investigate whether sex limitation genetic environmental determinant reactivity ; explore genotype-by-age interaction control reactivity ; determine whether share genetic and/or environmental variance reactivity recognize cardiovascular risk factor obesity lipid . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
