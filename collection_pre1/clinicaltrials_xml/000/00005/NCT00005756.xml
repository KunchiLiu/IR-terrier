	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This ancillary study Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) DESIGN NARRATIVE : Continued annual telephone follow-up remain 178 Pittsburgh SHEP participant 168 control conduct . A final clinic visit include measure coronary aortic calcification use electron beam compute tomography ( CT ) , pulse wave velocity measure aortic stiffening cognitive function test . For Pittsburgh SHEP cohort , antihypertensive treatment effect striking event rate active placebo group continue diverge beyong end SHEP . Successful demonstration treatment effect coronary calcium score would first randomize data show antihypertensive effect directly coronary artery . Risk factor coronary calcification evaluate , produce data type yet available literature old adult collect ongoing study elderly . The added measure vascular stiffness supplement extensive data subclinical atherosclerosis already available cohort . The extent measure predict cardiovascular event evaluate . The study renew July 2006 . Since hypertension age associate cognitive impairment vascular dementia , SHEP participant assign placebo group expect low cognitive function compare assign active treatment . Among hypertensive normotensive group , low cognitive function among evidence subclinical atherosclerosis expect . Finally , member cohort originally normotensive study entry develop systolic hypertension . These subject allow prospective evaluation risk factor systolic hypertension . Continued study cohort 80 provide unique data risk etiology systolic hypertension , efficacy treatment prognostic value number measure subclinical atherosclerosis . It predict result directly applicable large grow segment U.S. population .</detailed_description>
