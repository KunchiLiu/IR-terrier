	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : To improve strategy detection prevention early-stage disease . PURPOSE : This research study collect specimen data develop good method early detection prevention ovarian cancer among high risk population disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specimen Data Study Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify develop highly sensitive specific tumor marker detection management ovarian cancer gynecological malignancy . - To identify new prevention approach therapy . - To identify measure improve quality life woman increase risk develop disease woman diagnose ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : Subjects undergo periodic specimen data collection research study , include molecular , biochemical , functional , genetic marker study . Participants may sample blood , tissue , body fluid ( ascites , pleural fluid urine ) , combination aforementioned sample obtain develop tumor marker detect early stage recurrent ovarian cancer . The result biomarker research study report patient physician . In future , experimental tumor marker find effective detect early stage ovarian cancer , patient 's result abnormal , patient physician notify . Subjects may ask complete combination questionnaire design evaluate psychological functioning among woman enrol comprehensive ovarian cancer early detection program increase risk develop disease compare woman currently diagnose ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
