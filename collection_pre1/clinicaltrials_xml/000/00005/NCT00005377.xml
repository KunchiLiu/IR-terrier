	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Essential hypertension reach epidemic proportion among adult significant risk factor premature coronary artery disease [ CAD ] stroke . The research localize BPQTGs represent initial step toward apply DNA information early identification at-risk individual understand complex relationship among blood pressure , essential hypertension , coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study four aim . Aim 1 us robust sibling pair linkage method , parental marker data , office blood pressure level measure 1,376 full sibling pair localize BPQTGs region human genome mark highly polymorphic tandem repeat locus near 59 gene involve blood pressure regulation . These gene select base involvement renin/angiotensin system , ion transport , cardiac physiology , biometabolism neurotransmitter , carbohydrate lipid metabolism . At gene , highly polymorphic tandem repeat marker locus already identify . Aim 2 us method association analysis relate individual office blood pressure level measure 587 full sibships localize BPQTGs region human genome mark 59 candidate BPQTGs . Aim 3 determines variation BPQTGs improve ability predict difference blood pressure level sample 1,166 unrelated normotensive adult essential hypertension status sample 1,160 unrelated grandparent beyond provide established predictor . Aim 4 determines variation BPQTGs improve ability predict symptomatic asymptomatic coronary artery disease status beyond provide established predictor include blood pressure essential hypertension . Aims 3 4 also ask whether predictive relationship traditional risk factor blood pressure , essential hypertension , coronary artery disease different among genotype BPQTGs . The study renew FY 1999 continue data analysis .</detailed_description>
