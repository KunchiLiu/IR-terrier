	<brief_title>Pulmonary Hypertension -- Mechanisms Family Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH ) serious disease unknown cause small artery lungs become obstructed . Mean survival less three year , woman develop PPH twice commonly men . It familial ( FPPH ) 6 percent case . The National FPPH Registry establish 1994 collect analyze family history clinical data PPH family well characterize disease phenotype well identify underlie genetic etiology . Through collection 72 family , FPPH show inherited autosomal dominant disorder , incomplete penetrance genetic anticipation . Micro-satellite marker study six family identify linkage chromosome 2q31 without evidence genetic heterogeneity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study establish national registry familial PPH ( FPPH ) . The primary goal family registry establish expand database FPPH pedigrees definitively establish mode inheritance FPPH , initial segregation analysis suggest autosomal dominant . The FPPH family registry provide framework linkage analysis molecular search basic mechanism PPH . The investigator develop tissue bank specimen ( DNA transform lymphocyte ) family patient pulmonary hypertension , investigation national resource interested investigator . Their search use three different approach investigate FPPH gene locus . First , perform karyotyping high resolution chromosome study search chromosomal translocation , interstitial deletion , inversion , find would implicate specific gene locus . Second , pursue propose association human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) tissue type familial PPH parallel attempt identify related locus perform intensify molecular search , use regional mapping study closely link marker . Finally , perform linkage analysis select PPH family informative inheritance pattern , use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) base microsatellite marker select candidate gene , include transform growth factor beta , endothelin , beta globin , HLA . An additional promising approach include search linkage FPPH gene GC-rich trinucleotide repeat , successful disease genetic anticipation , include Fragile X syndrome , myotonic dystrophy , Huntington 's disease . The study renew 1999 2003 expand registry order obtain enough PPH family localize clone PPH gene , support DNA bank study . Other goal include prospective biochemical mediator study obligate gene carrier , clinically evident PPH . This aim determine mediator first become abnormal develop PPH , define natural history pre-symptomatic disease . In addition , registry broaden scope include sporadic PPH patient , include use appetite suppressant medication , screen gene mutation .</detailed_description>
