	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Few study progression atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease perform none use objective method evaluate disease progression large number symptomatic subject . The study obvious major clinical importance . Elevated plasma homocysteine well establish independent risk factor atherosclerosis . If folate treatment result less frequent/rapid progression peripheral vascular disease , confirm first effective treatment atherosclerosis without toxic side effect involve major change life/dietary habit . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Homocysteine Progression Atherosclerosis Study ( HPAS ) long term , prospective , blind , multifactoral clinical study begin 1991 study relationship elevate plasma homocysteine ( HC ) well number risk factor PVD progression . The study divide two phase , conduct sequentially upon 400 patient symptomatic low extremity ( LED ) cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) . The first phase three year natural history study relationship progression peripheral vascular disease plasma homocysteine risk factor establish . The clinical question address natural history study : Do patient symptomatic peripheral vascular disease elevate plasma homocysteine rapid/frequent progression peripheral vascular disease patient symptomatic peripheral vascular disease normal plasma homocysteine ? Progression disease assess primary outcome variable ankle brachial pressure index degree carotid artery stenosis , determine noninvasive vascular laboratory , secondary outcome variable include vascular death , need vascular surgery , stroke , myocardial infarction , amputation , clinical event . All outcome variable determine investigator blind result plasma homocysteine testing . The second phase study , begin August , 1995 , blind , prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled trial folic acid treatment elevate plasma homocysteine patient population . Folic acid treatment demonstrate result normalization elevate plasma homocysteine . The treatment trial address clinical question : Do patient symptomatic peripheral vascular disease elevate plasma homocysteine treat folate less frequent/rapid progression peripheral vascular disease patient symptomatic peripheral vascular disease elevate plasma homocysteine treat placebo ? Although second phase describe clinical trial , Surgery Bioengineering Study Section describe clinical research , NIH-defined Phase III trial . The study renew FY 1999 2003 continue follow-up analysis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
