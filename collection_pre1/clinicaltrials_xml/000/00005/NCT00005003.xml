	<brief_summary>Some function generally control right side brain others leave . One easily observe example `` lateral specialization '' brain handedness-that , person 's preference use either right left hand . This study try determine genetic component handedness inherit . It test theory single gene involve determine handedness try locate gene . Families least two left-handed sibling age eight year old least one right-handed parent eligible participate study . The left-handed sibling parent fill brief questionnaire hand usage , obtain tissue sample take inside cheek , return questionnaire sample mail study researcher . The tissue sample use DNA gene mapping . Participants give kit instruction obtain sample , along mail envelope . Cheek swab sample basically involve use small brush gently brush layer cell inner wall cheek drop brush tip preservative . The information gain study may provide insight aspect brain development medical benefit future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol , base hypothesis human hand-use preference ( handedness ) largely dependent action single locus , collect sample allow u map `` handedness gene '' via detection linkage eight potential candidate genes/regions via whole partial genome scan . We calculate full 300 marker genome scan 100 parent sibling pair ( allow linkage analysis 10 cM resolution ) , equivalent amount data partial scan 300 family , high likelihood allow u map propose gene . Eligible family , consist pair left-handed sibling plus least one right-handed parent , identified Phase I study 1996-1998 , approval now-lapsed FCRDC IRB . In Phase II study , collect cheek swab sample DNA isolation member 100 eligible family use map study . DNA sample link back individual group random family code link database limited information , include hand use preference family structure . In next phase , wish map locus cheek swab sample hand .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Members family meet follow criterion eligible participate : Have two lefthanded sibling . Have least one righthanded parent know lefthanded first degree relative . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All member family may exclude righthanded parent lefthanded sibling participate . Individuals family whose lefthanded sibling age eight eligible participate .</criteria>
