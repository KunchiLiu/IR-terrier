	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Aplastic anemia , form bone marrow failure , disease largely unknown cause , except rare situation involve high dos radiation . Many agent mention case report associate development aplastic anemia include drug , chemical , pesticide , radiation , viral infection . Of , chloramphenicol , phenylbutazone , insecticides frequently report . In United States develop country disease prevalence low case occur make epidemiological study single city logistically feasible . The Bangkok hospitalization rate aplastic anemia sufficient conduct case-control study . Also , study conduct locale provide information drug chemical commonly use developed country . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All aplastic anemia case metropolitan Bangkok locate verified forty hospital agree participate study . Incidence rate calculate age group sex . In case-control study , interview use obtain comprehensive history drug , chemical , pesticide , radiation , viral infection , exposure , along relevant demographic medical history information order examine association test hypotheses regard suspect hazard estimate risk develop aplastic anemia . The basic epidemiologic feature aplastic anemia describe characterize patient term standard demographic variable , age , race , sex , medical history . The degree association viral hepatitis development aplastic anemia estimate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
