	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although risk factor recently associate increased risk CHD know genetically influence , none investigate large sample American family Japanese ancestry . The project represent unique timely opportunity characterize genetic epidemiology CHD risk factor among Japanese Americans . The finding could lead development effective preventive strategy target subgroups individual high risk due underlying genetic susceptibility . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In original study , several hypothesis test , include : 1 ) predominance small LDL particle ( ALP phenotype B ) , determine gradient gel electrophoresis , inherit single gene trait Japanese-American kindred compare result previous study Caucasian family ; 2 ) ALP-B associate risk factor characteristic insulin resistance syndrome NIDDM among individual Japanese-American family member . 3 ) plasma level Lp ( ) inversely associate apo ( ) size phenotype , determine high- resolution SDS-agarose-gel electrophoresis follow immunoblotting , individual Japanese-American subject , compare contrast association previously report Caucasians ethnic group ; 4 ) addition apo ( ) gene effect , segregation plasma level Lp ( ) family nherited consistent presence another single major gene effect . The study also establish repository frozen white cell future genetic study candidate gene associate risk CHD Japanese Americans . These hypothesis test base blood sample , blood pressure anthropometric measurement , questionnaire data 33 Japanese-American kindred identify participant ongoing Japanese-American Community Diabetes Study Seattle . The kindred consist 126 nuclear family 443 individual family member , include probands , sibling , spouse , offspring niece nephew full Japanese descent . In 1998 , renewal three specific aim . The first aim identify genetic influence risk factor characterize ther metabolic insulin resistance syndrome ( include fast insulin , proinsulin , C-peptide glucose ; body weight waist circumference ; lipoproteins ; blood pressure ; fibrinogen ; factor VII plasminogen activator inhibitor . Statistical genetic analysis approach use first aim include univariate complex segregation analysis , factor analysis , quantitative multivariate genetic analysis . The second specific aim test genetic linkage specific candidate gene involve lipid metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , blood pressure , obesity , hemostasis genetically influence risk factor metabolic syndrome Japanese-Americans . The third specific aim , DNA repository complete ( 750 sample end year four ) , apply NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service perform whole genome screen identify new gene involve susceptibility metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
