	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness amino acid glycine treat psychotic disorder child . The drug give adjunct ( addition ) patient 's current antipsychotic medication . Children age nine 18 schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder whose symptom begin age 13 may eligible 10-week study . Patients hospitalize course trial . Weekend visit home may permit . Children enrol study evaluate two-week pre-treatment period write test IQ academic functioning magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . For MRI , child lie table slide large donut-shaped machine strong magnetic field . This procedure produce image brain may help identify brain abnormality schizophrenia develop childhood . During eight-week treatment phase , patient receive glycine powder dissolve water day , addition antipsychotic medication . They undergo follow additional procedure course treatment : 1 . Comprehensive psychiatric examination 2 . Blood pressure pulse monitoring week 3 . Blood test every week - About one ounce blood drawn per week measure glycine level 4 . Eye movement study week eight - Using technique call infrared oculography , special detector measure infrared light reflect child 's eye watch move square video monitor . 5 . Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) study - About one-half ounce cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid surround brain spinal cord ) withdrawn needle place low part spine analysis brain chemical . Patients respond well may continue receive glycine treatment refer physician study complete . NIMH follow patient phone every six month visit two-year interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ability glycine potentiate NMDA receptor-complex , along fact well tolerate short-and long-term administration , raise possibility may provide effective treatment augmentation neuroleptic-resistant negative symptom schizophrenia . Up ten child adolescent , age 9-18 , meet DSM-IV criterion schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder psychotic disorder otherwise specify onset psychosis age 12 fail least two prior antipsychotic enter protocol current antipsychotic medication ( ) participate open 8-week trial adjunctive glycine therapy . In addition potential benefit , glycine therapy ameliorate endure negative symptom schizophrenia , anticipate recruit rare patient facilitate availability new treatment . This study provide pilot data regard beneficial effect safety adjunctive glycine therapy child adolescent treatment refractory psychotic disorder . The availability newer alternate treatment also important recruitment patient broader study neurobiology genetics early onset schizophrenia . Children adolescents age nine eighteen allow study . Subjects enter protocol new patient characterize clinical phenomenology , eye tracking , MRI brain imaging , cerebrospinal fluid , plasma urinary biochemistry , chromosomal analysis . Patients prominent mood symptom require addition mood stabilize agent lithium valproic acid allow remain medication duration treatment trial , clinically indicate . Liver chemistry check baseline end study . All first-degree relative interview person undergo eye track measurement contribute blood cell line part genetic study cohort ( 84-M-0050 ) .</detailed_description>
