	<brief_title>Diabetes Cardiovascular Risk In Mexico City ( San Antonio Heart Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The present study precede earlier San Antonio Heart Study 1 support grant . The San Antonio Heart Study 1 population-based survey diabetes cardiovascular risk factor Mexican American non-Hispanic white conduct 1979 1982 . Participants include men non-pregnant woman age 24 64 , reside household randomly sample three socio-culturally distinct neighborhood San Antonio . The low-income barrio resident almost exclusively traditional Mexican-Americans . The middle-income neighborhood ethnically balance equal number Mexican Americans Anglos whereas upper income suburb approximately 90 percent Anglo . Risk factor measure included obesity , glucose intolerance , hypertriglyceridemia , low level high density lipoprotein cholesterol , blood pressure . The total number people examine medically 2,386 , divide follow : 1,288 Mexican Americans ; 929 Anglos ; 169 Hispanics Cubans . The San Antonio Heart Study design test hypothesis Mexican Americans become progressively affluent acculturate 'mainstream ' United States culture , would gradually lose diabetic pattern cardiovascular risk factor obesity , diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1979 , random sample conduct select participant . Sampling performed match two group obesity , thereby enable analysis ethnic difference diabetes cardiovascular risk factor independent confound effect obesity . For select , interview medical examination conduct mobile clinic . The interview consist personal family history diabetes cardiovascular risk , knowledge attitude towards cardiovascular risk factor , dietary questionnaire , Rose Angina questionnaire , intermittent claudication questionnaire , medication history . The medical examination consist anthropometric measurement , plasma glucose , plasma insulin , hemoglobin , serum cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL , LDL , VLDL , genetic marker , blood pressure , skin color electrocardiogram . It estimate 400 diabetic would available four year study permit Diabetic Recall Examination . The purpose Diabetic Recall Examination ass possible end-organ complication diabetes involve eye , kidney , peripheral autonomic nervous system , peripheral vascular system . The assessment provide baseline data diabetic use prospective incidence study . Beginning 1989 , prevalence survey type II diabetes mellitus cardiovascular risk factor conduct low-income barrio Mexico City . Information collect population include demographic data , socioeconomic status , level acculturation , medical history , diet , exercise , smoking . The physical examination include measurement blood pressure , obesity , body fat distribution , skin color . The laboratory examination include measurement lipid lipoprotein , oral glucose tolerance test , fast post-glucose load insulin concentration genetic marker . Beginning FY 1989 , Michael Stern associate carry epidemiologic study type II diabetes mellitus cardiovascular risk factor low-income barrio Mexico City compare result obtain San Antonio . They recruit interviewed subject data demographic , socioeconomic status , level acculturation , medical history , health habit include diet , physical exercise , smoking . The physical examination include blood pressure , obesity , body fat distribution , skin color , latter estimate percent Native American genetic admixture . The laboratory examination include measurement lipid lipoprotein , oral glucose tolerance test determine prevalence diabetes accord National Diabetes Data Group criterion , fast post-glucose load insulin concentration , genetic marker . The study renew 1996 August , 2001 . A 3.25 year followup examination ( FU1 ) cohort 2,296 Mexican men woman , age 35-64 year baseline , complete . The cohort re-examined 3.25-year interval ( 6.5 year ( FU2 ) 9.75 year ( FU3 ) baseline ) . The investigator test hypothesis different risk factor would prevail early ( 3.25 year prior conversion diabetes ) late ( 3.25 year less prior conversion ) prediabetic period . They hypothesize early prediabetic period risk factor associate Insulin Resistance Syndrome would predominate , i.e. , high `` specific '' insulin concentration ( measure specific immunoassay ) , hypertriglyceridemia , low HDL-cholesterol , hypertension , whereas late prediabetic period factor associate insulin secretory failure , i.e. , increase proinsulin low `` specific '' insulin , would predominate . Michael Stern associate assess carotid wall thickness ultrasonography subject FU1 plan repeat FU2 . They measure advanced glycation endproduct ( AGE ) -modified apolipoprotein B panel inflammatory risk factor ( serum albumin , serum amyloid A , alpha1-acid glycoprotein , C-reactive protein ) store contingency specimen baseline FU1 order determine factor predict accelerated thicken carotid wall and/or development type II diabetes . They also quantify extent carotid wall thickness ECG document myocardial infarction precede clinical diabetes predict `` common soil '' hypothesis , i.e. , hypothesis type II diabetes atherosclerosis common genetic environmental antecedent .</detailed_description>
