	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma chronic bronchitis among common chronic disease afflict middle-aged elderly adult United States , respectively occur 4 percent 5 percent population age group . While chronic bronchitis often cause cigarette smoking asthma often occur nonsmoker association atopy , two condition may difficult differentiate many middle-aged old adult may share number pathophysiologic feature include increase airway smooth muscle tone , increase airway responsiveness bronchoconstricting stimulus , bronchial mucus hypersecretion . The precise mechanism produce alteration airway function clear . Such functional alteration may cause airway inflammation abnormality autonomic nervous system ; however , little population data available regard importance airway inflammation disorder neural regulation pathogenesis airway hyperresponsiveness mucus hypersecretion . Also , little known potential interaction airway inflammation disorder neural regulation airway function pathogenesis chronic airway disease . Information relationship may offer insight pathophysiologic mechanism underlie asthma chronic bronchitis adult . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cross-sectional use subgroup Normative Aging Study , longitudinal study age men establish Veterans Administration 1963 . The study use data normally collect NAS examination include smoke history , socio-economic status , anthropometry , respiratory symptom illness , pulmonary function . New data collect : index inflammation indicate histamine , leukotriene , serotonin urine ; autonomic activity indicate urinary catecholamine excretion heart rate variation induce deep breathing ; autonomic responsiveness measure pupillary alpha-adrenergic cholinergic response . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
