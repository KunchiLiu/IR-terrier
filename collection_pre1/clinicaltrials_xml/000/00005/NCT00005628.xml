	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy autologous tumor cell-derived heat shock protein peptide vaccine term rate complete partial response time progression patient recurrent soft tissue sarcoma . II . Determine safety tolerability treatment regimen patient population . III . Determine anti-tumor response treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : At approximately 5 week surgery , patient receive autologous tumor cell-derived heat shock protein peptide vaccine intradermally weekly 4 week . Patients receive subsequent vaccination every 2 week least 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients improve stable disease without recurrence continue therapy 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
