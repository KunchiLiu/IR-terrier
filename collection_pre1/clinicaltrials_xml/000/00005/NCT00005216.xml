	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Reports unsuspected , frequent prolong episode asymptomatic ST depression ( ASTD ) raise important issue evaluation treatment coronary disease . The traditional role angina best indicator myocardial ischemia reevaluate , since several study show ASTD much frequent symptomatic ischemia many patient coronary disease . If ASTD reflect clinically meaningful ischemia , overt angina represent 25 percent total ischemic burden . Moreover , incomplete data suggest increase clinically unsuspected risk might confer patient frequent episode ASTD . In 1988 , study already progress find effective drug treat ASTD . If increase risk associate asymptomatic myocardial ischemia , little value pursue investigation detection therapy . But risk increase , detection treatment asymptomatic well symptomatic myocardial ischemia might completely alter therapy outlook patient coronary disease . The information 1988 increase risk ASTD unfortunately scatter sparse . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 973 patient enrol two six month hospitalization acute coronary event . Patients derive geographically dispersed center enhance generalization result overall population risk . Ambulatory 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic recording use evaluate frequency , severity , duration asymptomatic ST depression ( ASTD ) marker silent myocardial ischemia usual daily activity . This information analyze conjunction ST segment depression treadmill exercise , reversible myocardial perfusion defect stress thallium testing , limited number prespecified clinical parameter assess contribution ASTD add prognostic information current diagnostic technique use evaluate myocardial ischemia . Patients see study coordinator every four month first year , every six month thereafter . At visit study coordinator interview patient determine interim history , functional status symptom , drug usage . At four month visit second 24-hour Holter recording obtain . At 12-month visit study termination , 12-lead electrocardiogram record sent ECG Core Laboratory analysis . Data analysis use : assess predictive usefulness independence ASTD ambulatory patient establish coronary heart disease ; evaluate interaction association frequency , severity , duration ASTD measure myocardial ischemia ; obtain insight suspect vasoactive increase myocardial oxygen consumption mechanisms myocardial ischemia ; good understand interrelationship myocardial ischemia ventricular arrhythmia relate subsequent cardiac mortality morbidity . The study renew 1993 one year order fully analyze prospectively accumulate data 973 enrol patient Multicenter Study Silent Myocardial Ischemia ( MSSMI ) . The primary goal determine usefulness , lack thereof , ambulatory electrocardiographic ( AECG ) monitoring identify coronary patient jeopardized ischemic myocardium risk ischemic cardiac event . The aim study : 1 ) evaluate reproducibility current method detect ischemic-type change ( ST depression ) AECG ; 2 ) improve accuracy reliability contemporary scanner-interactive methodology utilized identify ischemic-type ST-segment change AECG ; 3 ) complete development new , innovative , reproducible computer-based technique automatic ( operator-independent ) , quantitative identification beat-to-beat ischemic-type ST depression MSSMI AECG tape ; 4 ) evaluate clinical utility improve new ST-segment analytic technique identify coronary patient risk natural cardiac event ( unstable angina , non-fatal myocardial infarction , cardiac death ) two year follow-up overall MSSMI population , select subgroup ( gender , age ) , prespecified high-risk ischemic subset ; 5 ) determine optimal cost- effective strategy sequence assessment silent , jeopardized ischemic myocardium clinical variable non-invasive test identify coronary patient risk subsequent ischemic cardiac event . This research utilized statistical technique evaluate reproducibility detect ST depression AECG ( kappa statistic , analysis variance , Cochran 's Q-test ) , determine ischemic risk factor time-to-cardiac event ( Cox regression analysis ) , cost-effectiveness analysis ( receiver-operator characteristic curve ) . Twenty-four clinical center In United States , Canada , Israel , Japan participate study . There also ECG Core Lab , Exercise Core Lab , Holter Core Lab , Thallium Core Lab , Coordinating Center .</detailed_description>
