	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although evidence relationship sickle cell disease pathology central nervous system since 1923 , tendency psychosocial literature attribute decrease cognitive performance child sickle cell disease illness-related demographic factor ( e.g. , school absenteeism , socioeconomic status ) rather disease process SCD ( e.g. , chronic microvascular insult central nervous system ) . Cerebral infarction common neurological complication occur child SCD , clinically present five ten percent child chronic illness . The majority child SCD also high risk demonstrate learn deficit poor school performance . Studies suggest significant number child SCD display overt symptomatology neurologic disease often exhibit decreased academic performance comparison healthy match peer . Given pathophysiology SCD , reasonable hypothesize insidious onset impair cognitive functioning result multiple microinfarcts , small hemorrhage , progressive vascular disease . Therefore , disease process SCD could primary contribute factor long-term decreased cognitive performance often demonstrate adult SCD population . It thus critical examine young child SCD exhibit gross manifestation neurological insult order determine cause cognitive deficit . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 60 infant toddler SCD 60 match normally-developing peer age birth three year serve subject five-year longitudinal design order permit between-group comparison . Subjects assess regularly schedule interval variety developmental ( e.g. , Bayley ) , cognitive ( e.g. , Stanford-Binet ) , neuropsychological ( e.g. , Purdue Pegboard ) , family functioning , physiological index order delineate factor SCD group associate decreased cognitive academic performance . A unique important feature research inclusion magnetic resonance image technology . These technique make possible study comprehensive componential manner neuroanatomical effect SCD instead rely single instrument assessment document phenomenon . Goals study include identification : ( ) specific area learn deficiency child SCD ; ( b ) period deficiency begin occur ; ( c ) relationship type learn deficit various outcome measure . In sum , study help determine factor interact change time child SCD mature , disease fluctuate , family and/or environmental context change relation cognitive development . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
