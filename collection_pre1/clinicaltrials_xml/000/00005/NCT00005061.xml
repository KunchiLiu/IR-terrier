	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine preliminary tolerability safety monoclonal antibody VEGF ( MOAB VEGF ) patient relapse refractory progressive solid tumor . II . Determine optimum biologically active dose MOAB VEGF evaluation base exploratory method . III . Determine maximum tolerate dose MOAB VEGF patient . IV . Determine safe dose MOAB VEGF clinical study . V. Determine dose limit toxicity pharmacokinetics regimen patient . VI . Determine response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody VEGF ( MOAB VEGF ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Patients partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) , stable disease ( SD ) completion fourth dose may receive weekly infusion 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos MOAB VEGF maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) optimum biologically active dose ( OBAD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . The OBAD define dose vascular endothelial growth factor optimally inhibit . Patients PR , CR , SD evaluate every 6 week disease progression initiation another treatment . Patients discontinue treatment prematurely due toxicity follow weekly resolution associate toxicity . Patients discontinue treatment fourth dose MOAB VEGF reason toxicity follow every month 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
