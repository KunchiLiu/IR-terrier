	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effectiveness Ablatherm high-intensity focus ultrasound device provide control disease least 12 month treatment patient stage I II prostate cancer recur external beam radiotherapy . II . Determine safety treatment device patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . A probe insert rectum . Ultrasound energy deliver probe prostate tissue 2-3 hour . Quality life assess study initiation ; 14 day 3 , 6 , 12 month ; annually thereafter . Patients follow 14 day ; 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month ; annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
