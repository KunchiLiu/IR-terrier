	<brief_title>Compliance Physicians ' Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Physicians ' Health Study randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled primary prevention trial design test whether 325 mg aspirin every day reduce risk cardiovascular disease whether 50 mg beta-carotene alternate day decrease cancer incidence among 22,071 male U.S. physician , age 40-84 year 1982 . Compliance study pill , use non-study aspirin platelet active drug , specific side effect aspirin , incidence condition indicate aspirin use , study outcome assess six month interval first year annually thereafter . The blinded aspirin component trial terminate early participant unblinded January 25 , 1988 , due emergence statistically extreme benefit aspirin fatal nonfatal myocardial infarction , well extraordinarily low cardiovascular mortality rate among study participant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Separate dose-response relationship estimate aspirin placebo group determine whether compliance placebo group associate low risk , find previous trial . Rates cardiovascular endpoint placebo group relative aspirin group adjust time-varying compliance study tablet , use non-study aspirin platelet active drug . In addition , baseline characteristic population longitudinal assessment side-effects new condition suggest aspirin therapy use predictor compliance take study pill separately aspirin placebo group . Similar longitudinal analysis determine predictor use non-study aspirin platelet active drug . The analysis intend supplement already publish intent-to-treat analysis . They provide observational evidence concern dose aspirin risk major cardiovascular endpoint . Examining modification aspirin effect reduce risk myocardial infarction accord level compliance aid generalizability result less motivated population . Evaluating determinant good study compliance benefit future large scale clinical trial . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
