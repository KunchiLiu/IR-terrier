	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality old person United States . Nearly two-thirds death men woman 65 year age old due manifestation cardiovascular disease . Further , cardiovascular disease major cause disability elderly . Although relatively extensive epidemiologic data risk factor cardiovascular disease young individual , particularly young men , 1986 study initiate , relatively little information exist prevalence antecedent cardiovascular disease men woman 65 year age . Further , data exist tended contradictory . From public health perspective , important identify risk factor cardiovascular disease old individual several reason . The number proportion elderly person U.S. growing , would continue grow well next century . This segment society , comprise 12 percent population 1986 , account one third health care cost . Older Americans continue make significant demand health care system come decade . The identification risk factor major public health problem ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease ) may lead intervention would improve health old Americans thus benefit entire society . Data project gather since 1975 Dunedin Program , population-based geriatric health-screening program . This Program design screen person 65 year age old wide variety medical disorder . It situate Dunedin , Florida , mid-west Gulf coast . Each participant see clinic year . The clinic visit consist registration , physical examination , questionnaire/medication form . Data available family history illness , illness participant , smoke history , alcohol use , emotional status , coffee consumption , dietary habit , current symptom , social activity , exercise , attitude towards health care , height , weight , blood pressure , carotid artery auscultation , electrocardiogram , lipid level , blood chemistry blood count , diabetes , urine sample , medication use . In 1986 , total 5,085 person complete first screen examination 1,540 complete full eight year screen . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In first phase , follow-up time participant compute change risk factor status analyze . Cardiovascular disease incidence mortality rate calculate . In second phase , incidence rate cardiovascular disease compute category risk factor level baseline . The relative risk cardiovascular disease calculate risk factor . Multivariable analysis carry third phase . Regression model use determine independent interactive effect identify risk factor incidence mortality cardiovascular disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
