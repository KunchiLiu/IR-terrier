	<brief_title>Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty ( PTCA ) Registries I , II , III Dynamic Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1977 , selective coronary catheter develop introduce Dr. Andreas Gruentzig colleague Zurich , first propose therapeutic tool dilatation obstruction coronary artery . Initial report technique enthusiastic many team begin evaluate procedure . In March 1979 , National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute initiate interim registry PTCA expedite evaluation technique December 1979 release Request Proposals establish formal registry . A contract award August 1980 University Pittsburgh . The 1979 registry collect case prospectively begin 1979 well retrospectively back introduction procedure 1977 . To participate registry , center require submit data patient guide catheter introduce first step angioplasty procedure . From 1979 1982 3,248 patient enter 105 clinical site 1982 , registry stop enter new case shift effort follow-up . Sixteen large center participate five year follow-up . During follow-up period , range patient expand greatly technologic advance clinical experience . The registry reopen 1985 confirm document change angioplasty technique result . Methods data collection new registry old . Within ten month , 2,094 new patient enrol . The PTCA III NACI Registry establish 1990 follow revascularization device method PTCA . Utilization PTCA experience explosive growth since first introduce . However , despite rapid growth technological improvement technique , balloon angioplasty universally successful . Problems relate failure cross chronic total occlusion , failure successfully dilate elastic lesion , intimal dissection abrupt closure lead emergency surgery , particularly , restenosis dilate segment . In late 1970s , diverse technology develop attempt counter problem plague coronary angioplasty . These technology include : mechanical device cross total occlusion ; atherectomy catheter ; abrasive athero-dispersion device ; intracoronary stent ; ablative laser ; hot-tip laser , laser balloon dilation technique . Each device category enter clinical testing . However , device state flux . Moreover , device utilize different clinical setting , different definition success complication rate different follow-up regimen . Therefore , difficult judge relative efficacy single device comparison standard PTCA . The need establish mechanism capable evaluate device , therefore , practical importance clinical investigational standpoint . The primary purpose registry compare device follow simultaneously progress multiple device parallel fashion , use common methodology definition early clinical usage . The NHLBI `` Dynamic Registry , '' year provide objective , `` real world '' assessment change practice percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) extend June 2007 . In 25 year , practice PCI evolve balloon angioplasty-to directional rotational coronary atherectomy-to bare-metal stents-to new interventional device include laser therapeutic ultrasound-to intracoronary radiation-to distal protection devices-and recently widely anticipate introduction drug-eluting stent . These evolution , accompany 150 % increase PCI procedures U.S. past 8 year alone , necessitate ongoing evaluation diverse clinical practice across patient subgroup , many promise result observe initially clinical trial realize , marginally realize , clinical practice . The multi-center Dynamic Registry fulfill mission , formal registry consecutive PCI-treated case capture in-hospital long-term patient outcome , characterize initial procedural strategy outcome great detail patient lesion level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The second registry establish five year mortality morbidity rate 1985-1986 cohort well determine functional status subsequent revascularization . Secondary goal include estimate rate clinically apparent restenosis patient important subgroup , determine recurrence symptom , seek predictor long-term response PTCA overall subgroup , determine PTCA success angiographically , provide background information NHLBI clinical trial , Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) . Sixteen center participate second registry . Patient follow-up perform independently medical care visit . The National Death Index search patient judge lose follow-up . Each center determine angiographically result angioplasty also send cineangiograms central laboratory . The third registry , NACI , design gather information use three type intervention technology PTCA . The interventional technique loosely group several category atherectomy , stent , last method . Patients contact telephone six week , six month , year . The center perform treadmill test repeat angiogram six month . To investigated , technique must use two center center must use intervention least five patient . Following acceptance registry technique , clinical site admit alll subsequent patient consecutively . Results analyze batch fifty , examine patient lesion analytic unit . The primary endpoint reduction target lesion least 20 percent less 50 percent final diameter stenosis without major complication . Secondary endpoint common device include major event additional event , health status follow-up , patency status six month . In addition , secondary endpoint specific device study . In 1993 , independent Angiographic Core Laboratory establish NACI R01HL49527 . Beginning July 1997 , PTCA Registry NACI registry renew June 2002 U01HL33292 . The purpose could consider fourth registry conduct dynamic evaluation new device usage pattern , well intermediate follow-up outcome patient undergo percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization . Three wave 2,000 consecutive patient , 18 month apart , enter 13 participate clinical site follow one year . The design woman minority patient oversampled . The clinical angiographic characteristic patient undergo coronary intervention procedure describe . There registration frequency different procedure use , conventional balloon , new device combination device provide information value add new device . Initial success rate complication evaluate . There one year follow-up clinical event subsequent procedure assessment one year symptom status include clinical re-stenosis durability intervention . Clinical anatomic criterion influence choice angioplasty strategy identify . Procedural outcome examine subgroup , include woman , African Americans , diabetic , patient prior revascularization , 75 year age . Sub-studies cost cost-effectiveness coronary interventional procedure develop . The Dynamic Registry extend June 2007 ) continue annual patient follow-up 3 5 year 2020 Wave 2 Registry patient underwent PCI 1999 ( characterize frequent stent use vary type ) ; b ) perform one-year follow-up 2124 Wave 3 Registry patient , annual follow-up 5 year approximately 150 Wave 3 patient underwent PCI 2001/2002 receive novel intracoronary radiation therapy ; c ) enroll follow annually 4 year Wave 4 2000 Registry patient undergo PCI follow introduction much await drug-eluting stent clinical practice ; ) enroll follow least one year Wave 5 2000 Registry patient undergo PCI time subsequent generation drug-eluting stent penetrate clinical practice . As successfully accomplish previous wave patient enrollment , woman minority continue oversampled Registry , important study aim investigate potential health disparity clinical practice outcome gender , race/ethnicity , control socioeconomic status . Finally , investigator coordinate cost effectiveness analysis use drug-eluting stent Wave 4 registry patient support separate source funding , pilot test new data collection form set peripheral arterial disease catheter-based intervention . Another extension receive 2007 funding conclude 2012 . This study involve long-term follow-up participant recruit 2004 ( Wave 4 ) 2006 ( Wave 5 ) across 16 medical center . All subject follow total 5 year participants Waves 4 5 already follow 3 1 year , respectively . Follow-up conduct via annual telephone interview data use track incidence long-term outcome . All identified death myocardial infarction review adjudication committee ( 1 ) classify cause death ( 2 ) determine whether myocardial infarction relate stent thrombosis . The research aim : ( 1 ) Compare 5-year mortality myocardial infarction participant treat drug elute stent ( DES ) versus bare metal stent ( BMS ) overall , within `` high-risk '' subgroup , `` off-label '' stent use ; ( 2 ) Evaluate cardiac non-cardiac cause mortality among participant treat DES versus BMS ; ( 3 ) Compare 5-year mortality repeat revascularization sirolimus-eluting versus paclitaxel-eluting stent overall , within `` high-risk '' subgroup , `` off-label '' stent use ; ( 4 ) Investigate mechanism contribute stent thrombosis , myocardial infarction , death , repeat revascularization participant treat BMS DES . In summary , extend active NHLBI Dynamic Registry , analyze long-term outcome data several thousand PCI participant treat BMS DES .</detailed_description>
