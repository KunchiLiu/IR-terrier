	<brief_summary>The diverse clinical syndrome associate hepatitis C underscore multifactorial polygenic nature HCV infection . Both viral host factor likely contribute variation infection outcome , disease susceptibility progression , treatment response . This protocol focus immunogenetics HCV infection . Various candidate gene , relate host immune response microbial infection , define genetic polymorphism associate variable manifestation infection include malaria , tuberculosis , leprosy , AIDS hepatitis B . In proposal , plan collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell source DNA approximately 1500 patient HCV infection , analyze genetic polymorphism various candidate gene association viral clearance , disease progression treatment response , characterize functional consequence polymorphisms patient well-defined clinical sequela HCV infection . We also collect blood patient form liver disease ( approximately 300 ) normal volunteer ( approximately 200 ) control . By identify relevant host factor genetically investigate molecular interaction HCV , may gain additional insight HCV pathogenesis uncover new potential target vaccine development treatment intervention .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients recover past HCV exposure ( positive antiHCV negative HCV viremia absent liver disease ) . Patients asymptomatic HCV infection ( positive antiHCV HCV viremia , persistently normal minimally elevated ALT normal mild disease liver biopsy ) . Patients active liver disease ( positive antiHCV HCV viremia , persistently elevate ALT and/or moderate disease liver biopsy ) . Patients active extrahepatic manifestation HCV infection ( cryoglobulinemia , glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , etc. ) . Patients rapidly progressive , severe liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients undergone undergoing treatment . Patients singlesource outbreak HCV infection ( viral factor identical patient often homogeneous population less genetic variability ) . HCV infect family member twin . Patients form liver disease include HBV infection , primary biliary cirrhosis , autoimmune hepatitis , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , hemochromatosis , Wilson 's Disease , well normal volunteer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Adult subject Hct le 30 pediatric subject less 25 exclude . Children HCV infection young 2 year age exclude . Unaffected healthy volunteer minor eligible study .</criteria>
