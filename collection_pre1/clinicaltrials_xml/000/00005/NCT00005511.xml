	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sleep apnea common condition affect 4 percent middle-aged male 2 percent middle-aged female . There recent evidence genetic influence first degree relative patient disorder increase risk obstructive sleep apnea . The basis increase familial risk undefined . The investigator postulate three specific intermediate trait , reduce upper airway size , thereby increase risk sleep apnea . These intermediate trait include : ) particular distribution fat neck ; b ) craniofacial structure ; c ) size critical soft tissue airway ( soft palate , tongue , lateral pharyngeal wall ) . All risk factor could assess quantitatively use advanced magnetic resonance image novel volumetric image analysis technique developed.. The study one project within Specialized Center Research Neurobiology Sleep Sleep Apnea . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The case-control study identify structural risk factor sleep apnea . The study complement study sibling patient control order identify trait demonstrate family aggregation explain share environmental factor . The investigator believe structural risk factor would interact increase risk sleep apnea . The elucidation upper airway structural risk factor provide basis develop new , effective technique screen patient sleep apnea provide basis perform future DNA analysis aim identify genetic locus risk factor . The specific aim : 1 ) quantify upper airway craniofacial structure , soft tissue regional fat deposition use three dimensional magnetic resonance image order determine intermediate trait associate obstructive sleep apnea utilizing case control design normal apneics ; 2 ) determine upper airway structural risk factor sleep apnea demonstrate family aggregation likely genetic component compare probands , sibling probands , neighborhood control sibling neighborhood control . The resource include extensive clinical sleep practice , sophisticated NM imaging technique , novel volumetric computer graphic image analysis expertise molecular epidemiology , craniofacial structure , genetics obesity .</detailed_description>
