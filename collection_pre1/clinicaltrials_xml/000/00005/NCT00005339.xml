	<brief_summary>To determine risk transfusion-transmitted hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) cardiac surgery patient donor screen anti-HCV surrogate marker non-A , non-B hepatitis ( NANBH ) . Also , characterize donor HCV seronegative lack surrogate marker time donation , whose recipient seroconverted HCV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In early 1990s , posttransfusion NANBH , mainly cause HCV , common serious complication transfusion , occur 2-5 percent transfusion recipient . About 50 percent infect develop chronic hepatitis , , 10 20 percent develop cirrhosis . Hepatocellular carcinoma report occur . This study provide first evaluation effectiveness donor screen anti-HCV recently license HCV antibody test surrogate marker NANBH . It also provide precise estimate risk transfusion-transmitted HCV . The result allow examination risk factor HCV infect donor seronegative time donation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study nonconcurrent prospective , seroepidemiologic study . To estimate incidence HCV infection , six-month postoperative serum sample test antibody HCV . Preoperative sample correspond positive postoperative serum also test . The donor patient receive blood screen HCV , i.e. , donation since May , 1990 , seroconverted six month since transfusion locate retested antibody HCV . The donor administer questionnaire design ascertain risk factor HCV infection . A sample donor HCV positive time donation give questionnaire . Comparison three group donor ( i.e. , seropositives , donor test negative implicated seroconversion , seronegatives ) allow investigation factor associate false negative screening result . Analytical method include standard method contingency table conditional unconditional logistic regression . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
