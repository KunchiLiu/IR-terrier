	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congenital heart disease represent major segment clinically significant birth defect associate high mortality morbidity infancy , childhood mar physical limitation repeat invasive procedure , adulthood increase risk medical social problem . Previous research principally direct clinical method diagnosis treatment , need prediction prenatal counseling require knowledge environmental familial risk factor . Congenital heart disease one malformation monitor International Clearing House Birth Defects Surveillance System . Surveillance include congenital heart disease may lack diagnostic accuracy among various report source . Accurate clinical study lack comparative control information . As result , true epidemiologic feature cardiac defect remain obscure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design Baltimore-Washington Infant Study case-control study . All infant one year age confirm diagnosis congenital heart disease eligible inclusion resident study area encompass 53 area hospital Maryland , District Columbia five county Virginia . Case enrollment do five pediatric cardiology center periodic search obstetrics neonatal pathology log participate hospital . Control selection random number resident birth eligible control except congenital heart disease . Mothers case control interview home demographic information , information maternal health , maternal medication , reproductive history , lifestyle , environmental exposure home , occupation , agent transmit mother father . Data collect characteristic , drug use , habit , occupation father . Vital record birth certificate abstract case control . Death certificate also abstract . Variables include drug , lifestyle home exposure , occupation , screen identify single factor importantly relate congenital heart disease . Cases congenital heart disease part genetic complex evaluate separately environmental exposure . Genetic data analysis focus first degree relative extend family data note wherever available . The genetic data analysis include : estimation recurrence risk sibling congenital heart disease cardiac defect ; cardiac defect sibling ; non cardiac birth defect pregnancy loss family . Parental phenotype investigate presence birth defect know genetic disorder . Twin birth assess concordance zygosity . Hypotheses genetic environmental teratogenic coteratogenic interaction test . Pathogenic mechanism define anatomic echocardiographic observation . The family inquiry expand include cousin . Nutrition information add maternal vitamin A supplementation , protein , calorie , nutrient . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
