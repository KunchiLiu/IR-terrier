	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] ) potent inflammatory stimulant find ambient air occupational setting . Asthma workplace increasingly significant problem . Asthma characterize airway inflammation increase reactivity allergic non-allergic stimulus . LPS know induced airway inflammation normal subject enhance airway reactivity asthmatic . Additionally , alveolar macrophage mononuclear cell asthmatic secrete high amount cytokine ( interleukins 1 8 [ IL-1 , IL-8 ] granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor [ GM-CSF ] ) normal . Thus , likely LPS enhance allergen-induced inflammation allergic asthmatic sensitive effect LPS . Preliminary data show exposure low level ( 250 ng/m3 ) LPS risk four hour enhance immediate responsiveness inhale allergen allergen-induced eosinophil observe induced sputum . In nasal airway allergics , single dose 1,000 nanogram LPS enhances polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx associate allergen challenge . This latter finding also correlate well baseline IL-8 ECP level , suggest constitutive airway inflammation enhance response stimulus . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The effect endotoxin LPS ( 5,000 nanogram ) compare airway inflammation methacholine response lung function normal asthmatic ; effect LPS ( 500 nanogram ) compare allergen-induced reactivity inflammatory cell influx follow LPS exposure ( 5,000 nanogram ) asthmatic , likely result decrease baseline inflammation . To examine potential cellular mediation effect LPS asthma , cytokine secretion mononuclear cell LPS subject respond LPS ( LPS enhance response allergen ) compare respond . In vitro monocyte vivo airway responses asthmatic responsive non-responsive compare baseline sputum nasal lavage fluid IL-8 ECP determine either vitro monocyte response IL-8 ECP readily obtain airway fluid may serve biomarkers LPS responsiveness might use marker LPS-response phenotype human future mechanistic intervention study . Finally , practical data effect LPS asthmatic ( level find typical work setting ) ability standard anti-inflammatory therapy protect asthmatic worker unavoidable expose LPS obtain . The study renew 2001 continue December , 2005 .</detailed_description>
