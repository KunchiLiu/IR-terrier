	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The integrate theme study hostility affect behavior biologic function way increase risk develop coronary atherosclerosis suffer acute CHD event . Disciplines involve include psychology , internal medicine , cardiology , psychiatry , pharmacology , biostatistics , epidemiology , molecular biology . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There five subprojects original program project grant . Subproject 1 examine social , behavioral biologic concommitants natural experimental interpersonal conflict function multimodal hostility assessment . Subproject 2 examined role hostility social support survival among CHD patient attempt identify behavioral mediator survival effect . Subproject 4 evaluated effect hostility , alone jointly risk factor social factor , CHD incidence 5,000 participant University North Carolina Alumni Heart Study . Subproject 5 evaluate effect age , smoking , lipid , adrenergic receptor physiologic reactivity hostile nonhostile men anger induce interpersonal challenge lab well event daily life . Subproject 7 extended evaluation anger-associated biologic reactivity hostile nonhostile person study biobehavioral response 200 woman employ real world high stress work situation ; also evaluate impact stress management intervention design reduce anger biobehavioral reactivity employee . The study renew fiscal year ( FY ) 1997 expand primary focus hostility include set psychosocial , behavioral , biological characteristic increase coronary heart disease risk appear cluster certain individual group , especially low socioeconomic status ( SES ) . Subproject 1 examine approximately 360 subject synergistic effect SES psychosocial risk factor depression , hostility , social isolation biological behavioral factor suspect know contribute atherogenesis . Subproject 2 evaluated role central nervous system serotonin function potential mediator cluster health-damaging psychosocial biobehavioral characteristic individual low SES group . Subproject 3 , Psychosocial Risk Cardiovascular Disease Youth Project ( PRCVDYP ) , use three ongoing general population study youth basis examine development psychosocial risk cardiovascular disease . The investigator hypothesize low SES youth would exhibit , addition increase level psychosocial behavioral risk factor study , increase sympathetic nervous system tone reactivity mental challenge , well decreased peripheral nervous system tone . They also hypothesize depression , social isolation , harsh parent interact low SES increase cardiovascular disease risk . Subproject 4 used rat model investigate early experience , serotonin adult function . The study renew FY 2004 include three subprojects . Subproject 1 determine role gene-environment interaction expression psychosocial biobehavioral risk factor cardiovascular disease . Variants identified candidate gene chromosomal loci associate endophenotypes hostility , personality , psychosocial risk factor , health behavior , follow response rest stress -- cardiovascular neuroendocrine function , platelet activation serotonin transporter function , circulatory inflammatory marker tendency characteristic cluster individual low socioeconomic group . A total 400 probands ( half African American , half Caucasian , half woman ) least one sibling proband recruit total 800 1200 subject . Subproject 2 explore 400 subject genetics glucose metabolism , hostility , cardiovascular disease risk factor . Subproject 3 examine genetics , hostility biology stress daily life 400 probands one sibling every proband .</detailed_description>
