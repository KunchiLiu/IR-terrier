	<brief_title>Vaccine Plus Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical response rate patient advance melanoma treat gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) melanoma vaccine low-dose interleukin-2 . II . Assess response duration progression-free interval patient receive treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 interleukin-2 SC day 1-5 8-13 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 3 additional course achieve CR . Patients follow every 9 week 3 year disease recurrence . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-50 patient accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
