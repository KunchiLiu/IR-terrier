	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Given increase awareness extent environment typically face ethnic group differ , environmental influence process may important factor aspect ethnicity . Socioeconomic status ( SES ) useful index environment associate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Since behavior one pathway SES influence think expressed disease , study focus specifically stress responsivity , think link pathophysiology CVD . Since disease antecedent childhood , multiethnic pediatric sample employ . In addition , subject sample consist twin . Investigation impact environment expression CVD achieve proper control biological influence . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects complete three laboratory stressor : video game task , structure social interview , cold pressor . Stress responsivity assess , particular interest pay systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) . Left ventricular mass ( LVM ) also assess . Sophisticated environmentally genetically informative analysis permit quantification environmental impact upon systemic vascular resistance responsivity leave ventricular mass . It hypothesize environmental influence ( SES ) account great proportion variance systemic vascular resistance responsivity leave ventricular mass African Americans Caucasian Americans . The hypothesis systemic vascular resistance responsivity pathway SES exert influence leave ventricular mass also test . The study extend November 2005 continue examination investigator 's Twin CV Health cohort ( 519 pair twin 14 25 year old ) . The study provide unique opportunity well understand effect sodium ion ( Na+ ) retention mechanism augment systemic vascular resistance responsivity ( SVR ) change vascular function ( i.e. , endothelium dependent arterial dilation ; EDAD ) , ventricular structure ( i.e. , leave ventricular mass ; LVM ) 24-hour ambulatory BP ( ABP ) . The specific aim determine : 1 ) To extent environmental stress related stress induce Na+ retention , SVR responsivity preclinical marker essential hypertension risk relationship strong African Americans Caucasian Americans ; 2 ) Whether stress induce Na+ retention pathway link environmental stress preclinical marker essential hypertension risk ; 3 ) Whether behavioral factor ( i.e . John Henryism , anger expression , social support , physical activity ) moderate effect environmental stress stress induce Na+ retention and/or SVR responsivity preclinical marker essential hypertension risk , particularly African Americans .</detailed_description>
