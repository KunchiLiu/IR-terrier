	<brief_title>BMS-188797 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose , dose limit toxicity , safety BMS-188787 patient nonhematologic malignancy . II . Determine plasma pharmacokinetics BMS-188797 patient . III . Describe antitumor activity treatment patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive BMS-188797 IV 1 hour . Treatment continue every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-188797 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow every 4 week toxicity resolve , investigator 's discretion . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
