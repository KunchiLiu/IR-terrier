	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The result longitudinal analysis yield new insight genetic effect affect CVD risk factor age process . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The analysis utilized maximum likelihood estimator genetic variance asymptotically efficient method-of-moments estimator use previous analysis . The model use incorporated term partition variance trait twin data either ) additive genetic variance unshared environmental variance ( AE model ) , ii ) additive genetic variance , dominance genetic variance , unshared environmental variance ( ADE model ) , iii ) additive genetic variance , share environmental variance , unshared environmental variance ( ACE model ) . The AE , ADE , ACE model fit separately data three exam obtain cross-sectional analysis . The investigator also extend model use longitudinal data incorporate term represent covariance variance component different exam . Two important additional objective study ) introduce resistant estimation technique twin modeling , trim effect outlier data point smoothly , ii ) carefully study performance maximum likelihood method-of-moments estimator assumption twin model violate . The result part study yield complete understand relative merit limitation twin modeling procedure . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
