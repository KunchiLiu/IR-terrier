	<brief_title>506U78 Treating Patients With Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete partial remission rate remission duration patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma refractory relapse noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma treat 506U78 . II . Determine safety toxicity treatment regimen patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive 506U78 IV 2 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response receive 8 course therapy . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year relapse . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34-74 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically document cutaneous Tcell lymphoma ( CTCL ) noncutaneous peripheral Tcell lymphoma ( PTCL ) ( needle aspirate core biopsy tissue marrow sole mean diagnosis acceptable ) , confirm immunophenotyping , include : Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome Peripheral TCell lymphoma ( medium , mixed mediumlarge , large cell ) Variants peripheral TCell lymphoma Angioimmunoblastic TCell lymphoma ( AILD ) ; angiocentric lymphoma ; intestinal TCell Lymphoma ; adult TCell lymphoma/leukemia ( ATLL ) ; anaplastic Large Cell ( CD30+ ) lymphoma , Tcell type Failure submit pathology slide within 60 day patient registration result patient declare ineligible ; Note : patient diagnose one year prior entry protocol must repeat lymph node biopsy . In event rapid tumor growth , rise LDH , onset B symptom period time less one year rebiopsy also require Biopsy immunophenotyping perform document relapse prior treatment CTCL patient may receive one prior course singleagent systemic chemotherapy CTCL , may receive multiagent chemotherapy regimen ; patient may receive prior local , topical , radiation electron beambased , chemotherapybased treatment ; example latter would include , limited , cytokine interferon , retinoids , monoclonal antibody , fusion toxin PTCL patient may fail one two prior treatment regimen ( one may include peripheral stem cell transplantation ) Patients must measurable disease ; patient CTCL must skin lesion measurable ; whenever CT specify , understood MRI may substitute long measurement tumor response make two successive study employ procedure The following lesion consider measurable : Barium study Ascites pleural effusion Bony disease ( lesion present note ) Bone marrow No CNS lymphoma require intrathecal craniospinal radiation therapy No history seizure disorder grade 3 neurologic toxicity prior treatment lymphoma . Baseline neurologic status eligible patient carefully record ( particularly elderly patient condition potentially predispose neurotoxicity , diabetes mellitus prior exposure neurotoxic agent ) ; patient prior neurologic dysfunction toxicity cause must recover grade 1 neurologic toxicity/dysfunction Performance status 02 No know HIV disease ; patient history intravenous drug abuse behavior associate increase risk HIV infection test exposure HIV virus ; patient test positive know infected eligible ; HIV test require entry protocol , require patient perceive risk Calculated Creatinine Clearance &gt; = 50 ml/min Unless attributable lymphoma To calculate method CockcroftGault Bilirubin &gt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal Patients hepatic dysfunction enroll CALGB 69803</criteria>
