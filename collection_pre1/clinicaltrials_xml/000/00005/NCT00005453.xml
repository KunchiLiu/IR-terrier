	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The success therapeutic intervention , whether preventive curative , ultimately dependent individual 's adherence treatment . Unfortunately , failure large percentage patient adhere prescribe medical regimen widely recognize well document phenomenon . It estimate many 50 percent patient take prescribed medication , remain , less two-thirds take medication prescribe . The intervention , implement outset pharmacologic intervention within clinical trial , time yield maximum effectiveness . Such randomized induction study yet undertake . By capitalize new unobtrusive assessment technique generate time medication intake prolonged period , study produce unique set data suitable study recur cycle medication intake pattern . The study part two grant initiative entitle `` Evaluation Adherence Interventions Clinical Trials '' . The initiative develop Behavioral Medicine Branch staff Clinical Trials Branch staff well member Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee Behavioral Medicine Prevention Working Groups . The initiative release September , 1991 award September , 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , two-group design . Within group , half subject lovastatin half placebo . The main outcome measure medication intake monitor daily unobtrusively MEMS electronic monitor . For subject , event time series six month duration obtain . The effect intervention determine average adherence two six month ; variability adherence . In addition , relative cost effectiveness intervention examine recalculation sample size need base upon increase adherence relate cholesterol lower . Ancillary goal study include : determine component variability medication intake use statistical modeling technique ; covariates treatment effect , include baseline daily hassle , problem solve skill , generalize expectancy success . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
