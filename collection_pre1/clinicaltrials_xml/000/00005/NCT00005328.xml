	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1980 , longitudinal study examine Type A behavior pattern , hostility , physiological response family interactive behavior primarily white , upper-middle class child parent . The study renew several time . In fiscal year 1992 renewal , research extend include study Black child lower-middle middle class family . The inclusion group important understudied , also examination need developmental factor may important accounting much high incidence hypertension relate disorder Blacks low lower-middle class group . The current study examines pattern cardiovascular response exhibit Black white child order good ass hemodynamic autonomic nervous system mechanism underlie response . It also examine hemodynamic pattern relate cardiovascular risk factor body fat distribution , leave ventricular geometry ( via echocardiography ) , well insulin , glucose , lipid level explore new conceptualization hostility index cardiovascular risk factor . A total 184 Black white child adolescent gender recruit participation , half pre-pubescent ( 9-10 year old ) half post-pubescent ( 15-16 year old ) . The first laboratory session consist fast venous blood draw , collection anthropomorphic data , psychophysiological stress protocol involve four task select elicit different autonomic nervous system response , completion standardize questionnaire assess hostility social support . A second session involve echocardiographic assessment leave ventricular geometry cardiac performance variable , Type A Structured Interview , interview examine subject process information hostile intention action others . The study extend August 2007 re-assess adolescent enrol Project Pressure three year initial assessment address key hypothesis regard early emergence behavioral risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) adolescence antecedent consequence . In initial phase Project Pressure , investigator collect data 217 black white , male female high school student test cross-sectionally model development CVD risk factor . Their model suggest adolescent ' socioeconomic status ethnicity affect exposure psychological stress , include discrimination , , turn , think lead development propensity vigilant possible threat , view ambiguous situation potentially harmful , mistrust others . These cognitive propensity may become automatic development lead stable trait hostility , anxiety , heighten cardiovascular responsivity stress . These trait may affect early development vascular stiffness leave ventricular mass . They propose test model longitudinally use measure initial assessment , plus add new measure take advantage recent technological conceptual advance : ( ) endothelial dysfunction carotid intima medial thickness ; ( b ) cop discrimination ethnic identity ; ( c ) depression . They anticipate 165 previous adolescent reassess , adequate term power test key hypothesis . The longitudinal design strong test model previous cross-sectional study .</detailed_description>
