	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study subproject within Specialized Centers Research ( SCOR ) Transfusion Medicine . The experimental design base study analysis several unique set data . One set consist abstracted patient data include ICD-9-CM diagnosis procedure , DRG red cell unit transfuse , constant set 100 United States hospital year 1980,82,84,86 , new set data add year 1989 . A similar set data gather eight cooperate teach hospital first four year grant term ; set include data transfusion blood component , autologous unit factor preparation . A third data base contain data four United States survey conduct 1982,84,86,87 ; expand include 1990 92 . Using data , four main task address . A Pan-DRG red cell transfusion study conduct ascertain red cell use across DRGs ICD-9-CM code . Extensive effort devote develop new method characterize transfusion practice . A series study devote characterize transfusion blood component select number ICD-9-CM class . The purpose fourth task develop simpler rapid alternative method produce national estimate transfusion activity ; part task , new survey conduct 1990 92 . Among question study : Was possible identify distinctive attribute patient , though operated , require transfusion require large volume blood ? Were transfusion non-red cell component relate use red cell ? Could transfusion frequency diagnosis blood product use measure transfusion practice ? Did longitudinal comparison transfusion 9-year interval , 1980-1989 , reveal significant trend ? Was possible discriminate quantitatively transfusion practice different hospital set hospital , different time ? What effect autologous blood program transfusion practice ? What contribution comorbid condition red cell component transfusion patterns. ? The dollar subproject approximately 25 percent total dollar spend year Center . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
