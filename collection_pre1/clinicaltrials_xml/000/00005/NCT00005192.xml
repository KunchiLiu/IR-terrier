	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blacks United States much great prevalence essential hypertension white . The prevalence hypertension adult age 18-74 estimated 15.7 percent white woman , 18.5 percent white men , 27.8 percent Black men 28.6 percent Black woman . Among adults underwent screen Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program , 36.2 percent Black males 38.2 percent Black females either diastolic blood pressure least high 95 mmHg take antihypertensive medication . The Black-white ratio prevalence hypertension survey approximately 2 . Reportedly , prevalence hypertension among inner city Blacks may high 50 percent . The exact cause disparity hypertension prevalence Blacks white unknown , genetic predisposition , psychosocial stress , life-style factor high sodium ingestion obesity implicate . None factor alone appear sufficient account difference prevalence hypertension Blacks white , suggest multiple factor and/or interaction factor may involve . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study support program project grant thus include many subprojects . Projects 1A 1C support beginning 1986 . Project 1A examined effect cardiovascular hormonal response standardize laboratory challenge function race , sex , age , normal blood pressure versus borderline hypertension . The subject classify accord four category : Black white race ; male female sex ; normal raise blood pressure ; age 25-39 40-54 , give total 16 cell 15 subject . The subject give physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood screen test well battery special test include Structured Interview Type A behavior pattern , play video game , test design elicit anger , exercise bicycle ergometer . During tasks subject monitor heart rate blood pressure , blood sample plasma catecholamine , renin , cortisol , aldosterone , vasopressin . Various psychological test administer include Cook-Medley hostility scale , Life Orientation test , job stress scale , John Henryism Active Coping Scale others . Urine sample collect electrolyte catecholamine excretion ambulatory blood pressure monitor work day non-work day . Project IB examine effect acute sodium load depletion cardiovascular hormonal reactivity function race sex . Normotensive subject classify accord two category : Black white race ; male female sex , four cell 15 subject . After initial medical examination , subject see three time intervals two week . Before visit three overnight urine collection make electrolyte excretion evaluation . On three visit subject randomized either control day , sodium loading day , sodium depletion day . On day subject give three reactivity test include video game , exercise test , speech-stressor task . The psychological test Project 1A give morning three test day . Project 1C five-year follow-up 80 subject Study Biobehavioral Factors Affecting Hypertension Blacks . Subjects routine history physical exam give Type A Interview , video game , exercise task . Subjects also provide three overnight urine sample . Two substudies also conduct . The goal substudy 1 determine psychosocial factor predict cardiovascular respond work Black white woman . Black white normotensive nurse age 20-45 year serve subject . Substudy 2 examine affective physiological response Black white college student challenge . Normotensive Black white men woman monitor blood pressure heart rate rest three task include mirror star tracing , hand immersion cold pressor , speech stressor . The program project renew 1996 . Subproject 7 address problem modifying risk youth high blood pressure . The subproject compare adolescent high versus normal blood pressure term fast insulin , oral glucose tolerance , adiposity , aerobic fitness , diet , cardiac mass , autonomic reactivity , psychosocial characteristic family medical history . Subproject 7 renew Subproject 1 FY 2001 examine long-term effect three intervention condition : three month self-management intervention ; six month augment self-management skill acquisition intervention program ; usual care . Subproject 8 renew Subproject 2 FY 2001 involve behavioral intervention post-myocardial infarction patient receive standard pharmacological treatment standard pharmacological treatment plus behavioral treatment include stress management , dietary supervision , self-directed exercise .</detailed_description>
