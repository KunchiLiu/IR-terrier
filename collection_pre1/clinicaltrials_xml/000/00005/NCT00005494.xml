	<brief_title>Prospective Study Health Runners Walkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Current government physical fitness guideline state : 1 ) majority health benefit physical activity obtain walk two mile briskly day week ; 2 ) health benefit physical activity depend principally total amount activity rather intensity activity . Nevertheless , currently prospective epidemiological study extant , design specifically directly contrast health benefit cost moderate exercise ( e.g. , walk ) versus vigorous exercise ( e.g. , run ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Before start study , 233,000 person-years follow-up accumulate 56,000 runner ( 1991 1997 ) . The runner resurveyed 1997 along 68,000 walker . The walker also solicit publication questionnaire Walking magazine follow direct mailing questionnaire 425,000 subscriber . Total cause-specific mortality determine National Death Index ; fatal nonfatal cancer identify National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results ( SEER ) 46 state registry ; nonfatal coronary heart disease injury determine questionnaire . Survival analysis use test whether runner great reduction heart disease , total mortality , cancer per unit exercise . Exercise-related injury walk run also examine . Power calculation suggest detection difference runners walker , small 11 % total mortality , 16 % CHD , 12 % total cancer , 36 % breast cancer , possible . The difference adjust weekly kilocalorie expend walk running , walk run distance , time spent activity test whether variable account difference disease rate walker runner . By end study , 517,000 person year 68,000 runner ( 1991 2001 ) available analysis . Survival analysis use test dose-response relationship run mileage CHD cancer risk , whether relationship affect run intensity , run frequency , run history , gender , adiposity , age medication use . Using conservative rate ( 25 % publish value ) , statistical power calculation suggest detectable reduction coronary heart disease risk small 0.71 % per mile possible , far estimate reduction publish study ( 2.1 % ) . Additionally , detectable reduction breast cancer risk small 1.5 % per mile run woman calculate , 1.7 % reduction risk estimate publish data . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
