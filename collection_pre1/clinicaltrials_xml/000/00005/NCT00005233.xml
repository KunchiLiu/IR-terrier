	<brief_title>Patterns Fatty Acids Framingham Offspring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1988 , research suggest high intake saturate fat increase risk cardiovascular disease cancer , feed polyunsaturated fatty acid decrease plasma lipid value . However , understand role specific type fatty acid nutrition health remain limited . This primarily technology analysis fatty acid composition human tissue recently achieve required specificity secondarily application technology large scale epidemiologic study await recent advance automation chromatography . Also intervention study , aim reduce dietary intake polyunsaturated fatty acid long period time , either impractical unethical . The study conduct confirm preliminary result suggest great prevalence low level essential fatty acid , particularly w3 fatty acid , among people cardiovascular disease hypertension , provide confirmatory evidence result hyperlipidemia inversely associate essential fatty acid level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects randomly select exist list six men six woman select age-year group 30 69 broken follow : age 30-34 ; 35-39 ; 40-44 ; 45-49 ; 50-54 ; 55-59 ; 60-64 ; 65-69 . Plasma sample subject retrieve storage batch analyze . The prevailing distribution fatty acids general population calculate . The interrelationship study among level fatty acid , particularly w3 w6 fatty acid , lipoproteins apolipoproteins . Relationships among fatty acid composition different lipid fraction explore relationship various cardiovascular risk factor evaluate . Over 60 fatty acid quantitated use capillary gas-liquid chromatography . Tables reference value produce general population select subpopulation . Multivariate analysis use correlate fatty acid biochemical marker . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
