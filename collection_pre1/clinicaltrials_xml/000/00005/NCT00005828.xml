	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effectiveness toxicity green tea extract patient androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer . II . Determine response rate response duration patient treat regimen . III . Determine whether decline prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) coincide evidence disease regression patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral green tea extract six time daily 4 month . Patients 50 % decline PSA , complete partial response , stable disease 4 month continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression 4 month receive treatment . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year disease progression . If disease progression , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
