	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : An association overt diabetes cardiovascular disease observe multiple study among population across world . The reason excess partly understood . In recent year , several study suggest elevation level insulin insulin resistance important risk factor cardiovascular disease , diabetic patient also among normal subclinical abnormality glucose tolerance . Many reason exist investigate role insulin insulin resistance development cardiovascular disease . Insulin effect multiple metabolic pathway show promote development atherosclerotic lesion animal . In addition , level insulin insulin resistance correlate multiple abnormality cardiovascular disease risk factor elevation blood pressure , dyslipidemia , alteration coagulation factor . It particularly important determine whether association strong level insulin insulin resistance since information valuable study aim localize site defect develop new therapeutic intervention . Despite evidence population study , difficult explain excess cardiovascular disease diabetic solely consequence elevation insulin level . Recent , small study suggest risk previously associate hyperinsulinemia may correlate strongly increase insulin resistance . Insulin resistance continue increase glucose level increase , even presence decrease insulin secretion . Such observation may help explain high risk cardiovascular disease overt diabetic . More detailed assessment role insulin resistance alter cardiovascular disease risk factor also need . Prior IRAS study , direct measure insulin resistance perform population study . The continuation IRAS additional five year provide first longitudinal data insulin resistance cardiovascular disease risk factor . The IRAS proposed staff approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee May , 1990 . The Request Applications release November , 1990 . Awards first make September , 1991 . The study extend additional five year September , 1995 August , 1999 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study population select insure adequate number participant within gender glucose tolerance group ( normoglycemia , impair glucose tolerance , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ) . IRAS first large epidemiologic study include detailed measurement insulin sensitivity secretion . During first four year funding , IRAS investigator successfully design implement first phase study -- cross-sectional evaluation 1,625 participant . Cohort examination begin October , 1992 complete April , 1994 . Insulin resistance assess directly use frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test minimal model analysis . Intimal-medial carotid artery wall thickness , indicator atherosclerosis , measure use B-mode ultrasonography . Prevalent cardiovascular disease assesed questionnaire resting electrocardiography . The IRAS renew September , 1995 additional five year July , 1999 prospective follow-up reexamination cohort . The renewal period consist three phase . During first phase ( year 05 06 ) , investigator conduct substudy address measurement insulin sensitivity individual NIDDM . This substudy evaluate several alternate technique measure insulin sensitivity approximately 115 non-IRAS volunteer NIDDM . In addition , IRAS participant contact annually incident cardiovascular major health event . During second phase ( year 07 08 ) , follow-up examination IRAS cohort conduct goal determine predictor change insulin sensitivity , cardiovascular risk factor , measure atherosclerosis development , incident cardiovascular event . Additionally , throughout first four year , continue major effort devote analysis report cross-sectional data first IRAS examination . The final phase ( year 09 ) include analysis report longitudinal result . Since exist measure insulin resistance appear measure exactly thing , substudies conduct compare insulin resistance measurement technique enable IRAS data related study literature . A decision make continue frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) vascular resistance measure IRAS . The FSIGT compare measure insulin resistance diabetic . The IRAS renew August 1999 July 2005 IRAS Family Study . The purpose identify genetic determinant insulin resistance abdominal obesity determine extent insulin resistance , visceral adiposity , metabolic cardiovascular disease risk factor share common genetic influence . Families African-American Hispanic background enrol use participant original IRAS study index case . Approximately 1,280 additional family member recruit study total 1,440 participant . Insulin resistance measure use frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test , abdominal obesity measure use compute tomography . Metabolic cardiovascular disease risk factor also assess . A panel 370 micro satellite marker genotyped provide data genome-wide scan detect chromosomal region contain quantitative trait locus ( QTLs ) influence phenotypic variation insulin resistance visceral adiposity . The study extend December , 2008 target exploration genomic region positional clone gene contribute variation adiposity glucose homeostasis . Positional candidate gene identify . The original cohort re-contacted repeat primary phenotype measure change ( abdominal CT scan fast insulin ) add several important new phenotype add depth assessment adiposity glucose homeostasis ( total body fat DXA adipocytokines , include adiponectin soluble TNF-alpha receptor 1 2 ) . A panel nutritional , dietary , eat behavior assess study genetic effect . Using exist genome scan data variance-components-based linkage analysis method , region genome detect contribute variation new phenotype change phenotype</detailed_description>
