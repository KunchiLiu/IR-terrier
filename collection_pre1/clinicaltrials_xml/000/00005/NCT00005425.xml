	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The question study include whether name risk factor reduce maximally attain level pulmonary function early adulthood , foreshorten postulated stability level pulmonary function age 18 35 and/or unfavorably affect subsequent decline level pulmonary function . FEV1/h2 , VC/h2 FEV1/IVC study , use graphic smooth techniques regression analysis techniques cross-sectional longitudinal datasets . In addition , investigator test hypothesis state early adult symptom asthma , increase bronchial responsiveness , marker allergy influence become smoker , influenced amount smoke and/or influence stop smoke relatively early adult life , use logistic regression analysis survival analysis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
