	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1985 study initiate , surprisingly little data distribution risk factor among subgroups population change occur time . These issue assume great importance decline coronary heart disease mortality focus interest role primary prevention alteration risk factor . In review potential contribution decline , noted cessation cigarette smoking , good blood pressure control decrease total serum cholesterol may account partially decline coronary heart disease mortality . However , observation overlook possibility observation total population confine specific socioeconomic group may fail disclose differential change particular population segment . For example , Americans high educational income group experience rapid marked change risk behavior less educate , low income Americans specific racial/ethnic group experience beneficial change . The majority cohort study follow rather select group cross-sectional survey also little sociodemographic variability . However , focus public health , educational medical intervention effort require particular group great risk experience less beneficial secular change identify targeted great effort . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Trends blood pressure , serum lipid , cigarette smoking describe nationally representative sample adolescent age 12 17 young adult age 18 24 use data survey conduct 1960 1984 National Center Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Trends blood pressure , serum lipid , cigarette smoking , obesity describe nationally representative sample older adult age 35 75 use NCHS survey data . The national survey use include National Health Examination Surveys ( NHES-I III ) , National Health Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES I II ) Hispanic NHANES . The secular trend risk factor contrast subgroupings age , race , sex , family income , education . The correlate risk factor determine secular change time identify quantify . Risk factor value correlate national population sample contrast three Hispanic population survey Hispanic Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( HHANES ) . Statistical methodology refine include statistical software analysis complete sample survey data , model fit strategy characterize secular trend across four national survey , guideline choice analytical strategy . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
