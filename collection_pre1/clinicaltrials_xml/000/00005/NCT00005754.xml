	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 10 percent premature coronary artery disease ( CAD ) morbidity mortality general population due insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) . By age 55 , 35 percent IDDM patent die CAD , contrast 8 percent nondiabetic men 4 percent woman . In U.S. , IDDM affect least 750,000 person number grow rapidly effect increase incidence improve survival . Tight blood glucose control slow development microvascular complication protective effect heart disease convincingly demonstrate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This observational population-based study evaluate cross- sectionally population-based group 656 IDDM patient age 20-55 year 764 non-diabetic spouse/partner control use electron-beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) . Patients control compare term amount anatomical distribution coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) , marker atherosclerosis , leave ventricular ( LV ) area , marker LV hypertrophy diabetic cardiomyopathy . The demographic , metabolic , behavioral factor associate increased CACand LV area define . Standard epidemiological method use determine prevalence clinical CAD , define previous MI , revascularization , angina study population . In 100 asymptomatic high-risk IDDM patient ( CAC great equal 20 LV area great 60 cm2 ) , 50 low-risk patient ( CAC LV area cut-offs ) , 20 nondiabetic control age-sex match high-risk patient , ECG-gated rest-stress technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission compute tomographic imaging ( MIBI SPECT ) perform . This help determine presence myocardial perfusion defect quantify myocardial perfusion reserve well relate finding anatomically distribution CAC EBCT . In addition , LV volume , ejection fraction , wall motion thickening determine , relate LV area EBCT . Finally , study cohort 656 IDDM patient 764 non diabetic spouses/partners follow period 3 year measure change CAC LV area use repeat EBCT identify metabolic behavioral risk factor progression index . Cause-specific mortality monitor fatal non-fatal cardiac event ascertain . In subgroup 100 high-risk IDDM patient study MIBI SPECT baseline low-risk patient whose CAC increase 50 follow-up , MIBI SPECT use evaluate change myocardial perfusion , LV volume , ejection fraction , wall motion thickening , well relate finding change CAC LV area EBCT . The study extend follow cohort additional three year achieve follow specific aim : 1 . To determine , among type 1 diabetic ( T1D ) patient comparable control , risk factor : . 6-year progression electron-beam tomography ( EBT ) define coronary calcification - marker coronary atherosclerosis b . 6-year development myocardial perfusion defect change relative myocardial perfusion reserve define use ECG-gated rest-stress technetium-99m MIBI SPECT image c. 6-year incidence clinical CAD , define fatal non-fatal MI , revascularization angina , well stroke , peripheral artery disease cause-specific mortality . 2 . To develop clinically useful measure insulin sensitivity directly comparable T1D patient non-diabetic person precisely determine role insulin resistance development premature CAC type I diabetes .</detailed_description>
