	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) thrombosis relate disorder major source morbidity mortality United States world . To certain extent disease elderly , majority overt CHD occur person age 65 . Recently , fibrinogen factor VII implicate independent CHD risk factor middle age population , although causative role establish . These study increase understand relationship thrombosis cardiovascular risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1992 , study test hypothesis measure coagulation fibrinolysis correlate incidence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) thrombosis related disorder , identify individual great risk , use Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) Honolulu Heart Program ( HHP ) population . These two genetically distinct population different event rate CHD , offer unique opportunity test association uncover compare result across population . The study examine select measure coagulation fibrinolysis individual 65 year old : measure pro-coagulation ( factor antigen VII , prothrombin fragment 1.2 , fibrinopeptide A thrombin - antithrombin III complex ) , measure coagulation inhibition ( protein C protein S , antithrombin III , lipoprotein associate coagulation inhibitor ( LACI ) , measure fibrinolysis ( plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , tissue plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complex , plasmin-alpha-2 antiplasmin complex , Lp ( ) . A case/control design use determine relationship measurement incidence CHD ( thrombosis relate disorder ) . The short medium term biological variability measure determine aid interpretation observe difference . Finally , distribution measurement establish cohort relationship variable extensive CHS HHP data base ascertain . The study renew 1999 determine inflammation marker time cardiovascular disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
