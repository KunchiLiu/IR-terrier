	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Radiation tumor site surround area may kill tumor cell . It yet know radiation therapy breast alone follow surgery effective radiation therapy breast plus surround tissue treat invasive breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy breast alone see well work compare radiation therapy breast plus surround tissue treat woman undergone surgery early-stage invasive breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival , disease-free survival , isolate local regional disease-free survival , distant disease-free survival woman previously resect , early stage , invasive breast cancer treat breast radiotherapy without regional radiotherapy . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient ( certain participate center ) treat regimen . - Compare cosmetic outcome patient ( certain participate center ) treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number positive node ( 0 vs 1-3 v 3 ) , number axillary node remove ( &lt; 10 , &gt; equal 10 ) ; type chemotherapy ( anthracycline contain vs v none ) , hormonal therapy ( yes v ) , number axillary lymph node excised* , participate center . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . NOTE : * Patients negative sentinel node dissection without axillary dissection stratify accord total number node remove - Arm I : Patients undergo standard breast radiotherapy alone 5 day week 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo breast regional radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Radiotherapy arm begin soon possible randomization . Radiotherapy must begin within 8 week completion adjuvant IV chemotherapy , unless radiotherapy administer concurrently chemotherapy ( i.e. , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , fluorouracil [ CMF ] ) , within 16 week last breast surgery patient treat hormonal therapy alone . Quality life assess ( patient certain participate center ) within 2 week prior randomization , last week radiotherapy , 3 9 month completion radiotherapy , annually first distant disease recurrence . Cosmetic outcome assess ( patient certain participate center ) within 2 week prior randomization , 3 5 year completion radiotherapy first distant disease recurrence . Patients follow 3 , 6 , 9 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 1,822 patient accrue study within approximately 4 year .</detailed_description>
