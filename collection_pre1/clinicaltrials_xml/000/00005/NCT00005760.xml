	<brief_summary>This study woman already decide undergo liposuction Georgetown University Medical Center Washington , D.C. To take part study , woman must first meet plastic surgeon , accept liposuction . This study investigate whether large volume liposuction improve risk factor heart disease overweight woman type 2 ( adult onset ) diabetes , impair glucose tolerance , elevate blood insulin level . Large volume liposuction surgical removal least 10 pound ( 4.5 kg ) body fat , usually abdomen , hip chest . Risk factor heart disease include high blood pressure elevate level blood lipid ( cholesterol triglyceride ) , blood glucose ( sugar ) , blood insulin . Subjects participate part study receive total $ 930.00 . Overweight woman 18 year old high blood insulin level , impair glucose tolerance , type 2 diabetes , plan large volume liposuction perform Georgetown University Medical Center Washington , D.C. , may eligible study . For subject accept study , must first meet plastic surgeon Georgetown University Medical Center , agree perform large volume liposuction . The decision someone suitable liposuction control NIH NIH investigator . Those enrolled undergo follow procedure four separate time - undergoing liposuction , 4 week surgery , 4 month surgery 1 year surgery : - Body measurement - take caliper measure several skinfold thickness ( width fat fold ) tape measure measure circumference part body . - Urine sample 6-hour urine collection - test pregnancy evaluate kidney function . - Glucose tolerance test - measure insulin sensitivity body use sugar , well insulin work , insulin sensitivity . The procedure involve placement two catheter ( thin , flexible tube ) needle vein arm . Sugar water infuse one catheter 20 minute test small amount insulin inject . Blood sample draw catheter frequent interval total 5 hour . - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) echocardiography - measure heart 's electrical activity function . - Abdominal computerized tomography ( CT ) scan - produce image measure body fat abdomen . ( do 4-week visit ) . Takes half hour complete . - DXA X-ray - measure body fat , muscle bone mineral content . Takes half hour complete . - Bod Pod - capsule-like device use determine proportion body weight composed fat non-fat tissue . Takes le 10 minute - Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measure proportion body fat base electrical conduction small electric current . Takes 2-3 minute . - 24-hour blood pressure monitor - device attach blood pressure cuff strap arm measure blood pressure every 15 30 minute continuously 24 hour . - Vascular reactivity test - blood pressure cuff inflate 4 minute deflate , provide information function small blood vessel skin , well idea function level small blood vessel elsewhere body . Takes half hour . - Blood sample - collect evaluate kidney liver function measure body lipid , cholesterol , mineral , substance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Effects Liposuction Overweight Women With Elevated Insulin Levels , Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity major predispose factor future Type 2 diabetes often associate insulin resistance impair glucose tolerance . Insulin resistance suggest common link aspect cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome include hypertension , dyslipidemia , obesity , macrovascular arterial disease . There racial disparity prevalence obesity Type 2 diabetes : Compared non-Hispanic Caucasians , African American woman almost twice prevalence overweight , obesity , Type 2 diabetes . Because data predominantly Caucasian population suggest quantity truncal ( sometimes call upper body ) adipose tissue , include adipose tissue surround abdominal viscera , far important risk stratification find limbs buttock , contain subcutaneous adipose tissue , presume attempt treatment obesity concentrate reduce visceral fat . However , despite great risk complication obesity , African Americans less visceral abdominal adipose tissue Caucasians match body weight . Further , recent metabolic study suggest upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play significant role , particularly African Americans , comorbid metabolic condition associate obesity . With advent large volume liposuction technique , selective removal substantial quantity subcutaneous adipose tissue become possible . It unknown whether complication obesity ameliorate removal subcutaneous adipose tissue , one preliminary study suggest fast hyperinsulinism improve approach . We propose conduct pilot study 10 patient ( five Caucasians five African-Americans ) plan undergo liposuction . We investigate large volume liposuction affect metabolic complication obesity overweight patient hyperinsulinemia , impair glucose tolerance , type 2 diabetes . We investigate effect liposuction various index cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome perform study insulin sensitivity lipid metabolism four time point : large volume liposuction , 1 month liposuction , 4 month liposuction , 1 year liposuction . At visit study body composition , blood pressure , cardiac function , dietary habit , insulin insensitivity , free fatty acid , lipid profile .</detailed_description>
