	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic study identify Factor V Leiden common cause heritable thrombophilia , prothrombotic mutation associate 5 7-fold increase risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . In pre-menopausal woman , use oral contraceptive associate 4-fold increase VTE risk , joint effect oral contraceptive use Factor V Leiden carriership increase VTE risk factor 35 . Recently , result several observational study randomize clinical trial suggest post-menopausal woman , use hormone replacement therapy associate 3-fold increase VTE risk . Whether post-menopausal woman prothrombotic mutation experience similar 20-fold increase risk take post-menopausal hormone remain unknown . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In case-control study , post-menopausal woman first episode objectively confirm venous thromboembolism , population-based control identify recruit GHC enrollment file . Controls frequency match case age calendar-year . Data collection include review ambulatory medical record telephone interview . The GHC computerize pharmacy database use ass exposure hormone replacement therapy . A venous blood specimen obtain consent subject , process aliquots white cell , plasma , red cell , store 70 degree C prior laboratory analysis . DNA extract white cell , molecular genotyping assay conduct assess carriership prothrombotic mutation .</detailed_description>
