	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The International Atherosclerosis Project ( IAP ) quantify atherosclerosis aorta coronary artery 31,000 person age 10 69 die 1960 1965 fifteen city country throughout world . The IAP establish average severity atherosclerosis differ widely many part world difference correlate mortality ischemic heart disease . It also demonstrate fatty streak childhood prevalent severe boys girl . Fibrous plaque generally first appear age 20 30 proportion prevalence ischemic disease adult population . Since result IAP first publish 1968 , research atherosclerosis change greatly gross microscopic morphological method manipulation experimental animal , vitro culture arterial wall cell , application micro-chemical , physical chemical , immunological technique tissue . The use newer technique make possible test hypothesis series change fatty streak age fifteen twenty-five lead typical fibrous plaque test hypothesis lesion fatty streak precede may progress fibrous plaque . The study also test association establish risk factor atherosclerosis early stage lesion progression see young person . The protocol study serve basis protocol develop World Health Organization ( WHO ) Committee Pathobiological Determinants Atherosclerosis Youth . It plan incorporate study WHO study cross-cultural geographic factor could evaluate population high low incidence atherosclerosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A common protocol follow collect risk factor data coronary artery aortas approximately 1,000 autopsy per year three year . Specimens collect preserve standardized way collection center . Data management statistical analysis conduct University Texas San Antonio . The unit Louisiana State University compose three central laboratory : lipid biochemistry center ; coronary heart disease risk factor center ; gross morphology center . The morphometry central laboratory locate Ohio State University . Administration coordination direct University Chicago University Illinois . In addition serve collection center , many center carry individual research project . At University Alabama Birmingham , two separate relate investigation conduct : Dr. Miller analyze various collagen solubilizing peptide fraction isolate peptide via chromatography ; Dr . Gay use monoclonal antibody define distribution various collagen atheromatous lesion . At West Virginia University Dr. Jagannathan , study isomeric fatty acid proteoglycans . Dr. Reichenbach University Washington study distribution immunocytochemical marker smooth muscle cell differentiation leukocyte subpopulation coronary artery well searched viral DNA plaque . At Baylor , three-dimensional distribution lipid inclusion , macrophage , smooth muscle cell coronary artery determine digital fluorescence . Dr. Mergner University Maryland collect specimen immediate autopsy program provide specimen free autolysis . He also perform transmission scan electron microscopy , X-ray microanalysis , lipid analysis , immunofluorescence immunoperoxidase procedure define calcium content cytoskeletal component . Dr. Virmani Vanderbilt determine role biogenic amine histamine , serotonin , catecholamine atherosclerosis correlate content amine presence mast cell adventitia . In 1988 , two regular research grant award part multicenter study . The grant Southwest Foundation Biomedical Research determine genotype subject respect restriction fragment length polymorphism apolipoprotein LDL receptor gene use Southern blot analysis DNA liver sample send collection center . It also type subject apo E isoform genotype use oligonucleotide probe . The grant Ohio State University correlate 3-D coronary axial geometry pathology . Some major question address study include : whether fatty streak progress fibrous plaque transitional lesion ; morphometric biochemical lesion change indicate progression ; frequency feature insudative proliferative lesion may portend progressive disease ; sex difference lesion ; whether immune complex viral infection implicate . In FY 1991 , six grant award title `` Risk Factors Early Human Atherogenesis '' ( RFEHA ) . The purpose extend ongoing PDAY : obtain adequate number female case risk factor association could accurately detect study ; increase power study general detect association risk factor raise lesion , begin appear age group ; increase power study detect genetic influence atherosclerosis . REFHA add 1,400 new specimen 1,800 case already collect PDAY achieve approximately 3,000 total specimen . Emphasis place female case provide best opportunity study transition lesion fatty streaks fibrous plaque . In 1998 , NHLBI award R24HL60808 five year provide maintain archive human cardiovascular tissue use United States international investigator study human atherosclerosis . The investigator , part PDAY RFEHA , assemble autopsy material ( mostly aorta coronary artery , tissue include liver , serum , adipose tissue ) 3,000 Black white male female . These autopsy individual age 15 34 obtain within 48 hour death . The grant cardiovascular specimen data library renew July 2007 .</detailed_description>
