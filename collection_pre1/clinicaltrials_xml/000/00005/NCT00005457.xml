	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : In previous work investigator develop Disturbed Highest Derivative Polynomial ( DHDP ) model-free time curve publish theoretical development use overall time curve linear Gaussian model longitudinal data fix covariate effect autocorrelated error without subject effect . For logistic model , DHDP would replace constant appear log odds non-longitudinal case . The first-order DHDP straight line whose slope receive random disturbance time . As , capable fitting rich variety arbitrarily change time curve . The second-order DHDP would generally provide fit small high frequency variation . There number longitudinal data analysis method currently available Gaussian binary-logistic data . They common requirement explicitly model overall time curve -- usually low order deterministic polynomial . The main significance proposal represent overall time curve DHDP , thereby allow possibility fit arbitrarily change time curve without explicitly model form change time . The order DHDP select modification Akaike Information Criterion . The Poisson model useful fitting periodic report incidence rare disease . The relationship DHDP Smoothing Polynomial Spline ( SPS ) show method develop use SPS instead DHDP analysis . Robustness method examine computer simulation study evaluate compare ability DHDP SPS model estimate covariate effect time curve time curve generate process DHDP . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
