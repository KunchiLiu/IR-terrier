	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent study associate evidence Chlamydia pneumoniae infection coronary carotid atherosclerosis evidence increase infection cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) patient develop restenosis atherosclerosis . Several common pathogen less consistently associate atherosclerosis . Altered parameter inflammation hemostasis identify prognostic factor myocardial infarction link possible pathogenetic mechanism . Recent study indicate peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient coronary artery disease frequently include Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA stimulation PBMCs reflect unsuccessful host cellular immune response CMV associate elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study nest case-control design nest cohort design within Strong Heart Study ( SHS ) , ongoing cohort study 4,549 American Indians . The study utilize previously collect specimen , baseline data , ultrasound measurement carotid wall thickness ( IMT ) SHS participant . Within initial SHS cohort , 400 definite case incident myocardial infarction , coronary heart disease , stroke compare 400 control individual diagnosis match age , gender , residence . Their prior serum specimen analyzed Chlamydia pneumoniae-specific IgG , IgM antibody , cytomegalovirus-specific IgG antibody , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . In addition , assay perform antibody Helicobacter pylorus , hepatitis A virus , ( HAV ) herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) type 1 2 . Correlations make baseline parameter lipid , coagulation , adjust potential confounding variable tobacco use , pneumonia , alter pulmonary function . An additional analysis subcohort , 400 control , perform look outcome carotid IMT , parameter subclinical atherosclerosis , relation serologic result indicate prior exposure CMV , Chlamydia pneumoniae , and/or pathogen approximately eight year precede ultrasound testing . Both case-control cohort analysis stratify level hemostasis inflammation , include CRP , fibrinogen , Lp ( ) , plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 . A separate nest substudy perform peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , prospectively collect 80 case 80 control , examines host T-cell proliferative response CMV pathogens relation disease also search chronic persistent infection Chlamydia pneumoniae evidence DNA detection . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
