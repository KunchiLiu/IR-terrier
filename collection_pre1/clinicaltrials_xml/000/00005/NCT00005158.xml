	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There two general hypothesis nature genetic component hypertension . A single gene hypothesis visualize hypertension specific disease entity determine autosomal dominant incompletely dominant allele little environmental effect . A polygenic hypothesis view hypertension determine large number genetic environmental factor operate independently roughly equal contribution . The evidence support single gene hypothesis base primarily bimodal trimodal distribution blood pressure population . It suggest bimodal trimodal distribution result ascertainment bias . The evidence support polygenic model base several study distribution blood pressure unimodal often skew toward high value population first degree relative hypertensive individual . These skewed distribution approximately normalized use log transformation . In study , particular effort make detect major gene . A major gene say exist particular sample appreciable amount variability trait sample due segregation allele single locus . The presence major gene preclude existence genetic environmental effect . In last decade three general model propose detect presence major gene . The transmission probability model general model genetic analysis pedigree data test Mendelian segregation ratio generalization traditional method segregation analysis . This model little power differentiate single gene polygenic inheritance although may able detect kind non-single gene transmission . This method extend allow analysis multivariate trait , test wide variety hypothesis concern mode transmission various ascertainment correction . Major gene identify model include hypercholesterolemia , dopamine-beta-hydroxylase , catechol-o-methytransferase . The mixed model include single locus multi-locus component design distinguish two . The model assume transmission one generation next accounted classical polygenic inheritance due segregation allele single locus . It ideal detect major gene presence polygenic inheritance provide type transmission occur . This model extend include environmental correlation among sib . Major locus identify model include PTC , IgE congenital glaucoma . The unified model mixed model single locus component parameterized term transmission probability , combination two previous model . Several research group develop methodology overcome computational difficulty present combined model . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study divide two part , analysis methodology application methodology genetic analysis hypertension . In first part study , power , robustness , validity three genetic model segregation linkage analysis consider : transmission probability model ; mixed model ; unify model also mixed model single locus component parameterized term transmission probability . The method segregation linkage analysis find satisfactory applied analysis data five large pedigree collaboration Wright State University analysis ten large pedigree ascertain part Bogalusa Heart Study . A determination make effect partition large family nuclear family perform segregation linkage nuclear family . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
