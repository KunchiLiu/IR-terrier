	<brief_title>Isocyanate Antigens T Cells That Cause Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Isocyanates group highly reactive widely use low-molecular weight chemical , commonly report cause occupation asthma develop country . Yet , mechanisms isocyanate cause asthma well define . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study investigate isocyanate antigen-driven T-cell response vitro- , follow vivo exposure use patient sample acquire collaboration ongoing field epidemiological clinical study . The study compare isocyanate antigen-reactive T-cells primary exposure sit ( skin/lung ) blood , evaluate potential route sensitization identify diagnostic indicator isocyanate sensitivity/susceptibility . Specifically , study : generates characterize hexamethylene diisocyanate ( HDI ) antigens include isocyanate metabolite , isocyanate conjugate normal human foreign protein ; evaluate T-cell antigenicity HDI antigens , base blood lung lymphocyte proliferation , cytokine production , phenotype order identify molecular form HDI initiate airway cytokine production asthma patient ; establish T-cell line skin , lung peripheral blood HDI asthma patient characterize phenotype , antigen specificity , cytokine production TCR expression isocyanate responsive T-cells different compartment ; compare isocyanate responsive T-cells found skin , lung blood correlate clinical sensitivity determine characteristic associated exposure sensitization lead clinical asthma . The study renew FY 2002 extend follow-up analysis March 2007 .</detailed_description>
