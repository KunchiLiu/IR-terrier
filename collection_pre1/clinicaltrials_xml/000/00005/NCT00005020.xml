	<brief_summary>The purpose study monitor patient recently infect HIV order learn immune system respond HIV infection study virus multiplies body . Patients infected HIV recently consider acute , early , HIV infection . During period , viral load ( level HIV body ) rise sharply high level first decrease significantly . Doctors sure decrease viral load happen body able accomplish . In study , patient acute HIV infection monitor doctor study immune system try learn rise fall viral load .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two theory offer possible explanation early decline viral load see acute HIV infection . The first CD4 target cell number deplete , reduction permissive target cell limit viral replication . A second host develop HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) immune response limit viral replication initial high viral titer . Consequently , enhance clearance HIV-infected cell result decline plasma HIV RNA . This study examine latter theory characterize viral immune dynamic blood lymph node HIV-infected patient . Cohort I ( HIV-negative volunteer ) : At study entry medical history physical exam perform , volunteer complete questionnaire . Blood sample draw weekly Week 12 , Weeks 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Volunteers follow 24 week . Volunteers offer opportunity participate lymphoid tissue substudy , involve one four sequential gut-associated lymphoid biopsy . Compensation travel inconvenience study participation provide . Cohort II : At study entry patient history physical exam perform , volunteer complete questionnaire . Volunteers rise plasma HIV RNA first three visit frequent sample blood physical exam two year . Volunteers continue follow thereafter every 6 month 5 year study duration . Volunteers offer opportunity participate lymphoid tissue substudy and/or lymphoid kinetics substudy . These substudies require hospitalization 24 hour less tissue biopsy glucose infusion . Compensation travel inconvenience study participation provide</detailed_description>
