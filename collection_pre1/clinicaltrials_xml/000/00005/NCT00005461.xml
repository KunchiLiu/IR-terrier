	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The treatment childhood asthma increasingly entail self-management important factor influence course disease . The study identify subgroups child increase risk misinterpreting , thus mismanage , pulmonary function . Identification characteristic high risk child form basis subsequent development intervention program improve symptom self-perception , thereby enhance child 's ability participate effectively self-management asthma . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The specific hypothesis test cross-sectional prevalence study : 1 ) great validity self-perceived symptom associate less functional morbidity asthma ; 2 ) specific psychological asthma-related determinant affected sensitivity specificity symptom perception child asthma ; 3 ) perception respiratory symptom measurable characteristic could evaluate term reliability validity ; 4 ) perceptual accuracy natural clinical set significantly relate perceptual ability measure laboratory . Investigation objective use study validity self-perception symptom relation clinical status . Children age 8-15 make subjective estimate asthma severity immediately prior pulmonary function test multiple time live either summer camp child asthma long-term asthma treatment center . The correspondence subjective objective measure pulmonary function clinical environment compare result obtain laboratory use threshold detection add resistive load . The sensitivity specificity asthmatic child 's self-assessment symptom state quantify related retrospectively risk functional morbidity . Cognitive ability , anxiety level , tendency toward repression , locus control , familial factor investigate regard role determinant sensitivity specificity symptom self-perception measure pulmonary function . The stability individual pattern self-perception study longitudinally annual repeat evaluation among child return camp rehospitalized . The study three-component research plan renew fiscal year 1997 . Component 1 strengthen understand psychologic physiologic correlate perceptual ability . A positive association expect perceptual accuracy ) intelligence ; b ) attention ; c ) symptom focus ; ) systemic steroid use ; e ) predominantly large airway mixed airway involvement . Component 2 explore relationship chemosensitivity resistive-load perception high risk pediatric asthma patient . It hypothesize , compare asthmatic control , adolescent near fatal asthma attack ) high threshold detect resistive load ; b ) decrease response progressive isocapneic hypoxia ; c ) small increase respiratory drive progressive hypercapnia . Component 3 characterize family self-management pattern moderate variable perception morbidity . It hypothesize ) symptom perception interact family asthma management relation asthma morbidity b ) poor symptom perception associate bad medication compliance ; c ) well family function relate well perception lower functional morbidity . Methodologic approach include naturalistic clinical accuracy protocol ; laboratory study use computerized resistive-loading apparatus determine perceptual threshold ; chemosensitivity protocol investigate drive ; family assessment interview , computerize meter dose inhaler technology ass compliance asthma medication .
