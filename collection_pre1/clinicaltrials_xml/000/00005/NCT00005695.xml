	<brief_title>Physical Training Blood Pressure High Risk Youths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : There two specific aim . The first test hypothesis control physical training ( PT ) reduce blood pressure , rest reaction forehead cold exercise stressor , 8-9 year old high blood pressure body fatness . Subjects divide equally gender blood pressure body fatness . Subjects divide equally gender ethnicity ( black/white ) . Both rest reactive blood pressure correlate leave ventricular mass predictive future essential hypertension . The underlying hemodynamic regulator blood pressure , cardiac output total peripheral resistance , measure impedance cardiography explore hemodynamic mechanism train favorable influence blood pressure leave ventricular mass . The second aim test hypothesis physical training reduce percent body fat , measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) . Children 70th percentile blood pressure fatness randomly assign , within ethnicity gender , physical training wait list control group . After physical training group underwent four month train , subject retested data use test primary hypothesis . The initial control subject perform four month physical training , retested . The data second phase add data initial physical training group explore interaction train gender ethnicity . The initial physical training group bring back four month cessation train see change elicit training reversible . To document stimulation provide training , heart rate monitor training session . To observe time course change full lab test session , skinfolds rest blood pressure measure monthly . Diet free live physical activity assess help explain change body composition . Aerobic fitness measure treadmill test maximal oxygen consumption .</detailed_description>
