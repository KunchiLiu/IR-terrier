	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity rebeccamycin analog therapy advance breast cancer administer two different treatment schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity associate administration rebeccamycin analog therapy woman advance breast cancer . II . To evaluate topoisomerase I II level human lymphocytes follow treatment rebeccamycin analog . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV 60 minute day 1 . Arm II : Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV 60 minute day 1-5 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
