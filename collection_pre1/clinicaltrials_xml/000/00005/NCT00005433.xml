	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A multitude coronary angiographic trial conduct use various endpoint measure base repeat coronary angiogram . Relative coronary event trial , angiographic trial require small sample size reduce trial length . While trial assume angiographic endpoint valid surrogate measure clinical coronary event , assumption completely test . Although several coronary angiographic endpoint available trial outcome , single method uniformly accept optimal . Because , utility validity coronary angiographic progression predict future clinical coronary event remain unsettled . The recent advent carotid ultrasonography assess arterial intima-media thickness ( IMT ) offer excite potential noninvasive measure atherosclerosis . Because noninvasiveness , carotid IMTallows extension anti-atherosclerotic trial asymptomatic frail subject , coronary angiography might medically unethical . Because currently limit support association carotid IMT clinical event coronary atherosclerosis , validity carotid IMT potential surrogate either endpoint establish . The Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study ( CLAS ) coronary angiographic trial test efficacy colestipol-niacin therapy 188 nonsmoking , 40-59 year old men previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery . Coronary artery atherosclerosis change evaluate human consensus panel quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) . In addition , B-mode ultrasounds common carotid artery conduct every six month provide measure carotid IMT . Since competion two-year CLAS study , subject follow 12 year . This long term follow-up CLAS cohort permit examination appropriateness angiographic ultrasound arterial endpoint predictor subsequent clinical coronary event . Angiographic ultrasound ( carotid IMT ) endpoints also allow test association various serial measure atherosclerotic progression . The result analyse provide important information validity measure , current use trial endpoint , surrogates clinical coronary event . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use angiographic ultrasound carotid intima medial thickness endpoint test association various serial measure atherosclerotic progression subsequent coronary heart disease .</detailed_description>
