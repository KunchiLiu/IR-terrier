	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sudden unexplained death sleep ( SUDS ) lead cause death young men several Asian population . The immediate cause ventricular fibrillation absence know disease . A strong environmental component may infer regional nature SUDS group culturally genetically distinct rapid decline rate SUDS migration Southeast ( SE ) Asian refugee United States . Risk SUDS rise sharply peak among men age 35 year age , decline increase age . In pilot study SE Asian refugee men Thailand high know risk SUDS , investigator document high-prevalences prolonged heart rate correct QT interval ( QTc ) , thiamine deficiency , hypokalemia , positive association poor thiamine status , measure erythrocyte transketolase activity ( ETK ) , QTc . These limited study unable precisely quantify relationship QTc thiamine status , lack sufficient power examine relationship QTc hypokalemia , include electrolyte , address striking difference risk SUDS sex age . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cross-sectional design . During 14-month period , informed consent obtain subject select age-stratified random sample refugee schedule routine medical screening . Blood sample , 12-lead 24-hour ECGs , interview data collect test follow hypothesis : ( 1 ) mean QTc great men woman , ( 2 ) mean QTc great men age 30-39 year men young old ; similar relationship expect among woman , ( 3 ) QTc positively correlate poor thiamine status , measure erythrocyte transketolase activity , ( 4-6 ) QTc negatively correlate serum level potassium , magnesium , total calcium , ( 7 ) QTc associate abnormality autonomic control heart , indicate power spectral analysis heart rate variability . Secondary aim include study interaction thiamine status electrolytes prolongation QTc , dynamic analysis QT variation heart rate level 24-hr ECGs , collection blood specimen later genetic study</detailed_description>
