	<brief_title>Mechanisms Underlying Abnormal Ambulatory BP Patterns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The blood pressure significant percentage hypertensive population , normotensive population high risk development hypertension ( Blacks older individual ) , sodium ( salt ) -dependent . That say , increase intake salt increase blood pressure individual ; conversely , importantly , decrease intake salt reduce blood pressure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator believe mechanisms responsible sodium-dependent blood pressure indirectly link race , sex , age . Their research consistent hypothesis sodium-dependent blood pressure control result decreased responsiveness renal adrenal blood pressure regulatory system . This produce abnormal daily blood pressure pattern , reduce fluctuation result extended period increase blood pressure . The increased cardiovascular load lead early development cardiovascular renal disease , include hypertension . They test hypothesis identify 'high risk ' 'normal risk ' subject base renal response sodium restriction . The subject equal number healthy male female , Blacks white , age 55-70 year . Using innovative approach , examine influence risk status 24-hour pattern blood pressure , hormonal activity , sodium handling . Finally , determine clinical significance profile examine change cardiac renal status two-year follow-up . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
