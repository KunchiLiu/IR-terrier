	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose tipifarnib patient recurrent progressive malignant glioma receive enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug . ( Stratum II phase I portion study close accrual effective 07/16/2001 . ) ( Phase I complete effective 10/2/2001 . ) ( Phase II open patient require resection provide surgical tissue sample [ effective 3/13/2003 ] . ) - Define safety pharmacokinetic profile drug patient population . - Assess evidence antitumor activity drug patient . - Assess evidence inhibition farnesyl protein transferase ( FTase ) peripheral blood monocyte surrogate endpoint effective biologic activity drug patient . - Determine efficacy drug measure 6-month progression-free survival objective tumor response patient . - Evaluate safety profile drug patient . - Correlate treatment response inhibition FTase peripheral blood monocyte patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord pretreatment medication ( receive enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug [ EIAEDs ] v receive EIAEDs without steroid ) . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . - Phase I ( complete 10/2/2001 ) : Cohorts 3-6 patient stratum II receive escalate dos tipifarnib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . ( Stratum II phase I portion study close accrual effective 07/16/2001 . ) - Phase II ( open patient require resection provide surgical tissue sample [ effective 3/13/2003 ] ) : Once MTD determine , additional patient glioblastoma multiforme stratum II accrue receive treatment tipifarnib recommend phase II dose . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month progression . Patients follow every 4 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 30 patient ( 15 per stratum ) accrue phase I portion study within 10 month . ( Stratum II phase I portion study close accrual effective 07/16/2001 . ) ( Phase I complete effective 10/2/2001 . ) A total 24 patient glioblastoma multiforme stratum II accrue phase II portion study . ( Phase II open patient require resection provide surgical tissue sample [ effective 3/13/2003 ] . )</detailed_description>
