	<brief_title>Genetic Epidemiology Blood Lipids Obesity - Ancillary NGHS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The National Growth Health Study , NGHS , epidemiologic study 2,379 black white girl , age 9-10 year entry , follow annually . The ancillary study potential identifying gene involve determine Black/white difference lipid metabolism obesity . This exciting area virtually available information . Finally , study permit examination effect gene variation change quantitative level blood lipid well body fat different stage pubescence since NGHS protocol include annual anthropometric maturation assessment biannual blood lipid determination along extensive environmental measure include dietary , household , psychosocial information . The study unique rare opportunity genetic analysis large cohort two ethnic group child rich data base available . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study independent research project ancillary NGHS utilized extensive biological environmental information available NGHS core data base . Blood sample obtain 1,133 girl see followup examination Year 7 order determine genotype loci know implicated lipid metabolism obesity . Both protein [ apolipoproteins C-II , D , E LP ( ) ] DNA [ apolipoprotein B , lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , LDL receptor ] analyze . The distribution genetic variation within ethnic group determine . At candidate gene locus , genotype effect estimate quantitative level apolipoproteins lipoprotein , also degree distribution body fat adjust concomitant variable ( age , biologic maturation stage adiposity ) within ethnic group . By compare frequency genotype candidate locus , allelic effect assess well impact blood lipid obesity development Black white female . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
