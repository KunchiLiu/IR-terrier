	<brief_title>ILX-295501 Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response patient refractory stage III IV ovarian epithelial cancer treat ILX-295501 . II . Determine number patient least 50 % decrease CA125 treat regimen . III . Determine time tumor progression , overall survival , toxicity profile patient population treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral ILX-295501 weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week maximum 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 month every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
