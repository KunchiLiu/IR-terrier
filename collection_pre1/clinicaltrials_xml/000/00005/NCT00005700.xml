	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The African-American population United States continue experience high rate mortality cardiovascular ( CV ) disease , include coronary heart disease , stroke renal failure . The major syndrome determine CV risk , include obesity , hypercholesterolemia , glucose intolerance , hypertension , occur frequently among African Americans . Nutritional factor underlie many form CV disease important focus current prevention effort . Very little currently know , however , specific nutritional pattern among African Americans might lead CV risk , applicability structure intervention . The study conduct response initiative `` Collaborative Projects Minority Health '' release October 1992 review approval September 1992 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Given grow recognition importance total fat , point view disease risk eat pattern , primary focus intervention reduce percentage calorie diet fat . Four hundred household recruit randomly assign either active intervention observation group period 18 month . Dietary change consistent specific recommendation make American public reduce cardiovascular ( CV ) risk encourage , namely , reduction total fat , saturate fat ( SFA ) , cholesterol ( Chol ) . A practical , community-based program developed could take household . Nutrition education enhancement skill helpful make behavioral change form basis intervention . Lay educator , recruit target neighborhood , work close supervision community nutritionist . Changes report dietary intake , serum lipids/lipoproteins body weight measure . In addition formal evaluation trial outcome , important secondary goal obtain detailed information eat pattern community characterize behavior associate achievement maintenance target nutrient goal .
