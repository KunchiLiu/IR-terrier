	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study utilize extremely rich source data collect Wisconsin Sleep Cohort , one large cohort study SDB one long period follow-up , address broad array question relate pathogenesis risk SDB general community . The data-set obtain 1988 1998 population 1400 worker age 30 60 year , include overnight sleep polysomnographic in-lab study conduct two occasion eight year period . The dataset contain computerized analysis 300,000 apneas hypopnea non-clinical population . Although strong association demonstrate sleep disordered breathing cardiovascular disease , much know regard mechanism SDB produce blood pressure change increase morbidity . Further analysis polysomnography blood pressure data could yield important insight physiologic event responsible cardiovascular morbidity . Such information could use develop diagnostic test identify people high risk thus might especially benefit intervention . This would potentially great public health importance , give prevalence SDB availability treatment SDB . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator use computerized database Wisconsin Sleep Cohort answer follow specific question . What physiologic characteristic SDB event non-clinical population term severity , high airway resistance , obstructive central component associate after-effects EEG arousal ventilatory overshoot ? Did important element SDB event change SDB progress time ? Did ventilatory cardiovascular consequence apnea hypopnea immediate aftermath determine likelihood subsequent sleep-disordered breathing event ? 2 . What immediate long-term cardiovascular consequence sleep-disordered breathing event ; characteristic SDB event ( oxygen desaturation , arousal , ventilatory overshoot airway resistance , etc . ) determine cardiovascular response consequence ? 3 . What effect age SDB sequela study truly healthy elderly ? 4 . What role anatomical characteristic upper airway play determine frequency severity type sleep-disordered breathing ? Did anatomical determinant differ general non-clinical population versus obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) population ? ... obese versus non-obese ? Organization respond study non-FDAAA applicable accept transfer organization .</detailed_description>
