	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study great practical importance asthma common condition ( 3-5 percent population ) recent , unexplained rise morbidity mortality . Many previous epidemiological study focus predictor hospitalization people asthma see emergency room . These study limit value practice physician see vast majority patient asthma . Results study , first time , enable profile construct high risk patient asthma include identification modifiable risk factor . These result use physician patient education program well target medical intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study develop key piece information need outpatient care patient asthma ; profile patient risk severe , potentially life-threatening exacerbation asthma . The experimental design prospective study 800 patient asthma draw large , pre-paid health care plan . The key advantage population care occur within health plan . Characteristics identify included demographic factor , socioeconomic status ; patient characteristic tobacco use , atopy , pattern medication use , self-reporting compliance/adherence , attitude asthma ; historical assessment indoor air quality ; characteristic asthma duration asthma , lung function , variation asthma symptom ; speciality physician . The outcome measure obtain three year period include episode hospital-based care include hospitalization , emergency room visit , urgency care clinic visit . Based data , model develop assigned relative risk independent variable . These model validate subset population . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
