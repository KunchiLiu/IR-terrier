	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The rationale prevention derive mass nature adult cardiovascular disease affluent society , insidious development underlie process , particularly hypertension atherosclerosis , high immediate out-of hospital mortality coronary disease stroke , long-term excessive risk survival initial episode . The potential preventive approach cardiovascular disease base large difference disease rate find population strong association individual risk factor level disease rate within high risk culture . The congruence population observation clinical evidence plausible mechanism cause , strengthen inference causal importance . Further , safety feasibility well establish modify individual ' cardiovascular risk characteristic change personal health behavior medical educational strategy . Finally , dynamic nature change vital statistic death report hypertension , stroke , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) many nation , rate one two percent year great , upward downward , indicated preventability , though none trend adequately explain study begin 1980 . The rationale population community-wide strategy , Minnesota Heart Health Program , contrast high-risk individual , medical approach , base consideration , plus demonstration entire population excess risk relative others . Focusing solely portion high risk people among high risk culture appear necessary medical part community-wide prevention approach , insufficient inefficient sole major public health strategy . This mainly bulk attributable ( excess ) case cardiovascular disease come large central part population distribution risk , tail . The socially learn behavior lead precursor cardiovascular disease also mass phenomenon , require population strategy prevention health promotion . Finally , concentration preventive effort among high risk adult tend ignore mass emergence youth early adulthood bear physical characteristic excess risk already well-developed unhealthy behavior . Therefore , rational effective public health strategy would appear one direct toward age segment community , sustained period , ultimate objective prevent elevate risk risky behavior first place . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Three pair community select , pair one education one control community . Communities match size distance Minneapolis-St. Paul pair similar median income , education , health care , medium resource . The first pair , Mankato Winona , small agricultural community approximately 40,000 population 1980 . The second pair , Fargo , North Dakota Moorhead , Minnesota pair Sioux Falls , South Dakota , medium-sized urban center approximately 100,000 population . Bloomington Roseville , Minnesota suburban center Twin Cities metropolitan area population approximately 80,000 . The education program begin Mankato 1981 two baseline survey , Fargo-Moorhead 1982 three baseline survey , Bloomington 1983 four baseline survey . Education activity continue three community five year conclude stag manner begin . Targeted risk factor include blood pressure , exercise habit , smoking , blood cholesterol level . Health message communicate involvement community leader organization , medium education , population-based risk factor screen education , adult education class , youth parent education disseminate school , health professional 's educa0tion , community-wide risk factor education campaign . The effectiveness program evaluate annual population survey sample cross-sections cohort morbidity mortality surveillance . The annual risk factor survey measure community individual change risk factor related behavior 25-74 year old person live six site . Annual survey include 300-500 person population-based , random , neighborhood cluster sample town . Selected household invited participate . A home interview conduct collect data health belief , attitude , behavior , medical history , health message exposure , demographic characterization . After home interview , participant additional risk factor measurement survey center . Data collect height , weight , blood pressure , serum total HDL cholesterol , serum thiocyanate . In community , 50 percent sample subject assess dietary habit 50 percent physical activity . Morbidity mortality data myocardial infarction stroke collect analyzed Minnesota Heart Health Program area mortality data Minnesota , North Dakota , South Dakota . Computer classification algorithm develop jointly Pawtucket Heart Health Program Stanford Five-City Multifactor Risk Reduction Program allow pool data three study . All hospitalized case myocardial infarction stroke investigated cause death validate cardiovascular disease death occur out-of-hospital . Deaths occur throughout Minnesota , North South Dakota catalogue . Hospital disease surveillance carry cooperation 34 area hospital . Mortality ascertain death certificate count tape supply three State Health Departments . Morbidity mortality data compare pooled education versus pool comparison community mortality data compare remain area three state .</detailed_description>
