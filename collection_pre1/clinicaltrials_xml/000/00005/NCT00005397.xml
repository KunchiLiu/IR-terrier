	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The atherosclerotic process begin childhood advance adult life occlusive vascular disease result coronary heart disease , stroke peripheral vascular disease . Although risk factor establish adult population , risk factor measure childhood directly relate morbidity mortality occlusive atherosclerotic disease . The ultrasonographic measurement carotid artery intimal-medial thickness ( IMT ) adult relate risk stroke also severity atherosclerotic disease coronary artery . In 1970 , population school age child adolescent first examine Muscatine , Iowa , since follow examine predictive value childhood risk factor level cardiovascular disease . See also Study 906 ( Muscatine Heart Study ) . The study provide view significance IMT young adult relationship risk factor childhood young adulthood also familial factor may responsible accelerated atherosclerosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1995 , longitudinal study examine follow : 1 ) relationship body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure , total cholesterol , smoke behavior measure childhood IMT measure early adulthood ; 2 ) relationship risk factor ( BMI , blood pressure , total cholesterol , LDL-C , HDL-C , Apo A1 , Apo B , Lp ( ) , Apo E genotype , glucose insulin smoking ) IMT young adult ; 3 ) relationship risk factor 'load ' childhood adult life IMT ; 4 ) relationship IMT young adult familial mortality first- second-degree relative due vascular disease ; 5 ) degree familial aggregation IMT young adult parent . The study renew FY 2000 investigate third generation Muscatine Heart Study cohort . The renewal determine whether offspring cohort member premature atherosclerosis familial history cardiovascular disease increase carotid intimal-medial thickness ( IMT ) elevate risk factor , identify risk factor progression carotid IMT , measure putative riskfactors increase IMT ( serologic evidence Chlamydia pneumoniae cytomegalovirus infection , high sensitivity C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 glycosylated hemoglobin ) . The study extend June 2008 measure intimal-medial thickness vascular bed affect early atherosclerosis , distal abdominal aorta , well carotid artery . In 662 offspring , age 11 32 year , investigator determine aortic carotid intimal-medial thickness relate , relationship cardiovascular risk factor aortic intimal-medial thickness progression carotid intimal-medial thickness , relationship aortic carotid intimal-medial thickness offspring subclinical clinical disease parent .</detailed_description>
