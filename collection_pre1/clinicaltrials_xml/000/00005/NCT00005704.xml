	<brief_title>Pharmacologic Intervention Postcessation Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite potential importance weight gain smoking relapse , 1991 virtually success eliminating , even reduce , weight gain follow smoke cessation . Two promise pharmacologic method reduce postcessation weight gain nicotine gum over-the-counter drug , phenylpropanolamine gum ( [ PPA ] . However , relative efficacy two drug never evaluate mechanisms action drug weight gain unknown . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator determine efficacy nicotine gum phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) gum relative placebo reduction postcessation weight gain throughout 13-week combined behavioral pharmacologic treatment program . Following cessation drug end treatment , monitor long-term effect drug body weight 6- 12-month follow-up . They also determine mechanism action nicotine gum PPA gum ( viz. , change dietary intake , physical activity , metabolic rate ) change weight course treatment evaluate withdrawal symptom smoke cessation moderate either nicotine gum PPA gum use course treatment . Finally , investigate whether PPA nicotine gum produce incremental effect smoke cessation ( relative placebo gum ) sample female smoker high risk postcessation weight gain posttest 6- 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
