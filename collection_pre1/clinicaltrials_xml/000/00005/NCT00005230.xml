	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program multicenter control clinical trial support NHLBI study cardiovascular psychological effect isolate systolic hypertension elderly determine efficacy evaluate possible adverse effect drug treatment condition . A total 4,736 patient follow 1991 . Elderly individual isolate systolic hypertension clearly increase risk heart attack stroke . This group show pilot study also high prevalence carotid disease low extremity arterial disease . Selected risk factor old age , male sex , smoke find related increase prevalence disease . This study allow validation initial observation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study ancillary Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) clinical trial . Participants SHEP University Pittsburgh use hypertensive population . Patients screen SHEP reject normal blood pressure use control . Carotid disease assess duplex scanning , noninvasive technique combine real time B-mode ultrasound Doppler ultrasound , produce system capable vessel image analysis blood flow characteristic . Other evaluation include ankle systolic blood pressure measurement detect low extremity arterial disease , complete history physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood lipoprotein level , fast insulin glucose level , hemoglobin , hematocrit . Thus , effect various risk factor development carotid atherosclerosis evaluate well relationship carotid atherosclerosis peripheral arterial disease low extremity . The first six month study consist preparation reproducibility test duplex scan measurement . During follow three year , duplex scan evaluation complete 400 participant . During final half fourth year , first 100 duplex scan hypertensive participant repeat determine whether possible measure disease progression use methodology . The study begin FY 1988 R29HL39871 continue FY 1993 R01HL50439 . The study renew 1998 additional three year June , 2003 . The study continue investigate prevalence prognostic value subclinical atherosclerosis Pittsburgh SHEP cohort cohort normotensive control . Annual telephone follow-up remain 178 SHEP participant 168 control continue . A final clinic visit include measure coronary aortic calcification use electron beam compute tomography ( CT ) , pulse wave velocity measure aortic stiffening cognitive function test . For Pittsburgh SHEP cohort , antihypertensive treatment effect striking event rate active placebo group continue diverge beyond end SHEP . Successful demonstration treatment effect coronary calcium score would first randomize data show antihypertensive effect directly coronary artery . Risk factor coronary calcification evaluate , produce data type yet available literature old adult collect ongoing study elderly . The added measure vascular stiffness supplement extensive data subclinical atherosclerosis already available cohort . The extent measure predict cardiovascular event evaluate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
