	<brief_title>Physiological Psychosocial Correlates Type A Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Type A behavior pattern describe Friedman Rosenman characterize extremes competitiveness , easily arouse hostility , sense urgency aggression . In 1981 Review Panel Coronary Prone Behavior Coronary Heart Disease conclude Type A behavior pattern associate increase risk coronary heart disease . Studies challenge independent predictive value behavior pattern respect coronary heart disease . There need develop physiological measurement relate coronary-prone behavior reexamine stability psychological assessment . It hypothesize Type A behavior component hostility might associate state chronic , generalize sympathetic-adrenal arousal . Preliminary research conduct interpersonal dynamic correlate Type A behavior among married couple . Research need whether certain type marriage , accord Type A/B classification two spouse , pathogenic others . Additional research also need component global Type A pattern primary importance risk factor coronary disease , component endure , transient , situationally relate .

The correlation among heart rate , pupil size , blood pressure , plasma platelet catecholamine measure determine relationship report global health , chronic disease , functional disability level . The five-year predictability test report global health , chronic disease , functional disability measure global component Type A behavior . Tests make difference chronic acute sympathetic-adrenal response , assess platelet plasma catecholamine , pupil size , heart rate , blood pressure , among married couple different combination Structured Interview global component Type A classification . The five year marital stability health couple follow . A comparison make one week test-retest reliability five year stability Structured Interview global component Type A measure . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
