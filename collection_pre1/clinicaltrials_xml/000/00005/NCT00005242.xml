	<brief_title>Childhood Passive Smoking : Cohort Study Cardiac Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The adverse health effect actively inhale cigarette smoke include impaired pulmonary function , increase coronary cerebrovascular disease , chronic pulmonary disease , cancer . Infants young child smoke parent increase risk lower respiratory tract infection small airway disease child non-smoking parent . What less clear oxygen transport system grow child affected long-term exposure passive inhalation cigarette smoke exposure represent risk subsequent development atherosclerotic heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A sample 300 pre-adolescent twin pair recruit establish population-based twin study . The three cohort twin parent initially evaluate cross-sectional study follow longitudinally three year . In initial test cycle follow data collect : genotype ; general health ; anthropometric measure ; rest exercise noninvasive evaluation hemodynamic parameter include blood pressure , heart rate , cardiac output , leave ventricular mass , oxygen consumption ; hematocrit blood level 2,3-DPG , cotinine , thiocyanate , erythropoietin ; spirometric pulmonary flow data ; lipid level . There three follow-up exam . The availability repeat measure oxygen delivery determinant twin parent permit unique analysis genetic environmental factor process developmental change measurement risk accelerate atherosclerotic/ischemic heart disease development reactive airway disease . The following hypothesis test : genetic factor account significant proportion variation hematologic cardiovascular determinant systemic oxygen delivery ; adaptive response oxygen delivery system differ individual puberty ; passive smoking child incremental risk factor development accelerate atherosclerotic/ischemic cardiovascular disease ; passive smoking child contribute factor development reactive airway disease .</detailed_description>
