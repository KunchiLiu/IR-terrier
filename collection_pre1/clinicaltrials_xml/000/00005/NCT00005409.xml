	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In middle-age , level blood pressure ( BP ) strong independent predictor total cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality . However , among elderly , recent short-term observational study , include East Boston Established Populations Epidemiologic Studies Elderly ( EPESE ) , raise possibility J-shaped curve . In study short-term mortality , low blood pressure positively associate total cardiovascular disease mortality . However , analysis confine 2079 ( 68 percent ) cohort also screen nine year previously Hypertension Detection Follow-Up Program show conventional positive linear relationship systolic blood pressure , association diastolic blood pressure mortality . The observation high short-term total cardiovascular disease mortality lower blood pressure level among elderly could reflect particular susceptibility deleterious consequence drug therapy high blood pressure . Alternatively , find might artifactual , due survival bias confound co-morbid condition . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Linking data HDFP EPESE study , investigator examine change blood pressure , antihypertensive medication use , mortality 15-year period . With regard association lower blood pressure increase mortality , determine whether relationship previously observe reflected fall normotensive level oppose consistently low blood pressure . With regard upper end mortality curve , assessed effect antihypertensive drug treatment mortality compare untreated hypertension . The latter question particular public health significance question remain risk-to-benefit ratio antihypertensive drug treatment age group . Furthermore , also describe change blood pressure population medication usage pattern time correlate type medication mortality . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
