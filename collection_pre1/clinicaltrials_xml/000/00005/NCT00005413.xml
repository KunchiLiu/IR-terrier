	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The epidemiology common risk factor cerebrovascular disease well document cross-sectional longitudinal population survey . These study generally involve unrelated individual little information family history . Despite significant role cardiovascular risk , study investigate familial contribution stroke risk , importance unknown . Recognition importance hereditary influence vascular disease heart contribute , large part , current emphasis molecular biology vascular disease balance view recognize genetic environmental influence coronary artery disease . Twin study represent simple uniquely powerful tool analyze genetic environmental contribution complex human phenotype . Studies cardiovascular risk show importance heritable factor , hypothesize similar genetic factor play role development stroke . With improved understanding stroke risk factor ( genetic environmental ) , early prevention measure begin high risk group early childhood , approach already apply cardiovascular disease . Demonstration significant heritable risk stroke also prompt help direct , investigation molecular mechanism genetic influence stroke may identify new approach stroke prevention treatment , cardiovascular disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The twin survey periodically past two decade , recently 1985 . Information obtain included question vascular risk factor , myocardial disease , stroke . An analysis make estimation heritable risk . A comparison make monozygotic ( MZ ) dizygotic ( DZ ) twin . If gene influence prevalence stroke , MZ twin pair stroke . Measures concordance heritability use estimate size genetic contribution . Secondary analysis focus compound risk factor ( e.g . hypertension diabetes ) , less well document risk factor ( e.g . diet personality ) , heritability individual stroke risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
