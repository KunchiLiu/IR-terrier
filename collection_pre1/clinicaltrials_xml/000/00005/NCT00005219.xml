	<brief_title>Predicting Physical Activity Change : Epidemiologic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1988 study begin , epidemiological study show health benefit physical activity prevalence physical activity well recommended level . Exercise-promotion intervention typically ineffective , lack knowledge exercise determinant inhibit design effective intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Data San Diego Health Exercise Baseline survey conduct 1986 use contact participant follow-up . The difference report activity level time 1 time 2 serve estimate change activity . The follow-up survey elicit two-year history vigorous exercise moderate-intensity exercise , substantial health benefit , well different determinant . Potential predictor assess baseline include demographic variable index base social learn theory . Multiple regression analysis determine combine independent relationship variable self-efficacy , social support , perceive barrier benefit environmental factor type physical activity change . A second analysis separate subject baseline physical activity group low , intermediate , high activity examine prediction change versus no-change category .</detailed_description>
