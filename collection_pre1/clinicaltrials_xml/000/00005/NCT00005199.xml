	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Valvular stenosis incompetence result estimate 41,000 valve replacement United States year . These replacement equally distribute aortic mitral valve . An estimated 60 percent aortic valve replacement result valve stenosis ; 20-30 percent mitral valve replacement due stenosis . The risk operative mortality single valve replacement range 3 percent high 15 percent depend upon patient characteristic . Morbidity associate open heart procedures include wound infection , reoperation bleeding , post-operative pain . Most patient artificial valve require anticoagulant therapy rest live thus face compete risk hemorrhage valve thrombosis/embolism . In addition , number patient aortic stenosis candidate aortic valve replacement unacceptable operative risk might dramatically improve balloon valvuloplasty . The pathophysiologic process underlie valvular stenosis aortic mitral position quite different . Mitral stenosis outcome rheumatic fever . Rheumatic fever quite unusual country sequela , rheumatic valvular disease , persist major public health problem Third World . Aortic stenosis commonly result calcific degeneration normal tricuspid aortic valve elderly result rheumatic fever also develop congenital bicuspid aortic valve become progressively stenotic age wear abnormal flow pattern . The result surgical valvuloplasty differ mitral aortic valve . Surgical valvuloplasty ( commissurotomy ) mitral stenosis currently well-established commonly use treatment symptomatic patient mitral stenosis . Similar attempt repair aortic stenosis largely unsuccessful . Surgical valvuloplasty aortic stenosis , reason , abandon favor valve replacement . Initial attempt aortic balloon valvuloplasty , therefore , undertaken patient surgical candidate ; initial effort small number patient , come wake abandon surgical attempt , surprisingly successful reduce gradient increase valve area without complication embolism significant regurgitation . Balloon valvuloplasty begin pediatric cardiologist use catheter design dilatation peripheral arterial stenosis child pulmonic stenosis coarctation aorta . Balloon dilatation quite successful pulmonic stenosis , accept therapeutic maneuver . It less successful coarctation aorta . As direct outgrowth research , investigator apply procedure mitral aortic stenosis adult . Balloon valvuloplasty perform cardiac catheterization laboratory without general anesthesia . A balloon catheter insert percutaneously venous side circulation place across mitral valve puncture atrial septum . Inflation appropriately size balloon result marked reduction transvalvular gradient increase calculate valve area case thus far report . Given success close commissurotomy , surprising finding . A similar procedure use severely stenotic aortic valve either advance balloon mitral valve aortic position approach valve retrograde . Aortic balloon valvuloplasty thus far employ largely severely ill , elderly patient judge able tolerate valve replacement . As noted , result quite promise ; low mortality morbidity , substantial hemodynamic improvement short hospital stay observe . These anecdotal report lead application balloon valvuloplasty increase number patient . Major issue need address prior general acceptance therapy aortic mitral stenosis operative nonoperative candidate . The issue include : definition risk mortality morbidity overall subgroup define baseline characteristic ; success rate define clinically hemodynamically overall subgroup ; durability procedure , , long give improvement clinical hemodynamic measure persist ; definition subgroup particularly favorable unfavorable outcome . These question address NHLBI Balloon Valvuloplasty Registry . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Investigators treat patient balloon valvuloplasty voluntarily collect submit data consecutive case valvuloplasty two year active recruitment follow patient select interval minimum two half year . Demographic , clinical , hemodynamic data collect patient valvuloplasty hospitalization . The data submit participate clinical unit Coordinating Center .</detailed_description>
