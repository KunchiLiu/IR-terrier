	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Has Not Responded Platinum- Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity oxaliplatin measure response rate patient recurrent refractory , platinum resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal carcinoma fail high priority treatment protocol . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour . Treatment continue every 21 day maximum 9 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 12-14 month .</detailed_description>
