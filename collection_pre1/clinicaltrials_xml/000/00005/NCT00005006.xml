	<brief_summary>This study investigate effectiveness parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) combination alendronate , standard treatment osteoporosis block reduce bone loss . We use alendronate may help protect patient possible harmful effect PTH cortical bone long bone hip . We test two different treatment schedule PTH-one give PTH daily one give PTH 3 every 6 month cyclical fashion . The entire study 21 month long ; active treatment period 18 month 6-month followup period . The main effect look study change body chemical sign bone formation bone breakdown , change bone density throughout skeleton . We randomly assign study participant , woman age 50 , either stay alendronate alone , receive daily continuous PTH plus alendronate , receive daily PTH 3 month every 6 total three separate 3-month cycle PTH plus daily alendronate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) With Alendronate Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis significant disease increase risk fracture throughout skeleton , importantly spine hip region . The current medication osteoporosis , include estrogen , bisphosphonates , raloxifene , calcitonin , primarily prevent bone loss , although may associate small bone gain . Another class drug , anabolic drug , increase bone formation substantially , lead big gain bone mass . One , sodium fluoride , clearly increase bone mass may may reduce fracture risk . Another bone-forming agent human parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . We others demonstrate substantial bone mass gain well reduction vertebral fracture use PTH administer daily subcutaneous injection . The current study seek capitalize knowledge glean PTH-induced stimulation bone formation prior resorption subject antiresorptive therapy estrogen alendronate . In protocol chosen give PTH daily subcutaneous injection presence alendronate . We already show 6 week daily subcutaneous h ( 1-34 ) PTH 400 U/day patient establish alendronate , biochemical indicator bone formation substantially increase ( 30-60 percent ) , stimulation resorption time frame . We hypothesize , 3 month , combination PTH plus alendronate , like combination PTH plus hormone replacement therapy , result increment bone formation exceed bone resorption . We also theorize biochemical profile reflect great effect bone mass therapy alendronate alone , formation resorption elevate . Furthermore , believe change first 3 month repeat additional discrete 3-months cycle bone turnover return baseline . Therefore , plan study difference bone mass biochemical indicator bone turnover , presence establish alendronate therapy , give PTH daily subcutaneous injection continuously 15 month ( bone resorption elevate substantially half time ) versus discontinuously three discrete 3-month cycle ( bone formation dramatically exceed bone resorption entire treatment period ) . The candidate study postmenopausal woman osteoporosis define either bone density and/or prior osteoporotic fracture occurrence , addition , use alendronate least 18 month prior enter study . Patients must age 50 . The entire study 21 month long ; active treatment period 18 month 6- month followup period . The primary outcome study biochemistry bone density throughout skeleton . We randomly assign participant either remain alendronate alone , receive daily continuous PTH plus alendronate , receive daily PTH 3 month every 6 , total three separate 3-month cycle PTH , PTH give addition daily weekly alendronate .</detailed_description>
