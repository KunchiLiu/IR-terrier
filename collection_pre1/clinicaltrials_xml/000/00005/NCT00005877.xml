	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate , overall survival , time disease progression maximal response patient advance metastatic colorectal cancer treat oral nitrocamptothecin . II . Determine safety , toxicity , pharmacokinetics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease completion course 8 may receive additional course . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 14-45 patient accrue study less 1 year .</detailed_description>
