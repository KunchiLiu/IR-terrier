	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension , complex disease involve interplay genetic environmental factor , affect estimate 50 million Americans major predispose factor myocardial infarction , vascular disease , stroke , renal failure . It estimate segregation analysis twin study approximately 45 percent interindividual difference blood pressure account genetic difference . The identification gene whose variant contribute high blood pressure far-reaching effect understand pathophysiology circulation may suggest new preventive measure rational therapeutic approach . One principal advantage genetic approach identifies primary molecular defect . As result , possible stratify general hypertensive population subgroup base genotype intermediate phenotype thereby evaluate preventive strategy therapeutic approach homogeneous group . In addition , identification hypertensive gene also provide basis understand interaction gene environmental factor . It likely particular environmental variable exert effect presence certain genotype . Until recently , technique dissect genetic determinant high blood pressure available developed extent would make Family Blood Pressure Program initiative feasible . However , several recent advance technology analytical method , together rapid construction genetic map , substantially improve chance detect genetic factor . The concept Family Blood Pressure Program conceive Report Expert Panel Genetic Strategies Heart , Lung , Blood Diseases . The initiative approve Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee ( AHLMAC ) March , 1993 . The genetic-epidemiological aspect approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee ( CAPAC ) February , 1993 . The Request Applications release March , 1994 . Awards make September , 1995 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The network consist five field center , central biochemistry laboratory , molecular genetics laboratory , data coordinate center study equal sample Black non-Black family two hypertensive sibling , untreated relative , control genetic association sib-sib linkage study . The study , use sample Family Heart Study ( FHS ) Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) study , include determination characterization gene promote hypertension interaction non-genetic factor . Beginning 1996 , Donna Arnett , principal investigator University Minnesota echocardiographic center R01HL55673 , perform target echocardiographic exam 3,100 HyperGEN participant five field center part HyperGEN clinical examination . She examine genetics leave ventricular hypertrophy . Her study characterize leave ventricular structure function , define leave ventricular structural phenotype base four geometric pattern ( normal geometry , concentric remodeling , concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy , eccentric leave ventricular hypertrophy ) . She examine highly select group candidate gene association leave ventricular mass geometric pattern . Using quantitative trait locus analysis , test linkage 240 anonymous , evenly space genetic marker leave ventricular mass geometric pattern . She also evaluate interaction gene potential risk factor leave ventricular hypertrophy , include insulin , glucose , blood pressure response mental physical stressor , dietary urinary electrolyte , obesity . The grant part original initiative . Approximately $ 2,093,000 support provide grant , broken follow : FY 1996 - $ 652,085 ; FY 1997 - $ 628,979 ; FY 1998 - $ 433,000 ; FY 1999 - $ 379,000 . The Family Blood Pressure Program , include HyperGEN , renew FY 2000 . The Family Blood Pressure Program whole carry five specific aim renewal period . These aim group accord two complementary theme : First , investigator create analyzed database blood pressure-related phenotype genotype data FBPP participant ( Aim 1 ) . Within link region , identify allelic variation within positional candidate gene evaluate relationship polymorphism blood pressure level hypertension status ( Aims 2 3 ) . Second , use quantitative measure target organ damage identify gene influence susceptibility develop hypertensive heart kidney disease ( Aims 4 5 ) . In addition Program specific aim , network , include HyperGEN , carry specific aim alone , base unique aspect population interest expertise investigator . The HyperGEN network take lead study associate subphenotypes hypertension study follow : measure metabolic intermediate plasma insulin , glucose lipid level , red cell sodium-lithium transport ; co-morbidity disease possible common etiology diabetes , obesity , hypertension-associated kidney disease ; degree specific target organ damage ; differential response environmental input ; leave ventricular hypertrophy phenotype measure echocardiography . Co-morbid condition measure end-organ damage use stratifying variable . Genes influence variation measure metabolic intermediate , blood pressure response stressor , leave ventricular hypertrophy study linkage association study . Environmental exposure ( medication use , activity level , smoke ) use covariates . These measurement allow identification gene influence variation subphenotypes , may overlap gene influence blood pressure level per se , others may specific associated phenotype , nearly heritabilities equivalent great blood pressure . The HyperGen extend August , 2008 make Program share resource hypertension researcher United States throughout world . In Aim 1 , investigator build , maintain update publicly available knowledge-base facilitate research non-FBPP investigator genetics hypertension , risk factor complication . In Aim 2 , use state-of-the-art genetic linkage analysis method identify additional linkage region use subgroup pedigree physiologically relevant combination phenotype aid localize hypertension gene . In Aim 3 , use combination bioinformatics , dense array SNPs , state-of-the-art data analysis follow-up region interest identify underlie hypertension gene . The region followed-up include identify current phase FBPP Aim 2 renewal phase . In Aim 4 , evaluate hypertension gene identify Aim 3 association multiple measure reflect cardiovascular renal complication hypertension , include leave ventricular mass microalbuminuria . It long-term goal FBPP hypertension genetics community develop comprehensive picture genetic architecture human hypertension , include risk factor , complication , response treatment .</detailed_description>
