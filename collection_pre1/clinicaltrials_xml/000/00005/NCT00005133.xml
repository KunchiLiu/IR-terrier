	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1984 , estimate 28 million Americans age 65 11 million age 75 . Projected growth number proportion elderly population United States show marked increase , attribute primarily decline death rate cardiovascular non-cardiovascular disease . Although decline cardiovascular disease past twenty year , still major source morbidity mortality middle-aged old population . An estimated 2.8 million person United States age 65 year coronary heart disease base 1982 National Health Interview Survey National Center Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . About 1.4 million men 1.4 million woman . Prevalence coronary heart disease 11 percent age group : 13 percent men , 9 percent woman , 12 percent white , 13 percent Blacks . The characteristic increase blood pressure serum cholesterol , cigarette smoking , overweight , diabetes document risk factor cardiovascular disease among men woman middle year . A study find characteristic operate risk factor older population whereas role cigarette smoke cholesterol uncertain . The influence hemostatic factor remain determined . The traditional risk factor present substantial proportion elderly population . From 1983 National Health Interview Survey , estimate 21 percent person 65-74 year age current cigarette smoker . From 1976-80 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey NCHS , estimate 29 percent person 65-74 year age overweight , 28 percent serum cholesterol level 260 mg/100 ml great . From SHEP pilot study , estimate 68 percent person 65-74 year age 75 percent person age 75 hypertension , , systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg great diastolic pressure 90 great ( base average three measurement ) anti-hypertensive medication . Isolated systolic hypertension quite common elderly population . The Framingham Heart Study observe average annual incidence new coronary heart disease event 20.4 per 1,000 men age 65-74 year 14.5 per 1,100 woman age group , base 20 year follow-up . The Study show marked increase incidence age significant physical disability cardiovascular disease elderly . Another indication impact coronary heart disease elderly United States health care expenditures . Incidence , prevalence , disability heart disease account personal health care expenditures $ 8.2 billion person 65 year age older 1980 accord National Center Health Statistics . Based estimate expenditure 1983 , figure nearly $ 12 billion year . These expenditure hospital care , physician professional care , drug , nursing home care . Characteristically , old people limit chronic illness , increase disability , decrease function . As people reach old age , increase demand expectation functional life active retirement . Data , however , relatively sparse prognostic characteristic , effect medical care , ultimate outcome cardiovascular disease population . Particular attention give accuracy diagnosis elderly population . The use medical care service elderly frequency nature pharmacologic , surgical medical management elderly patient document . In addition , study supply information place death , suddenness death circumstance precede clinical event death elderly . The study grow recommendation Working Conference Coronary Heart Disease Elderly hold Bethesda , Maryland September 1985 review approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council September 1986 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) population-based , longitudinal study risk factor development progression CHD stroke adult age 65 year . Initially funded six year , renew another six-year period 1994 project shift morbidity mortality follow-up ( collection examination data ) end year 11 exam June 1999 . Within population men woman 65 year old , objectives Cardiovascular Health Study : 1 . To quantify association conventional hypothesized risk factor CHD stroke . 2 . To assess association non-invasive measure subclinical disease incidence CHD stroke . 3 . To quantify association risk factor subclinical disease . 4 . To characterize natural history CHD stroke , identify factor associate clinical course . 5 . To describe prevalence distribution risk factor , non-invasive measure subclinical disease , clinical CHD stroke . This extensive study undertaken NHLBI study CVD exclusively elderly population . It originate recommendation NHLBI workshop management CHD elderly . Since atherosclerosis prevalent elderly , study focus factor think induce clinically overt disease . A major emphasis study focus subclinical disease , abnormality detect noninvasively without sign symptom . Subclinical disease measure CHS include ultrasonography carotid artery abdominal aorta , ankle-brachial index , echocardiography , rest ambulatory electrocardiography , cerebral magnetic resonance imaging , spirometry , retinal photography . Some measure conduct three time ; baseline , ass risk clinical disease relationship subclinical disease ; three four year entry assess change subclinical disease risk clinical disease relationship change ; toward end study , assess predictor subclinical disease . Echocardiography , ambulatory ECG , cerebral MRI aortic ultrasonography conduct twice . Specific objective current period ( 1994-2000 ) : 1 . Identify risk association clinical disease accumulation event . 1 . Compare risk estimate subgroups participant , woman vs. men , African-American vs. Caucasian , old vs. young 75 year , vs. without prevalent clinical subclinical disease . 2 . Compare risk estimate subtypes disease , fatal vs. non-fatal myocardial infarction , symptomatic vs. silent myocardial ischemia , fatal vs. non-fatal stroke . 3 . Compare estimate longer-term ( 5-10 year ) vs. short-term ( 1-3 year ) CVD risk . 2 . Determine whether presence progression subclinical disease ( abnormality detect noninvasively without sign symptom ) good predictor clinical disease traditional risk factor . 3 . Identify determinant change subclinical disease . 4 . Identify characteristic subgroup low risk develop CVD ( preventive measure may unnecessary ) . The study involve four field center ; coordinate center ; five reading center include echocardiography reading center , ultrasound reading center , cerebral MRI reading center , retinal reading center ; central blood analysis laboratory . Protocol development begin June , 1988 , recruitment first clinical examination begin June , 1989 . Examination 5,201 participant ( 2,962 woman 2,239 men ) complete May , 1990 . Two brief interim examination conduct 1990-1992 . A extensive clinical examination 1992-1993 repeated ass change major subclinical disease ; time , additional cohort 672 African Americans recruit improve minority representation assessment black-white difference . Since 1993 , annual examination focus different major non-invasive measure time , reduce participant burden . Project Status : Clinic examination complete June 1999 . The cohort continue follow bi-annual phone call ass study endpoint , include : myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , congestive heart failure , peripheral claudication , angina , TIA death . CHS investigator also continue analyse previously collect serum DNA sample ; analysis recently collect cross-sectional data analysis longitudinal data . Close-out reading center underway , read center principal investigator continue study involvement , primarily continue data analysis publication study result . The study extend May , 2009 additional follow-up cohort data analysis .</detailed_description>
