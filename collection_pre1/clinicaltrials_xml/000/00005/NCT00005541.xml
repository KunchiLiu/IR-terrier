	<brief_title>Hemochromatosis Iron Overload Screening Study ( HEIRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hereditary iron overload , hemochromatosis , common inherit disorder among Caucasians , estimate prevalence 0.25-0.50 percent , though mistakenly believe many quite rare . The disease insidious onset , many even individual diagnose disorder identify advanced organ damage present . However , absence anemia , cause tissue damage iron late stage disease , relatively easy treat disorder remove excess iron repeat phlebotomy . Evidence suggest early diagnosis treatment prevent disease manifestation enable normal life expectancy The discovery HFE C282Y H63D variant HLA gene region chromosome 6 provide opportunity early rapid genetic identification individual risk development hereditary hemochromatosis . Much remains learn penetrance expression allele , include relevance full spectrum clinical disease . To date , HFE alleles appear predominantly associate disease mainly populations Caucasian descent . While 80-90 percent Caucasian hemochromatosis patient HFE abnormality , hetero- homozygote manifest evidence disease , manifest disease different age different outcome , imply existence genetic environmental factor . Similarly , hemochromatosis patient HFE abnormality . Other gene yet discover also likely involved pathogenesis iron overload familial hemochromatosis non-Caucasian population well . This project intend examine genetic environmental determinant correlate iron overload hereditary hemochromatosis diverse population . Increases body iron may due increase absorption ( hemochromatosis ) , increase oral intake non-therapeutic iron , unneeded iron therapy , multiple blood transfusion absence bleeding . The excess iron deposit body tissue , reach toxic level lead organ damage . The toxicity affect tissue organ , particularly liver , cause cirrhosis ; endocrine system , cause diabetes , hypogonadism , sometimes hypoparathyroidism ; heart , cause arrhythmias cardiomyopathy . Iron overload hereditary hemochromatosis extensively study non-Caucasian racial/ethnic group Caucasians . The toxicity excess iron non-Caucasians appear similar Caucasians , prevalence iron overload unknown genetic contribution overload suspect proven group . It long assume iron storage disease population sub-Saharan Africa due increase iron absorption beer brew iron pot , recent information suggest also hereditary component accumulation iron . However , iron overload among Africans appear due HFE abnormality , gene HLA region . Primary iron overload report African Americans remain determined whether link HFE genetic factor . Iron overload report Asian population , frequency genetic contribution ( ) know . In study HFE variant find non-Caucasians , additional genetic testing suggest Caucasian admixture may involve . Hispanic-Americans appear frequency iron overload similar non-Hispanic Caucasians , although study genetic environmental correlate warrant . There almost study iron overload hereditary hemochromatosis Native American population . Hemochromatosis may suitable detection intervention primary care population-based screening strategy : 1 ) relatively common ; 2 ) asymptomatic early stage ; 3 ) screen method reliable ; 4 ) standard diagnostic method widely available developed country relatively inexpensive ; 5 ) easily treatable ; 6 ) untreated , subsequent burden morbidity mortality substantial . The feasibility benefit program remain assessed , however , since prevalence disorder factor related phenotypic expression ( optimal age reliable detection effective intervention ) unknown . Other question need addressed include public acceptability screen test ; sensitivity specificity screen method , particularly non-Caucasians ; optimal timing set screen testing ; well benefit cost and/or burden associate screen test . A major objective project gather information need develop recommendation regard possible primary care- population-based screening hemochromatosis . Estimating burden preventable illness unrecognized hemochromatosis one important need . Comparing relative value acceptability diagnosis screen genotype v phenotype also important . In particular , difference racial/ethnic group , age characteristic need examine . Some issue , appropriate threshold transferrin saturation screening , may resolve propose study 's planning phase , others constitute key research question address study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Hemochromatosis Iron Overload Screening Study multi-center epidemiological study prevalence genetic environmental determinant iron overload hereditary hemochromatosis diverse representative primary care-based sample men woman age 25 old . Over 101,000 patient undergoing routine screening test involve blood draw recruit five Field Centers screen transferrin saturation level . Cost-effective population-based strategy recruitment also consider . A repeat fast transferrin saturation screen conjunction serum ferritin assay use identify potential 'case ' participant confirm elevated transferrin saturation level match random 'control ' participant confirm non-elevated transferrin saturation level . In order obtain data prevalence genetic factor routine care population , random subgroup approximately 20-40 percent 101,000 screenees genotyped known variant , HFE C282Y H63D , relate iron metabolism overload . The panel genotypes assay reflect state knowledge time phase study conduct . In particular , newly discover variant related iron overload hemochromatosis non-Caucasian population , iron overload among Africans , include . The result genotyping directly impact selection case control participant ; case/control selection base transferrin saturation/serum ferritin screen result . It likely many HFE genotype positive person confirm elevation transferrin saturation thus may get select confirmed elevated transferrin saturation case participant . Genotype positive person non-elevated transferrin saturation level , randomly select control , constitute third group undergo intensive study case control . A random sample individual recruit participate genotyping subgroup survey determine knowledge attitude , interest , support screen program . Both qualitative quantitative measure employ . Efforts make ascertain reason refusal relate information decline participation . In addition , 2,000 primary care patient select participate substudy compare phenotype- versus genotype-based screen test method . Following transferrin random subgroup genotyping screen , comprehensive clinical examination conduct confirm elevated transferrin saturation potential case participant , genotype-positive participant , confirm non-elevated control participant assess iron store , distinguish primary secondary cause iron overload examine associate hepatic , endocrinologic , hematologic cardiovascular disease correlate sequelae hemochromatosis . A detailed family medical history obtain . Examination participant previously genotyped undergo genotyping , panel genotype describe , use association analysis . The genotype-positive participant receive counsel result . The examination also include extended ELSI assessment issue relate genetic screening test diagnosis disease . Data collect participant ' acceptability genetic testing , experience screening , understand interpretation result , impact information live well family member . Specific component comprehensive clinical examination determine protocol development . Follow-up ELSI assessment examine issue impact screen program relationship family member , experience stigmatization discrimination . A family study , use comprehensive clinical examinee probands , seek identify modifier genetic variant relate expression iron overload hereditary hemochromatosis disorder via genome scan assessment linkage . Identification new genetic variant , particularly minority , also great interest , possible study achieve sufficient power . Proposed effort improve power , combine data study , consider . The family study ELSI assessment examine family member ' experience screen program , impact information live relationship , experience stigmatization discrimination . A repository blood specimen establish permit additional study genetic environmental factor relate iron overload . This require careful attention detail informed consent . For late study , specimen may anonymized . The study five Field Centers , Coordinating Center ( subcontract necessary Reading Centers ECG Reading Center ) , Central Laboratory ( may subcontract novel assay and/or genome-wide scan ) .</detailed_description>
