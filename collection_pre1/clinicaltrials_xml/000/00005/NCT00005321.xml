	<brief_title>Epidemiology Sleep Disordered Breathing - SCOR Cardiopulmonary Disorders Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The investigator show undiagnosed sleep disorder breathing prevalent men woman throughout range middle age ; multidisciplinary research finding suggest untreated sleep disorder breathing may lead significant behavioral cardiovascular morbidity . The relative risk direct application public health estimate : How much behavioral cardiovascular morbidity would eliminate prevalence untreated sleep disorder breathe significantly reduce ? How much reduction sleep disorder breathing prevalence could achieve eliminate modifiable etiologic factor ? Should high risk group target early detection risk factor reduction program ? DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study quantify etiologic role hypothesize risk factor sleep disordered breathing , describe progression pathophysiologic process , test causal hypothesis adverse health outcome . The study conduct unique , establish cohort 800 subject , representative middle-aged employ adult . Extensive baseline polysomnographic data available establish cohort 800 subject ; additional cohort 50 perimenopausal woman 200 old adult add maximum study power . The research result longitudinal data , 5-9 year period , multiple parameter sleep , breathe , risk factor outcomes . The independent relative risk calculate multivariate technique express temporal relationship sleep disordered breathing etiologic factor consequence sleep disordered breathing . The study renew 1993 use longitudinal study focus specific question great relevance public health , namely : role age menopause development sleep-disordered breathing effect sleep disorder breathe hypersomnolence systemic hypertension .
