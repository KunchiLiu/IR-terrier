	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study fund response Request Application issue 1975 High Blood Pressure Young . The program High Blood Pressure Young grow awareness adult hypertension might origins adolescence even childhood infancy . In 1975 NHLBI support little research , except Specialized Centers Research , identify precursor high blood pressure operate early age . Sixteen grant funded program . The program conclude 1978 Dr. Kotchen 's grant renew regular research grant . A second population group follow grant period . From original population 409 pregnant , nulliparous adolescent age 12-18 enrolled University Kentucky Young Mothers Program 1971-1974 , 70 diagnosed hypertension third trimester pregnancy . These 70 woman plus control group 54 normotensive woman population study child . Blood pressure measure young mother 3-6 year 6-9 year first pregnancy . Women history hypertension pregnancy heavy , maintain high blood pressure great incidence hypertension subsequent pregnancy . At second follow-up , systolic blood pressure body weight male child bear hypertensive woman great male born normotensive woman . Blood pressure female child two group mother differ . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In 1973 standardized blood pressure , height , weight measure 14-19 year old student Bourbon County High School Kentucky . Additional information collect included age , date birth , sex , race . In 1978 five year follow-up study undertaken adolescent 14-15 year old time initial survey select 16-19 year old high , intermediate , low range blood pressure distribution . Follow-up measurement include weight , height , blood pressure subject , sodium excretion , serum cholesterol , glucose , triglyceride , exercise , uric acid concentration , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram older group . In 1984 follow-up also include information socioeconomic variable , medical family history , smoking , exercise , life event , coronary-prone behavior , anxiety . Plasma renin activity plasma aldosterone measure treadmill exercise young adult relatively high relatively low blood pressure determine renin-aldosterone axis suppress appearance hypertension . Studies continue physiologic , psychosocial , behavioral risk factor hypertension , age-related trend cardiovascular risk factor time , correlate elevate blood pressure , early cardiac consequence high blood pressure . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
