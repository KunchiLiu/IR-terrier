	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although scientist agree obesity independent risk factor coronary heart disease , may strong univariate predictor coronary heart disease , impact coronary heart disease least relationship risk factor : positive association blood pressure , inverse association high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDLC ) , positive association triglyceride low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDLC ) , positive association hyperglycemia diabetes . A number show major coronary heart disease risk factor . Prevention obesity , weight reduction towards desirable body weight may reduce incidence coronary heart disease risk factor . There evidence suggest obesity begin and/or advance childhood , track adulthood , reasonably high level certainty . Obesity become progressively difficult treat maturation adulthood . Thus , good understand pathophysiology obesity late childhood early adolescence , long-run , provide basis effective prevention intervention program order long-range impact upon consequence obesity . The age group 9 10 entry select assure many individual enrol prior puberty , follow transition period obesity become apparent among Black adolescent female among white . Support research grow recommendation make Working Conference Coronary Heart Disease Black Populations hold September 1983 sponsor NHLBI . The group recommend research identify physiological and/or behavioral factor contribute obesity Black female . In addition , 1981 Report Working Group Arteriosclerosis NHLBI state research need characterize behavior create maintain caloric imbalance . The initiative approve September 1984 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council Request Proposals release November 1984 . The NGHS I initiate 1985 contract-supported program three field center coordinate center . Annual exams conduct baseline year follow-up . The study renew mean cooperative agreement mechanism 1992 NGHS II permit two additional year follow-up exam . The study renew 1994 NGHS III continue annual examination . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In longitudinal study , baseline examination annual examination . Data collect include : physical examination ; anthropometric measurement ; dietary information include food pattern nutrient intake ; physical activity ; lipid , lipoprotein , apolipoprotein profile ; family socioeconomic status ; psychosocial information . The study renew twice continue longitudinal investigation subject reach age 19 20 . Following girls age allow documentation transition risk factor Black girl longer cardiovascular risk advantage study factor surround transition . The longer follow-up also allow study influence smoke body weight relationship adolescent pregnancy subsequent adiposity development , body fat patterning , blood pressure , blood lipid .</detailed_description>
