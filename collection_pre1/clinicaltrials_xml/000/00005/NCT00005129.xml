	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Bogalusa Heart Study long-term epidemiologic study . The investigator identify followed black white participant nearly 40 year , describe incidence prevalence biologic behavioral cardiovascular disease risk factor childhood adulthood . Their participation enable study document difference male female , also black white . The result Bogalusa Heart Study clearly document genesis atherosclerosis basis childhood , prevention must begin early age . The Bogalusa Heart Study fund year Specialized Centers Research ( SCOR ) Program . The SCOR program initiate NHLBI 1970 expedite development application new knowledge essential improve diagnosis , treatment , prevention arteriosclerosis , hypertension , pulmonary disease , thrombosis . In 1984 Demonstration Education Component add parent SCOR Bogalusa Heart Study order translate experience gain epidemiological study intervention study design retard development cardiovascular risk factor child . Beginning 1987 , Bogalusa Heart Study support regular research grant . Beginning 1997 , study support cooperative agreement mechanism . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The initial survey 1973-1974 restricted child age 2 1/2 14 . A physical examination conduct information collect anthropometric data , hemoglobin , blood pressure , serum lipid , health history . Over 3,500 child participate . The second cross-sectional survey 1976-1977 subsequent survey expand eligible population include child age 5-17 year . The second survey 4,000 child also include information salt intake , smoking , health belief , attitude , girl age 8-17 , menstrual history oral contraceptive use . The third survey 3,500 participant 1978-1979 also collect anthropometric measurement skinfold thickness two measurement heart rate . The fourth survey 3,300 participant 1981-1982 add data alcohol use , Type A behavior , peer network diet habit . The Bogalusa Heart Study continue use cross-sectional longitudinal design general cross-sectional survey approximately 3,700 Bogalusa child age five seventeen 1988-1989 sixth screen additional longitudinal study recall child define subgroup intensive evaluation . Half 12,000 participant screen since 1973 study three time . There several cohort group study . The Newborn-Infant Cohort Study design describe distribution , inter-relationships , trend time blood pressure , serum lipid lipoprotein concentration , dietary intake pattern , anthropometric measurement . Four hundred forty infant bear January 1 , 1974 June 30 , 1975 examine birth , six month , yearly age one four seven , ten thirteen year cardiovascular risk factor variable . The Post High School Study examine young adult age 21 30 previously examine child age five fourteen first Bogalusa Heart Study screen 1973-1974 . The population include approximately 4,603 young adult originally screen child adolescent examine first time subsequent survey . The fifth screening begin 1988 extend December 1991 . The Pediatric Pathology Risk Factor Program , begin 1978 , document relationship cardiovascular disease risk factor anatomic pathologic change . A local information system establish obtain family coroner 's consent autopsy decease resident age three 26 Bogalusa area . Autopsy specimens collect 100 deceased child young adult , approximately forty percent previously examine Bogalusa Heart Study . Major activity 1988-1991 involve 24-hour dietary recall collection 1963 , 1966 , 1968 birth cohort attend Post High School Study . A food frequency questionnaire also self-administered Post High School Study participant . The use two dietary methodology , 24-hour dietary recall food frequency questionnaire , provide data assess nutrient composition diet young adult , assess weekly consumption individual food , compare nutrient composition data food frequency data , compare dietary intake post high school age school age . Several substudies conduct use Bogalusa Heart Study population . Among impact childhood obesity risk factor , relationship apolipoproteins A-I B child parental myocardial infarction relationship leave ventricular size demonstrate echocardiography blood pressure distribution . The study renew Fiscal Year 1992 order follow-up previously examine young adult development abnormal level cardiovascular risk factor even clinical disease . In 1997 , study renew extended 2002 , 2002-2010 , 2012 order study impact genetic factor evolution childhood cardiovascular risk factor subclinical clinical morbidity adult population , age 20 43 , follow long period time . The study also seek study association risk factor phenotypes anatomic change cardiovascular system see necropsy . The population genotype-phenotype study include approximately 1,400 sibling derive 178 longitudinal birth cohort . The cardiovascular phenotype include obesity , blood pressure , lipid , lipoprotein , apoproteins , homocysteine , glucose-insulin , fibrinogen , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 von Willebrand Factor . Environmental risk factor consist sociodemographic characteristic , tobacco alcohol use , oral contraception , physical activity , cognitive physical function , quality sleep diet . Subclinical morbidity include echo-Doppler measurement cardiac-carotid structure function . Using robust sibling pair linkage method , genome-wide search involve 391 marker space 10 centimorgans conduct gene influence quantitative trait . This supplement 41 highly polymorphic marker locate near candidate gene likely related obesity , lipoprotein metabolism , blood pressure , insulin resistance , diabetes , atherogenesis thrombosis . Approximately 75 percent dollar Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Arteriosclerosis ( P50HL14103 ) use support Bogalusa Heart Study 1972 1986 . Since 2002 , study support National Institute Aging ( NIA ) , National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) , National Institute Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) , National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) .</detailed_description>
