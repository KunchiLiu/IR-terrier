	<brief_title>Re-evaluating Triglycerides Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The result investigation help shed substantial light controversial relationship triglyceride coronary heart disease , topic great importance preventive cardiology . Additionally , important methodological information obtain study interaction precision variable epidemiologic analysis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There three component study : 1 ) analysis several exist cardiovascular database evidence significant association coronary heart disease specific lipid interaction involve triglyceride ; 2 ) analysis database investigate role measurement precision association elevate triglyceride level coronary heart disease ; 3 ) survey expert lipidologists community clinician examine current practice related screen treatment elevate triglyceride level purpose reduce coronary heart disease risk . Five database use first two component study . These data set include Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Mortality Follow-up Studies ; Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial ; Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial ; National Heart , Lung , Blood Type II Coronary Intervention Study ; Coronary Drug Project . For first component , detailed statistical analysis database perform , specifically examine role lipid interaction involve triglyceride association coronary heart disease . For second component , precise estimate subject 's lipid level recalculate use multiple lipid measurement already available database . Each dataset analyze evidence independent relationship triglyceride coronary heart disease validate theoretical finding suggest measurement imprecision may explain difficulty detect independent triglyceride-coronary heart disease association . The public health implication current state knowledge surround triglyceride assess survey research technique third component . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
