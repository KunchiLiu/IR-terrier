	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Preliminary finding already show , contrast woman low score Cook Medley Hostility ( Ho ) scale , woman high Ho score exhibit great cardiovascular change harassment . Additional finding suggest oral contraceptive ( 0C ) use may also associate increase behaviorally-induced physiological change , especially low Ho woman . Similarly , high level total serum cholesterol ( TSC ) positively associate great stress-induced neurohormonal change middle-aged men high Ho score . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Assessment autonomic activity take place laboratory 24 hour ambulatory measurement period . Hostility measure Cook Medley Hostility scale . The laboratory assessment help determine high hostility woman respond harassment great cardiovascular neurohormonal change low hostility woman , relationship alter 0C use , lipid , age . The ambulatory assessment autonomic activity allow exploration response high low hostility subject daily-life stressor . Several hypothesis explore : 1 ) Did harassment produce neuroendocrine well cardiovascular hyperreactivity young woman , hyperreactivity generalize laboratory real-life ? 2 ) Were harassment-induced cardiovascular neuroendocrine change young woman also present middle-aged woman ? 3 ) To extent 0C use modulate cardiovascular neuroendocrine response harassment young woman , 0C use also alter hostility -- related association lipid reactivity ? 4 ) Were differential lipid-reactivity association observe middle-aged men function high low hostility score present woman , , , modulate age ?
