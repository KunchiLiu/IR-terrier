	<brief_title>Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Children With Meningeal Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine therapeutic activity intrathecal topotecan , term response rate time central nervous system ( CNS ) progression , pediatric patient recurrent refractory neoplastic meningitis . II . Determine safety toxicity regimen patient . III . Evaluate concentration matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease type ( acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs. leukemia/lymphoma v medulloblastoma v solid tumor ) . ( Recurrent CNS acute lymphoblastic leukemia stratum open accrual 11/30/04 ) INDUCTION : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intrathecally ( IT ) 5 minute twice weekly 6 week . CONSOLIDATION : Beginning 1 week completion induction , patient receive topotecan hydrochloride IT 5 minute weekly 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Beginning 2 week completion consolidation , patient receive topotecan hydrochloride IT 5 minute twice monthly 4 month monthly year 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-77 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
