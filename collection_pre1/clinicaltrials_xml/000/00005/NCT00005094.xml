	<brief_summary>Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development cancer . The use celecoxib approve use reduce number adenomatous colorectal polyp familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . It know whether clinical benefit reduction number colorectal polyp FAP patient . The use celecoxib may effective way prevent development sporadic adenomatous polyp , precursor colorectal cancer . This randomized phase III trial study celecoxib see well work compare placebo prevent development adenomatous colorectal polyp patient least one polyp remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety efficacy celecoxib reduce occurrence new sporadic adenomatous polyp ( SAP ) colon rectum patient undergone polypectomy previous SAP . OUTLINE : This randomize , double blind , placebo control study . Patients enter one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive celecoxib twice day 3 year . Arm II : Patients receive placebo twice day 3 year . Patients evaluate adenomatous colorectal polyp 1 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Over 1000 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
