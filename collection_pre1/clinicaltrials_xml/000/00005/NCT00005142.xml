	<brief_title>Etiology Prevalence Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atherosclerosis frequently generalize , affect blood vessel various part body . Previous study note strong association peripheral arterial disease coronary heart disease similarity risk factor , particularly diabetes cigarette smoking disease . The natural history peripheral arterial disease delineate lack , recently , accurate reliable non-invasive testing . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All 624 subject initially study Lipid Research Clinic protocol involve two evaluation , visit 1 visit 2 . At visit 2 , half subject random sample LRC visit 1 cohort others select visit 1 cohort hyperlipidemia , define age- sex-specific 90th percentile cholesterol 95th percentile triglyceride take lipid-lowering medication . At visit 2 , subject characterize age ; sex ; drug , diet , alcohol smoking history ; personal family history cardiovascular disease ; Rose questionnaire ; electrocardiogram examination cardiologist . The subject give traditional manual examination peripheral arterial disease four non-invasive test include segmental blood pressure , flow velocity Doppler ultrasound , postocclusive reactive hyperemia , pulse reappearance half-time . The subject categorize large vessel peripheral arterial disease , isolate small vessel peripheral arterial disease normal base result non-invasive test followed average four year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
