	<brief_title>Gubbio Study Five-year Follow-up : Lithium Countertransport , Blood Pressure , Other Variables</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The field work baseline prevalence phase Gubbio Study Epidemiology Hypertension conduct March 1983 December 1985 . The population sample include individual age 5 reside town Gubbio . The survey involve standardized comprehensive examination focus trait previously show related hypertensive and/or adult cardiovascular disease , trait current concern possible risk factor . This latter category include measurement red blood cell electrolyte concentration flux , particularly sodium-stimulated lithium countertransport . The study plan , organize , conduct Merck , Sharp Dohme Center Epidemiologic Research cooperation Gubbio civic medical leader , laboratory facility Gubbio , Naples , Rome . Follow-up examination conduct Centro di Medicina Preventiva Gubbio furnish equipped Merck , Sharp Dohme Rome , Italy . Additional work conduct Center Epidemiologic Research Merck , Sharp Dohme Rome , University Naples , Northwestern University Chicago . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This prospective study re-examine 5,500 resident Gubbio take part Gubbio Population Study 1983-1985 . The data collect follow-up focus mainly factor related change blood pressure development hypertension include standard physical examination , height , weight , girth , blood pressure , medical history family medical history , urine collection study electrolyte excretion , venipuncture , 12-lead electrocardiogram , m-mode echocardiogram , pulse , skinfold measurement , carbon monoxide content exhale breath , sociodemographic data age , marital status , education , employment , life style data diet , alcohol intake , smoking , physical activity . Measurements make baseline permit assessment whether hypothesized positive relation lithium countertransport blood pressure independent factor age , sex , body mass index , alcohol intake , plasma uric acid , glucose , family history , variable generally associate blood pressure . The relationship 5-year change factor , change lithium countertransport , blood pressure also examine . Several additional important unresolved question epidemiology blood pressure hypertension explore : role macronutrients micronutrient lithium countertransport change ; red blood cell sodium potassium concentration relation blood pressure ; possible difference calcium metabolism hypertensives normotensives ; genetic polymorphism relate lipid-lipoprotein metabolism possible influence blood pressure ; pattern blood pressure change elderly , 639 341 person age 65-74 75 , respectively , baseline . Coronary heart disease incidence also study . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
