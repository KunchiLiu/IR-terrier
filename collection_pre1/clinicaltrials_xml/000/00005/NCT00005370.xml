	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Cortisol Pulmonary Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It hop study would provide important insight pathogenesis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease potential implication prevention early therapeutic intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All subject participate Normative Aging Study recruit study time next schedule examination . Twenty-four hour urinary excretion free cortisol , morning serum cortisol concentration , pre- post-bronchodilator spirometric index measure . For 700 subject recruit year one two study , measurement repeat subject return next triennial examination year four five study . Respiratory illness smoking questionnaire data , total differential leukocyte count , methacholine inhalation challenge test data also available time point . The specific aim study examine : ( 1 ) cross-sectional relationship level pulmonary function morning serum cortisol concentration 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion ; ( 2 ) relationship rate decline pulmonary function follow-up interval measurement cortisol concentration excretion ; ( 3 ) whether relationship modify smoke history , blood total leukocyte count , methacholine airway responsiveness , characteristic ; ( 4 ) stability time serum cortisol concentration urinary cortisol excretion age population . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
