	<brief_title>Adverse Events With Magnesium Sulfate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Preterm labor major public health concern United States . The delay labor , particularly idiopathic preterm labor , important allows fetal development opportunity administer steroid improve fetal lung maturity . It common MgSO4 administer delay labor . The dangerous adverse event MgSO4 treatment development pulmonary edema may lead maternal adult respiratory distress syndrome death associate fetal morbidity mortality . The estimate frequency complication vary 0 8 percent . Therefore , improve understanding pulmonary toxicity therapeutic agent clinically important . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There three phase study . The first , retrospective cohort study , examine incidence rate pulmonary edema MgSO4 administer tocolytic agent . The second , case-control study nest within cohort , examine relationship patient clinical factor incidence pulmonary edema patient treat MgSO4 . The third phase use result case-control study develop validate predictive index define group patient increase risk develop pulmonary edema associate MgSO4 . Patients identify use ICD-9-CM code preterm labor delivery . The medical record review determine exposure MgSO4 tocolytic agent , exclude patient receive MgSO4 indication . Cases define probable patient meet clinical definition pulmonary edema , include chest X-ray finding . The medical chart case random sample non case review detail data group compare . The primary analysis case-control data include unadjusted analysis multivariable explanatory model provide insight risk factor pulmonary edema associate MgSO4 . The data case-control study use develop clinical predictive index . The predictive rule validate separate patient population .</detailed_description>
