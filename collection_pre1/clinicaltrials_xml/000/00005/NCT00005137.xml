	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This research increase understand human variation , genetics adaptation exercise-training concomitant change cardiovascular disease diabetes risk factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 742 sedentary subject recruit , initially test , exercise-trained laboratory program 20 week , re-tested . The subject come family Caucasian descent parent three biological adult offspring family African-American ancestry . Oxygen uptake , expiratory volume respiratory exchange ratio , blood pressure , heart rate , blood lactate , glucose , glycerol free-fatty acid , stroke volume cardiac output measure exercise training maximal oxygen uptake determine . Plasma lipid , lipoproteins apoproteins , glucose tolerance insulin response intravenous glucose load , plasma sex steroid glucocorticoid , rest systolic diastolic blood pressure , body fat regional fat distribution also assess . Dietary habit , level habitual physical activity lifestyle component assess questionnaire . Genetic analysis include determination heritability level phenotype response regular exercise , test presence paternal maternal effect , sex-limited effect , major gene effect segregation pattern . Multivariate genetic analysis complex segregation analysis use develop hypothesis concern genetic basis response exercise-training . The study renew September 1997 perform analyse data collect Phase I . A series nongenetic study undertaken dataset . Physiological , behavioral , social determinant maximal submaximal indicator cardiorespiratory endurance sedentary state response training investigate take account contribution age , gender , race . Similar analysis conduct cardiovascular disease non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) risk factor monitor study . Genetic analysis determine heritability level test paternal maternal effect , major gene effect , segregation pattern use develop hypothesis concern genetic base response endurance exercise . A panel candidate gene type use association linkage study . Differential display analysis skeletal muscle transcript use identify new candidate gene response endurance exercise . Finally , genome wide search undertaken isolate candidate genomic region positional candidate gene response cardiorespiratory endurance cardiovascular NIDDM risk factor phenotype . The study renew 2001 four year continue analyse data .</detailed_description>
