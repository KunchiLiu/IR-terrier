	<brief_title>Anemia Surgery : Indications For Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The AIDS epidemic focus considerable attention risk associate blood transfusion . Perhaps importance , hemolytic transfusion reaction post-transfusion non-A non-B hepatitis continue significant concern . However , guideline blood transfusion surgical patient vary considerably medical literature . Some recent text stress need consider factor patient 's age , surgical procedure , co-morbid illness , predict blood loss , cause anemia , well hemoglobin level . Nonetheless , practice many surgeon still adhere 10g/dl threshold transfusion . The lack consensus guideline probably attribute dearth study explore indication transfusion . The study examine question limit fail analyze subset patient age , co-morbid illness , blood loss . The need develop peri-operative transfusion guideline base multivariate analysis , therefore decrease frequency unnecessary transfusion result common use hemoglobin threshold , especially important light hazard cost associate blood transfusion . Jehovah 's Witnesses chosen study population decline blood transfusion religious reason . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The retrospective case-control study explore possible association peri-operative anemia post-operative mortality status . Cases define die within 30 day operative procedure control survive . There approximately eight control per case . Participating surgeon operate Jehovah 's Witness patient within preceeding five year provide list patient . Charts patient review determine die within 30 day surgery . If patient discharge prior 30 day postoperatively , National Death Index use assess patient 's status 30 day surgery . The incidence post-operative death , 95 percent confidence level , calculate strata pre- post-operative hemoglobin level operative blood loss . The death rate calculate stratify patient base status regard co-morbid disease possible risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
