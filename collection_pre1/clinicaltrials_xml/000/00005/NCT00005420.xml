	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Modern treatment cardiovascular disease enhance survival increase need understand improve corresponding aspect quality life . The increase interest prevention health promotion contemporary cardiovascular care emphasize reduce risk factor major behavioral component , smoking , diet , exercise .

It also contrast predictive finding relate cardiac illness , stroke , hypertension predictive finding matched-control group healthy individual individual serious ( cancer ) moderately serious ( arthritis ) noncardiovascular disease . The research involve secondary data analysis large sample individual survey Center Health Care Evaluation Stanford University Medical School . The sample include individual age 55 65 use medical service two large medical center . Extensive psychosocial physical health data available mail-out inventory three point time four- year period . Of eligible respondent contact , 92 percent agree participate initial survey , 89 percent ( 1884 ) provide complete data . Participation one-year four-year follow-up approach 90 percent survive respondent previous survey . At initial testing , 411 respondent ( 22 percent ) report diagnosed cardiac illness ( exclude stroke hypertension ) , 83 respondent ( 5 percent ) report diagnosed stroke , 593 respondent ( 31 percent ) report diagnosed hypertension .

Computerized hospital medical record available one-third sample , use evaluate reliability subject ' self-reports medical condition health status . Group comparison make two dimension : illness type post-illness time interval . Longitudinal analysis use examine causal influence positive health behavior quality life , develop test integrative predictive model .</detailed_description>
