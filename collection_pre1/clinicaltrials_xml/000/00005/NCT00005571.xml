	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental drug h5G1.1-mAb treating patient dermatomyositis . This disease , cause skin rash , muscle weakness , sometimes various symptom , may due immune system abnormality . Drugs currently use treat dermatomyositis , prednisone various anticancer drug , often serious side effect may work patient . h5G1.1-mAb genetically engineer antibody block activity certain protein involve immune reaction produce inflammation . Patients age 18 year old dermatomyositis least 6 month improve prednisone therapy , tolerate prednisone therapy , may eligible 12-week study . Candidates history physical examination , include blood urine test , throat culture , muscle strength test . Participants randomly assign receive either h5G1.1-mAb placebo ( inactive substance ) . The drug placebo give intravenously ( thin tube insert vein ) week five dos every week two dos . Participants undergo follow additional test various interval study follow : 1 . Complete physical examination ( visit 9 ) 2 . Blood urine test ( various interval ) 3 . Muscle strength testing , assessment ability perform daily task , completion questionnaire regard functional ability ( visit 2 , 6 9 ) 4 . Ultrasound image muscle ( certain muscle exercise ) ( visit 2 , 6 9 ) 5 . Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ( visit 2 9 ) 6 . Throat swab ( culture ) ( visit 6 ) 7 . Examination photography skin lesion ( visit 2 9 ) 8 . Skin biopsy - removal small sample skin tissue local anesthetic ( visit 2 9 ) 9 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan muscle ( visit 2 9 ) 10 . Possible muscle biopsy - removal small sample muscle tissue local anesthetic ( visit 2 9 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , third-party , placebo-controlled pilot study h5G1.1-mAb , antibody direct complement component C5 , administer patient dermatomyositis persistent disease . We one four group take part multicenter trial sponsorship Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc . In dermatomytosis , humorally-mediated damage muscle skin microvasculature appear important . The deposition membrane attack complex ( C5-9 ) capillaries show precede destruction muscle fiber specific find skin lesion . These observation , along recent discovery effectiveness intravenous gammaglobulin ( IVIG ) dermatomyositis , support role complement activation pathogenesis dermatomyositis . Among activated component complement system , product generate cleavage C5 , namely , C5a C5b-9 , potent inflammatory mediator pleiotropic activity . Inhibition complement activation C5 would prevent formation pro-inflammatory molecule allow generation C3b , critical opsonization immune complex clearance . C5 inhibition therefore represent potentially effective therapeutic modality dermatomyositis . Anti-C5 monoclonal antibody design prevent cleavage C5 . A murine monoclonal antibody human C5 , m5G1.1-mAb , humanize ( h5G1.1-mAb ) graft antibody 's antigen-binding CDR region onto human antibody-derived framework constant domain . This antibody make available Alexion Pharmaceuticals , use IND . There 15 patient enter ( goal 12 evaluable patient ) distribute among two treatment group . Patients randomize 3 1 ratio h5G1.1-mAb placebo . Following screen period le 7 day , 2 month double-blind , randomize treatment period commence . Patients receive active ( h5G1.1-mAb , 8mg/kg ) bolus infusion every week X 5 , every 2 week X 2 , placebo bolus infusion every week X 5 , every 2 week X 2 . All patient receive 7 infusion h5G1.1-mAb placebo . The objective determine safety tolerability h5G1.1-mAb evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics antibody well efficacy target population . Safety assess via collection adverse event evaluation pre- post-treatment laboratory data . Efficacy assess change manual muscle test score relative placebo 2.25 month ( one week follow end active treatment period ) ( primary efficacy value ) , change muscle enzyme level , MRI finding , skin examination finding biopsy , SF-36 ( secondary efficacy value ) .</detailed_description>
