	<brief_title>Physical Fitness Cardiovascular Mortality Firefighters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : From 1971-1991 Occupational Health Service Los Angeles Country measure physical fitness CHD risk factor ( include physical activity , anthropometric measure , blood pressure , smoking , family history CHD , level total cholesterol , uric acid , glucose ) Los Angeles County firefighter application routine interval ( approximately every three year ) . The entire cohort 3403 firefighter follow mortality 1996 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The entire cohort 3,403 firefighers follow 1996 longitudinal study . The investigator use variety tracing source , include National Death Index , obtain death certificate determine date cause death . Cohort data analyze address follow aim : ( 1 ) To provide longitudinal description determine interrelationship among physical fitness , physical activity , measure risk factor ; ( 2 ) determine whether level physical fitness relate , independently know measure risk factor , CHD all-cause mortality ; ( 3 ) To determine whether gradient decrease CHD risk increase level physical fitness , whether appear threshold physical fitness , CHD risk stabilizes ; ( 4 ) To determine whether relationship physical fitness CHD all-cause mortality vary cardiovascular risk factor age , cholesterol level , blood pressure , smoking , obesity .</detailed_description>
