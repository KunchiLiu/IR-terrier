	<brief_title>Job Strain , Ambulatory Blood Pressure Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease account 43 percent death United States . Hypertension affect many 50 million Americans , however cause essential hypertension well know . A new CVD risk factor ( `` job strain '' ) emerge potential major cause essential hypertension . By 1995 , 20 study find significant positive relationship `` job strain '' CVD , coronary heart disease , all-cause mortality hypertension . `` Job strain '' define high psychological workload demand combine low '' decision latitude '' . An expanded concept `` job strain '' include low workplace social support ( `` iso-strain '' ) develop examine study . Important question remain answered `` job strain '' , CVD hypertension . In study , `` job strain '' measure one point time , , fact , cumulative exposure `` job strain '' believe risk factor . In addition , study rely self-report measure `` job strain '' . Also , study specifically examine risk stroke `` job strain '' . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Data Cornell University cohort study Psychosocial Factors Cardiovascular Disease Columbia University-Northern Manhattan Stroke Study analyze . The study five specific aim , include determine whether : blood pressure level associate cumulative exposure `` job strain '' ; difference blood pressure increase associate objective measure `` job strain '' ; increase risk stroke associate objective measure `` job strain '' ; change psychological variable time associate job characteristic ; change CVD risk factor ( hypertension ) associate job characteristic . Paul Landsbergis also construct measure cumulative exposure `` job strain '' determine association blood pressure , analyze association job characteristic change psychological variable cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
