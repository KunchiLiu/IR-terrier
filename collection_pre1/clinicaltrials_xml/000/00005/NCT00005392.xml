	<brief_title>Epidemiology Venous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous disease commonplace , prevalent woman , increase age , major cause morbidity . Between 6 30 percent medical expenditure cardiovascular disease venous disease . Despite fact , basic epidemiology venous disease receive limited attention . Even definition peripheral venous disease varies widely , often confuse symptom sign demonstrable pathophysiologic abnormality . This study provide estimate extent peripheral venous disease , contribute efficient diagnosis , allow insight prevent ameliorate condition risk factor modification , provide quantitative estimate daily burden disease impose patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall , age , sex , ethnic-specific , prevalence peripheral venous disease determine stratified multiethnic random sample 2,408 men woman age 29 91 year . Three specific category venous disease define include : telangiectasias flat reticular vein ; superficial venous disease without deep valvular incompetence obstruction ; deep venous disease , valvular incompetence obstruction . Varicose vein typically invariably present latter two category . These three category diagnose order non-invasive evaluation , include visual inspection , photographic documentation abnormal finding , duplex color sonography diagnose valvular incompetence venous obstruction . An evaluation make sensitivity , specificity , predictive value traditional sign symptoms venous disease three category venous disease . Signs symptom evaluate included aching , itching , swell edema , heaviness , cramp , nocturnal restless leg , pigmentation , induration , ulcer , Trendelenburg test . Risk factor evaluate three categories-of venous disease . Risk factor assess included age ; sex ; ethnicity ; socioeconomic status ; height ; weight ; obesity ; exercise ; blood pressure ; stand versus sit daily activity ; family history venous disease ; cigarette smoking ; alcohol consumption ; diet ; constipation ; constrictive clothing ; aspirin use ; use select medication ; history hernia , flat foot , condition associate connective tissue laxity ; parity ; use estrogens progestin ; age menarche ; age menopause ; concomitant arterial disease . Finally , evaluation make degree morbidity interference daily activity result venous disease , use Quality Well Being ( QWB ) scale develop University California San Diego . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
