	<brief_title>National Health Nutrition Examination Survey IV ( NHANES ( IV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The first National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES I ) conduct National Center Health Statistics 1971 1974 . NHANES I cluster , multi-stage stratified probability sample 23,808 individual range age one 74 year draw non-institutionalized civilian population United States . A random subsample 14,407 examine adult age 25-74 give supplemental questionnaire cardiovascular respiratory history . In 1981 , National Institute Aging NCHS begin follow-up original NHANES I cohort . In order evaluate usefulness major epidemiological study predict coronary heart disease United States population , NHLBI add Framingham model verification component follow-up . The risk factor ( systolic blood pressure , serum cholesterol , cigarette smoking ) death coronary heart disease compare use result seventh cohort examination 1960-1964 baseline Framingham NHANES I examination 1971-1974 baseline NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study ( NHEFS ) . The endpoint study coronary heart disease death cod death certificate . Results NHLBI portion follow-up demonstrate major risk factor coronary heart disease mortality describe previous Framingham analyse applicable United States white adult population . In 1986 , total survive cohort NHANES I ( approximately 12,500 ) re-contacted order improve risk factor morbidity mortality analyse . The NHLBI contribute fund NHANES III currently contribute fund NHANES IV . NHANES III incorporate feature distinguish earlier surveys series . The feature include longitudinal component , mean individual follow time vital statistic re-examination , long-term biological specimen banking , oversampling Blacks Hispanics . The component additional question procedure provide information common heart , vascular , lung , blood disease , risk factor elements medical care . It also indicate representative NHLBI population-based epidemiologic study extent finding study could generalize United States population . The major NHLBI ongoing study compare NHANES III Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factor Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) , Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) , Framingham Heart Study , Cardiovascular Health Study . Field work NHANES III begin September 1988 . The first wave data collection complete 1989 1991 . The second wave data collection carry 1992 1994 . ECG data release public 1998 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1981 , NHLBI supplement NHANES examination protocol include question history heart , lung , blood disease , treatment . The examination also include Rose questionnaire angina , myocardial infarction peripheral vascular disease , 12-lead electrocardiogram , question know suspected risk factor include active passive smoking , weight history , use exogenous hormone , family history heart , lung blood disease , select aspect diet , psychosocial characteristic ( depression , anxiety , social support , job control demand , anger experience expression ) , lifestyle . If feasible , 2-hour ECG Holter monitor record obtain identify classify premature ventricular contraction detect episode ischemia . Pulmonary function test perform use standardize method strict quality assurance procedure American Thoracic Society-Division Lung Diseases respiratory disease questionnaire administer . Waist hip girth measurement obtain along anthropometric measure . Blood pressure determination make home well mobile examination center . Blood test include lipid lipoprotein , fibrinogen , hematocrit , white blood cell count , differential , fast post-challenge insulin glucose concentration , nutritional biochemistry . The NHLBI currently support part NHANES IV . NHANES IV study representative sample approximately 30,000 non-institutionalized population United States , obtain use complex multi-stage sample design use combination health questionnaire physical exam . Each single year combination consecutive year comprise nationally representative sample facilitate linkage survey provide yearly estimate Continuing Survey Food Intake Individuals allow limited national estimate NHANES IV year . The NHLBI component obtain information prevalence distribution common heart , vascular , pulmonary blood disease . The core questionnaire base Health Interview Survey ( HIS ) , provide information disease , risk factor , component medical care . Through use Mobile Exam Center ( MEC ) , subject throughout country administer standardized physical exam obtain data blood pressure , venipuncture , spirometry , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , ankle-arm blood pressure . Sub-populations U.S. particular interest , include minority age group particular concern like young elderly , over-sampled . Specific objective NHANES IV include : ascertaining prevalence common heart , vascular , lung , blood disease representative sample non-institutionalized population United States ; estimate frequency distribution know suspected risk factor heart , vascular , lung , blood disease ; measure association risk factor diseases ; ascertain frequency distribution medical , surgical , pharmacologic , behavioral intervention use prevent treat heart , lung blood disease ; measure trend time heart , lung blood disease risk factor ; relate clinically manifest disease , risk factor , component medical care detect baseline examination subsequent morbidity mortality ( detect follow-up questionnaire match National Death Index ) ; determine extent finding NHLBI populations-based epidemiological study reflect national data may generalize U.S. population . A Central Lipid Laboratory establish : standardize lipid measurement ; accurately measure total cholesterol HDL cholesterol entire NHANES IV sample population ; accurately measure triglycerides fast NHANES IV population . Phase I data first three year study make available June , 2002 . Phase II data NHANES IV become available May , 2004 .</detailed_description>
