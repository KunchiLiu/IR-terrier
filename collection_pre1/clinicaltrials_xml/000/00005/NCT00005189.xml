	<brief_title>Carotid Atherosclerosis Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although angiographic evidence coronary atherosclerosis one best predictor clinical event , non-invasive image arterial bed yet possible . The availability non-invasive method image carotid artery , intra-individual similarity extent disease coronary carotid artery provide rationale study assess usefulness B-mode ultrascan evaluation extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis independent predictor clinical sequela fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction stroke . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Pilot data ongoing case-comparison study risk factor coronary carotid atherosclerosis define angiography B-mode ultrasound provide background project . Patients pilot study use study . Beginning 1986 , traditional risk factor lipid , lipoprotein , blood pressure , diabetes , smoke measure non-traditional risk factor apolipoproteins genetic marker . The cohort follow 3.5 8.5 year incidence clinical event . Multivariate technique use relate disease risk factor status all-cause mortality , fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction , fatal non-fatal stroke . The subject re-evaluated periodically B-mode extent carotid atherosclerosis . A fifty percent random sample patient positive cerebrovascular disease coronary artery disease fifty percent random sample patient negative cerebrovascular disease coronary artery disease repeat B-mode measurement 2.5 year . All patient survive end five year repeat B-mode scan . The study renew 1996 April 1999 conduct longitudinal study test follow hypothesis : 1 . ) Incidence cardiovascular event ( bypass surgery , angioplasty , fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke endarterectomy ) men woman extensive carotid wall thickening ( CWT ) baseline exceed less extensive baseline carotid wall thickening ; relation carotid wall thicken outcome independent coronary artery disease and/or coronary artery disease risk factor ; , 2 . ) carotid wall thickening progress rapidly male female coronary artery disease and/or coronary artery disease risk factor coronary artery disease/risk factor free control . The investigator intend : 1 ) follow-up cohort 670 individual define coronary anatomy , extent carotid wall thickening , coronary artery disease risk factor 5-10 year fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event . Coronary artery disease , carotid wall thickening , coronary artery disease risk factor status accession relate outcome ; , 2 . ) In separate ( new ) cohort 280 volunteer without coronary artery disease evaluate carotid wall thicken yearly three year , use multivariable analysis relate accession status progression rate . Availability unique sample patient largely already characterize coronary status ( angiography ) , coronary artery disease risk factor , carotid wall thickening , development B-mode method quantify carotid wall thicken biostatistical approach quantify progression carotid wall thicken short time span ( three year ) provide opportunity project . Recent pilot data support feasibility . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
