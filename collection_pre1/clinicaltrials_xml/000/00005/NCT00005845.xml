	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile antitumor activity farnesyltransferase ( FTase ) inhibitor R115777 ( tipifarnib ) patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) treat one week on/one week schedule . II . To determine effect R115777 one week on/one week schedule FTase activity , prenylation RAS substrates downstream effect . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive tipifarnib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
