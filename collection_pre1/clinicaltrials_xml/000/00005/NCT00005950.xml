	<brief_title>506U78 Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate , failure-free survival , progression-free survival patient recurrent refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma peripheral T-cell lymphoma treat 506U78 . II . Assess pharmacokinetics toxicity treatment patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive 506U78 IV 2 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
