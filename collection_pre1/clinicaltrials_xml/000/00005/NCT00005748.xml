	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : African Americans suffer disproportionate rate hypertension relate cardiovascular morbidity mortality due , least part , excessive socioenvironmental psychosocial stress . Furthermore , despite substantial individual population risk burden associate high normal blood pressure ( BP ) African Americans , control study evaluate stress reduction approach primary prevention hypertension target high risk group . Therefore , recent ( mid 1990s ) NIH NIMH policy committee call new research focus primary prevention hypertension target high risk populations-notably African Americans high normal BP . In previous randomize controlled trial investigator , hypertension psychosocial stress significantly reduce low SES African Americans practice stress reduction Transcendental Mediation ( TM ) program compare relaxation health education control . In recent long-term trial , African Americans borderline hypertension show BP reduction would associate 17 percent decrease prevalence hypertension , 15 percent reduction stroke , 6 percent reduction CHD population . These BP reduction compare favorably decrease show sodium restriction weight loss program prevention trial . Also , pilot data two clinical trial indicate TM associate significantly low cardiovascular morbidity mortality African Americans Caucasians high BP 5-year 15-year period , respectively . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized control trial stress reduction primary prevention hypertension conduct African Americans high normal BP . African American male female ( N-352 , age 21-75 year ) high normal BP ( SBP 130-139 and/or DBP 85-89 mm Hg ) recruit African American Family Heart Health Plan Medical College Wisconsin , Milwaukee , house nation 's large registry African Americans know CVD risk factor . After baseline assessment , participant randomize either TM program match health education control intervention . The primary outcome change clinic BP 12-month follow-up . Secondary outcome include change ambulatory BP , hypertensive event , psychosocial stress health behavior . Also , model pathway component stressful experience affect high BP African Americans test . This study describe clinical trial . The summary statement state NIH Phase III clinical trial . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
