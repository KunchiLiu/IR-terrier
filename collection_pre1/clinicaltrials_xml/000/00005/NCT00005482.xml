	<brief_title>Homocyst ( e ) Ine , Vitamin Status , CVD Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Elevated plasma homocyst ( e ) ine risk factor vascular disease middle-aged men . Supplementation folate , extent vitamin B12 B6 , reduce plasma homocyst ( e ) ine level . There also evidence vitro study adverse atherogenic thrombotic effect Lp ( ) may greatly enhance homocyst ( e ) ine . The high prevalence low level folate vitamin B12 B6 among elderly United States lead hypothesis substantial portion cardiovascular morbidity mortality among old person could prevent increase intake nutrient reduce plasma level homocysteine . Little known , however , regard relationship homocysteine , folate , B vitamins , Lp ( ) cardiovascular disease among elderly , among CVD represent lead cause morbidity mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In ancillary study prospective Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) , case-cohort design use test hypothesis risk myocardial infarction and/or stoke associate elevated plasma level homocysteine , low plasma level folate , vitamin B12 B6 . Further , determination make whether elevated plasma level homocysteine Lp ( ) interact increase substantially risk myocardial infarction and/or stroke due either factor alone . The sub-cohort use study relationship factor study progression sub-clinical atherosclerosis . For case sub-cohort member , aliquot fast plasma drawn baseline analyze homocysteine , folate B12 , B6 concentration . [ Values plasma Lp ( ) determine baseline . ] Results assay combine CHS data address hypothesis risk myocardial infarction and/or stroke associate elevated plasma level homocysteine , low plasma level folate , vitamin B12 B6 .</detailed_description>
