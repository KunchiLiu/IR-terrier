	<brief_title>Weight Set-Point HDL Concentration Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The elevated high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol concentration long distance runner ascribe almost exclusively increased muscle lipoprotein lipase . Based data collect cross-sectional longitudinal study , investigator propose alternative theory : long-distance runner HDL-cholesterol metabolism men sedentary weight rather HDL-cholesterol metabolism lean sedentary men usual sedentary weight . In analysis , find significant determinant male runner ' plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration difference runner ' great weight current weight . HDL- cholesterol level high runner lose weight , i.e. , high presume furthest weight set-point The study result Program Announcement ( PA ) release October , 1994 Physical Activity Cardiopulmonary Health . The PA jointly sponsor NHLBI , National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases , National Institute Nursing Research . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In cross-sectional study , runner sedentary men woman measure lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis HDL low-density lipoprotein subclass , apolipoproteins A-I B , intravenous fat clearance rate , post-heparin lipoprotein lipase hepatic lipase , adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase , cholesteryl ester transfer activity , diet , percent body fat , regional adiposity . It hop survey would confirm reject weight set-point hypothesis , provide possible explanation lipoprotein difference male female runner , elucidate mechanism lipoprotein change occur exercise-induced weight loss . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
