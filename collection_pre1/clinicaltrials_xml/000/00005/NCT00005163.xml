The National Health Information Clearinghouse divide follow three category : Computer-Scored HRAs , mail central computer facility batch process usually complex detailed appraisal ; Microcomputer-Based HRAs , c ; ould process microcomputer home , school worksite ; Self-Scored HRAs , usually brief , involve computer , score user . Although HRAs burgeon industry health education , properly design conduct scientific evaluation sufficiently large representative sample general population undertaken United States elsewhere . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In first stage , fourteen HRAs evaluate determine validity score system estimate cardiovascular risk employ Framingham Heart Study data base , accuracy report risk factor score measure physiological value , understandability social acceptability instrument format . The second stage project field test determine reliability cost-effectiveness . Ten group respondent form randomly assign eligible adult one five HRA group reliability validity status . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
