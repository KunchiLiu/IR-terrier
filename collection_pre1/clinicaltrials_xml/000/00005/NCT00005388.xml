	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prevalence obesity increase markedly United States 1960 's 1980 's , vary race gender particularly high rate obesity among Black woman . Reasons ethnic difference prevalence obesity understood . This cross-sectional study perform conjunction 10-year follow-up examination Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study , NHLBI-funded longitudinal study development risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) young black white adult . This study represent unique opportunity investigate factor may influence development obesity , good understand relationship obesity cardiovascular risk factor , increase understand racial difference adiposity . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional study test hypothesis visceral adipose tissue , component fat consider strongly relate coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk factor , differ Black white subject . Specifically , investigator propose Black subject less visceral adipose tissue give level total body fat white subject . Further , relationship visceral adipose tissue risk factor CHD similar subject . This would explain different relationship obesity CHD risk factor see Black vs white subject . A second specific aim determine whether Black woman low rest energy expenditure Black men white . This could explain high prevalence obesity Black woman Black men white either gender . CT scan record tape ship University Colorado Health Sciences Center visceral adipose tissue quantify . Dietary intake physical activity measure important covariates relationship metabolic rate adiposity , thyroid function measure determinant rest energy expenditure . The CARDIA study provide funding cardiovascular risk factor measurement , include blood pressure , lipid , insulin , glucose , smoking , anthropometric measurement include dual energy absorptiometry ( DEXA ) measurement total regional body fat . The study renew 1999 March 2004 perform five-year follow-up cohort .</detailed_description>
