	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Beginning 1920s , death rate coronary heart disease United States rise unyielding fashion reach epidemic proportion mid-1960s . Since time , mortality attribute coronary heart disease level turn markedly downwards . In ten-year period 1968 1978 great 25 percent decline overall age-adjusted death rate coronary heart disease , phenomenon observe sex , age group three major race/ethnic group . While significant encouraging decline appear real due artifactual change death certification practice , cause decrease remain obscure coronary heart disease continue major cause death disability United States . Internationally , inconsistent trend mortality rate attribute coronary heart disease occur . These rate decline early 1960s Australia , Canada , France , Japan , Switzerland Italy mortality rate coronary heart disease continue increase period late 1970s England Wales , Ireland , Finland , Norway , New Zealand Israel . Despite encouraging enigmatic decline mortality attribute coronary heart disease United States certain country , paucity population-based data exist ascertain whether temporal decline death rate due change incidence rate new coronary event , change survival acute coronary episode combination thereof . These data crucial importance formulate explanation decline mortality rate . A decline incidence rate coronary heart disease would suggest mortality decline due measure primary prevention change prevalence and/or level major coronary risk factor , increased detection control hypertension , decrease cigarette smoke decline serum cholesterol level . If , however , incidence rate coronary heart disease remain steady even increase , likely explanation downward trend cardiovascular mortality would due effort direct secondary prevention include establishment effective utilization coronary care unit , therapeutic intervention , emergency medical service . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This longitudinal study examines recent ( 1997 1999 ) compare prior ( 1975 , 1978 , 1981 , 1984 , 1986 , 1988 , 1990 , 1991 , 1993 , 1995 ) time trend annual attack rate acute myocardial infarction out-of-hospital coronary heart disease death , recent ( 1997 1999 ) well prior ( 1975-1995 ) change time in-hospital long-term survival rate acute myocardial infarction , relationship incidence survival pattern acute myocardial infarction select demographic , clinical medical care factor . The study also examine change time therapeutic management , diagnostic evaluation , surgical workup patient hospitalize acute myocardial infarction , well related issue cost . The study renew 1992 1997 . The 1997 renewal study , carry 13 acute general hospital Worcester Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area , use extend previous approach use conduct study . All new ( incident ) recurrent episodes definite acute myocardial infarction occur among Worcester resident calendar year 1997 1999 identify discharge diagnostic printout obtain metropolitan Worcester hospital . The medical record patient individually review validation purpose accord pre-established diagnostic criterion acute myocardial infarction . Abstraction medical record patient satisfy diagnostic geographic eligibility criterion carry standardized recording relevant data . A review record additional hospitalization statewide national search death certificate carry examine long-term survival status discharge hospital patient propose study year well identify previously ( 1975-1995 ) year 2000 . Death certificate Worcester SMSA resident review identify case out-of-hospital death due coronary heart disease occur 1997 1999 determine temporal trend incidence rate . The study renew 2001 five year examine examine recent ( 2000 2003 ) compare prior ( 1975 1999 ) trend annual attack survival rate AMI , out-of-hospital death attribute CHD , relationship incidence survival pattern AMI demographic , clinical , medical care factor . An additional objective multi-hospital community-wide study examine change time use select therapy coronary interventional approach patient hospitalize AMI .</detailed_description>
