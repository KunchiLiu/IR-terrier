	<brief_title>AE-941 Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare survival patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma refractory immunotherapy treat AE-941 ( Neovastat ) versus placebo . II . Compare time progression one-year survival rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine safety regimen patient . IV . Compare overall tumor response rate , duration response , quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number organ metastasis ( 1 vs 1 ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral AE-941 ( Neovastat ) twice day . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice day . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Quality life assess day 1 every 8 week thereafter . Patients follow every 4 week disease progression every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 280 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
