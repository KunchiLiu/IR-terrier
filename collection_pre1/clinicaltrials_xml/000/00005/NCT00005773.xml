	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize control trial test whether initiate iNO therapy earlier would reduce death reduce use extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) -- temporary lung bypass -- therapy compare standard recommendation threshold . Infants born &gt; 34 week ' gestation enrol require assisted ventilation oxygenation index ( OI ) &gt; 15 &lt; 25 2 measurement 12-hour interval . Infants randomize receive either early iNO simulate initiation iNO ( control ) . Infants increase OI 25 give iNO standard therapy .

	<brief_title>Early Inhaled Nitric Oxide Respiratory Failure Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory failure occur near term term infant complication perinatal aspiration syndrome , pneumonia , sepsis , respiratory distress syndrome primary pulmonary hypertension . Recently collaborative trial NICHD Neonatal Research Network Canadian Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study Group ( NINOS trial ) demonstrate inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) reduce number death need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) therapy -- lung bypass mechanism -- 64 percent 46 percent . The standard recommend threshold initiation iNO therapy , base trial , oxygenation index ( OI ) &gt; =25 . The purpose study determine administration inhale nitric oxide early course respiratory failure infant less severe respiratory failure , decrease incidence ECMO death , suggest sub-group analysis original NINOS trial . This prospective , randomize control trial test whether initiate iNO therapy earlier would reduce death reduce use ECMO therapy compare standard recommendation threshold . Infants born &gt; 34 week ' gestation ( near- full-term ) enrol require assisted ventilation oxygenation index ( OI ) &gt; 15 &lt; 25 2 measurement 12-hour interval . Infants randomize receive either early iNO simulate initiation iNO ( control ) . Infants increase OI 25 give iNO standard therapy . The neurodevelopment subject evaluate 18-22 month correct age . The study compare outcome infant receive iNO OI &gt; 15 &lt; 25 , control group receive simulate early procedure iNO actually give base standard recommendation . iNO deliver 20 ppm initial dose-response evaluation . Infants either group show subsequent deterioration OI &gt; 25 two consecutive measurement least one hour apart , rapid deterioration OI &gt; 30 two consecutive measurement 15 minute apart , receive iNO therapy part standard medical management . Specific guideline follow use high frequency ventilation surfactant study gas administration prevent confound result study . Study recruitment discontinue 3 year due persistent decline enrollment . Infants give neurodevelopmental exams 18-22 month correct age .</detailed_description>
