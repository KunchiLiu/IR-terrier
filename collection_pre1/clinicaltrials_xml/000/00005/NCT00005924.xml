	<brief_summary>This study examine effect long-term antiviral therapy valaciclovir ( Valtrex ) Epstein-Barr virus infection . This virus infect 95 percent people United States . Most infected childhood , symptom , unaware infection . People infected adolescent adult may develop infectious mononucleosis , usually resolve completely . Once infected , people shed virus throat occasionally , carry virus white blood cell life . This study determine whether amount virus blood decline disappear long-term valaciclovir treatment . Normal volunteer take antiviral medicine patient enrol NIH 's protocol . 97-I-0168 ( Evaluation Valaciclovir Prevention Herpes Simplex Virus Transmission ) Glaxo-Wellcome protocol HS2AB 3009 collaborate center may eligible study . Patients multi-center study must start valaciclovir therapy least 1 year . All candidate must 18 year age old . Study participant see clinic 1 hour every 3 month year . During visit , provide information medicine take , gargle twice salt water spit fluid tube , blood drawn ( 8 teaspoon visit ) . The blood gargle fluid test amount Epstein-Barr virus antibody virus . ( Blood sample also test HLA type order immunologic study laboratory . HLA marker immune system similar blood-typing testing . ) The result people take valaciclovir compare people take drug . People whose result show virus disappear body continue follow twice year 5 year blood gargle test continue look evidence virus . Also , people develop symptom resemble mononucleosis ( e.g. , enlarge lymph node fever sore throat ) ask blood test virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Long-Term Treatment With Valaciclovir ( Valtrex ) Epstein-Barr Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) cause heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis . After primary EBV infection , virus persists rest memory B lymphocytes detected oropharyngeal secretion . Short term ( 1 month ) treatment oral acyclovir , inhibit EBV replication , result loss virus shed oropharynx , virus persists B cell . The goal study determine EBV longer persist B cell patient treat long term ( 20 month ) oral valaciclovir ( metabolize acyclovir ) . Blood sample throat washing obtain every three month individual receive valaciclovir treatment genital herpes simplex virus infection . These sample analyze EBV DNA determine level EBV DNA decline becomes negative long term antiviral therapy . If level EBV DNA become undetectable EBV-seropositive person study , ask patient return twice year five year develop symptom mononucleosis , EBV DNA blood throat washing study . Knowledge gain study provide important insight mechanism persistence EBV infection .</detailed_description>
