	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cigarette smoke recognize important factor development chronic airflow obstruction , yet minority cigarette smoker develop clinical disease . In 1985 , interest focus role increase level airways responsiveness atopy possible potentiate factor development chronic airflow obstruction . Then current epidemiologic study data one potential risk factor small adequately address issue involve . The present study ass airways responsiveness atopy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use population data base Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study ( NAS ) begin 1963 . The NAS population consist 1,900 men originally select good health wife . The NAS currently administer cigarette smoke history questionnaire , NHLBI-ATS respiratory symptom illness questionnaire , spirometry regularly schedule examination three year apart . The current study assess airway responsiveness measure response methacholine inhalation atopy measure skin test , blood eosinophilia , serum IgE NAS participant return next two examination . The data use examine relationship airways responsiveness , atopy , cigarette smoke respiratory symptom cross-sectionally longitudinally . The study renew 1996 prospectively identify factor influence rate decline pulmonary function identify predictor chronic obstructive lung disease ( COLD ) asthma population sample old adult . The investigator hypothesize development accelerate decline FEV1 occurrence respiratory symptom old adult determine two environmental exposure : tobacco smoke-induced injury IgE-mediated hypersensitivity inhale aeroallergens . The extent allergen exposure airway responsiveness lead fix airflow obstruction old adult unknown . The primary allergens interest include : house dust mite ( Der p I , Der fI ) , cockroach ( Bla g I , Bla g II ) , cat ( Fel I ) , fungi . Airway hyperresponsiveness bronchoconstricting stimuli physiologic characteristic may think manifestation airway disease intrinsic host characteristic predisposes development airway disease determines clinical pattern . They use extensive longitudinal information respiratory symptom illness , cigarette smoking , pulmonary function , airway responsiveness , index atopy ( skin test , total antigen-specific IgE ) , indices inflammation ( eosinophil leukocyte count peripheral blood ) , allergen level dust air NAS participants wife address follow hypothesis : association increase airway responsiveness accelerate longitudinal decline pulmonary function modify gender , smoking , level FEV1 , skin test reactivity ; . level exposure common indoor allergen affect rate longitudinal decline pulmonary function ; high level exposure common indoor allergen lead longitudinal increase airway responsiveness time ; settle dust level fungi ( culturable countable organism ) antigen , cockroach ( Bla g l , Bla g II ] , cat ( Fel I ) correlate airborne level agent . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
