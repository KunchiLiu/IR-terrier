	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sleep apnea characterize repetitive cessation respiration sleep consequent decrease arterial oxygen saturation . Sleep apnea cause upper airway obstruction central nervous system failure sufficiently excite diaphragm accessory respiratory muscle . However , case , process involve . Hypopneas , airflow significantly compromise without complete cessation respiratory flow , snore often find association apnea . Both apneas hypopnea cause repetitive disruption sleep , consequent daytime somnolence , complex cardio-respiratory disturbance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study longitudinal design . A stratified random sample adult San Diego use examine risk factor prevalence sleep respiratory disturbance . A structured random sample select random digit telephone dialing . Subjects study home . Some follow yearly project . Each volunteer give brief sleep history medical review , include blood pressure measurement , National Interview Survey , And Quality Well-being Scale . Blood oxygen saturation , pulse rate , snore , sleep duration record three night . State-of-the-art computerized pulse oximeter microprocessor-based activity/light monitor use . Subjects find severe sleep respiratory disturbance underwent laboratory polysomnograms add descriptive data validate survey methodology . The prevalence respiratory disturbance sleep analyzed function age sex . Associations several aspect morbidity determine . The longitudinal course respiratory disturbance sleep examine . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
