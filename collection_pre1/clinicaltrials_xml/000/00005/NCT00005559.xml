	<brief_title>Statistical Basis Hemochromatosis Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Once consider rare disorder , hemochromatosis recognize one common autosomal recessive disorder white population . Substantial morbidity mortality may result untreated hemochromatosis ; thus , early detection treatment essential . The Centers Disease Control Prevention College American Pathologists recommend regular screening hereditary hemochromatosis . Transferrin saturation regard best single screen test detection individual risk disorder . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Statistical mixture model use develop guideline hemochromatosis screen regime determine frequency gene hemochromatosis . The research design provide statistical foundation analysis population transferrin saturation assist development optimal screening regimen hemochromatosis . To determine potential screening threshold , probability method apply data third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , cross-sectional probability sample weight represent U.S. population . Statistical mixture modeling use determine potential transferrin saturation screen threshold identify individual repeat test possible evaluation . The actual sensitivity specificity screen threshold assess use data separate demonstration project , `` Cost effective Hemochromatosis Survey Primary Care '' , design identify individual hemochromatosis . In addition , gene frequency hemochromatosis white ethnic subgroup also determine analysis transferrin saturation data NHANES III . The study two specific aim , follow : ( 1 ) develop guideline use transferrin saturation relate test detection individual risk hemochromatosis , ( 2 ) determine frequency gene hemochromatosis United States statistical mixture model population transferrin saturation data NHANES III . Providing statistical foundation analysis transferrin saturation facilitate development optimal , cost-effective screening regimen identification individual require evaluation hemochromatosis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
