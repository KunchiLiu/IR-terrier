	<brief_title>Quantitative Genetic Analysis Lipid Research Clinic Family Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although coronary heart disease long know aggregate family , 1986 little know relative importance genetic environmental factor . This partly due heterogeneous nature disease . Instead analyze complex endpoint , tendency focus individual risk factor phenotypes . Plasma lipids lipoproteins heterogeneous risk factor analyze subgroup genetic epidemiological perspective . Attention turn familial aggregation risk factor , particularly hyperlipidemia , hypertension , diabetes . In 1971 , National Heart Lung Institute begin series epidemiologic study several North American site Lipid Research Clinics Program . The Family Study design investigate familial association blood lipid , lipoprotein , dyslipoproteinemias . This study complement duplicate ongoing analysis Lipid Research Clinics data . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study address seven phenotype , derive fasting blood sample : total cholesterol , total triglyceride , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , VLDL-cholesterol , uric acid , glucose level . The data already collect Lipid Research Clinics Cincinnati , Iowa , Oklahoma , Minneapolis , Stanford . Univariate bivariate segregation analysis conduct mode inheritance familial combine hyperlipidemia familial primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia . Path analysis use resolve cultural biological inheritance phenotype within clinic resolution population heterogeneity among five Lipid Research Clinics . A general bivariate path model use analyze association among various phenotype . General model use analyze temporal trend family resemblance seven phenotype . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
