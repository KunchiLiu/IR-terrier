PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness interleukin-2 without histamine dihydrochloride treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 With Without Histamine Dihydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical efficacy safety subcutaneous ( SC ) histamine dihydrochloride give conjunction SC recombinant human interleukin-2 patient stage IV renal cell carcinoma term survival 1 year , objective tumor response rate , duration response , median survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , open label study . Patients randomized receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) without histamine dihydrochloride . - Arm I : Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously ( SC ) daily histamine dihydrochloride SC twice daily day 1-5 week 1-3 follow 2 week rest . - Arm II : Patients receive IL-2 arm I . Treatment continue minimum 2 course arm absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
