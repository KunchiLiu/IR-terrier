	<brief_summary>This study ass value improve magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique study lens human eye . Knowledge cataracts develop progress hamper lack human tissue available study ; MRI may provide effective mean learn eye disease . Normal volunteer 18 70 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo medical history complete eye examination , include vision assessment , eye pressure measurement , lens retina examination , photography eye . MRI scan schedule second visit . For procedure , volunteer 's pupil dilate lie stretcher move cylinder contain magnetic field . A device similar welder 's helmet place head . Attached device image probe small blinking light . The probe receive radio signal eye computer convert image . During imaging , participant gaze blink light ; help keep eye blink wander . Scan time vary 2 10 minute ; total time study less hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies human diabetic cataract age relate cataract formation hamper unavailability human tissue especially early stage disease . Eye bank tissue first use cornea transplant time become available basic research study , lens longer suitable biochemical histological study . Cataracts usually become available extraction end stage development . However , appropriate surgical lens specimens longer available cataract generally extract destructive phakoemulsification technique . Therefore , noninvasive technique require order study lens vivo .</detailed_description>
