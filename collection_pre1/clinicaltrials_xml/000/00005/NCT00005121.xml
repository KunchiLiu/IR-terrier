	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Framingham Heart Study , initiated 1948 , design longitudinal investigation constitutional environmental factor influence development cardiovascular disease men woman free condition outset . The first person examine September 1948 four year later 5,209 person receive first examination . The group follow Study twenty-four subsequent biennial examination . The need information arise fact epidemiology cardiovascular disease incompletely know , estimation risk imprecise , pattern cardiovascular disease incidence change ; change need document . Changing pattern cigarette smoking , nutritional habit exercise pattern well change aspect lifestyle advance medical care may influence future morbidity mortality rate cardiovascular disease . New case clinically recognizable cardiovascular disease less predictable disease free subject age 60 , already large grow proportion total cardiovascular disease event first express age . Recently available , technologically advanced measurement tool echocardiography need evaluate risk assessor various age group . Similarly , predictive efficacy recently available lipoprotein cholesterol apoprotein measurement need demonstrate early onset ( age le 60 ) well later onset cardiovascular disease . Thus , change early detection treatment cardiovascular disease advance , prospective epidemiology need document value impact change organize fashion . Finally , availability prospective data two generation add uniqueness Framingham Study among ongoing study CVD epidemiology . A determination extent mechanism cardiovascular disease cluster family another important goal Framingham Study . In 1982 , National Institute Aging initiate study senile dementia use Framingham Heart Study cohort . The study design determine morbidity mortality outcomes among 160 subject identify suffer dementia 15th biennial examination determine incidence senile dementia among subject free dementia 15th biennial examination . Outcome nursing home admission also determine study participant . Biennial comprehensive examination Framingham Heart Study cohort take place since 1949 . Until examination 12 , study carry entirely NHLBI . After time , Boston University Medical Center , collaboration , use facility equipment make available NHLBI , responsible examination . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Biennial examination conduct survive original cohort obtain information physical activity , blood pressure , diet , body weight , occupational history , psychosocial factor , personal habit smoke . Special test include electrocardiographic evaluation , exercise stress test , HLA typing , lipoprotein apoprotein test , non-invasive assessment atherosclerosis , fast blood glucose , lung function test , B-scan/Doppler carotid femoral artery , clot hemostatic measure . Endpoints include coronary heart disease , stroke , hypertension , congestive heart failure , peripheral arterial disease . Members Offspring Study examine first time 1971 1975 , second time 1979 1983 , third time 1983 1987 . Examinations consist complete physical examination include rest electrocardiogram , medical history , non-invasive cardiovascular examination , lung function assessment , lipoprotein cholesterol apoprotein measurement , SMA 25 , personal history interview , blood cell ion flux measurement , platelet function blood clot factor measurement . The 27th exam approximately 400 survivor original cohort complete . The 28th exam begin ahead schedule . The 7th exam Offspring Cohort begin September 1998 complete December 2001 3,500 participant examine . The genome scan complete approximately 1,800 sample 336 family . A Genetics Advisory Panel meet regularly advise NHLBI direction genetic research within Framingham Study . Analysis genetic nongenetic data ongoing extensive cover area genetics lipid , lifetime risk coronary heart disease , trend event follow Q-wave myocardial infarction , factor affect leave ventricular hypertrophy , prevalence determinant heart valve disorder . Initiation Third Generation Study announce November 2001 . Beginning 2002 , Third Generation Study enrol 3,900 grandchild Framingham Heart Study 's original enrollee . Key goal identify new risk factor heart , lung , blood disease , identify gene contribute good health development heart , lung , blood disease , develop new image test detect early stage coronary atherosclerosis otherwise healthy adult .</detailed_description>
