	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Social dominance , tendency exercise social influence control , positively associate coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk among male , independent biomedical risk factor hostility . Exposure dominant others behavior also associate elevate CHD risk . For female , submissiveness constellation psychosocial behavior opposite urgency competitiveness associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The study extend grow literature concern central role social relationship health illness test theoretical model address social relationship interpersonally-oriented person variable dominance may differ consequence physical well-being men woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The three study design test social-contextual model dominance cardiovascular stress reactivity ( CVR ) synthesize elaborate earlier model order account ( 1 ) cardiovascular consequence exposure dominant others ( 2 ) difference dominant men 's woman 's cardiovascular response social interaction . Because disproportionately high rate CVD among Black Americans , Black white men woman include study . Using laboratory social interaction paradigm , study 1 refine validate cod system design assess dominant hostile behavior dyadic social interaction . Study 2 examine two factor propose account difference dominant men 's woman 's cardiovascular response social interaction : ( 1 ) explicit role demand regard dominance expression ( i.e. , degree situation provide clear salient cue regard expect acceptable behavior ) ( 2 ) gender composition dyad ( i.e. , sex versus opposite sex ) . These two factor manipulate independently unacquainted , healthy young adult men woman participate task-oriented dyadic discussion design activate motif influence ; cardiovascular response measure discussion precede rest . Study 3 , secondary analysis data collect study 2 , examine association CVR exposure others ' dominance . The aforementioned behavioral coding system use assess behavioral dominance observe study 2 path analytic technique use model association among CVR , one 's one 's partner 's trait behavioral dominance , gender , situational factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
