	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blood pressure continuous unimodal distribution general population . Individuals level elevate 80th percentile suffer hypertension , major cause cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Over 95 percent hypertensive primary disease say essential hypertension . Pedigree twin study indicate genetic difference account large fraction interindividual variation blood pressure . In 1984 study begin , genetic locus yet identify useful marker essential hypertension serve probes biological basis interindividual blood pressure variability . Environmental factor also influence blood pressure ; increase dietary intake sodium chloride , particular , elevate blood pressure may contribute development essential hypertension people . It hypothesize genetically determine alteration metabolism sodium ion occur subset population increase liability develop elevate blood pressure upon exposure usual range dietary sodium intake Reports alter sodium transport red blood cell individual essential hypertension offspring stimulate interest hypothesis . Several proposal offer explain alteration sodium transport similar observe red blood cell could lead elevate blood pressure present renal tubule vascular smooth muscle . Studies sodium-lithium countertransport system indicate red blood cell sodium transport pathway may provide informative phenotype relate blood pressure essential hypertension closely genetic factor . Numerous laboratory confirm maximal rate sodium-lithium countertransport increase red blood cell individual essential hypertension . The sodium-lithium countertransport normal secondary form hypertension increase level essential hypertension attribute age , body size , gender dietary salt intake . The high level observe individual positive family history essential hypertension low level occur normotensive control without hypertensive relative . DESIGN NARRATIVE : When study begin 1984 , objective determine whether genetic alteration pathway sodium transport red blood cell child could predict risk develop primary hypertension adulthood . Approximately 600 child 7 18 year age randomly select index case family study . Each participate member pedigree study underwent venipuncture withdrawal whole blood . A medical history obtain family member visit clinic physical examination conduct . Existing medical record live deceased adult relatives 600 pedigree review . In addition , 40 normotensive adult member 300 pedigree underwent metabolic balance renal clearance study , well ambulatory blood pressure recording . Segregation analysis pedigree data carry determine likely mode genetic transmission sodium-lithium counter-transport phenotype . Baseline genetic information sodium-lithium related prevalence primary hypertension family index child . Additional phenotype involve blood pressure regulation also study include renal proximal tubular sodium reabsorption , atrial natriuretic peptide , sodium-potassium adenosinetriphosphate pump , sodium-potassium cotransport . The study renew several time , last 1992 continue work genetic basis interindividual variation risk essential hypertension population large use Rochester Family Heart Study ( RFHS ) . The RFHS use address three major question : 1 ) Which intermediate biochemical , physiological , anthropomorphic trait predict blood pressure contribute pathogenesis essential hypertension 2 ) Did allelic variation one gene large effect intermediate trait ? 3 ) Did information allelic variation improve prediction risk essential hypertension beyond provided measure intermediate trait ? The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
