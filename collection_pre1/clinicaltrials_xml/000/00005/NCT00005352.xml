	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : Studies conduct blood pressure neuroendocrine effect noise result relocation Munich International Airport . At former airport site investigator monitor people expose high level noise track individual ambient environment become normal follow shutdown airport . At new airport site , opposite situation occur : Individuals live normal , quiet ambient condition become exposed loud aircraft noise . At site , control group form expose aircraft noise . The study piggyback onto German sponsor grant . NIH fund covered cost cardiovascular psycho-physiological data analysis . Measures include biochemical assay chronic neuroendocrine marker stress , rest blood pressure , reactivity blood pressure cognitive task . Perceptions community noise level also assess possible mediator stressful effect chronic exposure ambient , environmental noise . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
