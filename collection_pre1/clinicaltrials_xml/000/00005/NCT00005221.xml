	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Longitudinal design frequently encounter epidemiologic research , particularly cardiopulmonary field . Many different statistical model propose analysis longitudinal data statistical literature . These include general linear model , autoregressive model , random effect model , simple model base analysis slope time . Complex model widely use epidemiologic literature , due mainly lack understand underlie utility type question could answer complex model address use simple model . An additional problem lack software available fitting complex model . The study important public health implication , since longitudinal data continue accumulate rapidly guideline available appropriate method analysis specific research question . Furthermore , often model longitudinal data process pertain change understood . The original aim study perform comparative study statistical model datasets nine large epidemiological study cardiopulmonary field order develop tool identify appropriate class statistical model use analyze longitudinal data . The present study define new national norm pediatric blood pressure adjust available data set 60,000 pediatric blood pressure reading age , height gender among child normal body weight . It increasingly accept long-term correlation blood pressure childhood adulthood . Hence , significant monitor childhood blood pressure . The 90th 95th percentile blood pressure specific age , sex height group present Update 1987 Task Force Report Blood Pressure control child , arid widely distribute National High Blood Pressure Education Program . There recent update Task Force Report ( Pediatrics , 2004 ) use current height percentile base Center Disease Control Prevention ( 2000 ) growth chart extend percentile provide include 50th , 90th , 95th , 99th percentile . However , percentile base child include obese non-obese child . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The nine datasets use include : pulmonary data , Childhood Respiratory Disease Study , Netherlands data Vlagtwedde Vlaardingen , Boston Police Study , Fletcher Study data England ; cardiopulmonary data , Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study ; blood pressure data , Wales Study , Zinner/Kass Study , Lee/Zinner Study , East Boston Childhood Blood Pressure Study . For nine datasets follow model fit compare adult , child , adult child combine : autoregressive model serial-correlation state-dependence ; random-effects model ; regression model intraclass correlation structure ; general linear model ; model base fitting slope individual person . New method analyze longitudinal data develop included fitting higher-order autoregressive model unequally space data , nonparametric method , familial clustering effect analysis longitudinal pulmonary function data , robust method , empirical Bayes method estimation slope , hierarchial model base old new method . The study renew 1996 perform comparative study complex model datasets four large epidemiologic study cardiopulmonary field . The model compare regard goodness fit , ease implementation , interpretability . In addition , new statistical method develop model phenomenon seem poorly-fitted existing model , include adult longitudinal bp pulmonary function data . The overall goal develop tool identify appropriate class longitudinal statistical model . This important public health implication , since longitudinal data continue accumulate rapidly guideline exist appropriate method analysis . Furthermore , often model longitudinal data rather cross-sectional separate two time-point analysis underlie process pertain change understood . The study renew February 2000 extend enhance several technique analysis longitudinal data frequently encounter epidemiological study . The technique include : method control time-dependent confound epidemiological study ; develop incidence model benign breast disease use Nurses ' Health Study ; analysis incomplete longitudinal data Normative Aging Study ; extend penalize likelihood procedure quantile regression repeat measure set ; development method estimate correlate ROC curve measure predictive accuracy GEE regression model longitudinal data . The study renew 2005 define new national norm pediatric blood pressure adjust available data set 60,000 pediatric blood pressure reading age , height gender among child normal body weight . The study ( ) broaden percentile present display full range blood pressure percentiles first 99th percentile ( b ) evaluate percentile child normal body weight disentangle relationship hypertension obesity ( c ) provide algorithm use Microsoft Access computation blood pressure percentile Z-score user-friendly format ( ) provide percentile K4 K5 diastolic blood pressure ( Task Force Report include percentile K5 DBF ) ( e ) compare childhood blood pressure percentiles ethnic group . The study also develop screen rule detect high blood pressure child . Given existence new Task Force Norms quantify percentile value blood pressure child age , sex height , significant issue use norm effectively screen child high blood pressure , high blood pressure define average blood pressure &gt; 95 ' percentile give age , sex height base task force percentile large number visit . The goal develop efficient screen rule maximize accuracy few screen visit necessary per child . The screening rule assess simulation study test sample 16,000 Houston school child screen high blood pressure</detailed_description>
