	<brief_title>Arterial Endothelial Function -- An Epidemiologic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Many young adult subject degree atherosclerotic coronary carotid artery disease experience symptom . As time pass , many die suddenly unexpectedly limited therapeutic process begin youth , measure early manifestation atherosclerosis may potential identify subject risk premature coronary carotid occlusive vascular disease therapeutic option administer . Impaired brachial artery flow mediate dilatory ( FMD ) capacities show exist child young adult hypercholesterolemia , hyperhomocysteinemia , diabetes smoke . Impaired brachial artery FMD show related impaired endothelial function , early manifestation atherosclerotic process . If impaired brachial artery FMD predictor process , may use non-invasively assess atherosclerosis early development evaluate effect therapeutic intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In longitudinal study use previously study member Muscatine study , measurement make contemporaneous risk factor , brachial artery FMD , along coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) carotid artery intimal-medial thickness ( IMT ) ( latter two establish measure early atherosclerosis ) three year later . The effort design examine follow hypothesis : 1 ) Established risk factor level measure childhood , adulthood across year form childhood adulthood predictive brachial artery flow mediate dilatory ( FMD ) capacity ; 2 ) Putative risk factor level measure adulthood related degree brachial artery FMD , CAC carotid artery IMT ; 3 ) Brachial artery FMD , CAC carotid artery IMTare related adult ; 4 ) Brachial artery FMD predictive increase carotid artery IMT .</detailed_description>
