	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness leptin replacement therapy treat lipoatrophy lipodystrophy-a condition total partial loss fat cell . Patients lipodystrophy lack sufficient leptin , hormone produce fat cell . The leptin deficiency usually cause high blood lipid ( fat ) level insulin resistance may lead diabetes . Patients may hormone imbalance , fertility problem , uncontrolled appetite , liver disease due fat accumulation . Patients 15 year old lipodystrophy eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , fast blood test . Those enrolled undergo follow additional procedure : - Ultrasound liver , abnormality find , possibly liver biopsy - Resting metabolic rate measurement - measure amount oxygen breathe rest order calculate many calorie require maintain rest body function - Magnetic resonance image liver organ , muscle fat - Estimation body fat - measurement height , weight , hip size , skin fold arm abdomen estimate body fat content - Insulin tolerance test - measure blood glucose level administration insulin . Insulin give intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( thin tube place vein ) blood drawn 5 minute test begin , test begin , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 30 minute test - Oral glucose tolerance test - measure blood glucose insulin level drink glucose ( sugar ) solution . Blood sample draw IV catheter 15 minute test begin , time test begin , 30 , 60 , 90 180 minute test - Intravenous glucose tolerance test - measure tissue response insulin glucose glucose inject vein . The glucose injection follow short infusion insulin blood sample take 3 hour measure insulin glucose level - Appetite level food intake - measure hunger level caloric intake . Patients question hunger level , give variety food may choose eat question various interval hunger level . On another day , patient give breakfast ( usually milkshake ) want eat , appetite level caloric intake study repeat . - Hormone function test - function three hormone influence leptin ( corticotropin-releasing hormone , thyrotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) assess . The hormone inject intravenously blood sample draw . When test complete , leptin therapy begin . The drug inject skin twice day 4 month patient caregiver ( similar self-administered insulin injection diabetes ) . Blood drawn month monitor effect treatment drug side effect . At clinic visit schedule 1 , 2 4 month therapy start , patient physical examination meet dietitian . Medication dosage also increase visit . At end 4 month , baseline study describe repeat . Throughout study , patient complete form week , record symptom . Patients diabetes also measure blood glucose level home meal bedtime .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lipoatrophic diabetes syndrome characterized insulin resistance association paucity adipose tissue . Patients severe lipoatrophy die prematurely , typically complication diabetes liver disease . Experiments lipoatrophic mice suggest insulin resistance cause lack adipose tissue . Adipose tissue normally produce leptin , hormone increase insulin action . To extent leptin deficiency cause diabetes lipoatrophic patient ? In one mouse model lipoatrophy , leptin administration reverse diabetes liver disease . In different , severely adipose-deficient mouse , effect leptin treatment detectable , modest . In protocol , carry NIH University Texas Dallas , test hypothesis leptin safely administer patient lipoatrophic diabetes benefit treatment A-100 ( recombinant form human leptin provide Amgen ) . We study patient lipoatrophy , low leptin level , least one follow metabolic abnormality : severe insulin resistance , diabetes , and/or hypertriglyceridemia . We treat patient A-100 injection four month , inpatient study baseline , 1 , 2 , 4 month treatment . In core protocol , monitor metabolic control ( e.g . glucose , insulin , free fatty acid , triglyceride level ) . Ancillary study evaluate effect A-100 gonadal axis liver pathology . After 8 month treatment , offer withdrawal study patient require inpatient admission control diet . Afterwards leptin therapy resume long-term extension study follow visit every 6 month . Metabolic parameter continue follow , along body fat image study , gonadotropin monitoring , liver function analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All ethnic group Males female Age great 14 year Clinicallysignificant lipodystrophy , identify study physician physical examination absence fat outside range normal variation and/or identify disfigure factor patient . Circulating leptin level less 4.0 ng/ml female less 3.0 ng/ml male measure Linco assay least 2 occasion . Presence least one follow metabolic abnormality : Presence diabetes define 1997 ADA criterion : ) fast plasma glucose great equal 126 mg/dL , b ) 2 hour plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dL follow 75 gram oral glucose load , c ) diabetic symptom random plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dL . Fasting insulin great 30 micrograms/ml ; Fasting hypertriglyceridemia great 200 mg/dl . EXCLUSION General : Pregnant woman , woman reproductive year use effective method birth control , woman currently nurse lactate within 6 week complete nursing , person unable provide inform consent exclude study . Exclusions underlie disease likely increase side effect hinder objective data collection : Known liver disease due cause nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Current alcohol substance abuse Psychiatric disorder impede competence compliance Active tuberculosis Use anorexiogenic drug Other condition opinion clinical investigator would impede completion study Subjects know hypersensitivity E.
