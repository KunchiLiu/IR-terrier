	<brief_title>End-organ Pathology Childhood Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Elevated blood pressure establish important risk factor development cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality . The major manifestation end-organ pathology associate hypertension include congestive heart failure , ischemic heart disease , stroke , peripheral artery disease , include renal failure retinopathy . As blood pressure study child , become evident adult essential hypertension complication may origins adolescence childhood . Clinical observation show individual elevate blood pressure develop one form morbidity , others develop different form , still others develop complication . The reason unknown . Few study do attempt delineate risk factor development different end-organ pathology hypertensive individual . Two end-organ problem particularly amenable study child . Ultrasound examination heart allow non-invasive study leave ventricular hypertrophy important precursor development congestive heart failure . Retinal examination fundal photograph fluorescein angiography allow examination effect elevate blood pressure vessel eye . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The first phase study cross-sectional design . In phase , echocardiography use measure leave ventricular dimension , mass , volume function fundoscopic examination fluorescein angiography use determine retinal vascular abnormality . Data collect independent variable age , sex , race , obesity , level duration increase blood pressure , ambulatory variability blood pressure , family history hypertension , treatment antihypertensive medication , sodium intake , smoking , alcohol use , fast blood glucose , hemoglobin , basal plasma renin activity , plasma catecholamine , cardiovascular reaction mental stress exercise . Multiple regression analysis use determine independent variable independently associate leave ventricular mass , creatinine clearance , retinal vascular abnormality . The second phase study longitudinal investigation development leave ventricular hypertrophy , change leave ventricular function retinal vascular disease , temporal relationship complication risk factor find first phase , use cohort design . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
