	<brief_title>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis -- Pathogenesis Staging - SCOR Occupational Immunological Lung Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) disease unknown etiology characterize pathologically chronic inflammatory process ( alveolitis ) precede likely control alteration connective tissue matrix eventually destroy normal lung architecture . The mechanism involve process know . A complex cell-cell interactive sequence , involve principally neutrophil , lymphocyte , macrophage , fibroblast , epithelial cell believe responsible . The SCOR Occupational Immunological Lung Diseases first award December , 1981 . The subproject idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis first award December , 1986 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional comparison examine bronchoalveolar lavage , high resolution , thin-section computer tomography ( HRCT ) , neutrophil monocyte label scintigraphy ) . The serial , longitudinal evaluation monitor progression disease . The study PSS patient , without disease subclinical disease , particularly useful allow examination early event pathogenesis IPF . The long-term goal project determine alteration cellular composition , function trafficking occur lung parenchyma patient IPF relate alteration disease stage , prognosis , therapeutic responsiveness . The major objective study : ( 1 ) continue prospective , longitudinal study carefully define case IPF ; ( 2 ) initiate study patient PSS , disease provide useful paradigm study early event disease ; ( 3 ) determine role lymphocyte IPF , define subset T lymphocytes responsible modulate macrophage function ; ( 4 ) establish role non-invasive technique ( bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , HRCT scan scintigraphy -- neutrophil monocyte label cell ) assess activity inflammation carefully evaluate patient ; ( 5 ) determine relationship result -- carefully define serially obtain -- clinical , radiographical , physiological finding histopathologic abnormality ( patient underwent lung biopsy , predominantly IPF case ) . ( 6 ) perform study utilize blood , BAL fluid lung tissue effort understand pathogenic mechanism underlied inflammatory/immune cellular injury fibrosis characterize disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
