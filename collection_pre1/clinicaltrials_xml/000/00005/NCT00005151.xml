	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Pawtucket Heart Health Program arise concern need society could meet palliative treatment coronary heart disease . In 1977 , program design facilitate rehabilitation , hopefully , provide possible secondary preventive measure patient symptomatic coronary heart disease begin . Simultaneously , conviction grow national interest would serve careful research whether coronary heart disease preventable modification aspect individual group behavior influence major cardiovascular risk factor free living population . The Pawtucket Heart Health Program design foster community ownership active participation culture change process . A population-wide atherosclerosis risk factor reduction anticipate result apply independent variable base upon Social Learning Theory . Emphases individual factor , physical environmental factor , sociocultural influence behavior design produce persist risk factor change follow morbidity - mortality rate reduction population city . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Selection intervention community control community carry early design Pawtucket Heart Health Program . Census data , updated 1975 , use identify two community 40,000 100,000 people stability in-migration out-migration necessary long-term follow-up . The two community carefully match socio-demographic variable . Both community undergo baseline random-sample survey demonstrate similar level cardiovascular risk factor population city . Effective community intervention begin 1983 . Total intervention 7.5 year . Specific objective intervention include six percent reduction total cholesterol , 6 mm Hg reduction systolic blood pressure , 30 percent relative reduction active smoker , two percent reduction body weight body mass index , 2 ml/kg/minute increase estimate maximal oxygen uptake , 15 percent reduction fatal non-fatal cardiovascular disease event rate . Educational technique use program include : print , radio televise message ; small group behavior change program deliver trained lay volunteer ; community worksite-based blood pressure reduction , cholesterol multiple-risk factor screening , counsel referral event ; self-help program ; school curriculum ; smoke prevention program ; risk behavior change competition ; shelf-labeling grocery store menu-labeling restaurant indicate low sodium low fat food . The effectiveness program evaluate biennial random household risk factor survey , morbidity mortality surveillance system method . In risk factor survey , household randomly select . Within sample household , single respondent select eligible adult . A household interview test protocol administer home include question diet , exercise , smoking , behavior knowledge cardiovascular disease . Physiological measure include height , weight , blood pressure , total cholesterol , triglyceride , high-density-lipoprotein bound cholesterol serum cotinine . A subsample give step test estimate maximum oxygen uptake measure fitness . A second subset complete Willett diet questionnaire . There five cross-sectional household survey approximately 2,800 individual per survey . The initial cross-sectional survey convert cohort survey measurement 1986-1987 1988-1989 . The third cross-sectional survey also convert cohort survey simultaneous measurement 1987-1988 1989-1990 cross-sectional sample . Both community screen morbidity case-fatality rate coronary heart disease stroke . Morbidity mortality data obtain seven area hospital State Health Departments Rhode Island Massachusetts . Outcome criterion develop collaboratively Pawtucket Heart Health Program , Stanford Five-City Multifactor Risk Reduction Study , Minnesota Heart Health Program , maximize scientific value conclusion draw three study allow pool final data . Surveillance complete 1980 1983 continued 1993 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
