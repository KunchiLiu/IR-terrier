	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Pulmonary infection group commonly recognize life threaten disorder patient AIDS . Although Pneumocystis carinii predominant pulmonary pathogen find patient , organism clearly importance well , early year HIV epidemic patient AIDS ARC individual asymptomatic HIV infection . In mid-1980s , physician examine many AIDS patient impression shift occur type incidence pulmonary complication associate HIV infection . For example , appear increase incidence serious infection cause pyogenic bacteria pulmonary extrapulmonary infection M. tuberculosis note increased frequency . Furthermore , lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis ( LIP ) , diagnostic AIDS child 13 year old HIV antibody positive , diagnose increased frequency adult . Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis also appear rise . Legionella pneumonia , contrast increase incidence 1981-83 , seldom encounter . However , apart increase incidence tuberculosis , reportable disease , shifts incidence pulmonary complication verify . Because diagnostic strategy development new treatment regimens new approach clinical research dependent upon knowledge incidence natural history pulmonary complication associate HIV infection , collection information important . The Request Proposals initiative release January 1987 . Awards make September 1987 . The study fund jointly NHLBI NIAID . The study extend cooperative agreement mechanism FY 1993 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cohort consist 3 group : Group A HIV seropositive , symptom attributable HIV CD4+ Cells &gt; = 400 per microliter ; Group B HIV seropositive chemical manifestation HIV past 6 month CD4+ Cells &lt; 400 per microliter ; Group C HIV seronegative control . The pulmonary status individual category evaluate method chest radiography , pulmonary function test , nuclear medicine study , histological and/or microbiological evaluation . The prospective cohort study describe incidence course lung diseases stage HIV infection . Six clinical center different geographic area United States begin enrol participant 1988 , result cohort comprise 1,369 member . HIV seropositive participant randomize `` intensive '' ( pulmonary disease screen follow-up three-month interval ) `` routine '' ( six-month follow-up interval annual screen ) follow-up assess impact strategy patient outcomes . The contract-supported phase study jointly fund NHLBI NIAID . In 1992 , NHLBI decide extend follow-up another five year . The contractor apply research grant approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council May 1992 award October , 1992 . In renewal , particular attention give identify pattern complication among demographic subgroup extensively study , woman Blacks , define difference HIV transmission group . The study end May , 1997 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
