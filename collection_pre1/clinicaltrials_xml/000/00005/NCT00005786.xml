	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Lymphoma Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity profile arsenic trioxide patient relapse refractory low-grade lymphoma . II . To determine incidence complete partial response arsenic trioxide patient previously treat low-grade lymphoma . III . To evaluate basic science correlate arsenic trioxide activity order improve understanding mechanism action arsenic trioxide patient low-grade lymphoma . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 1-4 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day maximum 6 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients respond stable disease may receive 6 additional course . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
