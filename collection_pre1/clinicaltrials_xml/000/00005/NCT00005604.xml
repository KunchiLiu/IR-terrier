	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile MTD low-dose SC IL-2 administer conjunction BIW regimen IV rhIL-12 . II . To determine antitumor effect combination therapy IV rhIL-12 SC IL-2 . III . To determine impact low-dose SC IL-2 magnitude duration vivo immune activation induce BIW schedule IV rhIL-12 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) IV day 1 4 6 week . Beginning day 4 third week , patient receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously 1 hour 20 hour dose IL-12 . On subsequent course , IL-2 IL-12 administer day 1 4 week . Treatment continue 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease response may continue treatment complete response disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos IL-12 IL-2 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 3 week .</detailed_description>
