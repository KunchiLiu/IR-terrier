	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Phenobarbital Prophylaxis Neonatal Intracranial Hemorrhage Study clinical trial support National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke ( NINCDS ) , enrol 280 infant three Harvard Neonatal Intensive Care Units June 1981 April 1984 . Babies recruit study birth weight 1,750 gram less , demonstrable intraventricular hemorrhage cranial ultrasound require intubation within first twelve hour life . Data collect included maternal history , infant health status , event hospitalization . The Antenatal Risk Factors Intraventricular Hemorrhage Study , also fund NINCDS , compose 520 infant , less 1,500 gram birth weight bear two Harvard teach hospital July 1984 September 1986 . Babies enrol alive mother interview , usually 24-48 hour delivery . Procedures delivery room finding early examination record . Information first five day life collect daily . Bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic pulmonary disease prematurity substantial long-term problem survivor neonatal intensive care . This disorder see 15 35 percent survive infant whose birth weight less 1,500 gram . It estimate 5 percent neonatal intensive care unit admission develop affliction . Affected infant require prolonged neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) hospitalization . When study begin 1988 , infant BPD survive NICU discharge require home oxygen therapy month year . In addition , 50-69 percent chance re-hospitalization 11-36 percent probability death first year life . Although improvement age often see , pulmonary function abnormality persist late childhood beyond least 75 percent . Among associated morbid sequelae myocardial pulmonary vascular dysfunction , cor pulmonale , systemic hypertension , growth failure , neurodevelopmental abnormality . Pathologic study show structural pulmonary myocardial abnormality severely affect infant . Of advance field neonatology , one exciting experimental use exogenous surfactant . Neonatal clinician researcher look preparation specific therapy hyaline membrane disease indirect reduction neonatal mortality chronic pulmonary disease prematurity . Published clinical study exogenous surfactant supportive anticipate trend neonatal mortality morbidity . Up 1988 , however , surfactant therapy show appreciable impact acute respiratory disease neonatal mortality rate bronchopulmonary dysplasia . Unfortunately , publish trial report even surfactant-treated premature infant develop fatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design retrospective , case-control study . The population baby study Phenobarbital Study Antenatal Risk Factor Study identical therefore , combine analysis allow hypothesis generate one sample test . In review medical record , case choose base clinical criterion requirement supplemental oxygen 28 day . An additional requirement case status presence classical stage II , III , IV radiographic finding bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic pulmonary disease prematurity . Positive reading two independent pediatric radiologist require case assignment . Control infants fail meet case criterion . Hypothesis test proceeded univariate stratify analysis , finally , multivariate modeling . Candidates multivariate analysis include : antenatal factor maternal age , race , marital status , obstetric history pregnancy history ; perinatal factor birth weight , gestational age , degree illness ; neonatal factor respiratory condition , body fluid , miscellaneous laboratory data . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
