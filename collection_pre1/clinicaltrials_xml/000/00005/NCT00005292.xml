	<brief_title>Alpha1-antitrypsin Deficiency Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Severe congenital deficiency alpha1-antitrypsin associate early onset emphysema , usually third decade life . One approach correct deficiency though replacement alpha1-antitrypsin ( refer alpha1-proteinase ( A1Pi ) inhibitor purified form ) . An intravenous preparation A1Pi concentrate produce human plasma Cutter Biological , division Miles , Inc. , Berkeley , California . This preparation evaluate clinical study safety biochemical efficacy . Based augmentation level lung upon intravenous administration , A1Pi preparation license Food Drug Administration replacement therapy treat individual severe congenital deficiency impair lung function . When registry begin 1988 , clinical efficacy plausible , unproven data base estimate degree clinical benefit , . Slow progression emphysema lack adequate control group make difficult evaluate proteinase inhibitor control clinical trial . A patient registry alternative method collect data effect long-term replacement therapy A1Pi rate decline lung function . The registry also include individual receive replacement therapy order obtain good knowledge rate decline lung function associate congenital deficiency alpha1-antitrypsin . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The registry consist clinical coordinating center , 37 participate clinical center contribute patient data registry , steer committee , data analysis policy board , appoint National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute . Data collect patient include clinical history , laboratory evaluation chest x-ray , lung function study vital capacity , total lung capacity , force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) blood study . In addition , patient receive replacement therapy baseline lung function test , spirometry every six month follow initiation replacement therapy , measurement serum alpha1-antitrypsin level pre- post-infusion , every six month . The recruitment phase end September 1990 . Support registry end June , 1998 .</detailed_description>
