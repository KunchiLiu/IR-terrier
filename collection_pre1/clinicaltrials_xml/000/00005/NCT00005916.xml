	<brief_summary>This study test ability experimental vaccine increase number tumor-fighting immune cell ( lymphocyte ) patient localized prostate cancer prevent disease recur follow radiation therapy . The vaccine intend stimulate lymphocyte target attack cell contain protein call prostate specific antigen , PSA . It compose follow part : - rV-PSA : Vaccinia virus plus human DNA produce PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) - rV-B7.1 : Vaccinia virus plus human DNA produce B7.1 ( protein help guide immune cell target ) - rF-PSA : Fowlpox virus plus human DNA produce PSA - GM-CSF : Drug boost immune system . - IL-2 : Drug boost immune system . Patients 18 year age old prostate cancer confine prostate receive smallpox vaccine sometime past history allergy egg may eligible study . Candidates screen complete medical history physical examination , blood test , skin test ( similar allergy tuberculosis ) ass immune function . Participants randomly assign receive one follow three treatment : Group 1 - standard radiation therapy plus experimental vaccine ; Group 2 - standard radiation therapy without vaccine ; Group 3 - standard radiation therapy vaccine , different dose IL-2 Group 1 . Patients vaccine group receive injection arm thigh 28-day treatment cycle , follow : - GM-CSF : Days 1 4 first week - IL-2 5 : Group 1 , 5 day second week cycle ; Group 3 , 14 day begin second week cycle - rV-PSA rV-B7.1 : Day 2 first cycle - rF-PSA ( booster shot ) : Every 28 day , begin day 2 second cycle ( i.e. , day 30 , 58 , 86 , etc . ) Treatment continue eight cycle unless serious side effect develop , PSA level rise significantly , doctor feel reason continue therapy . All patient undergo radiation therapy possibly hormone therapy , indicate . Blood sample draw week first month every 4 week monitor safety . After treatment end , patient follow examination blood test every 3 month first 2 year every 6 month doctor determine follow-up longer need cancer return . All patient HLA tissue type begin study . Those type HLA-A2 ask additional procedure study immune response do tissue type . This involve collect blood sample treatment begin , every 4 week treatment , cycle 2 , 4 month eighth vaccine . They also undergo four leukapheresis procedure collect white blood cell . For leukapheresis , blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate unit blood . The blood flow machine separate component . The white cell remove , red cell , platelet plasma return body , either needle needle arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PSA-Based Vaccine Radiotherapy Treat Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial evaluate immunologic effect vaccination regimen HLA-A2 positive prostate cancer patient . Eligible patient localized prostate cancer willing undergo definitive local radiotherapy . 30 patient randomize 2:1 ratio two cohort ( see schema ) patient vaccine arm receiving vaccination , primary standard radiotherapy ( external beam alone combination brachytherapy ) . When enrollment two cohort complete , enrollment begin 19 ( 9-10 HLA-A2 positive ) patient third , non-randomized vaccine cohort . This cohort C differ first vaccine cohort IL-2 dose schedule . The vaccine regimen compose ( 1 ) recombinant vaccinia virus express Prostate Specific Antigen gene ( rV-PSA ) , admixed ( 2 ) recombinant vaccinia virus express B7.1 costimulatory molecule ( rV-B7.1 ) ; follow ( 3 ) sequential vaccination recombinant fowlpox virus contain PSA gene ( rF-PSA ) . All patient vaccine arm , addition , receive sargramostim aldesleukin part vaccination schedule . The primary endpoint identify immunologic response measure vitro analysis patient peripheral blood cell . The immune response cohorts A B analyze various time determine whether specific immune response affect vaccination well whether radiotherapy effect immune response . The serum PSA follow secondary endpoint . All patient PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma prostate evaluate eligibility include history prior vaccinia ( vaccine smallpox ) immunocompetence .</detailed_description>

Patients must receive prior vaccinia ( smallpox immunization ) . For patient le 30 year age , physician certification prior smallpox immunization require . For patient great equal age 30 , patient recollection appropriate vaccinationsite scar sufficient evidence . There must history allergy untoward reaction prior vaccination vaccinia virus . Absolute lymphocyte count great equal 600/mm ( 3 ) ; platelet great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) ; hemoglobin great equal 8.0 grams/dl . The initial urine analysis eligibility less equal grade 1 proteinuria , grade 0 hematuria abnormal sediment . Any positive protein , include trace value , evaluate 24hour urine less equal 1 gram per 24 hour . Any abnormality sediment presence hematuria evaluate nephrologist evidence underlie renal pathology . Patients may eligible underlie cause abnormality determine nonrenal .

Patients must understand sign inform consent explain neoplastic nature disease , procedures follow , experimental nature treatment , alternative treatment , potential risk toxicity , voluntary nature participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients evidence immunocompromised list : They reactive HIV test ; They diagnosis alter immune function , autoimmune disease ( autoimmune neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , hemolytic anemia ; systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren syndrome , scleroderma ; myasthenia gravis ; Goodpasture syndrome ; Addison 's disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , active Graves ' disease ) . They prior radiation therapy great 50 % nodal group ; They prior splenectomy ; They use glucocorticoid ( include glucocorticoid brachytherapy ) . The recombinant vaccinia vaccine administer follow apply either recipient , least two week vaccination , close household contact : Persons active history eczema eczematoid skin disorder ; acute , chronic exfoliative skin condition ( e.g. , atopic dermatitis , burn , impetigo , varicella zoster , severe acne open rash wound ) condition resolve ; Pregnant nursing woman ; Children 5 year age ; immunodeficient immunosuppressed person ( disease therapy ) , include HIV infection . Close household contact share housing close physical contact . Other serious intercurrent illness . Patients active infection require antibiotic treatment ( include chronic suppressive therapy ) eligible infection clear antibiotic stop least three day . History malignant process ( exclude squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin ) , unless previous tumor treat curative intent patient remission least three year . Patients history seizure , encephalitis , multiple sclerosis eligible . Patients know allergy egg eligible . Patients cardiac disease , pulmonary disease , autoimmune disease , renal disease hepatic dysfunction may exacerbate IL2 .</criteria>
