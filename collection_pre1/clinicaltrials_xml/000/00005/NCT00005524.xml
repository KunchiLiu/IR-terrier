	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The strong association mental stress morbid cardiovascular event coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient may derive stress-induced cardiac ischemia due exaggerate increase vascular resistance arterial pressure . In fact , may explain part prognostic relationship baroreflex cardiac vagal control cardiovascular outcome among CAD patient . The hemodynamic response psychological stress buffer arterial baroreflex ; thus , exaggerate pressor response mental stress may result impaired baroreflex regulation CAD patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study three component . The first component characterize relationship vascular stiffness baroreflex regulation among CAD patient , also contrast healthy control subject CAD patient . The second component examines , relation individual difference pharmacologically derive estimate baroreflex function , change autonomic baroreflex control laboratory psychological stress among CAD patient among healthy control subject . The third component test hypothesis impair baroreflex regulation CAD patient , due increase vascular stiffness and/or attenuate autonomic control , associate exacerbated hemodynamic reaction psychological stress . Bolus vasoactive drug infusion combination Finapres beat-by-beat arterial pressure carotid B-mode ultrasonography use evaluate baroreflex sensitivity arterial stiffness . Baroreflex adjustments psychological stress assess power spectral-derived relation arterial pressure cardiac chronotropy mental arithmetic task speech task . The degree index baroreflex function associate hemodynamic response psychological stress among CAD patient assess .</detailed_description>
