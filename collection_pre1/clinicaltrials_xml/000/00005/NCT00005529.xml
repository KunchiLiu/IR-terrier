	<brief_title>Self-Scored Cardiovascular Disease Risk Appraisal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Health risk appraisal ( HRA ) use increasingly health center worksites inform people personal mortality morbidity risk . However , recent research suggest many HRAs limit reliability validity respect coronary heart disease , lead cause death country . Self-scored HRAs appear considerably less accurate predicting CHD risk computerize instrument , chiefly people always know physiologic value require instrument frequently make error compute score . DESIGN NARRATIVE : During Phase I , new appraisal name CardioRisk develop . The Phase I prototype version contain eight major self-reported risk factor . CardioRisk predict risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) 12-year period use equation base recent accelerated failure time model Framingham Heart Study . The purpose Phase II thoroughly test refine prototype instrument . The Phase II analysis design assess psychometric property CardioRisk , evaluate utility judge patient , determine whether instrument change perception personal CVD risk . These result compare data appraisal determine whether CardioRisk outperform comparable product . In proposed commercial application , CardioRisk would distribute health promotion organization increase awareness risk factor cardiovascular disease . Estimates American Heart Association put demand product 180,000 HRAs per year . The potential market product include worksites , community health center , manage health care organization , public health department , clinic . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
