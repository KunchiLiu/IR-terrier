	<brief_title>SU5416 Irinotecan Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity SU5416 combination irinotecan patient advanced colorectal cancer . II . Determine time disease progression , objective response rate , survival time patient receive regimen MTD . III . Evaluate safety tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study SU5416 . Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 week 1-4 SU5416 IV 60 minute day 1 4 week 1-6 . Treatment continue every 6 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SU5416 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient accrue receive treatment SU5416 irinotecan recommend phase II dose . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
