	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Isocyanates account high number report case occupational asthma United States develop country . Prevention , however limited inadequate knowledge isocyanate route exposure , exposure pattern , mechanism sensitization causal factor . The Survey Painters Repairers Auto Bodies Yale ( SPRAY ) , five-year cross-sectional epidemiologic survey painters repairer autobodies Yale therefore initiate address question . At outset Spray , know frequent skin contact among painter might . Moreover , new excite data animal study demonstrate dermal rather respiratory contact may crucial immune sensitization lead asthma . Little known , far , dermal exposure autobody shop modifier , especially effectiveness personal protective equipment ( PPE ) prevent worker skin contamination isocyanate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study ancillary SPRAY study integrate . The overall design cross-sectional investigation 20 shop 120 worker . This would allow good understanding complex basis asthma risk worker , good recommendation autobody shops worker protective measure isocyanate dermal exposure . Specific aim include : 1 ) Qualitatively quantitatively assess surface skin contamination HDI ; 2 ) Identifying modifier affect surface skin contamination , specifically evaluate effectiveness personal protective equipment protect skin isocyanate contamination ; 3 ) Exploring relationship dermal exposure airborne exposure , biomarkers systemic absorption skin sensitization , asthma-developing risk . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
