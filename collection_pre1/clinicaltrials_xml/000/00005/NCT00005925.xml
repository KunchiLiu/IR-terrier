	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness infuse chemical call muscimol brain control seizures patient intractable epilepsy ( frequent seizure persist despite therapy ) . Muscimol , similar naturally occur brain chemical call GABA , show reduce seizure rat . After infusion study , patient undergo standard surgical procedure control seizure . Patients 18 year age old intractable epilepsy may eligible study . Before enter protocol 00-N-0158 , candidate screen protocol 01-N-0139 , Evaluation Treatment Patients Epilepsy , medical history , physical neurologic examination , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , electroencephalographic ( EEG ) monitoring magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head . Patients enrol study follow procedure : 1 . Computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head guide catheter/electrode placement ( see # 2 ) . 2 . Depth catheter/electrode placement presume location seizure focus ( part brain seizure originate ) - A small hole drill skull . A depth electrode hole center tube pass brain structure usually involve intractable epilepsy . MRI do check electrode placement . Video-EEG monitoring continue 5 day part study . Patients tested ability understand produce speech , see normally , move arm leg , distinguish sharp dull object , put pegs pegboard . They question headache , weakness , numbness sleepiness . The electrode leave place muscimol infusion ( see # 3 ) . 3 . Muscimol infusion - Into seizure focus , patient give two infusions-one saline ( salt water ) alone one muscimol dilute saline . Each infusion give period one-half 5 1/2 day , infused rate 0.1 ml ( 1/50th teaspoon ) per hour . During infusion video-EEG recording continue patient interview examined describe # 2 ) . 4 . Blood test - About 2 tablespoon blood draw daily test period first 2 day surgery ( see # 5 ) . 5 . Surgery - Temporal lobectomy topectomy ( removal small , specific area brain tissue ) standard surgical treatment medically intractable epilepsy whose seizure focus critical brain region , area control language , movement , sensation . If patient 's seizure arise one area , alternative procedure call multiple subpial transection offer . In procedure , vertical cut make seizure focus prevent neuron ( nerve cell transmit electrical impulse ) focus spread seizure rest brain . 6 . Surgery follow-up - Patients monitor surgical intensive care unit 24 48 hour NINDS nurse unit 4 8 day discharge home . Another visit NINDS outpatient clinic schedule 6-12 week surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective study test hypothesis direct infusion brain ( convection enhance delivery ) neurotransmitter receptor agonists 1 ) safe 2 ) use study basic pathophysiology epileptic focus human subject . The approach describe may new approach precise localization seizure focus . It may also prove indicate distribution suppression ( space ) require elimination seizure activity individual patient , , may accurately define minimum treatment area require success . Finally , data obtain may support treatment patient medically intractable epilepsy neurotransmitter-specific agent infuse directly epileptic focus . Study Population : The study population include adult patient medically intractable epilepsy candidate surgical resection epileptic region . Design : Adult patient candidate standard surgical care medically intractable epilepsy undergo standard noninvasive evaluation identify location seizure focus . After surface EEG confirm side approximate location seizure focus , depth electrode central lumen place seizure focus purpose research study . The lumen depth electrode use deliver vehicle ( artificial cerebrospinal fluid ) muscimol , neurotransmitter ( gamma-aminobutyric acid , GABA ) receptor agonist suppress neuronal activity . During infusion trial , patient monitor neurologic examination video-EEG . Following trial , epileptic focus resect , standard care medically intractable epilepsy , surgical specimen examine histological change cause infusion . Outcome Measures : Basic pathophysiology epileptic focus examine assess effect infusion seizure frequency ( primary end point ) , EEG recording , motor function , visual object naming . Safety assess neurologic examination pathologic examination ( gross microscopic ) resect surgical specimen ( presence absence infusion-induced injury ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : 1 . Be 18 year age old . 2 . Have simple complex partial seizure . 3 . Seizures must persist 2 per month , despite medical therapy . 4 . Be able give inform consent . 5 . Have determine NIH neurology staff medically intractable epilepsy . 6 . Have seizure focus single region one cerebral hemisphere . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates exclude : 1 . Are pregnant . 2 . Have contraindication MRI scanning . 3 . Have bleed disorder correct test treatment . 4 . Are unable comprehend risk test surgical therapy . 5 . Have seizure foci one region one hemisphere cerebral hemisphere . 6 . Have positive HIV test , patient would increase risk infection due immune deficiency .</criteria>
