	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The original study `` Calcium-Channel Blockers Primary Prevention Coronary Heart Disease '' conduct 1991 1995 design determine whether calcium-channel blocker reduce incidence myocardial infarction ( MI ) patient hypertension . Secondary aim include evaluation relative efficacy safety major drug class , include ACE inhibitor , beta-blockers , alpha blocker . The study originate answer question concern 1988 recommendation Joint National Committee Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure ( JNC V ) . The 1988 recommendation Joint National Committee revolutionize step-care approach treatment hypertension : calcium- channel blocker , new class agent , include first-line agent . That lower blood pressure clear . But randomize trial yet evaluate safety efficacy term clinical endpoint stroke coronary heart disease . Because result previous randomized trial suggest treatment hypertension reduce incidence coronary heart disease , study design answer question . In 1995 , study renew `` Antihypertensive Medications , MI Stroke '' design determine whether calcium-channel blocker increase risk stroke among hypertensive patient whether individual calcium-channel blocker represent three major subclass increase risk MI combine endpoint MI stroke patient hypertension . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study case-control design . Data collect Group Health Cooperative ( GHC ) computerize file use identify potential case : treat hypertensive patient , age 30 79 year , eligible case , accord WHO criterion , present incident , fatal non-fatal MI . A random sample member list GHC enrollment file serve source potential control . Review outpatient medical record ensure study subject meet entrance criterion . The effort also secure information blood pressure , duration hypertension , past medical history . A telephone interview provide information potential confounders , include smoking , diet , physical activity . The GHC computerize pharmacy record , database prescription fill enrollee , serve primary source information use calcium-channel blocker . Frequency match control potential confounding effect age year presentation , data analysis involve logistic regression . The study renew twice . The first renewal additional five year May , 2000 order identify estimate additional 1,007 stroke case , additional 1,020 MI case , additional 2,500 control . The second renewal August , 2005 determine antihypertensive drug/gene interaction cardiovascular event . The ongoing second renewal focus drug-gene interaction incidence non-fatal myocardial infarction stroke hypertensive patient , emphasize ( 1 ) alpha adducin polymorphism diuretic use ; ( 2 ) beta-2 adrenergic receptor-27 ( B2AR27 ) polymorphism beta-blockers ; ( 3 ) ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism ACE inhibitor use . The study also assess potential gene-drug interaction G-protein beta-3 subunit ( GB3 ) polymorphism , B2AR-16 polymorphism , amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel , angiotensinogen Met235Thr polymorphism . In addition , fatal case DNA extract surgical pathological specimen use assess genotype .</detailed_description>
