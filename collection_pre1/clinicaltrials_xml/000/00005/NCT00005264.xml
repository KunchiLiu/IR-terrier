	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Both pathologic precursor atherosclerosis development major risk factor -- blood pressure , blood lipid , cigarette smoking -- often far advanced age 20 within period birth conception adolescence . In 1990 , grow interest understanding aspect human biology devise appropriate preventive measure . In 1990 , knowledge risk factor childhood adolescence base mainly cross-sectional survey , strike consistent pattern change age infer , reference value screen management derive . Both growth sexual maturation influence pattern strongly , yet risk factor recently take account 1990 , partially screen recommendation blood pressure cholesterol . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects select simple random sampling . Data collect dependent variable include blood pressure , heart rate , echocardiography , Doppler flow , blood lipid , smoke . Independent variable include growth , diet nutrition , electrolytes , physical activity fitness , personal , family , social history , bone age . Most observation record four month interval . There six month pretest recruitment period , four year cycle measurement data collection , six month analysis report . Curves velocity acceleration growth attain level blood pressure , blood lipid , smoke determine longitudinal relationship individual growth curve blood pressure , echocardiographic measure , physical growth , sexual maturation , body composition , diet , physical activity , social factor . Dr. Labarthe several R03 grant analyze data Project Heartbeat . See also Study 4962 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
