	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know whether nitrocamptothecin effective chemotherapy cancer pancreas . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness nitrocamptothecin chemotherapy treat patient recurrent refractory cancer pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin Compared With Other Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Cancer Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall survival , objective response rate , time treatment failure , time progression patient recurrent refractory adenocarcinoma pancreas treat oral nitrocamptothecin v appropriate chemotherapy . II . Compare toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Karnofsky performance status ( 50-70 % v great 70 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : Arm I : Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease week 8 may receive additional course . Arm II : Patients stratify accord appropriate therapy possible ( mitomycin investigator 's choice ( include best supportive care ) v gemcitabine v fluorouracil ) . Patients previously receive fluorouracil gemcitabine without radiotherapy receive mitomycin investigator 's choice proven experimental chemotherapy regimen previously submit sponsor . Patients previously receive fluorouracil , chemotherapy , fluorouracil chemotherapy receive prove experimental regimen comprise gemcitabine . Patients previously receive gemcitabine chemotherapy receive proven experimental regimen comprise fluorouracil . Patients stable respond disease week 8 may receive additional course medically indicate . Patients drug indicate may receive best supportive care . At time disease progression , patient may receive treatment nitrocamptothecin . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 400 patient ( 200 per arm ) accrue study within 15 month .</detailed_description>
