	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular reactivity ( CVR ) change cardiovascular parameter response discrete environmental stimulus . A lead theory link behavior cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis hypertension propose exaggerated physiological response psychological challenge increase risk development disease . Such link establish conclusively 1988 . To considerable extent , might due fact numerous approach devise elicit measure CVR . Furthermore , single test combination test available would suitable administer large number individual differ age , gender , cultural ethnic background , socioeconomic status , would require definitive prospective study reactivity cardiovascular disease . A conference sponsor NHLBI University Pittsburgh 1984 comprehensively review concept reactivity , measurement , hypothesize relationship disease process . The value CVR provide estimation change cardiovascular function response challenge daily life , thus may serve good marker predictor cardiovascular disease risk usual 'casual ' measurement . Essential hypertension appear multi-factorially determined disorder , whose etiology encompass different element different individual . Physiological change induce excessive cardiovascular reactivity among mechanism suggest account transition borderline establish hypertension . In model , episodic cardiovascular activation elicit behavioral challenge lead autoregulatory adjustment culminate elevated blood pressure . An alternative interpretation elevate CVR elevate blood pressure reflection underlie nervous system pathology . Prospective study , use appropriate behavioral design standardize protocol ass cardiovascular reactivity could distinguish alternative . The possible role cardiovascular reactivity coronary heart disease support evidence basic clinical study . The hemodynamic force result turbulence shear stress curve bifurcation coronary artery cite responsible great degree atherosclerosis high heart rate , oppose low heart rate animal . Monkeys large elevation heart rate response psychological arousal develop significantly atherosclerosis . Although finding confirm human 1988 , substantial majority study report great reactivity Type A subject stress . Although evidence suggestive mechanism plausible , stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity investigate risk factor cardiovascular disease . In addition basic research determine parameter physiological determinant reactivity , clinical epidemiological study need establish whether association reliable . Especially needed prospective , longitudinal study association reactivity disease . The Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute recommend development study February 1987 . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council approve concept May 1987 . A Request Applications release August 1987 award make July 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Investigators University Miami evaluate cardiovascular hormonal function rest standardize manipulation design evoke autonomic nervous system arousal . Two hundred fifty-six subject enrol 2 ( male , female ) x 2 ( Black , white ) x 2 ( 25-44 year , 55-64 year ) x 2 ( Miami , Durham ) design . Subjects compare across broad range socioeconomic status . Each subject schedule three laboratory session . Sessions 1 2 two week apart . Session 3 six month later . During session , individual subject forehead cold pressor stimulus , video game , evaluative speech stressor . Noninvasive cardiovascular measure assess included heart rate , cardiac output , peripheral resistance , Heather Index , pre-ejection period , leave ventricular ejection period , diastolic , systolic , mean arterial blood pressure . On day laboratory session , subject wore ambulatory impedance electrocardiogram monitor work home . The following day subject wear ambulatory blood pressure monitor work home . Data analyze term stability baseline value , difference laboratory reactivity group , difference reactivity task , reliability response task across session , difference reactivity individual difference variable , generalizability reactivity laboratory cardiovascular function observe naturalistic setting . Improved procedure develop monitor impedance cardiographic electrocardiographic activity . Investigators University Pittsburgh develop battery test elicit differential vascular , cardiac inotropic chronotropic response . Each task base computer-driven video game permit standardized task presentation multiple response measurement . During initial prototyping year , item select maximize reliability , validity , applicability diverse demographic group . Circadian ambulatory study year establish optimal baseline reactivity assessment . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
