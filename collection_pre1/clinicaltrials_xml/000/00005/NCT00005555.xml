	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Results study provide important data regard dose exercise require improve cardiovascular health , describe NIH Consensus Conference Physical Activity CV Health recent Report Surgeon General . The study initiated response Program Announcement release October 1994 Physical Activity Cardiopulmonary Health . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects randomize one five group 2x2 factorial design plus usual care control group ( n=100 5 group ) . Subjects trained moderate ( 45-55 percent ) high ( 65-75 percent maximum heart rate reserve ) intensity , frequency 3-4 5-7 days/week ( viz. , Group 1 , 65-75 percent 5-7 days/week ; Group 2 , 65-75 percent 3-4 days/week ; Group 3 , 45-55 percent 5-7 days/weekk ; Group 4 , 45-55 percent 3-4 days/week ; , Group 5 , usual care control ) . Controls receive advice physician increase physical activity . The subject Groups 1-4 participate exercise intervention use walk mode training total 24 month . A lifestyle model physical activity use , subject could accumulate exercise minute day 10-minute increment continuously ( total duration 30 minutes/day ) , train conduct convenient subject ( i.e . home , work combination thereof ) . Tests occur baseline ( 0 ) , 12 , 24 month intervention . The hypothesis Groups 1-4 would show significant reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure increase HDL-cholesterol compare usual care control group . A second hypothesis would significant main effect frequency intensity , high level produce great improvement major outcome variable compare low level dose . The study also plan determine minimal dose response exercise necessary elicit significant improvement cardiovascular behavioral health factor . Finally , project include examination effect age level initial test value outcome variable determine interaction affect result intervention . The study also include assessment effect specific dos exercise reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure increase HDL-cholesterol ( primary outcome ) , addition change level physical activity , aerobic fitness ( VO2 max ) , body composition ( percent fat waist-to-hip ratio ) , triglyceride , LDL-cholesterol ( secondary outcome ) . Psychological variable ( depression , anxiety , anger , perceive stress ) health-related quality life also evaluate , important issue adherence exercise examine respect effect dose exercise .</detailed_description>
