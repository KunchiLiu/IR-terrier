	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Hydration saline solution may protect kidney cell side effect chemotherapy . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness glufosfamide without hydration treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glufosfamide With Without Hydration Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine activity glufosfamide determine objective response patient non-small cell lung cancer . II . Determine response rate patient population treatment . III . Determine duration objective response patient treated drug . IV . Characterize toxicity drug patient . V. Assess impact hydration scheme toxicity profile ( renal function ) drug patient . VI . Assess pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open label , multicenter study . Patients randomize receive glufosfamide without hydration . Arm I : Patients receive glufosfamide IV 1 hour every 3 week . Arm II : Patients receive glufosfamide arm I . Patients hydrate excess physiological saline solution 4 hour 3 hour treatment glufosfamide . Treatment arm continue 2-6 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients objective complete response continue treatment maximum 2 course confirmation response . Patients follow every 6 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-32 patient ( 8-16 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
