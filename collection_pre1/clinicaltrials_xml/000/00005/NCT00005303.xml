	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1986 , despite program person know risk factor exposure AIDS virus exclude blood donate population universal test donated whole blood blood component antibody HIV , public fearful acquire AIDS via transfusion medium story increase fear . A major concern among member blood bank community extent donor infect HIV identify enzyme-linked immunoassay ( EIA ) system . Most expert believe self-deferral assay HIV antibody eliminate vast majority positive unit donate blood blood component . If unit contain HIV eliminate combined effect self-deferral antibody screening ( treatment factor VIII concentrate ) , recipient screen whole blood blood component factor VIII would become HIV virus antibody positive result transfusion . Alternately , HIV positive unit whole blood blood component factor VIII concentrate eliminate self-deferral antibody screening ( treatment factor VIII concentrate ) , unit transfuse , transfusion recipient would become HIV antibody positive viremic . The initiative part special Fiscal Year 1986 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute AIDS Plan . The concept review approved National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council February 1986 . The Request Proposals release May 1986 . Two contract award September 1986 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : University California San Francisco : A risk assessment make HIV infection prospective test seroconversion woman recipients anti-HIV negative blood transfusion University California San Francisco hospital . Blood specimen collect recipient pre-transfusion , two , four , six month post-transfusion . Patients select base female sex exclusion high risk behavior blood transfusion precede six month . Johns Hopkins University : The rate seroconversion determine cohort cardiac surgery patient receive multiple transfusion blood product screen HIV antibody . The study conduct Johns Hopkins Hospital , Texas Heart Institute , Methodist Hospital Houston .
