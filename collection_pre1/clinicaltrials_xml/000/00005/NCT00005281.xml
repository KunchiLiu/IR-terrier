	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This longitudinal study initiate 1975 stratified random sample child , age 5-9 year live East Boston area City Boston , select . Annual lung function test perform child family questionnaire administer respiratory illness history , smoke history , disability cardiac disease , age menarche female child demographic data type heating , type fuel cooking , type air purify device , area residence . A subset cohort repeat measure eucapneic hyperventilation cold air . The cohort also study helium-oxygen protocol . Analysis focus validation exist model , include autoregressive model , lung growth child adolescent decline growth adult . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The longitudinal study renew 1995 . The overall aim continue investigation evaluate risk factor heretofore determined important predictor chronic respiratory symptom , diagnosis asthma , alteration expect level lung function child adolescents new population young adult woman . Within exist population investigator already obtain repeat observation airway responsiveness measure morbidity group young adult age 35 . These data , however , limited total number hundred . They expand observation 883 woman age 17-22 specifically assess risk factor affect maximum attained level lung function . Data entire cohort collect cross-sectionally include standardized questionnaire respiratory symptom , disease , exposure . Pulmonary function , height , immediate medication history subsequently obtain entire cohort , along blood specimen analyze immediately WBC total eosinophil count store subsequent analysis lgE cytokine profile . To assess impact history asthma ( wheeze ) , subject report asthma use medication last month , one-third sample woman symptom medication use , equal number asymptomatic age smoking match woman spirometry repeat bronchodilator use . The result investigation provide insight risk factor affect maximum obtain level pulmonary function woman . Since level function critical determinant risk develop chronic obstructive lung disease , determination interaction factor cigarette smoke lead good strategy help woman stop smoking , would major step reduce morbidity mortality chronic respiratory disease . The study formerly support R01HL22528 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
