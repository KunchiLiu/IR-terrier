	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease Mortality The NAS-NRC Twin Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Methodologically , statistical method genetics epidemiology develop largely independently ; result , seem little communication two field . Some important hypothesis regard familial aggregation chronic disease related gene-environment interaction draw field . The method analysis use study deal simultaneously survival time nature outcome variable , multiple continuous environmental risk factor , correlation outcomes related individual . The study support Small Grants Program establish National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute January 1990 extend analyse research data generate clinical trial , population research , demonstration education study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Data available two epidemiologic questionnaire administer ten year apart use determine extent increase familial risk cardiovascular disease mortality among twin mediate similarity behavioral risk factor smoke , diet , weight change , physical activity , socioeconomic variable . The contribution genetic environmental factor twin similarity health behavior also examine . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
