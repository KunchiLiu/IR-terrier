	<brief_summary>To improve predictive validity Structured Interview assessment Type A behavior compare interviewer technique Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial ( MRFIT ) Western Collaborative Group Study ( WCGS ) . To assess whether interviewer difference predictiveness Type A behavior component coronary heart disease incidence MRFIT WCGS , ass whether interviewer difference disease predictiveness relate interviewer stylistics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Individuals Type A behavior characterize hard drive , competitive , time urgent ; ask question quick answer emphatic speech ; perceive striving compete prone hostility . This core behavior presume continuum intensity well-developed Type A 's upper end well-developed Type B 's low end . Epidemiological study show Type A 's high prevalence incidence various form coronary heart disease Type B 's . The Structured Interview method measure Type A behavior series question administer individual 's characteristic response situation relevant Type A behavior pattern , reaction delay report frequency anger . The Interview deliver challenging style design elicit Type A characteristic . In 1960 , WCGS recruit 3,154 employ men , age 39 59 , initially free coronary heart disease follow 8.5 year coronary heart disease incidence . In 1972 MRFIT begin recruit 12,866 men , age 35 57 , select elevation one risk factor , free coronary heart disease follow average seven year randomization risk factor modification group control group refer physician treatment . Both study use Structured Interview ass Type A behavior . In 1981 , Type A behavior officially regard independent risk factor coronary heart disease , base largely findings WCGS . However , MRFIT find Type A behavior relate coronary heart disease incidence . The manner conduct Structured Interview may affect predictive reliability Type A assessment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Interviewer speech characteristic WCGS MRFIT Structured Interview tape recording audit analyzed . Each speech characteristic score high reliability . Multiple logistic regression analysis use control standard risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
