	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effect HIV vaccine Remune viral load ( level HIV blood ) way immune system respond HIV . This study also try see effect vaccine different patient enter study viral load 50 copies/ml compare viral load 50 500 copies/ml . ( This study currently redesign purpose may revise . ) Treatment anti-HIV drug always keep HIV viral load undetectable ( low measure ) . This study originally add HIV vaccine call Remune treat patient . Remune think reduce viral load improve immune response . However , new information suggest Remune may effective first believe . The study change follow people already study let people enroll participate substudy . The substudy look effect another HIV vaccine , vCP1452 , immune response work combination Remune . Information safety vaccine HIV-positive patient gather .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Giving HIV Vaccine ( Remune ) HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Anti-HIV Drug Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show inactivated , gp120-depleted whole virus immunogen ( Remune ) boost immune response HIV . One response , lymphocyte proliferative response ( LPR ) p24 , correlate low viral load patient long-term non-progression disease . This study examine whether administer Remune vaccine may generate new immune response boost exist response keep level virus blood low long period time antiretroviral therapy alone . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00 : In recent study use Remune , comparison virologic failure time virologic failure Remune adjuvant placebo arm reveal difference 2 arm study . Results study suggest hypothesis A5057 ( recipient Remune would 50 percent number virologic relapse occur control arm ) longer plausible current design . This protocol redesign . ] A substudy add HIV canarypox vaccine ( vCP1452 ) patient parent study evaluate whether canarypox vaccine augment immune response Remune . Patients add either Remune ( Arm A ) , placebo Incomplete Freund 's Adjuvant ( Arm B ) , antiretroviral therapy . They stratify 1 follow 4 group : 1 . Patients suppress 3 antiretroviral drug 15 month longer , HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml , may substitute 1 antiretroviral medication time . 2 . Patients suppress 3 antiretroviral drug , take antiretroviral medication 15 month longer , HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml , may substitute 1 antiretroviral medication time . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00 : This stratum include patient take current antiretroviral therapy le 15 month prior screen viral load measurement . If patient change prior antiretroviral regimen ( ) 15 month prior screen , must change least 2 antiretroviral drug time . ] 3 . Patients suppress 3 antiretroviral drug whose HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml high . 4 . Patients suppress 2 antiretroviral drug . Injections either Remune IFA give Day 1 every 12 week 96 week . Patients remain clinic observation 30 minute follow first second injection . If patient 's HIV viral level rise certain level , patient his/her health care provider may decide change antiretroviral drug try low . Injections suspend low level achieve , resume regular 12-week schedule . If decision change therapy , viral load decrease 500 copies/ml within 3 4 month , injection may still receive long HIV RNA level 5,000 copies/ml . Blood sample collect prior every injection determine CD4/CD8 count viral load , assay viral presence peripheral blood mononuclear cell , store future study . Pregnancy test woman reproductive potential , physical exam , medical history do prior every immunization . An immunological substudy randomize 80 eligible volunteer study cohort additionally receive ALVAC vCP1452 placebo ( ALVAC ) equal probability . Arm A receive ALVAC vCP1452 ; Arm B administer placebo . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/00 : The study close accrual except patient enroll A5058s protocol redesign . Patients enrol Version 1.0 continue follow every 12 week ( plus minus 14 day ) end study . Patients continue take potent antiretroviral treatment take study entry reach primary endpoint first virologic relapse . ]</detailed_description>
