	<brief_title>Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1987 idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy disorder unknown cause directly affect one cardiac ventricle diffuse multifactorial fashion , produce heart failure , least patient . Although viral etiology propose , dilate cardiomyopathy could associate numerous genetic non-genetic disease . However 1987 , role genetic factor know human . Although condition usually dismiss sporadic , numerous family multiple affect member observe . The role atrial natriuretic peptide level pathogenesis progression idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy beginning explored 1987 . Although Syrian hamster study suggest genetic deficiency primary cause dilate cardiomyopathy model , think possible ANP production level somehow involved myocardium respond idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Eligible patient interview ask whether first-degree relative willing participate . If family member participate , three generation pedigree construct first-degree relative contact . The relative interview medical history medical record institution review . Each family member brief cardiovascular examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram 2-dimensional , M-mode , Doppler echocardiogram . Blood drawn determination atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) level . The contribution variability age , sex , drug use , smoking , concomitant variability ANP echocardiographic data estimate . After remove source variability , strength similarity among family member assess . The relative contribution gene share environment similarity among family member estimate . Heterogeneity mean level echocardiographic index ANP level , familial aggregation etiology aggregation assess family familial idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy family non-familial idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
