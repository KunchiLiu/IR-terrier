	<brief_title>Nurses ' Health Study ( Cardiovascular Component )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Nurses ' Health Study begin 1976 , 121,700 female register nurse live eleven state complete mailed questionnaire include item medical history risk factor cancer . The National Cancer Institute fund first three year study subsequent year data pertain cancer . In 1980 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute begin fund cardiovascular portion study . Follow-up questionnaire administer every two year subsequently . The study formerly support R01HL24074 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In 1976 , 121,700 nurse age 30-55 complete returned initial Nurses Health Study questionnaire comprise Nurses Health Study cohort . The cohort follow mean biennial mailed questionnaire . A total 109,413 participant respond 1978 questionnaire . In addition , 400 woman reply 1976 state wish continue study 390 woman die . In 1980 , first major dietary assessment add questionnaire . In 1978-1980 interval , 624 death , 300 woman decline participation , approximately 99,000 complete full questionnaire include dietary questionnaire , another 4,000 complete abbreviated questionnaire , total 103,000 response . In 1982 , overall response 101,174 . The approximately 19,000 live non-respondents follow telephone , yield 71 percent non-respondents . Thus , end 1982 , current information available 116,150 95.4 percent original cohort . Deaths cohort usually report next-of-kin postal authority . At completion mail cycle , National Death Index search name non-respondents might die . By compare death ascertain independent source , study ascertain estimate 98.25 percent death . Death certificate obtain state vital statistic department confirm report death . For death certificate indicate possible cardiovascular disease , permission obtain information request family member . Confirmed coronary heart disease death require additional information beyond death certificate autopsy report , ECG enzyme change myocardial infarction prior death , classical chest pain immediately prior death , prior document myocardial infarction angina , prior cardiac catheterization show severe coronary disease . Data collect date birth , weight , cigarette smoking , menopausal status current interim use post-menopausal hormone . Data also collect incident case non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism , angina pectoris . These item appear questionnaire . In addition , nutritional parameter assess self-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire 1986 1990 . The study renew 1993 particular attention give dietary antioxidant , nutritional factor , physical activity , regional fat distribution , postmenopausal estrogen progestin replacement therapy , biochemical marker include plasma lipid apoproteins . Follow-up nonfatal CVD event 92 percent original 121,700 participant . Fatal CVD event document death certificate confirm classified review hospital record , autopsy report , interview next kin . Searches National Death Index nonrespondents ensure identification remain death , result mortality follow-up 98 percent complete . The study renew FY 2002 continue followup till March 2007 . A major aim compare predictive capability several biochemical genetic marker inflammation endothelial activation CHD versus stroke woman : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , E-selectin , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , endothelin-1 , polymorphisms CRP E-selectin gene . The study also continue investigation lifestyle determinant cardiovascular disease , include hormone replacement therapy ( dose , formulation , duration use ) alcohol consumption ( dose beverage type ) , full cohort interaction exposures biomarkers novel genetic marker ( prothrombin alcohol dehydrogenase-3 gene polymorphism ) .</detailed_description>
