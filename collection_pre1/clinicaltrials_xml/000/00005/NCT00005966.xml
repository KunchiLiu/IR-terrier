	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth cancer cell . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . It yet know interferon alfa-2b effective without thalidomide treat kidney cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness interferon alfa-2b without thalidomide treat patient previously untreated metastatic unresectable kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa-2b With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall progression-free survival 24 week patient previously untreated metastatic unresectable renal cell carcinoma treat interferon alfa-2b without thalidomide . - Compare safety 2 regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat 2 regimen . - Compare pharmacodynamic effect regimens pharmacodynamic measurement angiogenesis serum plasma angiogenic factor level patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior nephrectomy ( yes v ) , disease-free interval ( 1 year v 1 year ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily begin day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive interferon alfa-2b arm I oral thalidomide daily begin day 1 . Treatment arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment 24 week past CR . Quality life assess prior randomization every 4 week week 24 . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 346 patient ( 173 per arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
