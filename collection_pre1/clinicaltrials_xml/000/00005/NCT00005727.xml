	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Progress educate low literacy level CVD risk factor related nutrition hamper lack appropriate material program . It questionable whether traditional method education use literate , middle-income population generalizable low literate , lower-income population .

The study part NHLBI initiative `` CVD Nutrition Education Low Literacy Skills '' . The initiative originate within Prevention Demonstration Branch DECA , approve September 1988 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council , release July 1990 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The two cluster comprise small group multi-ethnic , low-income individual predominantly woman age 20-35 low-literacy level . The source group Expanded Food Nutrition Education Program ( EFNEP ) , program USDA Cooperative Extension Services University California . EFNEP provide basic , non-CVD specific nutrition information approximately 1000 low-income family Santa Clara County , California annually conjunction job training program specialty school low-literate individual .

The UC group receive eight one-hour classroom curriculum cover nutrition information basic food group , meal planning food purchasing , deliver primarily lecture print material . The Sl involve design innovative CVD nutrition program , compose distinct education module , use face-to-face , participatory education mediate material low-literate adult . Participants learn modify family menu , select prepare low cost food obtain USDA food stamp , receive specially adapt newly develop material rely little write communication sensitive cultural dietary belief . Summative evaluation involve test whether SI group great change CVD nutrition knowledge behavior ( measure self-report ) 24 hour diet recall , serum cholesterol ) baseline eight week post-test , five month maintenance period . The generalization phase research test revised version program non-classroom set Head Start family , intervene community level modify food selection preparation practice organization ( soup kitchens , food bank , homeless shelter ) provide food low-income/low-literate group . As conclude aspect study , feasibility explore disseminating nutrition program education modules local national group serve low-literate population .</detailed_description>
