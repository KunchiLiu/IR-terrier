	<brief_summary>This research study patient inoperable lung cancer call non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Currently , information radiological test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , use design best arrangement radiation beam kill tumor cell still spare normal part lung normal organ chest . The purpose study explore whether add information another radiological test , call positron emission tomography ( PET ) , improve accuracy radiation beam arrangement design treat lung cancer . A PET scan way picture biochemistry tissue organ : tissue body take glucose , normal nutrient body . The researcher attempt create radiation treatment plan PET image alone compare difference hypothetical plan standard-of-care CT-based radiation treatment plan . Because honest uncertainty contribution PET radiation treatment planning , possible difference CT-based treatment plan one result PET information . It also possible addition PET may result radiation beam arrangement may better control lung cancer . The addition PET may also result treat less normal tissue , may lower risk radiation side effect . This study provide preliminary data necessary design large clinical trial may define role PET radiation treatment planning .</brief_summary>
