	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Surgical myocardial revascularization ( CABG ) effective treatment triple vessel leave main coronary artery disease use thousand patient annually United States . CABG certainly prolong life , data demonstrate improves functional status majority patient . The intervention trial base upon outcome investigator ' first trial , show benefit maintain mean intra-bypass mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 65 mm Hg high MAP group vs. 52 mm Hg low MAP group . Intra-bypass MAPs correct interval le full flow 81 mm Hg high group 59 mm Hg low MAP group . Cardiac neurologic morbidity mortality 4.8 percent high MAP group versus 12.9 percent low MAP group ( p=.026 ) . All adverse outcome low high MAP group ( 16.1 percent ) low MAP group ( 27.4 percent ) . Data previous study also suggest outcome may improve maintain intra-bypass MAP close patient 's preoperative MAP . This consistent investigator previous work non-cardiac surgery , show maintain MAP within patient 's usual autoregulatory range associate low cardiac renal complication rate . This study determine whether refine approach hemodynamic management improve patient outcomes coronary revascularization . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The First Clinical Study During first three year grant support , August , 1991 November , 1995 , clinical research conduct comparison intraoperative high versus low mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) outcomes coronary artery bypass . In study , 248 patient undergoing primary , nonemergency coronary bypass randomize either low ( n = 124 ) high ( n = 124 ) mean arterial pressure cardiopulmonary bypass . The impact mean arterial pressure strategy follow outcome assess : mortality , cardiac morbidity , neurologic morbidity , cognitive deterioration , change quality life . All patient observe prospectively six month operation . Results describe Results Section . Second Clinical Study The second clinical study grant R01HL44719 , begin December , 1995 prospective trial 412 patient evaluated pre-operatively , monitor intra-operatively follow post-operatively accord standardize surveillance protocol . Patients randomize two form hemodynamic management cardiopulmonary bypass . In one group , intra-operative mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) bypass maintain 65 mm Hg ( 81 mm Hg full flow ) , thus employ effective strategy investigator ' first trial . In second group , intra-operative MAP maintain pre-operative MAP ( 90 mm Hg ) , strategy support data first trial . The principal outcome occurrence one following : mortality six month , major cardiopulmonary morbidity ( i.e. , myocardial infarction , pulmonary edema , cardiogenic shock low flow state ) , cognitive complication ( define summary definition include improvement decline neuropsychologic test memory , psychomotor/attention , linguistic function ) , major neurologic complication ( i.e. , new focal deficit , hemiplegia , aphasia , cortical blindness ) significant deterioration functional status six month postoperatively . The long term objective preserve improve quality life CABG . Although study describe clinical trial , Behavioral Medicine Study Section define clinical research , NIH-defined Phase III trial . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
