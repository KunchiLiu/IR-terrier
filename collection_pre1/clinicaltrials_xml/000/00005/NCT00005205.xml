	<brief_title>Incidence Diabetes Cardiovascular Disease Mexican Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The San Antonio Heart Study 1 population-based survey diabetes cardiovascular risk factor Mexican Americans non-Hispanic white conduct 1979 1982 . Participants include men non-pregnant woman age 24 64 , reside household randomly sample three socio-culturally distinct neighborhood San Antonio . The low-income barrio resident almost exclusively traditional Mexican-Americans . The middle-income neighborhood ethnically balance equal number Mexican Americans Anglos whereas upper income suburb approximately 90 percent Anglo . Risk factor measure included obesity , glucose intolerance , hypertriglyceridemia , low level high density lipoprotein cholesterol , blood pressure . The total number people examine medically 2,386 , divide follow : 1,288 Mexican Americans ; 929 Anglos ; 169 Hispanics Cubans . The San Antonio Heart Study 1 design test hypothesis Mexican Americans become progressively affluent accultured mainstream United States culture , would gradually lose diabetic pattern cardiovascular risk factor obesity , diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia . Mexican Americans second large minority group United States . Despite , recently 1977 , little known health status . In recent year situation begin change publication result several major study include San Antonio Heart Study , Starr County Study , recently Hispanic Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( HHANES ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1987 , participant prospective San Antonio Heart Study 1 recall close possible eighth anniversary baseline examination re-examined . Subjects fast lipid lipoprotein determination , glucose tolerance test diagnose incident case non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus accord National Diabetes Data Group criterion , blood pressure measurement , rest electrocardiogram , complete questionnaire elicit information possible cardiovascular endpoint . Medical record obtain document endpoint . Subjects history peripheral vascular disease diabetes ankle/arm blood pressure ratio determine exercise . Deaths ascertain course routine follow-up supplement search state health department National Death Index record . Death certificate request certificate indicate diabetes cardiovascular disease cause death , hospital physician record request review . Standardized criterion use validate cause death . Endpoints include diabetes , sudden cardiac death , non-fatal ( include silent ) myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , cerebrovascular peripheral vascular disease . The study renew 1992 continue follow-up . The study renew 1998 perform 15 24 year mortality follow-up cohort . Time dependencies ethnic mortality ratio examine well covariates biochemical parameter , hemodynamic variable , anthropometric variable socioeconomic status , health care access utilization migrant status . A sample 200 Mexican-American 200 non-Hispanic white death certificate verify medical record review . The purpose review determine whether Mexican Americans , deem die cardiovascular cause base medical record review , less likely cardiovascular code ( ICDA 390-459 ) list death certificate non-Hispanic white deem died cause . The review aid interpretation data relate possible ethnic difference cause-specific mortality base death certificate coding . The study help explain whether `` Hispanic paradox '' artifact underascertainment death group . The `` Hispanic paradox '' refers concept all-cause cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality widely think low Hispanics , include Mexican Americans , non-Hispanic white United States . Preliminary mortality data study suggest all-cause mortality actually high Mexican Americans non-Hispanic white San Antonio .</detailed_description>
