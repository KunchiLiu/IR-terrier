	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Overall study finding use estimate favorable impact blood pressure multiple improvement nutrition population . The investigator state aid make additional dietary recommendation toward goal primary prevention hypertension shift blood pressure distribution downward avoid excess risk associate present level generally optimal . DESIGN NARRATIVE : INTERMAP 's cross-sectional design pattern tested INTERSALT model : large sample size 4,680 person , half men half woman , age 40-59 17 population sample vary ethnicity , socioeconomic status ( SES ) dietary habit four country ( China , Japan , United Kingdom United States ) . There eight United States INTERMAP center . Specific aim involve elucidate influence blood pressure amount type protein , lipid , carbohydrate , also amino acid , calcium , magnesium , antioxidant , fiber , caffeine . Primary hypothesis test , control body mass index ( BMI ) , intake alcohol , age , sex , confounders follow : dietary protein inversely related blood pressure ; inverse relation education blood pressure significantly account education-related difference dietary protein intake ; direct relation blood pressure dietary saturate fatty acid , cholesterol , Keys score , starch ; inverse relation polyunsaturated fatty acid polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid . Randomly select participant provide one timed 24-hr . urine collection assessment sodium , potassium , creatine , urea , complete four 24-hr . dietary recall . Blood pressure measure eight time four clinic visit , standardization strict quality control procedure . The study coordinate two Coordinating Centers -- Northwestern University , Chicago London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine . Urinary determination make Central Laboratory Leuven , Belgium . Twenty-four hour dietary recall convert nutrient use Nutrition Data System University Minnesota 's Nutrition Coordinating Center . Data analyse test hypotheses do London Coordinating Center . Recruitment data collection begin July , 1996 January , 1997 . The main statistical analytic method multivariate regression analysis . The study renew FY 2000 FY 2004 continue analysis data August , 2009 .</detailed_description>
