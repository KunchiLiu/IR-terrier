	<brief_title>Coronary Heart Disease Incidence , Mortality , Risk Factor Relationships</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Many factor may contribute decline coronary heart disease include revise cod death certificate , behavioral modification risk factor , improvement emergency hospital care , use new medication surgery . The Rochester Heart Study contribute trend data cover time decline coronary heart disease mortality . At time , medical care resident Rochester Olmsted County almost exclusively provided Mayo Clinic Olmsted Medical Group . Under Rochester Epidemiology Program Project support program project grant National Institute General Medical Sciences National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases , medical record Olmsted Medical Group Community Hospital index retrieval system Mayo Clinic . Those outside source University Minnesota Hospital , Rochester State Hospital , Veterans Hospitals pertain occasional admission Olmsted County resident also add Mayo Clinic maintain diagnostic index . The resulting central diagnostic file give virtually complete case assignment diagnose case myocardial infarction , sudden unexpected death , angina pectoris , noncoronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The centralized case index Mayo Clinic Rochester Epidemiology Program Project use identify Rochester resident diagnosis 1950 1987 condition suggest coronary heart disease might present . Included diagnose coronary heart disease , myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , coronary insufficiency , arrhythmia . All relevant index code specify computer generate list provide unit record number candidate case . The medical history retrieve reviewed inclusion . The screened history assign nurse abstractor whose duty identify screening list patient satisfy diagnostic criterion protocol well incidence residence requirement . In case find coronary heart disease incidence , follow true : diagnosis angina pectoris , myocardial infarction sudden unexpected death must satisfy protocol 's diagnostic criterion ; diagnosis must first diagnosis ; patient , time first diagnosis , must free diagnosis congestive heart failure valvular heart disease ; patient must resident Rochester time diagnosis . If criterion meet , electrocardiogram read physician case verification . A precoded abstract history prepare incidence case . The abstract include : identification demographic data ; information smoking , hypertension , hypertension therapy , lipid , use estrogen ; diagnostic factor ECG , treatment test , angiography , select laboratory test result . The first myocardial infarction follow first coronary heart disease diagnosis cod ; first manifestation coronary heart disease myocardial infarction , second myocardial infarction cod provide basis determine reinfarction rate . In early study do 1950-1969 , little data treatment abstract . From 1970 1991t , drug surgery abstract . All death certificate Rochester Olmsted County resident period 1960-1979 recode 8th revision ICDA order obtain comparability study period . All death suspect due form coronary heart disease review group cardiologist use clinical classification death . The cardiologist use medical , hospital , autopsy record determine cause death . Follow 99 percent complete . Date last follow-up cause death record . The medical record Olmsted County resident age 30 come autopsy period 1950-1978 reviewed . Data abstract included date death , age death , sex , weight , heart weight , grade lesion coronary artery , evidence recent old myocardial infarction . All autopsy record 1980 1984 review coronary heart disease . Beginning 1986 , valvular heart disease data also collect period 1950 1987 . The effect Diagnostic Related Groups ( DRG ) incidence rate coronary valvular heart disease ascertain case hospitalize January 1 , 1984 . The Mayo Medical Center DRG system capture retained diagnosis hospitalize patient compare study medical index file . Incident case also follow specific diagnostic therapeutic procedure . This accomplished record review match list case patient number identification number patient underwent follow : radionuclide ejection fraction radionuclide exercise test begin 1980 ; arteriography , ventriculography , valve evaluation , thrombolytic infusion , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty balloon angioplasty , electrophysiologic test beginning 1976 ; coronary artery bypass surgery , myocardial resection , valve repair replacement begin 1978 ; coronary intensive care unit data begin 1976 . New procedure monitor come use . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
