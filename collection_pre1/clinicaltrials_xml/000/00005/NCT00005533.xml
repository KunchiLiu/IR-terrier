	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hostility , depression/depressive personality , socioeconomic status ( SES ) show influence risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . While three factor study separately previous work , evidence interrelate reason hypothesize would interact multiplicative fashion dramatically increase risk present combination . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Three study conduct design describe interrelationship hostility , depression/depressive personality , socioeconomic status document joint impact several health outcome . Study 1 take advantage two exist database study 3000 coronary artery disease patient follow decade . Both self-report behavioral indicator hostility depression study combination SES predict survival control initial disease severity . These measure also use analysis design discriminate psychosocial profile patient die early follow-up die five year . Data health behavior profile medical care utilization examine evaluate possibility factor could account relationship psychosocial characteristic survival . Study 2 examine ability depressive personality , hostility , SES jointly predict acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) mortality sample 730 initially healthy people follow 30 year . It also investigate association psychosocial measure change risk factor pattern health indicator follow-up period . Study 3 administer large battery measure community volunteer order document interrelationship hostility , depressive personality , SES detail . These measure also use predict magnitude duration cardiovascular reactivity mood induction task . The study renew FY 2000 continue data analysis . The study extend June , 2009 conduct four study address several question . All target significant clinical event coronary event mortality primary dependent variable . Two designed test aspect model mechanisms account connection stress health outcome . One notion tangible , social , psychological resource moderate stress reaction . This lead hypothesis good social relationship especially protective low SES . This tested large representative population sample ( Study One ) large sample military veteran . A corollary hypothesis interaction social support SES apparent high level job strain , also test population sample . Both physical health depressive symptom outcomes . Another resource effective coping strategy stress produce condition . One may tension reduction moderate alcohol consumption , proposition examine interaction moderate alcohol usage job strain sample . Alcohol consumption also hypothesize affect health pathway conceptual model . The investigator find psychosocial variable ( hostility depression ) associate pattern binge drink alcohol-related behavior problem , although effect may moderate SES . This could account association hostility , depression , health , proposition test sample veteran . The study concentrate task well illuminate health effect due particular component two complex psychosocial variable often treat global construct . One study cardiac patient rely extensive battery depressive symptom measure collect hospitalization predict subsequent cardiac event mortality . The study community volunteer assess comprehensive set hostility measure early 1990 's . These serve predictor subsequent cardiac event mortality . All study expansion past current work , build finding test new hypothesis , extend notion base previous finding prediction significant clinical outcome , improve conceptualization widely study psychosocial risk factor .</detailed_description>
