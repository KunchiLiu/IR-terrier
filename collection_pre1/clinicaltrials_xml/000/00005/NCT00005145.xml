	<brief_title>Minnesota Heart Survey - Risk Factor Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease mortality rate , especially myocardial infarction stroke , fall markedly past several decade race , sex , age group United States . Between 1966 1986 , combine death rate cardiovascular disease decline 42 percent . In 1986 , death rate coronary heart disease 55 percent 1966 , cerebrovascular disease 42 percent 1966 . The decline assume related several factor include improved medical care risk factor modification elevate blood lipid , cigarette smoking , hypertension . The Minnesota Heart Survey provide trend ( 1970-2002 ) coronary heart disease death out-of-hospital , hospitalization rate , case fatality survivorship myocardial infarction stroke metropolitan area . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Between 1979 1999 , R01HL23727 support mortality surveillance morbidity surveillance . Beginning FY 2000 , R01HL65755 support morbidity mortality surveillance R01HL23727 support risk factor survey . Mortality Surveillance : The mortality surveillance continuation surveillance study perform investigator since 1960 state Minnesota . Mortality data hypertension , stroke , coronary heart disease , cardiovascular renal disease monitor Twin City metropolitan area total population two million . Age , sex , area , location death cause-specific death rate follow . Trends cancer , diabetes , non-cardiovascular disease examine . Case fatality rate , include one- five-year survivorships determine related coronary heart disease mortality trend . Morbidity Surveillance : All discharge seven-county area hospital acute chronic myocardial heart disease stroke list among discharge diagnosis record use Professional Standards Review Organization data tape . A ten percent random sample record diagnosis validate yearly abstract data hospital record . Each year 's validation sample definite probable case myocardial infarction stroke form cohort follow mortality one year onset disease event . Individual hospital Professional Standards Review Organization area provide data total number coronary care unit admission coronary artery bypass operation year . Beginning August 1988 , registry establish new incident case coronary heart disease University Minnesota Hospital Ramsey County Hospital . In 1989 , twelve hospital part myocardial infarction registry . Risk Factor Surveillance : Population sample , age 25-74 year , recruit measure blood pressure , serum cholesterol , serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol , cigarette smoking , diet , physical activity , height , weight , health attitude beliefs , coronary prone behavior . Surveys complete 1980-1982 1984-1985 . The third survey conduct 1990-1992 included Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire bioimpedance measurement . A nested case-control study use 1980-1982 risk factor cohort examine baseline cardiovascular disease risk factor difference coronary heart disease case control . The study renew year 2000 R01HL23727 conduct population survey 4,000 adult , age 25 84 2000-2002 , detect current trend cardiovascular disease risk factor , include serum lipid , blood pressure , cigarette smoking prevalence , dietary fat intake , obesity , diabetes , physical inactivity , fibrinogen , serum vitamin E. Cohort ecological analysis use link secular trend risk factor morbidity mortality coronary heart disease , congestive heart failure , stroke . A total 1,000 child adolescent , age 8-17 , also survey use youth-specific measurement instrument appropriate .</detailed_description>
