	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Latino woman high risk cardiovascular ( CVD ) chronic disease , part , due sedentary lifestyle , obesity , poor fitness . Few study ass long-term physical activity , few observe maintenance none demonstrate effective procedure sustain exercise . Only one study demonstrate increased moderate exercise none demonstrate maintenance physical activity among Latino woman . Theoretically-based procedure ( shape , contingency management , relapse prevention , social reinforcement ) hypothesize necessary maintain physical activity yet test experimentally . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The 210 Latinas assign random one three group : one six month physical activity intervention , one physical activity plus maintenance intervention , one safety education control . Exercise train emphasize walking . Bilingual exercise leader , aid peer model community , use shaping procedure establish daily walk participant . In maintenance program , family incentive reinforce transfer community exercise use establish positive feedback loops promote activity within family . Peer lead community exercise session , community activism also use establish social network reinforce sustained physical activity . Program support fade naturally occur social support Community exercise establish . Four ( baseline , post-intervention , post-maintenance , follow-up ) , repeat measure 24 month assess fitness ( VO2max ) , physical activity ( PAR ) , CVD risk factor . Theoretically important mediating variable , self-efficacy , social support , stage change exercise , decisional balance , home exercise environment explore . Repeated measure analysis use determine significant difference among group , time group time main effect . This study first attempt engineer maintenance physical activity among minority woman . Results provide model use sustain physical activity reduce risk cardiovascular disease . If effective , analysis also serve model design program sustain physical activity increasingly sedentary general population . The study renew January 2000 continue December 2001 .</detailed_description>
