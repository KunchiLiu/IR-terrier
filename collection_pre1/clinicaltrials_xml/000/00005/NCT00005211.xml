	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Mortality Among Tunnel Bridge Workers Exposed To Carbon Monoxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A retrospective study NIOSH find significantly high death rate atherosclerotic heart disease New York City tunnel officer compare expect rate New York City population . A Cox proportional hazard model examine risk atherosclerotic heart disease tunnel officer compare bridge officer find similar pattern . The Cox model also show significant decline risk atherosclerotic heart disease among tunnel officer , compare less-exposed bridge officer , cessation exposure risk dissipate within little five year . Carbon monoxide may contribute cardiovascular disease several accept potential mechanism include bind hemoglobin , reduce oxygen dissociation tissue level shift oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve . Carbon monoxide experimental animal also increase platelet stickiness may contribute atherogenesis , accelerate atherosclerosis either alter lipid metabolism increase vessel permeability cholesterol . Carbon monoxide experimental study contribute sudden death reduce cardiac threshold ventricular fibrillation . Some mechanism , would lead transient hypoxia myocardium , would lead increase risk myocardial ischemia exposure current , mechanism , acceleration atherogenesis , may lead long stand elevation risk cardiovascular disease . The Occupational Safety Health Administration standard carbon monoxide 1987 allow exposure 50 part per million ( ppm ) time-weighted average 8-hour day ceiling level limit . The margin safety standard worker cardiovascular disease question series controversial study exposures average 50 ppm demonstrate decrease exercise necessary induce angina experimental subject underlie cardiovascular disease . NIOSH recommend standard carbon monoxide exposure 35 ppm 8-hour time-weighted average ceiling limit 200 ppm . DESIGN NARRATIVE : For study site , personnel record obtain include work history expose worker . For current worker , smoke history obtain questionnaire carboxyhemoglobin measure pre-shift post-shift . The feasibility obtain smoke history previously employ worker explore . Vital status ascertainment include use record Social Security Administration , driver license bureau , Internal Revenue Service , National Death Index . Death certificate obtain appropriate state vital statistic office . Statistical analysis perform use modified life table analysis system frequently use National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) similar study . In addition , industrial hygienist NIOSH visit study site measure current occupational exposure level gather information allow estimation past exposure level . Previous carbon monoxide monitoring data available tunnel . Based result cohort study , nest case-control study plan examine interaction smoke cardiovascular disease risk factor relationship cardiovascular disease occupational exposure carbon monoxide . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
