	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Both epidemiologic clinical research coronary heart disease increase awareness risk factor disease obesity , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia may partially determine genetic factor habit form infancy , childhood , adolescence . Studies date also suggest coronary heart disease risk factor change dramatically late teenage year differences characteristic sex race pronounce time . However , relatively little work do identify characteristic young adult life may precursors coincident increase risk factor prior middle age . While major increase certain risk factor occur young adulthood conjunction significant change life style , interrelationships among risk factor change rigorously investigate . Cross-sectional data , example , suggest weight gain pronounce late teen age 30 , particularly male , linear relationship exists weight lipoprotein fraction age . The reason consequence increase adiposity need investigation . The interaction life event , behavior , change physical activity dietary intake may influence weight gain lipoprotein level determine , well importance weight gain relationship risk factor change age span . Investigators examine consistency blood pressure level child determine whether `` track '' occur teenage year . The result study raise interesting important question . Is evidence `` tracking '' coronary risk factor ? Does `` track '' persist young adult life , time dramatic change life style often take place ? The study contribute understand development atherosclerosis help determine optimal strategy prevention individual life style pattern become well establish . The Working Group Heart Disease Epidemiology 1978 recommend study high priority . The study approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council November 1982 . The Request Proposals release December 1982 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : CARDIA , begin recruitment 1985 , complete 7 examination 20 year cohort 5,115 men woman age 18-30 year four community . Participants initially sample total population , select census tract , case one center , membership large health plan . The original cohort approximately equal representation black white , men woman , age 18-24 25-30 , high school education high school education . The baseline examination ( Year 0 ) conduct 14-month period 1985-86 . The examination consist questionnaire sociodemographic characteristic , health behavior , psychological factor ; exercise treadmill test ; rest electrocardiography ; diet history assessment ; anthropometry ; pulmonary function test ; rest blood pressure . Fasting blood measurement include total cholesterol subfractions , insulin , glucose , liver enzymes serum chemistry measurement , hematology . Six additional examination complete every 2-5 year , include Year 20 examination complete 2006 . Repeat measurement traditional risk factor , include plasma lipid , blood pressure , anthropometry , smoke behavior , physical activity , pulmonary function test ( except Years 7 15 ) use method examination assess age secular trend factor young adulthood . In selected year , additional measurement make , include treadmill exercise test baseline Year 7 ; diet history baseline , Year 7 , Year 20 ; cardiovascular reactivity measurement Year 2 ; echocardiography ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( subset ) Year 5 ; skin reflectance assessment experience discrimination psychosocial measure urine sodium creatinine Year 7 ; echocardiography ( subset ) Year 10 , glucose tolerance testing , microalbuminuria Year 10 Year 20 ; coronary CT scan Year 15 Year 20 ; carotid intima medium thickness Year 20 . Retention survive cohort 90 , 86 , 81 , 79 , 74 , 72 percent respective follow-up examination . Cohort member contact every six month obtain information vital status current residence . Every six-month contact also include speak participant ascertain information current smoking status , major illness injury , hospitalization . The Year 25 examination begin June , 2010 continue May , 2011 . There estimate 3,525 participant four field center participate five hour examination . The study end 2013 .</detailed_description>
