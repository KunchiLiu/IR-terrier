In addition , State Florida interest difference county age-adjusted stroke mortality rate -- northern county state experience mortality rate high high rate Stroke Belt state , whereas southern county exhibit rate closer national average , represent excellent opportunity comparative study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Stroke Belt Initiative two phase . In Phase I , pilot phase , State Health Departments locate Stroke Belt state assess high risk target audience ' need identify opportunity effective delivery medical and/or educational service reduce high rate stroke mortality experienced southeastern United States . This phase last three year , September 1990 August 1993 .
