	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation treatment patient certain disease retina ( layer light-sensitive tissue line inside eyeball ) . The protocol design test new treatment ; rather , patient receive current standard care specific condition . The purpose study twofold : 1 ) allow National Eye Institute physicians increase knowledge retinal eye disease identify possible new avenue research area ; 2 ) establish pool patient may eligible new study develop . ( Participants protocol require join new study ; decision voluntary . ) Patients diabetic retinopathy , age-related macular degeneration , vascular occlusive disease , central serous retinopathy another retinal disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination , thorough eye examination blood test . The eye examination include measurement eye pressure visual acuity ( ability see vision chart ) , examination pupil eye movement , dilation pupil examine lens retina . Patients also undergo fundus photography fluorescein angiography , follow : - Fundus photography - Special photograph inside eye help evaluate status retina evaluate change may occur future . From 2 20 picture may take , depend eye condition . The camera flash bright light eye picture . - Fluorescein angiography - Procedure evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . Participants follow least 3 year . Follow-up visit schedule accord standard care individual patient 's eye problem . It estimate patient one four follow-up visit year . Vision check visit , screen test describe may repeat follow progress disease evaluate response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 'Evaluation Treatment Protocol ' allow retinal specialist NEI identify , follow provide `` standard care '' treatment patient various retinal disease . A primary purpose protocol accumulate cohort patient retinal disease possible participation new clinical trial epidemiological protocol . Also , provide long-term follow-up treatment variety retinal disease , retinal specialist NEI well able identify research hypotheses diseases addition maintain clinical skill . The availability cohorts patient spectrum retinal disease valuable train retinal fellow , important mission NEI . The ability provide long-term follow-up care also facilitate referral effort new NEI protocol . The retinal specialist National Eye Institute free choose retinal disease interest . However , total number patient enrol protocol restrict . This protocol design test new treatment . Any evaluation treatment protocol base current standard care retinal disease . Participants patient evaluation treatment protocol evaluate potential eligibility new NEI clinical trial epidemiologic protocol develop . If eligible , patient may ask participate new protocol . However , require enter protocol decision participate entirely voluntary . No 150 patient accept `` Evaluation Treatment Protocol . ''</detailed_description>
