	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Longitudinal study coronary risk factor begin subject adult age show hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , obesity relate risk coronary artery disease stroke . The Framingham Study show , adult 30 year age , positive association risk cardiovascular disease low density lipoprotein cholesterol , elevate systolic blood pressure diabetes , negative association high density lipoprotein cholesterol . In 1971 Muscatine Heart Study initiate , preliminary evidence process begin childhood . It note child 's lipid , blood pressure , body size maintain degree rank order time , suggest high level likely become adult high level . Whether elevate level child accept adult coronary risk factor predictive future cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality remain important unanswered question . No data available directly link overt cardiovascular disease childhood measure risk factor . The Muscatine study follow child school age year middle age . This study , first time , directly relate multiple observation level profile change coronary risk factor childhood level risk factor measure age level establish predictive significance development premature atherosclerotic heart disease . The Muscatine Heart Study fund year Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Arteriosclerosis . The SCOR program initiate NHLBI expedite development application new knowledge essential improve diagnosis , treatment , prevention arteriosclerosis , ischemic heart disease , hypertension , pulmonary disease , thrombosis . The Muscatine Heart Study also fund R01HL35600 . Several substudies conduct use Muscatine study population . The subproject leave ventricular mass childhood design determine age/sex distribution leave ventricular mass child 5-14 year age whether elevated leave ventricular mass , demonstrate echocardiography , could relate high ambulatory blood pressure , exercise blood pressure work capacity , physical conditioning . The study also determine whether familial aggregation leave ventricular mass , whether associate high blood pressure parent whether left ventricular mass child associate increase cardiovascular cause mortality first second degree relative . Two subprojects conduct determinant blood pressure childhood . Both investigated factor relate blood pressure group child whose blood pressure pattern document period four 10 year . Five group child identify study : group persistently high pressure ; group rise blood pressure ; group decrease pressure ; group persistently low pressure ; group labile high blood pressure . The first subproject study cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , echocardiographic dimension , response exercise mental stress group child . The purpose study define whether significant difference blood pressure control rest , exercise mental stress group determine whether difference leave ventricular wall mass result group . The second subproject study blood pressure control mechanisms free-living sample five group consume usual , high low salt diet . Measurements make baroreflex control , structural component vascular resistance , response mental stress . The purpose study define whether salt sensitivity exist school child express blood pressure control mechanism . Studies also conduct apolipoproteins childhood determine role risk factor apolipoprotein A-I A-II gene polymorphisms association alteration high density lipoprotein level risk coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design cross-sectional longitudinal . Between 1971 1986 , 13,000 school age child 5 18 year age screen coronary risk factor . Measurements make serum cholesterol , serum triglyceride , blood pressure , height , weight , skinfold thickness . Beginning 1980 graduate Muscatine school participate earlier screen recruit age 23 , 28 , 33 , 38 year risk factor re-assessed . The old graduate 38 year age 1991 . The total number adult 5,126 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
