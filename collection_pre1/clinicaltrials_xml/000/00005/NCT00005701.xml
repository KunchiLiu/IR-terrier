	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acute cardiac ischemia ( ACI ) , include acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) unstable angina pectoris , lead cause death woman US . Despite grow interest ischemic ( coronary ) cardiac disease woman , little research focus woman common site ACI initial evaluation care : emergency department ( ED ) . Improving medical care quality outcomes ACI woman require understanding gender 's influence initial ED presentation , diagnosis , triage , treatment , outcomes.The detail prospectively-collected data number patient available project result large statistical power ( saving cost $ 1.8 million ACI-TIPI Trial data collection effort ) experience CCHSR decade related study factor influence triage , treatment , outcome ED patient ACI , provide project substantial promise new useful result . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The five study include . STUDY I : Were woman 's emergency department ( ED ) presentation ACI different men 's ?
