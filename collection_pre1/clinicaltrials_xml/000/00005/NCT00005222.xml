	<brief_title>Decline Cardiovascular Mortality : Framingham 1950-1984</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease mortality decline 30 percent last thirty year . Almost two-thirds decline occur 1970 1980 . Despite decreased mortality , cardiovascular disease still lead cause death . It also disease category associate rapidly rise health care cost . Secular trend lifestyle , self-care , improved access medical care , improvement diagnostic curative medicine implicate . An understanding mechanism contribute decline necessary order develop scientific basis palliative preventive care . Also , dramatic decline cardiovascular disease mortality raise issue quality life among survivor . The question raise whether people survive worsen health term increase incidence prevalence disease well increased level functional limitation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Five hypothesis test address issue secular trend lifestyle , self-care medical care may influence cardiovascular disease mortality . These : difference risk factor level among similarly-aged birth cohort influence mortality lessen severity disease improve recuperative capacity ; mortality among late birth cohort decline due less comorbid disease time disease event ; long-term case fatality decline progression disease slow evidence reduction disease recurrence ; medical intervention reduce mortality eliminate lethal sequela later birth cohort ; decrease mortality result medical innovation diagnosis therapy . Three hypothesis test address issue worsen health among survivor later birth cohort . These : although individual later birth cohort survive 13 year follow-up member similarly-aged birth cohort earlier period , high rate morbidity hospitalize often ; survivor later cohort exhibit disability functional limitation ; survivor later cohort institutionalize chronic care hospital skilled nursing facility . Data risk factor , co-morbidity , recurrent cardiovascular disease three birth cohort already computerize . Data medical intervention , improvement case management , use various technological innovation abstract medical record link data disease event . Data functional limitation available type extent disability Disability Analysis Health Data , study support Social Security Administration . This data file merge file disease event determine general difference functional health exist among three birth cohort intake , between-cohort difference exist among survivor . The study renew Shannon Award Fiscal 1991 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
