	<brief_title>Epidemiology Coronary Artery Calcification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) major cause mortality morbidity United States . Current noninvasive method identify individual atherosclerosis , exercise testing , often insensitive plaque progress enough significantly impede blood flow impair myocardial function . A large number individual destine die suddenly experience myocardial infarction experience warning symptom , mild non-flow limiting lesion rupture cause occlusive clot . Since coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) identify individual mild , non-flow limiting lesion , CAC potent marker atherosclerosis . The presence calcium mild , non-flow limiting lesion hypothesize predictor coronary event asymptomatic adult . Ultrafast Cardiac Computed Tomography ( Ultrafast CT ) provide tool obtain sensitive , noninvasive measure presence quantity CAC . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1991 , study seek establish age gender predict coronary artery calcification , potent marker atherosclerosis , individual sample RFHS report symptom coronary artery disease . The study also seek establish : measure lipid metabolism provide additional information predict CAC accounting variation age gender ; measure blood pressure , body size , fat distribution , smoke predict CAC accounting variation age , gender , measure lipid metabolism ; quantity CAC aggregate family ; whether predictor CAC asymptomatic individual differ predictor symptom coronary artery disease . Ultrafast Cardiac Computed Tomography ( Ultrafast CT ) use obtain sensitive , noninvasive measure presence quantity CAC . The study renew 2001 February 2005 : determine whether CAC predict clinical event 7.5 year active followup ; identify genetic determinant change CAC quantity ; ass whether gene act measurable coronary artery disease risk factor . The full sample 1,647 asymptomatic baseline adult follow prospectively clinical endpoint , CAC quantity re-evaluated sub sample 1,000 individual . The influence new inflammatory marker fibrinogen , C-reactive protein antibody infective agent evaluate .</detailed_description>
