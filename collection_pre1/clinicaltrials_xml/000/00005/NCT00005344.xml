	<brief_title>Mediators Social Support Coronary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Besides extend understanding mechanism social support effect health , finding project help design development effective efficient approach secondary prevention coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Social support assess large consecutive cohort coronary disease patient refer diagnostic catheterization ( Group A ) subgroup medically treat patient ( Group B ) severe coronary artery disease and/or poor leave ventricular function expect two year 'hard ' cardiac event rate ( death nonfatal myocardial infarction ) 25 percent . A brief baseline questionnaire assessment structural functional aspect social support well aspects quality life obtain coronary artery disease patient without prior revascularization refer Duke University Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory three year period ( Group A ) . Detailed questionnaire interview assessment perceive receive social support psychological trait , hostility , obtain high risk subgroup ( Group B ) randomly select 10 percent subgroup Group A patient . Potential behavioral mediator ( include smoke behavior , physical activity , medical care utilization ) biological mediator , ( include vagal tone , ambulatory ischemic burden ) social support effect outcomes measure Group B patient random subset Group A . Group A patient follow mailed questionnaire three month one year annually . Group B random subset Group A return one month clinic visit . At time , repeat social support interview administer patient send home 48 hour ambulatory ECG monitor allow measurement total ischemic burden heart rate variability ( vagal tone ) . Group B patient random subset Group A follow telephone interview one year annually . In addition , patient brief bimonthly telephone contact assess interval change social support well level environmental stress mood state include depression anger . All patient follow three year . Outcome event , include death myocardial infarction , ascertain point follow-up . Multivariable analysis use spline proportional hazard regression model test prognostic importance social support psychological measure outcome evaluate role biological behavioral variable mediator , control baseline disease severity . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
