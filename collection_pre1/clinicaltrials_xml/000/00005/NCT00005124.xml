	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1966 , National Academy Sciences-National Research Council ( NAS-NRC ) begin development twin registry . Through state birth record , group twin bear 1917-1927 ascertain match veteran record obtain roster 16,000 twin member pair military service . Veterans form basis registry Veterans Administration file provide access current address well potential mortality follow-up . From roster , group twin live within 200 mile examine center agree cooperate examine . This procedure yield set 514 pair twin member pair examine . At time initial examination , World War II veteran twin 42-56 year old . Since initial examination , twin follow NAS-NRC maintain current address mortality information . The World War II veteran cohort originally examine 1969-1973 period five examination center locate Framingham , Massachusetts ; Davis , San Francisco , Los Angeles , California ; Indianapolis , Indiana . The objective initial examination estimate heritability cardiovascular risk factor . Results first examination show significant heritability height , weight , relative weight , systolic diastolic blood pressure , glucose tolerance , uric acid , hematocrit , plasma triglyceride , force expiratory volume total plasma cholesterol lipoprotein cholesterol fraction .A second exam cohort complete 1981-1982 . Of original cohort 1028 subject , 792 77 percent reexamine approximately 5.5 % die . The objective second examination ass change cardiovascular risk factor ten year interval , assess disease experience cohort gather additional data new cardiovascular risk factor well pulmonary function measurement covariates . Examination two differ examination one great opportunity standardize data collection method , laboratory , equipment , time examination . Greater emphasis place pulmonary function test . One objective examination two achieved determination sufficient number cardiovascular event analyse concordance disease analyse disease occurrence relation risk factor . Analysis data 167 monozygotic pair twin 176 dizygotic pair twin show result similar first examination systolic diastolic blood pressure , unlike first examination , also show significant genetic variance total cholesterol LDL cholesterol . HDL cholesterol continue show genetic variance . The third examination original cohort conduct 1986-1987 . The primary objective third examination ass incidence cardiovascular pulmonary disease analyse relative risk factor data determine heritability cardiovascular disease exceed expect base know cardiovascular risk factor . Extensive pulmonary function test part examination three examination two provide longitudinal data analysis change pulmonary function relation genetic environmental factor . The exercise electrocardiogram expand entire cohort examination three provide additional data sub-clinical disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study longitudinal design consist three examination cohort period eighteen year . Data collect examination one 1969-1973 include : twin history questionnaire ; personal , family medical history ; diet history ; physical examination ; numerical data anthropometry , hematology , pulmonary function ; supplemental lab data ; X-ray ; clinical diagnostic impression ; electrocardiogram ; blood analysis-fasting lipid . Data collect examination two 1981-1982 include : personal family history ; decease twin information ; residence occupational history ; Thurstone Activity Scale ; leisure time physical activity ; social support ; medical history ; physical examination ; clinical diagnostic impression ; job mobility stress ; retirement information ; Jenkins Activity Survey ; blood lipid measurement . Data collect examination three 1986-1987 include data collect examination two plus assessment prevalence twin incidence subgroup twin preclinical cardiovascular disease detect noninvasive technique . The follow-up exam 1986-87 collected baseline data cognitive performance 622 individual , include 132 monozygotic 134 dizygotic twin pair . Beginning December , 1994 , research grant use conduct fourth exam survive subject cohort use rich resource available data determine relationship cardiovascular risk factor collect 23 year follow-up , change cognitive function since last exam , brain morphology assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Given mean age cohort ( 72 year ) 1995 , next several year represent critical time monitor age relate change brain morphology cognition . The addition fourth exam make NHLBI Twin Study long longitudinal study cardiovascular disease epidemiology twin subject ( 23 25 year follow-up ) first investigate contribution gene environment association CVD risk factor , cognitive performance , brain morphology . There five specific objective study . The first evaluate prospective cross-sectional relationship cardiovascular risk factor collect 23 year follow-up ( e.g. , blood pressure , lipid , obesity , smoke ) index brain morphology assess fourth exam . The second objective determine extent twin discordant essential hypertension non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) cardiovascular disease ( CHD ) show different MRI profile . The third characterize neuropsychological change performance Exam 3 Exam 4 determine contribution gene environment stability change . The fourth objective use data exam 1 3 investigate prospective relationship CVD risk factor decline cognitive performance Exam 3 Exam 4 . The fifth determine heritability new measurement obtain first time fourth examination cycle ( e.g. , MRI measure infarct area localization , white matter hyperintensities ( WMHI ) , ventricular volume ) . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
