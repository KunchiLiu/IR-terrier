	<brief_title>Hypertension Blacks West African Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The increase risk hypertension United States Blacks remain major unsolved public health problem . Comparisons macro-population group United States suffer confound social factor genetic admixture . The study 's international comparative design provide unique opportunity ascertain evolution hypertension among population common genetic background currently live widely vary social condition . A well-organized network investigator currently exist society Black diaspora provide first time opportunity conduct cross-national research question . DESIGN NARRATIVE : During first phase project 12,000 adult age 25 74 sample seven community : West Africa ( Nigeria , urban &amp; rural ; Cameroon , urban &amp; rural ) , West Indies ( St. Lucia , Barbados ) Maywood ( lllinois ) . The screen examination provide information blood pressure ( BP ) , height , weight , waist/hip ratio , alcohol use , education/occupation , sodium/potassium excretion social stress . These data provide estimate hypertension prevalence geographic region contribution know risk factor high rate among United States Blacks . In first phase considerable effort direct toward establish strong research infrastructure sit demonstrate feasibility cross-national blood pressure comparison . In second phase research continue extend three area : 1 ) Population study risk factor . At start study 1991 , clear adequate procedure available allow standardization mean blood pressure across site , especially since difference site might little 2 mmHg . Experience since time suggest would feasible collect definitive data question . In-depth study carry one African sit investigate early stage hypertension risk population . Investigators Jamaica United Kingdom join collaborative group examine effect migration Caribbean United Kingdom . 2 ) Prospective study blood pressure mortality . It well know hypertension account much excess mortality among United States Blacks . It less well recognize , however , death rate among Blacks United States high report Caribbean Africa . Hypertension likely account differential . A follow-up study region estimate relative attributable risk hypertension . 3 ) Heredity/Genetics . The population study shared common ancestral origin West Africa . Family study undertake determine heritability blood pressure/hypertension within site . In addition , pilot study genetic distance candidate gene hypertension conduct . The study renew FY 1999 examine detail role two potent hypertensive risk factor , namely dietary sodium obesity . Randomized study carry Nigeria , Jamaica , Chicago determine relative sodium sensitivity population factor condition blood pressure response . The renin-angiotensin system renal sodium handling compare causal mechanism . In addition , body composition study large sample three population determine role body fat versus lean body mass . Insulin leptin examine physical activity measure stable isotope assess role sedentary lifestyle contributor hypertension risk experience obese . Existing cohort follow determine hypertension sequela examine change blood pressure age .</detailed_description>
