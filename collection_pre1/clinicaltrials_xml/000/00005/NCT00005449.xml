	<brief_title>Social Support Myocardial Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A large quantity epidemiological data accumulate attest link social support progression cardiovascular disease cardiac patient . One way social support might exert health effect attenuate physiological response psychological stress , since response relate cardiovascular disease . Much myocardial ischemia occur daily life appear related period psychological stress , laboratory mental stress task find induce ischemia . Thus , incidence , severity , duration myocardial ischemia might modify change social environment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There two component study . In first component , investigator test hypothesis presence supportive spouse attenuate ischemic response psychological stress laboratory . Using counterbalanced crossover , repeat measure design , patient ask complete public speaking task laboratory two condition : spouse present ; alone . Hemodynamic , radionuclide angiographic , catecholamine response task assessed condition . In second component , investigator examine whether married patient show reduced duration ischemia compare unmarried patient . In addition , plan examine whether presence supportive ( spouse , friend case unmarried patient ) reduce incidence duration ischemia patient daily life activity . Patients ask keep detailed diary two week period ascertain pattern daily activity . Using diary consultation patient , investigator select two day period patient busy varied schedule . Patients ask follow pattern activity 48 hour period two consecutive week heart rate , incidence duration ischemia measure . During one week spouse , case marry patient , friend , case unmarried patient , present ; week patient repeat activity alone .</detailed_description>
