	<brief_title>Antecedents Hypertension : Role Race Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The theoretical rationale role environmental stress factor development essential hypertension outline several study . Briefly , individual increase risk essential hypertension likely non-risk cohort exhibit exaggerate cardiovascular reactivity environmental stressor . This may especially true Blacks compare white . Furthermore , individual risk develop essential hypertension subject frequent physical and/or sociopsychological stressor may experience frequent feeling anger hostility concomitant exaggerate cardiovascular reactivity . Blacks may experience many stressor frequently white . The exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity , turn , associate complex neuroendocrine change result pathophysiological alteration , eventually cause chronic elevate blood pressure . Although rationale receive empirical support animal human study , definitive evidence support etiologic role environmental stress factor still lack need test prospective manner . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cross-sectional longitudinal . An estimated 1,523 child , 7 14 year old baseline , whose family report essential hypertension , participate blood pressure screen follow medical verification family history hypertension . Children whose systolic blood pressure 5th 25th percentile 75th 95th percentile recruit . A sample child obtain relatively equal distribution race , age , gender , blood pressure grouping . Environmental stress factor evaluate include : psychophysiological response physical psychological stressor include physical exercise testing , video game , mental arithmetic test ; sociopsychological variable include anger hostility cop style ; sociostructural variable include socioeconomic status family stability . The environmental risk factor assess within context hypertension risk factor cholesterol level , sodium alcohol intake , tobacco usage , rest blood pressure , body weight . Each child parent follow annually . The study renew 1994 1998 continue follow-up additional four year . Follow-up continue adolescent young adult 13 20 year old 1998 . The purpose index early marker preclinical disease include rest blood pressure , leave ventricular mass , several new measure include plasma endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) endothelium dependent arterial dilation ( EDAD ) .</detailed_description>
