	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over last forty year , epidemiologic study make basic contribution knowledge etiology natural history chronic disease -- cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer . Findings epidemiologic study provide practical foundation development prevention control program improve life style control high blood pressure drug , indicate . These development impact life style risk factor probably contribute marked decline mortality rate coronary heart disease , stroke , cardiovascular disease , cause throughout 1970s 1980s . The four epidemiologic study foundation major contribution earlier 'first generation ' epidemiological study include Albany Civil Servant Study , Charleston Study , Framingham Heart Study , Tecumseh Study others . The significance study lie potential elucidate key 'second generation ' issue epidemiology major cardiovascular non-cardiovascular chronic disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Chicago Heart Association Detection Project Industry : Employees 85 firm great Chicago area screen Fall 1967 early 1973 . The total labor force among company 75,000 person . The volunteer rate screen 55 percent . All employee encourage participate irrespective job type shift work . At employment site data collect smoking habit , previous medical diagnosis , current treatment hypertension , heart disease diabetes , height weight , age , sex , race , heart rate . Peoples Gas Company : All data two cohort collect part periodic medical examination program employee Medical Department Company full-time staff physician . Data collect age , race , height , weight , blood pressure , serum cholesterol , smoke history , heart rate , rest ECG , medical family history , alcohol coffee tea consumption , education , military service , occupation , physical activity , diet , glucose serum uric acid level . Repeat exam schedule yearly men 50-59 , every two year men 40-49 , every four year men 25-39 . Western Electric Company : This longitudinal study coronary heart disease initiate 1957 Hawthorne Works Western Electric Company Chicago . The male subject free coronary heart disease baseline . The medical history physical examination model Framingham Heart Study . Data collect diet , physical activity , electrocardiogram , blood hemoglobin blood cholesterol level , body fatness , blood pressure , height , weight , lipoprotein lipase , glucose level , smoking . The study renew FY 1992 FY 1998 . The 1998 renewal use data analysis four cohort . It focus six specific aim : factor influence coronary heart disease-cardiovascular disease risk long-term young adult woman men ( age 18 39 baseline ) ; factor influence coronary heart disease-cardiovascular disease risk long-term African-American woman men ; factor influence coronary heart disease-cardiovascular disease risk earlier later follow-up ( first 15 year beyond 15 year follow-up ) ; impact baseline low risk status long-term risk mortality coronary heart disease , cardiovascular disease , non-cardiovascular disease , cause ; relationship habitual intake multiple food group 10 year change serum cholesterol , blood pressure , weight , 30-year risk death coronary heart disease , cardiovascular disease , cancer , cause ; difference risk factor impact group base sex , race , age , risk factor status . The study extend July 2005 use data analysis Chicago Heart Association Detection Project Industry cohort . The study focus three specific aim : factor influence coronary heart disease cardiovascular disease risk long-term young adult woman ( age 18-39 baseline ) ; factor influence coronary heart disease cardiovascular disease risk long-term young adult middle-aged African American men woman ; impact baseline `` low risk '' status long-term mortality coronary heart disease , cardiovascular disease , non-cardiovascular disease , cause young adult woman ( age 18-39 ) , include African-American white woman .</detailed_description>
