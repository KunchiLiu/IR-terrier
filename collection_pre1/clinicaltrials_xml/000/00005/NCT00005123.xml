	<brief_title>Honolulu Heart Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Honolulu Heart Program initiate verify report men Japanese ancestry living United States much high risk coronary heart disease low risk stroke Japanese men Japan . The Honolulu Heart Program actually component large NI-HON-SAN Study . The NI-HON-SAN Study ( acronyms Nippon , Honolulu , San Francisco ) initiate 1965 . The population investigation include member Honolulu Heart Program well men Japanese ancestry born 1900 1919 reside Japan San Francisco . In Honolulu Heart Program , 11,148 men identify 8,006 participated baseline examination 1965 1968 . The 1965 - 1968 examination include detailed medical social history specific inquiry smoking , alcohol consumption , diet , physical activity . A physical examination focus cardiovascular system ; laboratory test include hematocrit , serum cholesterol , triglyceride , uric acid , glucose determination , urinalysis . A twelve lead electrocardiogram lung function test reveal 301 men evidence coronary heart disease 111 stroke . The prevalence coronary heart disease slightly higher comparable population Japan , incidence rate first two-year period follow-up twice high Honolulu Japan . Stroke prevalence much high Japan Honolulu cohort , threefold difference . The Honolulu Japanese men obese , ate Westernized diet high amount animal protein , saturate fat , sucrose small amount complex carbohydrate . They high level serum cholesterol , triglyceride , uric acid , glucose Japanese men Japan . Cigarette smoke common Japanese cohort , proportion heavy smoker great Honolulu cohort . Alcohol consumption Japanese cohort twice Honolulu cohort . There difference mean blood pressure prevalence hypertension . Repeat examination perform near second sixth anniversary initial examination . The six year follow-up data identify 294 new case coronary heart disease 133 new case stroke . Between 1970 1972 2,800 cohort examine lipoprotein determination perform part NHLBI Lipoprotein Phenotyping Project . Survivors lipoprotein cohort reexamine 1975 1978 near tenth anniversary initial examination 1980 1982 . In 1985 , program enlarge make comparative analysis 12-year incidence coronary heart disease Japanese Hawaii study cohort original NI-HON-SAN Study , sample 400 offspring study cohort age 45 60 year complete nutrient indicator association blood pressure manner consistent United States-Japan study nutrition blood pressure . Resulting data compare comparable select group Japanese men parent offspring examine familial association . Pulmonary function data record analyzed association risk factor , respiratory disease , major chronic disease . Beginning March 1993 continue December 1994 , National Institute Aging , fund , investigate age dementia among Honolulu Heart Program participant . Beginning March 1997 , study support U01HL56274 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In prospective cohort study , hospital discharge roster general hospital Island Oahu review twice yearly part morbidity mortality surveillance . The appropriate chart material abstract review study physician evidence myocardial infarction stroke . Beginning 1986 , old new hospital discharge record review additional endpoint congestive heart failure , aortic aneurysm , bronchitis , emphysema , asthma , chronic obstructive lung disease , dementia , organic brain syndrome , Parkinson 's disease . Deaths monitor follow obituary column well review death certificate State Health Department . There daily contact hospital find impending autopsy study personnel could participate . However , 20-25 percent death protocol autopsy . The fifth final complete examination survive cohort conclude Spring , 1996 contract National Institute Aging . While emphasis exam investigation dementia , NHLBI fund record blood pressure ECGs well continue surveillance morbidity mortality . A cooperative agreement extend surveillance additional five year . As part close-out phase study , frozen blood sample collect since study 's inception send repository Rockville , MD . A review board screen prospective user resource hold quarterly meeting . As study group include migrant Japan Hawaii-born men , spectrum cultural lifestyle vary grade acculturation examine risk factor cardiovascular chronic disease . The exist baseline follow-up examination data surveillance information incidence major disease provide opportunity great variety research project concern predictor cardiovascular disease , well study broader concept health disease age population . The low out-migration rate well-defined source medical care provide ideal set maintain disease morbidity mortality surveillance ; nearly 100 per cent hospital discharge episode record . As study participant range age 75-95 1996 , rate coronary heart disease , stroke , chronic disease increase rapidly thus provide large number disease endpoint study . Other Institutes also currently support activity utilize original cohort . Stored serum provide opportunity test new idea etiologic hypothesis use prospective case-control study design . Protocol autopsy information utilized examine relationship among risk factor , clinical manifestation CHD , stroke pathological evidence atherosclerosis . Beginning 1997 , cooperative agreement extend surveillance additional five year February , 2002 . As part close-out study , frozen blood sample collect since study 's inception send repository Rockville , Maryland .</detailed_description>
