	<brief_summary>This research trial study discourse processing-that , brain process meaning language . It examine , example , word sentence interpret case one meaning possible . The study include two part : 1 . An investigation role prefrontal cortex brain discourse processing compare test performance patient prefrontal cortex damage healthy age-matched normal volunteer . 2 . An investigation role age discourse processing compare test performance young healthy subject ( 18 40 year old ) old healthy subject ( 41 80 year old ) . All study candidates-both normal volunteer patient brain damage-must least 18 year old , speak English native language , high school degree equivalent ( GED ) , read minimum fourth grade level right-handed . Study candidate central nervous system disease , dysfunction trauma routine history neurological examination . They also undergo neuropsychological test already do . Patients neurological damage magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan within six month year ask undergo procedure . Study participant take verbal write test ; sit front computer screen press computer key response show ; answer question examiner , may tape-recorded ; fill questionnaire . There rest break task . The study spread three four day , session last 30 minute three hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design acquire good understand underlying cognitive mechanism involve , role prefrontal cortex normal aging , various aspect discourse processing . For Phase 1 investigation , two investigation conduct : Study 1 compare performance patient prefrontal cortical damage age-matched healthy control ; Study 2 compare performance young healthy subject older healthy subject various aspect on-line discourse processing . The primary focus investigation cognitive mechanism suppression , allow selection appropriate meaning information ambiguous . A secondary focus cognitive process involve comprehend explicit implicit information story appreciate thematic aspect . In addition , interested learning individual comprehend visual ( pictorial ) versus propositional ( textual ) representation relational language concept ( e.g. , more/less , front/back ) . From cognitive neuroscience perspective , interest investigate role prefrontal cortex ( i.e. , prefrontal lateral orbitomedial area either hemisphere ) normal age process aspect discourse processing . We predict : ( 1 ) patient frontal lobe lesion difficulty suppress mental activation inappropriate meaning ambiguous text various point ongoing processing ; ( 2 ) age reduces efficiency suppress contextually inappropriate meaning ambiguous text ; ( 3 ) prefrontal cortex damage deleterious effect process implied information story appreciate thematic aspect , ( 4 ) prefrontal cortex damage impair visual rather propositional representation relational language concept . Phase 2 investigation design extend study aspect text process well expand study analysis discourse production . Our specific intent ( 1 ) investigate processing use context encounter garden path phenomenon text ; ( 2 ) understand nature breakdowns discourse production story tell/retell use sequential pictorial stimulus probe temporal sequence event , cohesive tie , cause/effect relationship , anaphoric reference , inference , gist ; ( 3 ) understand role prefrontal cortex play ability formulate coherent representation narrative text inferencing task . Our finding value contribute knowledge neural representation cognitive mechanism underlie various aspect discourse process ; advance clinical measurement pinpoint breakdown process occur real time , understanding effect normal age discourse process .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject age 1880 , fluent English speaker , premorbidly right hand , literate stimulus sentence write minimum 4th grade read level . In addition , subject minimum high school GED education , sufficient hearing acuity ( aid unaided ) auditory comprehension follow task instruction , adequate visual acuity ( aid unaided ) read least 14 pt . print computer screen , adequate dexterity press keyboard key response stimulus . Healthy subject history mental , cognitive neurological deficit , adequate hearing visual acuity ( correct uncorrected ) follow task instruction read least 14 pt . print computer screen , adequate dexterity press keyboard key response stimulus . As BD subject , healthy subject right hand , native English speaker , literate stimulus sentence . The MiniMental State Examination ( Folstein et al. , 1975 ) administer cognitive screen healthy subject , use cutoff score 27 ( total 30 ) inclusion protocol . For prefrontal BD subject , adult patient focal damage confine prefrontal lateral orbitomedial area either hemisphere include study . Cortical damage determine base neurological neuropsychological examination confirm MRI CT study . All patient stroke penetrate head injury test least 3 month postonset neurological damage ensure stable medical condition . All patient resect brain tumor complete radiation therapy regimen steroid medication . Dates course radiation therapy document . It emphasize BD subject include protocol selective deficit ( basis neuropsychological test finding screen determine candidacy ) able understand purpose study , instruction task , response demand . Patients understand purpose study , instruction response demand task would meet entry criterion . Only subject pas screen accept protocol . Healthy subject history mental , cognitive neurological deficit .</criteria>
