	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The diet-heart hypothesis , high dietary saturate fat cholesterol intake increase risk high polyunsaturated fat reduces risk coronary heart disease man support ecologic study , experiment rodent non-human primate , voluminous literature relate dietary factor serum lipid , several secondary prevention trial , Lipid Research Clinics Trial demonstrate reduction coronary heart disease among participant assign cholestyramine . Despite substantial scientific interest obvious public health implication diet heart disease issue , relatively observational cohort case-control investigation publish prior 1985 . Although observational study entirely consistent , take collectively , tend provide important general support diet-heart hypothesis . However , due study design , limited number endpoint , method analysis , many central question remain unanswered . The important issue quantitative relationship specific dietary factor risk coronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In prospective cohort study , participant complete mailed general medical health questionnaire baseline intensively validate semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire ( SFFQ ) . At one year , tissue specimen collect catalogued future nest case-control analysis coronary heart disease risk relation level calcium , selenium , chromium . Follow-up questionnaire update exposure information ascertain non-fatal endpoint mail two-year interval . All report case non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , cancer document hospital record and/or pathology report . Fatal event ascertain National Death Index document . To standardize SFFQ nutrient score measurement absolute intake , two one-week diet record obtain random sample 150 Boston-area participant . The study renew 1991 , 1997 , 2003 continue follow-up 51,529 male health professional . The cohort follow questionnaire mail two-year interval update exposure information ascertain nonfatal event . Complete dietary assessment include every four year .</detailed_description>
