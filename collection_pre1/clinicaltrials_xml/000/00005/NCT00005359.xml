	<brief_title>Genetics Asthma Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The development asthma require exposure incite agent allergens environmental pollutant , well presence host genetic factor . Understanding genetics bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) allergy delineate mechanisms important pathogenesis therapy asthma . While genetic environmental factor interaction felt important , precise role fully understood . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The probands 'asthma ' center Beatrixoord Haren , The Netherlands start 1962 . In collaboration Dr Dirkje Postma Holland , data available approximately 1200 patient first study 1963-1970 use protocol . Family study child grandchildren original probands underway . At time , 85 complete family characterize clinical data DNA available analysis Baltimore . Families ascertain investigator test fit genetic model segregation analysis . The major aim study identify major gene bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) asthma linkage highly polymorphic DNA marker . Since allergy commonly associate asthma , second goal study identify major gene atopy use similar linkage study . Allergic factor study include skin test reactivity common allergen , serum total specific IgE level , blood eosinophilia . Complex segregation analysis perform separately asthma , BHR allergy . The parsimonious model segregation analysis use linkage analysis . Initially , candidate region genome evaluate . Then , systematic search genome perform use highly polymorphic informative maker . When linkage detect , candidate gene specific area study . The study renew FY 1999 FY 2004 : characterize asthma closely related phenotype ; perform genetic modeling ( complex segregation analysis ) use one two locus model well bivariate segregation analysis ; complete genome wide screen ; fine map region interest identify candidate gene , perform linkage disequilibrium haplotype sharing analysis ; perform case control analysis susceptibility severity candidate gene asthma .</detailed_description>
