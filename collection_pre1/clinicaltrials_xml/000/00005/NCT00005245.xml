	<brief_title>Community Structure Cardiovascular Mortality Trends</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Socioeconomic structure refers aspects community -- industry , physical resource , occupational income distribution -- create condition change health-related exposure , behavior , availability quality medical care . Preliminary study suggest grow inequality ischemic heart disease mortality community different level socioeconomic structure probably reflect difference time onset decline rate decline mortality . Despite begin national decline ischemic heart disease mortality white men middle 1960 's , community begin decline year later , time national decline accelerate . Late decline community likely nonmetropolitan South . Further analyse show onset decline strongly related measure socioeconomic structure , income-related characteristic could account much previously observe metropolitan differential . Another study show decline ischemic heart disease white men woman great county group occupational structure characterize high level white collar employment . The trend toward great relative geographic inequality mortality appear strong ischemic heart disease stroke , cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . Prevention strategy take account process achieve equitable distribution health target population great excess risk available reduction . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Several analysis conduct use mortality data National Center Health Statistics population socioeconomic data Census Bureau . The onset decline ischemic heart disease white woman Black men analyze relation geographic region , metropolitan status , socioeconomic structure . The association onset decline ischemic heart disease rate decline study . The relationship occupational structure aspect socioeconomic structure rate decline ischemic heart disease mortality Blacks white quantified age . Geographic variation level trend stroke mortality describe relation socioeconomic structure . The association socioeconomic structure , cardiovascular disease risk factor , blood pressure treatment , mortality quantify geographic area sample National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . Socioeconomic structure-mortality trend association ischemic heart disease stroke compare association cardiovascular disease , all-cause non-specific cause . A detailed analysis make socioeconomic structure-mortality association United States South special attention impact Black/white mortality differential .</detailed_description>
