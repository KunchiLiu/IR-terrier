	<brief_title>Mechanisms Underlying Psychosocial Associations With Ischemic Heart Disease ( Kuopio )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Considerable interest controversy exist concern role psychosocial factor pathogenesis ischemic heart disease . Studies prevalence , incidence , mortality ischemic heart disease implicate socioeconomic status , job strain , Type A behavior , hostility , social support , variable . The study use baseline data previously collect part Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study conduct eastern Finland Research Institute Public Health Research Institute Exercise Medicine , Kuopio , Finnish National Public Health Institute Helsinki . The area eastern Finland lie within area great morbidity mortality ischemic heart disease Finland , part reference area evaluation North Karelia Project , part World Health Organization MONICA project . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study longitudinal design . Physical examination conduct baseline information collect behavioral risk factor , medical history , medication . Evaluations include maximal exercise tolerance test , four day supervise food recording , broad set hematological chemical test fast venous blood two 24-hour urine sample . Holter monitor ultrasonography carotid artery perform Cohort II . Psychosocial measure include social support network participation , socioeconomic status , job strain , Type A behavior pattern , John Henryism . All member Cohort II re-examined three year post-baseline . Cohort I member re-examined undergo Holter monitoring ultrasonography . Prevalence ischemic heart disease incidence analyse perform use cohort . Baseline psychosocial factor examine relation study endpoint include extent carotid atherosclerosis , presence ischemia exercise , presence arrhythmia , tendency toward blood clotting , four year progression atherosclerosis , incidence fatal non-fatal ischemic heart disease . The study renew 1997 . Data baseline examination , four-year re-examination , propose one-year re-examination ultrasonographically assess carotid femoral atherosclerosis , surveillance myocardial infarction outcome , use examine progression incidence outcomes relation change behavioral , psychosocial socioeconomic factor . It also possible see extent input behavioral , psychosocial socioeconomic factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) 1,600 men woman mediate lipid peroxidation , hemostatic factor , cardiovascular reactivity . Finally , investigator state first population-based epidemiologic study examine association carefully develop set measure cardiovascular reactivity stress progression carotid atherosclerosis , risk myocardial infarction death , development hypertension . The cohort previously male . Women add study renew FY 1997 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
