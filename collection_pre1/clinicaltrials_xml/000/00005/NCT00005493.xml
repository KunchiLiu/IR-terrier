	<brief_title>Observational Aspirin Use CVD Physicians ' Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The aspirin component trial terminate January 25 , 1988 , due demonstrate benefit aspirin myocardial infarction . At time , however , number stroke CV death experience trial participant inadequate definitively evaluate endpoint . The beta carotene component trial continue uninterrupted schedule termination December , 1996 . During period detail information continue collect post-trial aspirin use annual questionnaire . As October , 1995 , number death , include cardiovascular death , increase fourfold randomized period , number stroke increase 3.5 time . The investigator use data randomize aspirin period observational period follow trial assess impact aspirin use cardiovascular total mortality , long-term impact aspirin use subsequent stroke MI . The method include analysis randomize aspirin assignment time-varying aspirin use , assess annual questionnaire . Because potential bias , propensity aspirin use , particularly observational period take account . Analyses include use proportional hazard model allow time-varying effect aspirin use control time-varying confounders , well complex procedure use causal modeling . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
