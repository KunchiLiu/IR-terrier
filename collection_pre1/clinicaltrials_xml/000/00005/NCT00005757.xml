	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Each year , 40,000 new patient require treatment end stage renal disease , condition 4-fold high among African Americans Caucasians . Trials angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) Caucasians support role renin-angiotensin system pathogenesis glomerulosclerosis . Yet , despite high prevalence nephropathy among African Americans , Blacks under-represented study ACEIs . Data laboratory suggest renal effect ACEI may differ African Americans . African Americans resistant anti-hypertensive effect ACEI , thus , may resistant renoprotective effect well . The ACE deletion allele , variant associate increased ACE activity progression renal disease , increase frequency African Americans , frequency Ang AT1 receptor C allele , variant associate antihypertensive responsiveness ACEI decrease . Moreover , African Americans exhibit decreased sensitivity Ang I increase sensitivity bradykinin . Taken together , data suggest hypothesis ACE activity increase African Americans , lead decrease bradykinin level ( receptor sensitization ) increase tissue Ang II ( receptor desensitization ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study test hypothesis ACE activity increase African Americans , lead decrease bradykinin level ( receptor sensitization ) increase tissue Ang II ( receptor desensitization ) . The effect race , hypertension ACE insertion/deletion genotype ACE activity determine , measure pressor renal vasoconstrictor response Ang I Ang II vasodilator response bradykinin . Specific bradykinin angiotensin receptor antagonist use determine relative contribution increase bradykinin decrease angiotensin II renal hemodynamic effect ACEIs African Americans Caucasians .</detailed_description>
