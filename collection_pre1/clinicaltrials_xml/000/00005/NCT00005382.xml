	<brief_title>Sources Variability Peak Expiratory Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While PEF routinely apply diagnosis management asthma , scientist find new application PEF clinical epidemiologic tool follow individual pulmonary disease , study natural history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , evaluate impact environmental exposure lung function . Yet standardization PEF measurement lag behind application . The little attention pay performance characteristic PEF maneuver contrast sharply effort standardize measurement procedure FEV1 FVC . The American Thoracic Society devote great deal attention study measure publish guideline standardization measurement . These guideline include detailed protocol calibrate equipment , administer test , determine reproducibility , interpret result . The research provide data optimal number trial per test session , difference PEF perform full forced expiratory effort result short blast , impact test supervision test performance , reproducibility PEF measurement . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A baseline survey ventilatory function perform use spirometry . PEF measure daily mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter period several week study 201 normal ( staff , faculty graduate student University Massachusetts Lowell ) . Serial PEF data collect group mild asthmatic identify local occupational medicine clinic . Finally , performance characteristic examine serial PEF data two exist occupational cohort study . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
