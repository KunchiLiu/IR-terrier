	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Advances molecular genetics , genetic epidemiology , population genetics , identification new risk factor cluster risk factor cardiovascular disease make 1991 opportune time take advantage extensive information cardiovascular disease , pre-clinical atherosclerosis , risk factor individual examine ongoing , state-of-the-art epidemiological study support NHLBI . By recruit first degree relative random sample define population , FHS obtain information familial aggregation , genetic environmental contribution variance continuous variable , frequency distribution elevate level risk factor select major gene general population . The FHS initiated staff approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Commitee May , 1990 . The Requests Proposals release July 1991 . Contracts award June , 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : During Phases I II May 1992-May 1996 , probands , age 45-69 , recruit Framingham Heart Study , Utah Family Tree Study North Carolina Minnesota sit ARIC Study , along relative , participation Family Heart Study . Two group probands select , either randomly high family risk CHD calculate data parent study . Additional family structure disease history data collect 3,150 probands 22,909 relative . Clinical examination follow-up random high CHD risk family conduct total 1,253 family include 5,975 individual , 102 family include 265 individual African-American . The examination include information anthropometry , blood pressure , ECG , carotid ultrasound , pulmonary function , blood chemistry . Questionnaire data include medical reproductive history , diet , physical activity , tobacco alcohol consumption , education , income psychosocial factor include hostility , social support stress . Phases I II include four field center , coordinate center , central blood laboratory . In August 1996 , Phase III begin cooperative agreement award consortium seven investigator-initiated grant conduct molecular genetic genetic epidemiology study use data collect Phases I II . Phase III end July 2001 . The objective Phase III perform molecular genetic genetic epidemiology study use extensive data family medical history , risk factor , life style , blood specimen , bank DNA previously collect FHS . Studies include novel molecular genetics candidate gene genome-wide search anonymous marker detection , mapping , characterization coronary heart disease atherosclerosis gene . Genetic epidemiology analysis conduct contribute new information familial aspect atherosclerosis intermediate phenotype African Americans . Phase III also include four field center , central laboratory , molecular genetics laboratory , coordinate center . The study renew 2001 Family Heart Study - Subclinical Atherosclerosis Network ( FHS-SCAN ) complete analyse genome-wide scan data genotype promising marker . The study expect enroll 401 informative pedigree ( 3,027 individual ) previously examine genotyped NHLBI Family Heart Study quantify coronary aortic calcium volume order identify gene associate atherosclerosis . In addition , 315 African American sibships ( 770 individual ) previously examine comparably genotyped Hypertension Epidemiology Network ( HyperGEN ) examine one study center address study question minority population .</detailed_description>
