	<brief_summary>This study evaluate antibiotic gentamicin treat patient muscular dystrophy cause specific genetic abnormality know nonsense mutation . In study mice type muscular dystrophy , gentamicin treatment produce positive change muscle tissue . Patients Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy cause nonsense mutation may eligible 2-week study . Before start treatment , patient evaluation muscle strength general well . Two muscle tissue sample take needle biopsy , local anesthetic sedation . Because potential risk hear loss kidney toxicity associate gentamicin , patient also hear test blood urine test kidney function start treatment . ( Currently , gentamicin commonly prescribe serious infection lung , heart , digestive urinary tract ; adverse effect hear loss kidney toxicity occur excessively high drug dos . ) Patients hospitalized drug treatment . Gentamicin give intravenously ( vein ) day 14 day . Blood sample collect daily monitor drug level determine dosage adjustment , necessary . Urine sample collect assess kidney function . Hearing test do day 7 10 . On last day study , hear , kidney function , muscle strength test result compare pre-treatment level . Blood muscle sample also take pre-treatment comparison . Hearing , blood , urine , muscle strength test repeat one month treatment end comparison previous result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) fatal disease progressive muscular weakness currently effective treatment . The disease cause mutation gene dystrophin . A subset mutation include nonsense mutation , i.e. , premature stop codon . Previous study show aminoglycosides effective allow translation stop codon . Recently , gentamicin show restore functional dystrophin mouse model DMD . The objective protocol determine gentamicin also effective treatment patient DMD cause nonsense mutation . This preliminary , non-blinded study level intravenous gentamicin previously establish safe , administer identified patient meet inclusion criterion two-week period . These patient CLIA approve laboratory document stop codon mutation dystrophin gene . Quantitative dystrophin expression primary outcome . Strength measurement also assess immediately two-week treatment period . Follow-up evaluation make one month . For subset patient DMD anticipate transient increase dystrophin expression possible corresponding transient improvement strength . Subsequent blind study evaluate effective dose dose interval would pursue .</detailed_description>
