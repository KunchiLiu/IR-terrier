	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sedentary habit middle-aged individual associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Studies examine association typically assessed physical activity participation narrow window , ( example , 1 week 1 month ) relative probable disease etiology progression . When study initiate , possible relation long-term physical activity pattern decade lifetime disease risk know exist validated method determine exposure , study need . It hypothesize validation long-term recall activity could lead application lifetime physical activity pattern questionnaire . Data lifetime activity pattern might useful case-comparison prospective study cardiovascular disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Data analyze project cohort observation Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study . Baseline preventive medical examination give 6,902 men woman interval 1971-1982 . Current physical activity physical fitness level ( maximal exercise treadmill test ) assess baseline . Participants also complete lifetime physical activity pattern questionnaire part mail survey do 1986 . Self-reported physical activity 1986 questionnaire use categorize participant ' physical activity level year 1971-1985 . These recalled level activity compare physical activity physical fitness level assess year baseline examination ( measure truth ) . For example , participant report 1986 survey engage relatively high level physical activity 1976 expect record high level physical fitness 1976 examination participant report 1986 relatively sedentary 1976 . The study design permit evaluation accurately participant recall physical activity 15 year past allow quantification error investigator might expect assessment . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
