	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness drug Gemcitabine Herceptin , give conjunction radiation therapy , treat patient cancer pancreas . Gemcitabine standard therapy advance pancreatic cancer . It damage tumor cell may enhance effect radiation therapy . Herceptin genetically engineer antibody prevented tumor grow patient breast cancer . Because breast pancreatic cancer cell share characteristic relate Herceptin work ( similar HER-2/neu receptor protein ) , think drug may also inhibit growth tumor pancreas . Patients pancreatic cancer may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , chest X-ray , blood test , electrocardiogram , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis . They also minor surgical procedure call laparoscopy evaluate extent cancer . This procedure , do general anesthesia , require overnight hospital stay . A small incision ( 1 inch ) make abdomen thin , flexible tube light special fiber end insert opening . This device , call laparoscope , allow surgeon see inside abdominal cavity evaluate tumor also remove small piece tumor tissue examination . Patients accept study assign one two treatment group , accord whether tumor remove surgery . Patients ask complete Quality Life Evaluation treatment begin follow-up visit . This 15-minute questionnaire assess patient ' feeling , ability carry usual activity , effect therapy general health well . Patients treatment group give chemotherapy , outpatient basis unless special circumstance require hospitalization . Gemcitabine infuse 30 60 minute intravenous catheter ( IV ) -a thin plastic tube insert arm vein . Herceptin give 30 90 minute IV line . Radiation therapy abdomen start day , drug administer , continue next 4 day . This treatment cycle-chemotherapy plus 5 day radiation therapy-will repeat week 6 week . Within 6 week last treatment , patient 's tumor evaluate blood test CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis determine remove surgery . If , procedure do general anesthesia require 7- 10-day hospital stay . If tumor remove surgery , another biopsy take evaluate tumor 's response chemotherapy radiation treatment . All patient receive additional chemotherapy begin 6 week surgery ( patient whose tumor remove ) 6 week radiation therapy ( patient whose tumor could remove ) . Gemcitabine Herceptin give IV week 3 week follow week rest . This 4-week treatment cycle repeat six time . After treatment end , patient evaluate CT scan X-rays blood test every 3 4 month first 2 year every 6 month thereafter evaluate disease status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II study gemcitabine Herceptin give weekly bolus infusion administer concurrently radiotherapy patient regionally confine resectable unresectable adenocarcinoma pancreas overexpress HER2 . Patients treat external beam radiation standard manner 6 week prior surgical exploration . Gemcitabine Herceptin administer first day irradiation weekly course radiotherapy . Patients assessed resectability treatment may undergo pancreatic resection . Patients treat weekly gemcitabine herceptin three week follow 1 week rest 6 month . Patients assess clinically toxicity , tumor response , progression-free survival , overall survival .</detailed_description>
