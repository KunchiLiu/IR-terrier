	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) preterm infant respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) associate lung injury nosocomial infection . Moderately premature infant mild respiratory distress routinely receive artificial surfactant early course treatment . This multi-center , randomize trial test whether early surfactant therapy nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) infants 1,250-2,000g RDS reduce mechanical ventilation usage without added complication . Infants mild moderate respiratory distress syndrome enrol trial give either early administration surfactant follow extubation within 30 minute use CPAP , standard practice ( surfactant accord current center practice , initiation mechanical ventilation ) , see whether experimental method would reduce need subsequent mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) preterm infant respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) associate lung injury nosocomial infection . Moderately premature infant mild respiratory distress routinely receive artificial surfactant early course treatment . The role surfactant therapy management large infant respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) unclear . In many neonatal intensive care unit , infant routinely manage continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) alone . This trial test whether early use surfactant combine CPAP would ameliorate course RDS without increase risk death . Primary study outcome measure use mechanical ventilation , thereby likely reduction risk ventilator-associated morbidity . Eligible infant randomize infant 12 hour age receive either : early surfactant follow extubation within 30 minute application CPAP ( intervention group ) ; surfactant accord current center practice , initiation mechanical ventilation ( control group ) . The trial stop 7 month lack recruitment .</detailed_description>
