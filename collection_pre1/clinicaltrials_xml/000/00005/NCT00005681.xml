	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Many damage clinical feature coronary artery disease asymptomatic present without warn . Active myocardial ischemia important functional expression coronary atherosclerosis underlies clinical manifestation . Tests in-hospital aim assessment risk measure activity myocardial ischemia consider ischemia daily life . Electrocardiographic monitoring apparently stable ambulatory patient show frequent asymptomatic myocardial ischemia many new characteristic see test perform in-hospital fact event mostly asymptomatic , surprisingly prolong , related stress show diurnal rhythm similar report myocardial infarction . Out-of-hospital ambulatory monitoring show asymptomatic ischemia common overlook management apparently stable patient coronary disease . If activity ischemia affect prognosis , may sufficient treat symptom alone new goal may necessary aim control active ischemia daily life . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The first five year grant quantify activity myocardial ischemia approximately 90 ambulatory patient coronary artery disease out-of-hospital order : study natural history ischemia relation occurrence coronary event ; examine effect out-of-hospital active ischemia prognosis ; establish monitoring active ischemia provide information risk coronary event apart usual test The longitudinal study characterize patient accord history , symptom , risk factor , exercise test myocardial ischemia , cardiac catheterization data . Serial 48-hour ambulatory monitoring electrocardiogram perform standard medication baseline six month interval . The frequency duration active ischemia out-of-hospital related multivariate analysis symptom , clinical laboratory data , coronary event death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization unstable angina , need revascularization . Patients enrol first two year follow two four year . The grant renew 1996 test hypothesis aggressive treatment plasma LDL oxidize LDL result improvement activity ischemia patient coronary artery disease reverse characteristic cell/vessel wall dysfunction arteries patient . Patients evaluate randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel design trial . Ambulatory ECG monitoring ultrasonic exam endothelium-dependent vasomotion brachial artery use measure activity ischemia arterial dysfunction baseline 12 month therapy standard diet ( control group ) , standard diet plus lovastatin ( LDL lower strategy ) , standard diet , lovastatin probucol ( LDL oxidize LDL lower strategy ) . The study consider NIH-defined Phase III clinical trial . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
