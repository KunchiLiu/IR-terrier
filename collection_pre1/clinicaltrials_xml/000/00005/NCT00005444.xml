	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It know many year African Americans experience twofold high rate hypertension white . The underlying biological mechanism lead differential still understand , however . Despite widespread speculation person African descent genetically susceptible hypertension , direct study carry . Rates hypertension remain low West Africa , study provide contrast population similar genetic background low versus high risk environmental set DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 240 family identify complete community survey Maywood , Illinois Ibadan , Nigeria . Probands age 45-55 equally divided male female . A minimum five first-degree relative examine family obtain information follow variable : blood pressure ( BP ) , obesity , urinary sodium potassium , socioeconomic status physical activity . In addition , plasma DNA collect stored future study relevant physiologic intermediate phenotype candidate gene hypertension two contrasting population . These data provide basis examine familial aggregation blood pressure/hypertension relate CV risk factor . Three primary goal address : 1 ) determine whether familial aggregation blood pressure Black population influence overall distribution environmental factor population level , contrast distribution familial correlation blood pressure familial aggregation hypertension , Nigeria United States ; determine significance measure environmental correlate blood pressure compare magnitude variance component probands relative set ; 3 ) use path analysis obtain estimate genetic cultural heritability blood pressure , control cluster environmental factor household level . Plasma DNA sample collect study provide additional valuable resource future molecular research . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
