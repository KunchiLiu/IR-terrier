	<brief_summary>Recently , physical therapist begin treat people mechanical low back pain , hypothesize cause segmental instability lumbar spine , specific exercise program consist trunk stabilization exercise . The theory behind use trunk stabilization exercise treat lower back pain active contraction trunk local segmental muscle help control inter-segmental movement spine . The initial trunk stabilization exercise physical therapist teach patient abdominal draw maneuver often call abdominal hollowing exercise ( AHE ) . A challenge physical therapist establish effective mean teach people contract relevant muscle need perform AHE . The purpose study examine supplement typical clinical instruction teach AHE visual ultrasound feedback patient effective reduce length time take individual learn perform AHE . Three group research volunteer teach AHE receive different kind feedback performance order determine type feedback effective assist people learn AHE . Group 1 receive feedback performance ; Group 2 receive feedback palpation verbal descriptive alone ; Group 3 receive feedback palpation , verbal descriptive feedback , real time ultrasound . For initial test subject learn AHE , number trial subject demonstrate his/her third correct AHE outcome variable . For retention test , outcome variable percentage trial ( ten ) correctly perform AHEs absence visual , verbal palpation feedback .</brief_summary>
