	<brief_summary>This study examine effect granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) bone marrow stem cell healthy volunteer sickle cell trait determine cell collect transplantation donor sickle cell trait require special handling . Stem cell , bone marrow produce , responsible make different kind blood cell . They cell use bone marrow , stem cell , transplantation . The drug G-CSF , naturally occur hormone , cause stem cell mobilize-that , release bone marrow enter blood stream . This drug give stem cell donor increase amount cell collect . Stem cell donor patient sickle cell disease often healthy sibling patient match bone marrow type . Some sibling carry sickle cell trait , however , , even though sickle cell disease blood bone marrow normal , know cell react G-CSF stimulation . Nor known stem cell require special method removal , process store . Healthy volunteer 18 year old sickle cell trait history sickle cell disease know medical problem may eligible study . Participants medical history physical examination , include blood test urinalysis . They receive injection G-CSF skin day 5 day . On fifth day , stem cell collect leukapheresis . In procedure , whole blood drawn arm vein , similar donate whole blood . The blood circulates cell separator machine , stem cell remove , rest blood transfuse back donor vein arm . The information gain study use ensure safety stem cell donor sickle cell trait well prepare stem cell transplantation sickle cell patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobilization Handling Stem Cells Transplant From Healthy Volunteers With Sickle Cell Trait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients sickle cell disease increasingly become eligible transplantation technique stem cell transplantation continue improve , lead less morbidity mortality . However , availability match donor still remain one main obstacle . Given inherited nature disease , many HLA-matched sibling patient sickle cell disease sickle cell trait . Therefore , patient sickle cell trait presumably use donor patient sickle cell disease . However , publish data whether special manipulation require maintenance storage stem cell collect patient sickle cell trait . The effect granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -induced stem cell mobilization patient also know . Also , due potential HbS gellation red cell , freeze stem cell derive individual sickle cell trait may require stringent red cell removal normally perform . We would like evaluate issue use volunteer sickle cell trait prior begin transplant protocol sickle cell disease .</detailed_description>
