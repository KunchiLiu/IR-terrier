	<brief_title>Epidemiology Pulmonary Response To Organic Dust Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1986 study begin , agriculture one large employer United States , comprise nearly 12 million people . Farm worker hospitalize frequently occupational group find high number restrict activity day due injury illness . Much due frequent disable farm relate accident make agriculture hazardous occupation United States . Agricultural worker also find high rate respiratory disability , compare industrial sector , base Social Security disability record . The common denominator respiratory disorder among agricultural worker exposure organic dust recognize complex mixture vegetable particle fragment , microorganism product , insect insect fragment , fee additive include fish meal antibiotic , avian rodent protein . While vegetable dust far important exposure , individual circumstance grow , storage subsequent use product organic dust arose , influence specific exposure . In certain situation , like animal confinement housing , irritant gas include ammonia hydrogen sulfide co-existed organic dust vary respiratory exposure . Workers expose Iowa swine production unit know significantly expose grain dust , endotoxin , animal dander protein , ammonia hydrogen sulfide gas , variety microorganism include fungi thermophilic actinomycete . Cross-sectional epidemiological survey document high prevalence respiratory symptom include chronic cough , phlegm wheezing , also prominent constitutional symptom include fever , myalgias malaise . This study one several project support Specialized Center Research Occupational Immunologic Lung Disease . Funding represent approximately 35 percent dollar Specialized Center Research Occupational Immunologic Lung Disease ( P50HL37121 ) use support epidemiologic study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A nested case-control study carry previously study cohort . Members cohort resurveyed first year study . All participant receive routine physical examination , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram 40 year age , routine laboratory test , methacholine challenge , intradermal skin testing , bronchoalveolar lavage . Cases swine confinement farmer cohort select FEF50 60 percent le predicted age , sex , height , race . Three referent case randomly select swine confinement farmer select case , non-confinement farmer , blue collar worker . Measurements repeat fourth year , finish fifth year study . The study determine : extent epidemiological study underestimate pulmonary response impairment among agricultural worker ; environmental risk factor significantly related case ; whether atopy heighten airway reactivity significantly associate risk factor . The subproject renew 1992 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter old format Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) .</detailed_description>
