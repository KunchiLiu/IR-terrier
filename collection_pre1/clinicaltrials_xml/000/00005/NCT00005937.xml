	<brief_summary>This study determine safety effectiveness combination immune-suppressing drug antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine treat myelodysplasia , disorder low blood cell count . It : evaluate whether drug combination increase blood count patient reduce need transfusion ; compare survival patient respond ATG cyclosporine treatment respond ; determine side effect treatment . Myelodysplasia think result immune system abnormality cell call lymphocytes attack marrow 's blood-forming cell . The result deficiency platelet red white blood cell cause anemia , susceptibility infection , easy bruise bleeding . Various therapy , blood transfusion anemia bleeding , antibiotic infection , chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation use treat myelodysplasia , disadvantage carry serious risk . Patients 18 year age old myelodysplasia may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination medical history , blood test , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram bone marrow biopsy ( removal marrow sample hipbone microscopic examination ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants admit NIH Clinical Center first 10 14 day treatment continue therapy outpatient basis . They undergo follow test procedure : - Placement central line-An intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( flexible tube insert vein ) place large vein neck , chest arm . Medicines deliver line blood sample draw . - ATG skin testing- ATG inject skin check sensitization horse serum , drug derive . - ATG treatment-Four dos ATG give IV line 4 consecutive day . Prednisone take mouth begin first day ATG therapy continue total 17 day . This drug give reduce side effect ATG , fever , skin rash chill . - Cyclosporine treatment- Cyclosporine capsule take mouth twice day least 6 month . During hospitalization , blood drawn daily blood count test . Upon patient 's discharge 10 day , refer physician blood test weekly first month treatment every 2 week rest time patient take cyclosporine . Dosages drug may adjust depend test result . Patients evaluate NIH Clinical Center 3-month interval first year , every 6 month next 3 year yearly interval . A blood sample drawn visit . Bone marrow biopsy do 6-month interval first 3 year treatment . A grow body laboratory clinical evidence suggest cytopenia MDS least partly result cytotoxic T cell activity . Treatments abrogate T cell activity anti-thymocyte globulin alone cyclosporine alone demonstrated vary degree success alleviate cytopenia MDS . A response therapy MDS associate improved survival . Experience aplastic anemia suggest combination two agent effective suppress cytotoxic T cell activity alleviate cytopenia . This protocol propose use combination antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine ( CSA ) treat cytopenia MDS , effort improve response rate immunosuppressive therapy disease .</detailed_description>
