	<brief_title>Prospective Study HIV Infection Hemophiliacs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In late 1980s , hemophiliac transfuse variety blood product , include large amount cryoprecipitate . In comparison cohort , hemophiliac CMV ( - ) , result comparison group study virus potential cofactor . In contrast , non A , non-B hepatitis common comparison cohort , preliminary data prior 1990 suggest chronic disease predispose rapid progression HIV infection . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Disease-free survival rate determine HIV-infected hemophiliac . The effect co-factors intensive transfusion , concomitant cytomegalovirus chronic NANB hepatitis infection ascertain . Host-virus interaction assess use plasma culture , specific antibody titer , marker immune change detect flow cytometry immune function assay . The immunology asymptomatic stable infection investigate . The safety volunteer donor blood product determine seronegative patient expose 50,000 donor yearly risk sexual transmission HIV spouses seropositive patient monitor .</detailed_description>
