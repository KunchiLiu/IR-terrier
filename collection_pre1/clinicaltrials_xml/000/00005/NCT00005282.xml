	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic model growth decline lung function develop longitudinal study adult . The development chronic obstructive lung disease appear result abnormally rapid rate decline level lung function early adult life . Thus factor early childhood influenced adult pulmonary function either two way . First , hypothesize childhood factor diminish maximally attain level lung function early adult life , thus increase likelihood , fix rate decline adult life , individual would likely develop symptom . Alternatively , childhood event might act directly increase risk develop rapid rat decline pulmonary function adult life . The theory plausible patho-anatomic basis . The lung one last organ body mature child continue make alveoli age six seven . Thus risk factor environmental , respiratory illness , active passive cigarette smoke , host airway responsiveness atopy , could adversely influence lung growth lead less maximal lung growth and/or increase sensitivity cigarette smoking adult life . This study subproject Specialized Center Research Chronic Diseases Airways . The East Boston cohort develop 1975 contract issue Division Lung Diseases . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In 1975 stratify , random sample propositus child age 5-9 living East Boston area Boston , Massachusetts select family member form cohort . In longitudinal study , member propositus cohort family member five year age old reside household visit home annually study personnel . Data collect include : respiratory illness history ; demographic data type heating , fuel cooking , type air-purifying device , area residence ; cigarette smoking history ; disability cardiac disease ; age puberty female child ; pulmonary function test ; anthropometric data . The study help determine extent airway responsiveness risk factor chronic airflow obstruction , acquire result exposure consequence chronic symptom low level pulmonary function . Each year study family request participate cold air challenge protocol . Subjects participate protocol study laboratory community health center . Forced expiratory volume obtain follow cold air challenge test use technique eucapneic hyperventilation subfreezing air . The cold air challenge test separate normal asthmatic . Two inhalation isoproterenol administer one minute apart three force vital capacity maneuver perform . After pulmonary function test complete , allergy test conduct ragweed , tree , house dust , grass . The study renew 1992 examine relationship respiratory symptom illness , cigarette smoking , airways responsiveness , marker inflammation growth decline lung function two well-characterized investigated community-based population child adult . Data available two population : Childhood Respiratory Disease Study East Boston ( CRD ) Normative Aging Study Population ( NAS ) . This group show increase airway responsiveness associate alter pattern lung growth ( child ) reduce level lung function ( adult ) . They also show airway responsiveness cross-sectionally associate chronic respiratory symptom child adult . However , asymptomatic airway responsiveness extremely common , occur 20 percent 60 percent responsive subject , depend responsiveness chronic symptom define . Asymptomatic bronchial responsiveness think represent subclinical mild airway inflammation . Alternatively , may represent difference mechanical factor lead airway narrow . Funding represent approximately 15 percent dollar Specialized Center Research Chronic Diseases Airways ( P50HL19170 ) use support study .
