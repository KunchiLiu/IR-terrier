	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blood pressure increase age , time , reach proportion consistent clinically define hypertension individual . The age-dependent increase blood pressure start mid-childhood accelerates puberty post-pubertal period . Thus , mechanism development hypertension likely present early age . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute sponsor 'Workshop Juvenile Hypertension ' May 1983 . The Workshop conclusion although great deal accomplish past decade , research juvenile hypertension slow little effort evident important area field . They note especially paucity effort research relate mechanism blood pressure regulation elevation , clinical management hypertensive state , identification prehypertensive state . Based recommendation Workshop , study initiate response Request Applications 'Juvenile Hypertension Prehypertensive State ' release NHLBI October 1984 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Production aldosterone norepinephrine examine mixed-longitudinal study design white Black boy girl begin age 6 12 extend age 17 . Levels pressor system determine basal state measurement make urine sample collect overnight . To enhance likelihood school child would comply multiple observation require longitudinal study , measurement deliberately restrict non-invasive one . Specifically , aldosterone norepinephrine excretion measure sleep urine obtain six month interval addition blood pressure , heart rate , weight , height , skin-fold thickness . Family history hypertension parental blood pressure use covariates analysis data child . A second part study concern observation blood pressure increase faster rate adrenarche , period increase adrenal androgen production , puberty . Androgen production period adrenal gonadal maturation may contribute increase blood pressure . The relationship androgen blood pressure examine distinguish blood pressure responses androgen production effect androgens physical growth , thus explore concept androgen interact directly pressor system raise blood pressure . Androgen production adrenarche determine measurement dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate excretion , puberty measurement luteinizing hormone excretion sleep urine sample . Studies continue relationship aldosterone excretion rate , dietary potassium intake , blood pressure . A cross-over study conduct examine effect potassium supplementation aldosterone production . Segregation analysis 'low-aldosterone'phenotype perform family member child low-aldosterone . The study renew 1996 continue longitudinal study child ( biracial population , age 6-16 year ) influence hormones blood pressure examine . Twice yearly child blood pressure anthropometrics measure , overnight urine sample collect measurement aldosterone , adrenal androgen ( AA ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , sodium , potassium , creatinine . Rates growth change blood pressure age well characterized population . From original observation , several difference observe racial group ; specifically , Black child find consume less potassium , produce 40 percent less aldosterone high blood pressure white child . It observe child positive family histories hypertension likely low aldosterone-excretion rate . As part propose continuation longitudinal study , hypothesis test child low-aldosterone level predispose high blood pressure . Although Black child low potassium intake , cross-sectional data indicate part racial difference aldosterone production secondary low intake potassium ( potassium know stimulus aldosterone production ) . Subjects know low-aldosterone production ( Blacks white ) diet supplement potassium test hypothesis Blacks low-aldosterone production reduce responsiveness potassium compare white child low-aldosterone . Families child potassium-resistant low-aldosterone production screen evidence low-aldosterone production , segregation analysis perform establish mode inheritance 'low-aldosterone ' phenotype . In cross-sectional study , AA-excretion rate positively related blood pressure subject great equal 10 year age , suggest important role adrenarche determine blood pressure level young people . In future longitudinal study role AA well gonadal hormone study child reach adolescence ( current mean age cohort 12.7 yr ) . In addition , good distinguish individual influence adrenarche , gonadarche , increase body size blood pressure , series patient phenomenon dissociate studied . The study renew FY 2002 identify new mechanism hypertension use strategy identifies sodium transporter kidney account black retain sodium white . Three site along nephron study base compelling evidence link increase sodium-retention black .</detailed_description>
