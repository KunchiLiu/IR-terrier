	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hepatitis follow transfusion blood blood product continue important problem , despite routine hepatitis surface antigen ( HBsAg ) screen donor blood . In mid 1980s , seven ten percent transfuse individual develop post-transfusion hepatitis ( PTH ) . The majority case ascribe virus ( e ) NANB hepatitis . Because viral agent agent responsible disease identified 1988 , possible prevent illness . There evidence incidence NANB PTH could reduce use volunteer donor blood instead commercial blood . Other measure , absence specific test , relate effort develop surrogate test screen donor blood . The promising approach 1988 measure ALT activity exclude donor increase level enzyme . The measurement antihepatitis-B core antigen ( anti-HBc ) another surrogate test appear useful . Acute hepatitis cause agent ( ) mild often asymptomatic , although rare instance fulminant hepatitis may result indeed may associate high mortality occur course acute hepatitis A B . Of great concern find chronic hepatitis appear common outcome acute NANB PTH . Chronic NANB hepatitis define presence chronic liver disease patient negative serologic marker hepatitis B virus , hepatitis A virus , cytomegalovirus , Epstein-Barr virus , history drug toxicity , alcoholism , heart failure . It appear likely chronic liver disease occur least commonly , perhaps commonly , follow infection NANB virus ( e ) hepatitis B virus . Furthermore , evidence suggest presumed serious histopathologic abnormality chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis also common . The chronic sequela NANB hepatitis infection may therefore important acute illness . That information profound importance blood banker . Because disturb data derive primarily isolated study , suggest possible regional overtone effect large volume transfusion , seem appropriate study problem chronic NANB hepatitis wider scale . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design retrospective , prospective study follow two previously study cohort . In Phase I , evidence present subject Transfusion-Transmitted Virus Study Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Post-transfusion Hepatitis could locate current status establish . Initiation Phase II dependent successful completion Phase I . In Phase II , medical record individual identify Phase I obtain . The record examine clinical morbidity mortality particular attention give liver-related abnormality . Death certificate seek deceased patient . All survive patient control case group invite participate re-evaluated follow prospectively . Controls match age , race , gender , number unit blood product receive . Initial re-evaluation consist medical history , physical examination , series biochemical test evidence chronic liver disease . In initial evaluation , survivor compare clinical evidence chronic liver disease , biochemical , special test evidence chronic liver disease . In Phase III , subject group follow six month biochemical screening , include aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) . Enzyme assay perform least three time , thirty day apart . If aminotransferase activity persistently abnormal , liver biopsy perform . The initial six month follow-up design detect chronic liver disease . Once evidence chronic liver disease establish , patient chronic liver disease control re-evaluated evidence liver disease six-month interval three year initial visit . The study renew 1993 order develop protocol manual operation continuation study long- term follow-up transfusion-associated non-A , non-B ( NANB ) hepatitis ; conduct annual National Death Index ( NDI ) search cohort member alive locate last follow-up ; obtain code death certificate newly decease ; collect abstract medical record hospitalization occur since last follow-up newly decease subject . The search conduct determine whether mortality difference infect cohort control would develop long observation , suggest continued presence chronic liver disease . Each survive member contact annually , medical record hospitalization occur since last follow-up subject report liver disease collect abstract . The contact ensure liver disease may miss enzyme screening , may newly develop , would identify . The study formerly support N01HB87047 .</detailed_description>
