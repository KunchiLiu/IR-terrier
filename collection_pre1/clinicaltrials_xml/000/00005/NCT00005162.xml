	<brief_title>Epidemiology Decline Heart Disease Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The decline coronary heart disease mortality apparently begin around 1963 United States increase intensity later year . In 35-44 age group decline begin somewhat later , perhaps around 1968 . The decline find four race sex group age group include old . This decline also note many country besides United States . The decline coronary heart disease mortality could obviously function either change incidence case fatality . During time decline coronary heart disease mortality great many change occur care cardiac patient change risk factor . The fact decline occur across age well race , sex group well many country suggest one single factor may account decline . It unlikely decline sudden death due improve out-of-hospital care early recognition symptom . The three percent per year decline suggest acute precipitating factor underlie atherosclerosis likely factor account decline , especially young age group men . The study design evaluate whether decrease coronary heart disease mortality real due artifact certification practice accuracy diagnosis . The design base fact best opportunity study decline 35-44 age group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A retrospective review make death certificate certify coronary heart disease , cardiovascular death , non-traumatic possibly sudden death certify coroner . The review include autopsy record , coroner 's report , hospital record , information certifying physician , interview next-of-kin witness . A determination make contribution decline out-of-hospital sudden death prior history heart disease , diseases , possibly cigarette smoking . The change mode death in-hospital death also evaluate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
