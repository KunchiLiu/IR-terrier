	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study improve knowledge pattern functional lung development childhood factor influence relative level growth rate lung function Black child offer new understand predictive value spirometric test lung function perform early age . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use previously exist database unique value include comprehensive respiratory illness data collect on-site child 's tenure Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center 's daycare facility spirometric data collect longitudinally three 13 year age . Furthermore , measurements child racial group limit cross-sectional longitudinal spirometric data available . The longitudinal analysis two primary objective . The first characterize pattern functional lung development Black child three 13 year age relate pattern potentially influential factor ( ) wheeze non-wheezing associate LRI experience infant ( age 0 two ) preschool ( age two five ) year , ( b ) age occurrence first subsequent LRI episode , ( c ) respiratory syncytial virus etiology LRI . Potentially confound factor include prenatal childhood exposure environmental tobacco smoke allergy . The second objective determine degree spirometric parameter 'track ' individual child population child interval three 13 year age . This objective require assessment degree spirometric evaluation preschool year predictive later lung function . The statistical analysis achieve objective use recently develop statistical method base general linear mixed model . By design , method longitudinal data handle unbalanced data miss value , incorporate time-varying covariates , provide exactly extent level lung function individual child maintain relative study child determine value preschool spirometric measurement predictor level spirometric performance later childhood adolescence . These analysis utilize method develop Stewart , Pekow , Burchinal , Helms 1991 unique design handle incomplete , inconsistently-timed data well complete , balance data . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
