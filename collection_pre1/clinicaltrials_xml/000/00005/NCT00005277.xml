	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sickle cell anemia ( Hb SS ) relate hemoglobinopathy involve sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) recognize many year numerous clinical laboratory manifestation describe . However , clinical course sickle cell disease poorly document . The ability establish concrete interrelationship among sign , symptom laboratory test result complicate complexity interaction basic disease process health related event . Comprehensive evaluation clinical status patient usually carry hospitalization 'crises ' acute illness . Because inconsistent nature doctor/patient relationship , method periodic record patient 's status need establish . Further , obtain comprehensive laboratory data necessary period apparent clinical remission well hospitalization . A well design , statistically valid , longitudinal study could make significant contribution well understanding sickle cell disease . Information particularly lack clinical course start birth . Criteria need formulate could establish classification organ involvement severity disease process . Such classification could ultimately use establish need evaluate efficacy propose therapy . The source idea study date back 1971 Hematology Study Section recommend position paper study natural history sickle cell disease . The Hemolytic Disease Study Group Division Blood Diseases Resources develop detail protocol 1973 . The National Sickle Cell Disease Advisory Committee endorse idea 1975 . In April 1976 , Red Cell Working Group Blood Diseases Resources Advisory Committee recommend initiate study . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council approve initiative December 1976 . Phase I , Planning Phase , begin 1977 . The protocols Manual Operations develop phase . Phase II , Enrollment Phase , begin March 1979 end March 1981 , except infant young 6 month age , continue enrol March 1981 . In 1983 study extend additional five year 1988 . Beginning 1989 , separate initiative , study follow select patient group original study additional five year . The selected group include newborn cohort patient survive beyond age 35 . In 1981 , NHLBI offer special competition evaluation cardiac function sickle cell disease patient enrol cooperative study sickle cell disease . The original general study protocol require assessment lung , spleen , kidney , eye , liver heart . The cardiac function study objective : determine cardiac function cross-section sickle cell patient participate large study ; determine incidence , prevalence , onset cardiac impairment ; ass change cardiac function correlate observe change clinical data . A total 300 patient entry cardiac evaluation third year study ( June 1 , 1981 November 30 , 1981 ) exit cardiac evaluation two year later fifth year study conduct four center . Twelve cooperative study sickle cell disease center eleven clinical institution initiate Penicillin Prophylaxis Sickle Cell Disease ( PROPS I ) clinical trial August 1983 . The objective trial determine whether regular daily administration oral penicillin would reduce incidence document infection due Streptococcus pneumoniae child age 3 month 3 year sickle cell anemia . The trial schedule end February 1986 terminate eight month early , average 15 month follow-up , 84 percent reduction incidence infection observe penicillin group compare placebo group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Baseline data collect , include demographic past medical history clinical laboratory information . Stabilized patient re-examined every six month . Newborns young infant re-examined every two three month . Organ damage lung , spleen , kidney , eye , liver measure specific entry exit point provide longitudinal data . Data also gather acute chronic complication relate sickle cell disease provide cross-sectional evaluation .</detailed_description>
