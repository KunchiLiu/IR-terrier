	<brief_title>Intermittent ST Depression Prognosis After Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1988 , coronary heart disease lead cause death United States , account 500,000 life annually . The search continue non-invasive way improve risk-detection population prior manifest disease . Detection silent ischemia , indicate presence asymptomatic intermittent ST depression detect ECG monitoring , accomplish non-invasive mean data analysis determine current , automated analysis program . However , insufficient data assign definite prognostic import intermittent STD . The study address question select population yield conflict result . This part due small size population previously study . The size study 's population permit examination additional criterion ST change relation prognosis . A finding transient ischemia adversely affect prognosis large group patient myocardial infarction would therefore give confidence medical community accessible non-invasive technique identify high risk . This would important impact patient management . Impetus would also give toward study asymptomatic STD among high risk patient ( hypertensive , hypercholesterolemics , smoker , diabetic ) without clinical coronary heart disease determine presence increase risk develop myocardial infarction sudden death . The BHAT trial double-blind , randomize trial effect propranolol survival acute myocardial infarction . The total group number 3,837 patient , age 30-69 . Patients exclude study medical contraindication propranolol , history severe congestive heart failure asthma adult , likely undergo cardiac surgery . Clinical personal characteristic ECG data , include result 24-hour monitoring baseline reference examination , complete patient hospitalize prior randomization . Patients see regular interval random sample 1,000 patient second 24-hour monitoring 6 week . Also visit , psychosocial stress questionnaire complete 2,320 men . Patients follow minimum one three year index myocardial infarction . Official follow-up terminate 3 year recommendation Policy Monitoring Board . The main finding improved survival among patient take propranolol widely report . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This case-control study . The main issue examine whether intermittent STD contribute significantly mortality prognostic variable prior myocardial infarction , heart failure , arrhythmia , diabetes simultaneously control . Using BHAT computer ECG tape , 326 death observe BHAT follow compare 326 control . Substudy I examine joint impact psychosocial stress intermittent STD survival utilizing record 200 case death 200 control psychosocial stress interview BHAT . Substudy II examine whether propranolol favorable impact STD status baseline repeat examination . The design substudy prospective . One hundred fifty patient treat propranolol 150 untreated control randomly select among 1,000 patient repeat 24-hour Holter monitoring six week follow-up visit . Patients follow baseline repeat monitor six week STD duration baseline repeat monitoring follow patient . An univariate substudy examine prevalence STD approximately 180 patient substudy II cohort complete psychosocial stress interview order determine elevate psychosocial stress associate STD . A second univariate substudy examine effect diabetes prevalence STD . A third univariate substudy examine effect STD prevalence arrhythmia .
