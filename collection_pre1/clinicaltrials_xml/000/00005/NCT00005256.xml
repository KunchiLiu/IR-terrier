	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Because low cost non-invasive nature , fluoroscopy think potentially powerful screen tool coronary heart disease efficiency could demonstrate . The utility exercise test screening limit relatively low sensitivity since could detect atherosclerotic plaque large enough significantly impede coronary flow . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Asymptomatic high risk subject screen cardiac fluoroscopy exercise test baseline follow six year annual visit . The sensitivity specificity fluoroscopy relation incidence coronary heart disease incidence cardiovascular mortality determine compare 3.5 6 year follow-up . The predictive utility fluoroscopy exercise testing , relation incidence coronary event , assess logistic regression analysis . Multivariate analysis also perform baseline risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
