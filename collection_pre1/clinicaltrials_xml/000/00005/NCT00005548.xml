	<brief_title>Green Tea Consumption Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Both vivo vitro experiment show flavonoid , antioxidant rich green tea , potentially beneficial vitamin E , beta-carotene vitamin C reduce risk cardiovascular disease . Thus , possible preventive effect green tea CHD begin raise research interest green tea sufficiently inquire beneficial effect formally human . However , epidemiologic study carry directly examine effect green tea CHD . The Honolulu Heart Program ( HHP ) 30 year longitudinal study CHD stroke among 8,006 Japanese American men live Oahu Hawaii . Until end 1992 , 1,888 men cohort define incident CHD ; include 396 death due CHD . The baseline examination HHP conduct 1965-68 . A comprehensive physical examination 24 hour dietary recall interview administer . Within original cohort 75 percent men report drunk green tea daily . The amount consume per day vary considerably low high dos . The high prevalence green tea consumption couple dose information ( i.e low , moderate high consumption ) provide good opportunity examine relationship green tea consumption CHD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use Honolulu Heart Program data examine prospective association green tea consumption incidence mortality CHD use multivariate analysis control potential confounding effect cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose dietary nutrient . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
