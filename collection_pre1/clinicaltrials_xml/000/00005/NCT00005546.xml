	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congenital heart defect ( CHDs ) think result genetic environmental factor disturb cardiac embryogenesis . Because family multiple member affect atrial septal defect ( ASDs ) atrioventricular canal defect ( AVCDs ) describe previous study , paramembranous ventricular septum part complete formation atrioventricular cushion , project describe genetic-epidemiologic study ASDs , paramembranous ventricular septal defect ( VSDs ) , AVCDs DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study one several subprojects within Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease . Three group subject , surgically- echocardiographically-confirmed diagnosis ASDs , VSDs AVCDs identify study University Iowa Hospitals Clinics , Wolfson Children 's Hospital Jacksonville , Florida . A fourth group old subject ASDs progeny study Iowa report high recurrence heart disease offspring subject ASDs . The strategy call upon molecular genetic capacity available University Iowa carry genome-wide search genetic locus involve defect . Several candidate region identify ASDs , VSDs AVCDs . In addition , three well-recognized syndrome provide additional candidate region - Down syndrome , Holt-Oram syndrome 8p-syndrome . Parent-affected child trio genotyped closely-spaced marker within region linkage disequilibrium analysis use narrow exclude candidate interval . A genome-wide association study trio employ parsimonious technique DNA case CHD phenotype pool , compare pool DNA parent . Loci identify allele frequency distribution affect child parent significantly different . When locus identify , fine localization chromosomal area undertaken use high-density set short tandem repeat polymorphic marker span candidate interval . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
