	<brief_title>INTERSALT : International Study Sodium , Potassium , Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : For decade diet , particularly high habitual sodium intake , implicate etiopathogenesis high blood pressure . This concept base clinical observation , include therapeutic result dietary trial ; animal experimentation , particularly induction hypertension salt feeding ; epidemiologic finding . While considerable knowledge amass support concept , limitation inconsistency exist data base . This especially true regard finding population study . Thus , negative inconsistent result report several cross-sectional study dietary sodium blood pressure unit measurement individual within population . When INTERSALT begin 1984 , prospective data available population-based longitudinal investigation . A major problem study , one possibly account negative inconsistent finding , difficulty validly measure habitual sodium intake individual within population relative homogeneity regard trait . This difficulty due large individual variation day-to-day sodium intake output population , ratio intra- inter-individual variance large . This lead high probability misclassification obscure weaken true association single population sample , unless multiple measurement make person . Since dietary history method 7-day food record , multiple 24-hour recall , dietary interview limit validity assessment sodium intake , investigator rely timed urine collection , especially 24-hour sample . But accurate collection several specimen per person many individual population study difficult undertaking . This important reason paucity valid data sodium blood pressure within-population study . INTERSALT base common protocol staff train standardized procedure center , thus permit estimation sodium-blood pressure relationship within well across center . INTERSALT originate Project Council Epidemiology Prevention International Society Federation Cardiology since inception jointly coordinate London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine Northwestern University Medical School . The main data analysis perform London . Overwhelmingly , fund work London Coordinating Center , Central Laboratory , well 52 center , organize independently . For example , support come Wellcome Trust , World Health Organization , International Society Hypertension , Council Epidemiology Prevention International Society Federation Cardiology , Dutch Heart Foundation , British Heart Foundation , Canadian Heart Foundation , Japanese Heart Foundation , well private sector . The grant Northwestern University support Chicago share train coordination Chicago population sample Peoples Gas Company , assistance six center develop country , part Coordinating Center Central Laboratory , data analysis . The grant University Mississippi support four population sample Mississippi . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A common protocol follow cross-sectional study . Data collect blood pressure electrolyte creatinine excretion time 24-hour urine casual urine sample . Data also collect age , sex , height , weight , alcohol intake , diet , drug treatment hypertension , family history cardiovascular disease , contraceptive pill use , smoking , physical activity , social educational status . Urine specimens analyzed sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , magnesium , creatinine central laboratory St. Raphael University Leuven , Belgium . The data coordinate London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine , London , England . The data University Mississippi analyze separately use uric acid covariate . The study renew 1992 conduct analysis . Based important finding inverse association urinary marker protein intake blood pressure analyse conduct 12 52 INTERSALT center , first component renewal study complete biochemical statistical analysis 52 center provide first large population-based assessment test hypothesis inverse relationship dietary protein BP individual ( N=10,079 ) . This relationship also examine across population wide variety nutritional pattern ( N = 52 ) . The second major component study renewal assess impact protein intake original INTERSALT finding significant relation Na , K , Na/K blood pressure . This component include investigation possible interaction Na , K , Na/K protein well factor show INTERSALT relate blood pressure . In addition main substantive question , methodologic issue relate assessment nutritional factor blood pressure investigate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
