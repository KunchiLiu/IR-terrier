	<brief_summary>This study examine child 's body metabolize eliminate anti-fungal drug voriconazole . The result yield information need make recommendation safe effective dose drug child . Children reduce immune function-such receiving drug cancer treatment-are high risk serious fungal infection . Children 2 12 year old need treatment prevent fungal infection may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , eye examination , blood urine test . Children study hospitalize 21 day . They receive voriconazole twice day ( every 12 hour ) 8 day , infused vein period 1 2 hour . The dose determine base individual child 's weight . Blood sample collect various interval infusion day 1 , 2 , 4 8 determine amount drug blood . On day 8 , child another physical eye examination , well additional blood urine test . If additional treatment require , voriconazole may continue day 21 . ( Children require drug 21 day may receive another research protocol . ) On last day treatment , child another physical examination , blood urine test . These procedure repeat 30 35 day follow last dose drug . A small sample blood also analyze genetic information relate rate metabolism voriconazole-that , fast slow clear ( eliminate ) liver . Voriconazole effective several different fungi . It may protect child serious fungal infection few side effect standard available therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate serum level pharmacokinetic parameter achieve follow two dosage level voriconazole . In addition , safety toleration intravenous voriconazole two dosage level immunocompromised pediatric patient population evaluate . Also , plasma concentration major metabolite voriconazole ( N-oxide ) patient perform . The study design multi-center , open label multi-dose study intravenous voriconazole . Intravenous voriconazole administer prophylactically twice daily immunocompromised child high risk invasive mycoses . The patient population consist child age 2 year 12 year age ; two age group study ( 2- &lt; 6 , 6-12 ) . Initial dosage level 3mg/kg q12h 4mg/kg q12h . The planned sample size 24 child . For child complete full 8 day kinetics , replacement patient add . Immunocompromised child high risk invasive mycoses receive voriconazole prophylactically . Therapy initiate within 48 hour completion chemotherapy . Voriconazole therapy continue recovery neutropenia . The first 12 child initially receive load dose 6mg/kg X 2 dos follow 3mg/kg BID day 4 therapy . Twelve hour pharmacokinetics collect day 4 . Children receive 4mg/kg start second dose day 4 continue dosage level recovery neutropenia . Kinetics collect 4mg/kg dosage level day 8 therapy . If mean peak plasma concentration voriconazole first 12 patient follow 4mg/kg q12h dose less 4,000ng/ml. , remain 12 patient receive voriconazole day 4 dosage 5mg/kg .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children ( male female ) age 212 year require treatment prevention systemic fungal infection . Children expect develop neutropenia last 10 day follow chemotherapy one follow condition : leukemia , lymphoma , aplastic anemia , preparative regimen bone marrow transplantation . Patients anticipate live 3 month . Females childbearing potential ( postmenarchal ) must negative pregnancy test entry . Informed consent parent legally authorize representative obtain prior entry . Assent obtain minor capable understanding . No patient receive discontinue follow drug least 24 hour prior study start : terfenadine cisapride ( due possibility QTc prolongation ) . Omegprazole ( inhibitor CYP2C19 ) know increase plasma voriconazole level . No patient receive follow drug within 14 day prior study entry : rifampicin , rifabutin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , nevirapine barbiturate potent inducer hepatic enzyme result undetectable level voriconazole . No patient receive astemizole within previous 60 day . No patient take likely receive investigational drug except : used cancer treatment , antiretroviral agent , drug use treatment AIDS define opportunistic infection . No patient history hypersensitivity severe intolerance azole antifungal agent . No patient already enter onto protocol . No patient medical history evidence cardiac arrhythmia . No patient AST ALT great equal 5XULN . No patient moderate severe renal impairment ( i.e. , calculate creatine clearance le 30ml/min ) . If creatinine clearance reduce less 30 ml/min time study , patient must discontinue study . Creatine clearance calculate use follow equation : 0.55 X height ( cm ) /serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) . Any condition , opinion investigator , would make patient unsuitable enrollment .</criteria>
