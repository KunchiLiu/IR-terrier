	<brief_title>Exercise Blood Pressure Children : A Meta-Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 50 million Americans suffer hypertension , condition associate increase risk stroke , heart attack , kidney failure . While non-pharmacological intervention result dramatic reduction rest systolic diastolic blood pressure elevate pressure , debate continue efficacy pharmacological intervention deleterious side effect . As result , increase interest aerobic exercise non-pharmacologic approach treat hypertension . Recent reviews literature synthesize research use 'traditional ' approach ( chronologically arrange describe study , perhaps sub-topic ) may result subjective , non-replicable conclusion . Consequently , relationship among variable subject characteristic , experimental design quality , train program characteristic , contribute change rest systolic diastolic blood pressure clear . The meta-analytic approach use study synthesize research relationship among variable associate aerobic exercise intervention rest systolic diastolic blood pressure adult . Meta-analysis method pool result separate study . It quantitative approach increase statistical power primary end point subgroup , resolve uncertainty study disagree , improve estimate effect size , answer question pose start individual trial . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In first two year study , meta-analysis conducted study publish since 1966 aerobic exercise blood pressure . The study renew FY 2000 conduct meta-analysis study exercise train child youth age 21 year rest BP measure . This include randomized non-randomized clinical trial least eight week duration find English journal thesis 1966 1999 . Standard meta-analysis technique apply . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
