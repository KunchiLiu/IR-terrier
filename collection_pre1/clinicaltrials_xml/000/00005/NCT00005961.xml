	<brief_title>O6-benzylguanine Carmustine Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Recurrent Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective clinical response rate duration response patient unresectable locally recurrent metastatic melanoma treat O6-benzylguanine carmustine . II . Compare toxicity regimen patient prior chemotherapy v prior chemotherapy failure . III . Correlate clinical response regimen patient O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase ( AGT ) depletion baseline AGT peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( chemotherapy failure v chemotherapy naive ) . Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV 1 hour , follow 1 hour later carmustine IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment continue every 6 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression follow every 6 month . All patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
