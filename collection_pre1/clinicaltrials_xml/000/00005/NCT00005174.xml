	<brief_title>Western Collaborative Group Study ( WCGS ) : 25-Year Follow-up Cardiovascular Disease Morbidity Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The WCGS begin 1960 3,524 male volunteer employ 11 California company . Subjects 39 59 year old free heart disease determine electrocardiogram . After initial screening , study population drop 3,154 number company 10 various exclusion . The cohort comprise blue- white-collar employee . At baseline follow information collect : socio-demographic include age , education , marital status , income , occupation ; physical physiological include height , weight , blood pressure , electrocardiogram , corneal arcus ; biochemical include cholesterol lipoprotein fraction ; medical family history use medication ; behavioral data include Type A interview , smoking , exercise , alcohol use . Later survey add data anthropometry , triglyceride , Jenkins Activity Survey , caffeine use . Average follow-up continued 8.5 year repeat examination . During 8.5 year follow-up , coronary heart disease occur 257 initially disease-free group , 50 die coronary heart disease . There 90 non-coronary disease death . Multiple logistic analysis confirm role blood pressure , serum cholesterol cigarette smoking risk factor . The study also find Type A behavior , assess Structured Interview , associate independently risk coronary heart disease constitute 2:1 risk . In 1982 , Dr. Richard Brand Dr. David Ragland School Public Health , University California Berkeley , conduct Mortality Follow-up 3,014 WCGS subject live 1969 . The purpose 1982 follow-up locate original participant , determine vital status , obtain information health status participant still alive , cause death participant die 1969 1982 . All individual contact ask participate propose 25-year follow-up physical examination . At time 1983 2,534 survive subject . All data gather 1982 Mortality Follow-up use 25-year follow-up . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The follow-up evaluated power cardiovascular disease risk factor , measured 1960 , predict coronary heart disease morbidity mortality 25 year predict stroke . It also evaluate power change cardiovascular disease risk factor observe across seven repeat exam 1960 1969 , predict long-term morbidity mortality provide basis potential future follow-up age cohort . The 25-year follow-up extend exist database add current risk factor status cardiovascular disease morbidity data collect physical examination personal interview . The new data include physical , physiological , biochemical variable , health behavior , medical family history , Type A behavior . Existing mortality record update used determine cause death , possible , extent cardiovascular pathology . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
