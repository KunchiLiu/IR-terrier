The primary endpoint self-reported smoking status end grade 8 10 . The validity smoking report enhance collection breath carbon monoxide sample subject test point . The study extend additional three year add three year , junior high , design two arm comparison high school either receive receive school-wide , community , intervention . The new high school intervention respond recent evidence long term decay junior high program effectiveness , trend toward great high school smoking onset notably among female .
