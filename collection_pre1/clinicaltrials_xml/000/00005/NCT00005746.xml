	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The rationale program proceed markedly increase risk initial coronary event sibling coronary artery disease onset age 50 . There excess treatable coronary heart disease risk factor siblings high prevalence adult atherosclerosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study recruit 364 sibling individual early coronary disease . Eligible subject randomize community-based care ( CBC ) enhance primary care ( EPC ) community health site neighborhood health worker/nurse 1 year follow . Intervention participant stratify base result treadmill test either less aggressive management lipid accord National Cholesterol Education Program guideline . All positive participant exercise stress test directly refer physician . Diabetics refer primary physician treatment .

The intervention build prior sibling study Blacks white . The approach , rather carry intervention central John Hopkins Clinic , thus require transportation potentially anxious participant strange environment , new intervention carry trained local NHWs accessible local community site . The nutrition intervention use fat counter focus total fat gram goal , intervention carry NHW/N assistance cookbook appropriate African American household . Siblings request come monthly dietary counseling . Smoking cessation intervention use individual counseling previously carry investigator . Smoking assessment include self-report measure carbon monoxide ( CO ) expire air . Study physician carry pharmacologic intervention blood pressure , lipids lipoprotein . Diabetes treatment referral patient 's private physician . Nurses provide oversight NHWs . Neighborhood health worker train certified take blood pressure ( BP ) , phlebotomy , CO measurement Center Health Promotion Johns Hopkins , NHW train program blood pressure . Outcomes measure include change blood pressure , smoke behavior , plasma concentration lipid lipoprotein . Attention pay potential modifying factor demographic factor ( e.g. , education , socioeconomic status , income , occupation ) .
