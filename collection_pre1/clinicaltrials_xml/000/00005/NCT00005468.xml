	<brief_title>Lipid Variability -- Influence Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While researcher document behavioral contributor fluctuation individual ' lipid level ( e.g. , nutrition pattern , smoking , exercise ) , little attention give psychosocial stress . Early report utilize accountant , race car driver , air traffic controller provide uncontrolled data associate stress cholesterol increase . Yet , empirical research stress concomitantly examine related influence available . This paucity data probably due lack objective measure stress difficulty measure lipid subfractions . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Based result pilot study , research observation , investigator predict significant positive association stress level triglyceride . A total 228 public accountant ( 148 men 80 woman provide comparable power sex ) recruit great Birmingham , Alabama area . Participants evaluate monthly 18 month , across three stressful non-stressful work interval ( i.e. , tax season ) . The investigator also collect data ( time frame ) closely monitor follow variable affect lipid : dietary intake ( include alcohol , caffeine , total calorie , total fat , saturate fat , dietary cholesterol ) , smoke , physical activity , oral contraceptive use , pregnancy status menstrual stage among woman . Additionally , substudy present unique opportunity investigate relation stress triglyceride-rich lipoprotein formation foam cell . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
