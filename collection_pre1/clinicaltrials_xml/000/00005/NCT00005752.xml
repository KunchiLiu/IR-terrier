Weight loss affect multiple perception behavior , perception overweight , physical activity , dietary habit , smoking , alcohol use . Although past epidemiological research investigate independent effect influence weight , research date identify whether distinct cluster weight perception behavior exist among overweight adult . Given cluster may differ sociodemographic characteristic , identify cluster may contribute design innovative tailor weight-loss intervention address presence multiple influence weight loss increase likelihood successful intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study four specific aim : ( 1 ) identify subgroups high risk overweight base sociodemographic characteristic ( e.g. , ethnicity SES ) : ( 2a ) determine whether distinct cluster weight perception behavior exist among overweight adult ( 2b ) determine whether cluster differ sociodemographic characteristic ; ( 3 ) determine whether cluster overweight sample exist among normal-weight adult , ( 4 ) propose tailor weight-loss intervention test empirically future . Data analyze , gender , 3203 Black , 2989 Mexican-American , 3761 white men woman , age 25-64 , participated third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , 1988-1994 ) .
