	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The PHS cohort include 14,916 men initially free cardiovascular disease cancer provide plasma sample study entry 1982 . These men randomly assign factorial design aspirin beta-carotene therapy , follow prospectively occurrence vascular disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Employing nest case-control design , baseline plasma sample assay four marker inflammation ( interleukin-6 , TNF-alpha , soluble ICAM , soluble VCAM ) four marker chronic infection ( antibody titer direct Chlamydia pneumoniae , Helicobacter pylorus , Herpes simplex virus , cytomegalovirus ) . Case subject study participant subsequently develop MI ( N=550 ) , CVA ( N=400 ) , VTE ( N=200 ) . Control subject select study participant remain healthy follow-up match case age , smoke status , follow-up time . Data usual cardiovascular risk factor , lipid parameter , hemostatic marker risk already available PHS use evaluate result potential confound effect modification . Since PHS randomize trial low-dose aspirin initial 5 year , cohort also provide unique opportunity investigate whether use agent anti-inflammatory property modifies risk subsequent thrombosis among underlying inflammation . Indeed , intrigue hypothesis recently raise regard data relate another marker inflammation , C-reactive protein , future risk myocardial infarction stroke . These analysis take advantage exist blood bank well-characterized large cohort many year follow-up high quality end-point verification . Thus , study could provide efficient cost-effective mechanism evaluate posit , unproven role inflammation infection risk factor future cardiovascular disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
