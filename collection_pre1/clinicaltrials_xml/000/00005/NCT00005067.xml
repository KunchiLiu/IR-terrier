	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose photodynamic therapy lutetium texaphyrin treat patient locally recurrent prostate cancer . Photodynamic therapy use light drug make cancer cell sensitive light kill tumor cell . This may effective treatment locally recurrent prostate cancer . Photosensitizing drug , lutetium texaphyrin , absorb cancer cell , expose light , become active kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy With Lutetium Texaphyrin Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose limit toxicity maximum tolerate dose photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use 730 nm light lutetium texaphyrin patient locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma fail previous definitive radiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure lutetium texaphyrin level needle biopsy prostate PDT use HPLC tissue fluorescence assay calculate percent change lutetium texaphyrin treatment . II . Measure lutetium texaphyrin fluorescence situ prostate PDT use optical method correlate result direct tissue measurement make biopsy patient . III . Determine clinical outcome include clinical response , progression free survival , time complete response , time biochemical relapse , time local progression , time distant failure , overall survival , disease specific survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lutetium texaphyrin light fluence . Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV 10-15 minute 3-24 hour photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . Optical fiber attach laser insert catheter prostate . The laser deliver 730 nm light prostate specify fluence deliver . Patients undergo biopsy prostate bladder PDT . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos lutetium texaphyrin light fluence maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow 2 week , 1 month , 2 month , 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 24 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
