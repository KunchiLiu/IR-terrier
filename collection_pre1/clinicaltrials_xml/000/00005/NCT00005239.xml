	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1974 , twin registry establish member Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program 's Northern California region . In , 9,821 twin pair enrol . In 1978-1979 , 434 pair female twin recruit registry clinical examination coronary heart disease risk factor . The clinical examination include extensive health questionnaire , measurement plasma lipid serum chemistry , analyse genetic marker determination zygosity , measurement expire air carbon monoxide serum thiocyanate level , complete physical examination . During ten year since first examination , several new specific coronary heart disease risk factor recognize , include low density lipoprotein insulin level , anatomic distribution body fat . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All woman participate first examination invite participate second examination . Medical record and/or death certificate obtain document coronary heart disease event . Questionnaires use collect information health history , nutrition , physical activity . A clinical examination assess blood pressure , variety anthropometric measure cardiovascular fitness . Blood specimen collect clinical chemistry lipid/lipoprotein profile . To assess genetic influence , heritability risk factor estimate . Blood frozen future study polymorphic DNA marker . Using monozygotic co-twin control method , effect environmental behavioral factor risk factor assess control genetic factor could explain association . Two hypothesis examine could uniquely address use twin data . First , association body fat distribution coronary heart disease risk factor mediate serum insulin level . Secondly , cardiovascular fitness explain part association physical activity coronary heart disease risk factor HDL-cholesterol insulin level . Lipoprotein analyse conduct Donner Laboratory Berkeley . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
