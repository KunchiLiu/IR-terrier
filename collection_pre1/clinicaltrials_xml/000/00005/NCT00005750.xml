	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : An estimate 25-40 percent United States pre-adolescents adolescent obese . Higher rate note among minority youth . Onset obesity late childhood early adolescence associate increase risk `` track '' obesity adulthood , subsequent obesity-related morbidity mortality , obesity- related psychosocial morbidity . However , limited ability accurately identify child become obese adult suffer obesity-related morbidity , Existing treatment child adolescent obesity yield modest , unsustained effect , single-component prevention intervention relatively ineffective . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The intervention model derive principle Bandura 's social cognitive theory , include activity school , home , clinically orient component high-risk child . The school component include : computer-based classroom curriculum ; physical education curriculum ; school lunch intervention . The home component include correspondence material videotape parent . Children identify `` high risk '' eligible enroll intensive intervention . In addition , several innovative approach include : intervention influence food preference television viewing , intervention promote health advocacy , computer-assisted instruction . An `` efficacy trial '' evaluate three-year intervention cohort approximately 1200 3rd grader , 14 ethnically diverse elementary school , follow-up 6th grade . 7 school randomly assign comprehensive intervention , 7 school receive attention-placebo classroom curriculum . Anthropometric measure assessment food preference , cardio-respiratory fitness self-reported behavior , attitude knowledge occur every six month . Parent interview occur annually . Although careful assessment effect parent school conduct , crucial question whether overall intervention impact student adiposity behavior . The primary objective significantly reduce prevalence obesity , compare control , end three year intervention . Secondary objective include maintenance effect 6-month follow-up , reduce obesity among high-risk child , improve cardio-respiratory fitness , increase physical activity , decrease sedentary activity , reduce prevalence unhealthful weight control method , improve knowledge , attitude perceive self-efficacy regard adoption healthful behavior . In addition , investigator identify personal , behavioral environmental ( include family ) factor prospectively associate development obesity , maintenance normal weight , weight reduction among overweight child obesity-related behavior . Finally , examine longitudinal change height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , triceps skin fold thickness , waist hip circumference girls boys 8 - 12 year age , respect stage pubertal development .</detailed_description>
