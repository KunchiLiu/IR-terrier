	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug call GDNF deliver investigational device treat progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) . The drug administer directly brain catheter attach infusion pump implant abdomen . The study evaluate 1 ) drug safe well tolerate give method ; 2 ) performance catheter pump system , 3 ) effect GDNF PSP symptom . PSP rare neurological disease cause eye movement dysfunction , muscle rigidity , slowness movement , swallow , speech , emotional , cognitive personality problem . Patients 35 75 year old PSP may eligible study . Candidates screen National Institutes Health outpatient clinic Bethesda , MD , medical history , physical examination , neurological neuropsychiatric evaluation , blood test , electrocardiogram , CT scan brain , baseline study include special eye examination , evaluation symptom , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) psychiatric interview . Patients enrol study undergo surgery place two catheter brain two infusion pump skin upper abdomen . The surgery perform Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville , TN . It do general anesthesia require 3 day hospitalization . Within 24 hour surgery , CT scan brain do ensure catheter properly place . Patients return NIH two week surgery post-surgery examination treatment initiation . All patient receive continuous infusion GNDF one catheter placebo ( inactive salt solution ) 6 month . Half patient receive placebo right side brain GNDF leave , half receive GNDF right side brain placebo leave . All patient also undergo follow procedure : Brief physical examination , evaluation symptom adverse side effect - every 2 week Blood urine test - every 2 week first 2 month every 8 week end study CT scan check catheter placement - week 9 27 Thorough evaluation symptom - begin treatment week 1 , 5 , 9 , 17 27 Neuropsychiatric evaluation - week 27 Special eye examination - week 1 27 Lumbar puncture - week 27 Additional blood test measure drug concentration antibodies - 6 time study In addition , patient may ask positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) scan , . The potential benefit GDNF unknown . In study rat monkey , GNDF increase number size brain cell contain chemical messenger dopamine movement balance problem lessen . Earlier study GDNF infuse ventricle patient Parkinson 's disease show benefit serious harm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The safety initial efficacy unilateral intralenticular infusion recombinant-methionyl human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( r-metHuGDNF ) compare contralateral intralenticular infusion placebo solution , continuously administer use chronically implant catheter pump 10 patient progressive supranuclear palsy . Safety evaluate analyze implant- , post-implant- , treatment-emergent adverse event , clinical laboratory test result , disease status . Efficacy study compare leave right side neurologic function use validated clinical scale well putative surrogate biochemical radiographic measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diagnosis PSP bilateral symptom base medical history neurologic examination accordance NINDS criterion . Those evidence ratable limb dysfunction bilaterally well past history levodopa responsivity especially seek . 2 . PSP consider clinically moderate moderately advanced stage ( PSP Staging System grade BB DD ) , associate ratable parkinsonian sign limbs bilaterally Hoehn Yahr grade 3 5 . 3 . Men nonpregnant woman age 35 75 year . Women childbearing potential must negative human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) test result immediately ( within 48 hour ) catheter pump implantation repeat immediately ( within 48 hour ) start drug infusion ; men woman childbearing potential must practice adequate contraception course study . 4 . Before studyspecific procedure perform , subject designate representative must give sign informed consent participation . All patient must sign Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) . Device implantation must occur within 60 day subject consent participate study . 5 . The subject medically able undergo surgical procedure require implant bilateral pump intracranial catheter use stereotactic procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Treatment levodopa , dopamine agonist antiparkinsonian medication . 2 . Presence clinically significant psychosis hallucination . 3 . Any disorder precludes surgical procedure ( e.g. , bleed diathesis , sign sepsis inadequately treated infection ) alters wound heal render bilateral catheter infusion pump implant unsuitable . 4 . Any history clinically significant head trauma cerebrovascular disease recent history ( within previous 2 year ) drug alcohol abuse . 5 . A computed tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) brain within 3 month implantation procedure indicate presence central nervous system abnormality may interfere assessment safety biologic effect protocol , represent surgical risk subject . 6 . The presence intracranial shunt catheter system one use protocol . 7 . Any medical disability , condition laboratory abnormality ( e.g. , severe degenerative arthritis , compromise nutritional state , body weight less 15 % ideal , Na le 130 ( grade 3 ) , cardiovascular disease ) would deem likely increase risk participation protocol interfere assessment safety biologic effect study material , chronic implantation catheter infusion pump , would compromise ability subject give inform consent . 8 . Known allergy E coliderived product history anaphylaxis . 9 . Treatment investigational agent use investigational device within 60 day first dose study material , describe protocol .</criteria>
