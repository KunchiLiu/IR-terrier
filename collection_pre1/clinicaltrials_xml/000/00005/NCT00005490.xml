	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : One complex challenge problem human biology medicine define relationship DNA sequence variation interindividual variation quantitative risk factor complex diseases multifactorial etiology . As knowledge basic human DNA sequence increase , need define range natural variation human population explore relationship nucleotide diversity phenotype variation measure human health . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study collaborative one involve Dr. Deborah Nickerson University Washington , Dr. Kenneth Weiss Pennsylvania State University , Dr. Charles Sing University Michigan . Dr. Nickerson identify measure DNA sequence variation 13 gene play central role key physiological function involve development cardiovascular disease . She apply state-of-the-art automated fluorescence-based sequence high-throughput DNA genotyping method uncover assess DNA sequence variation three human population : non-Hispanic Whites Rochester , MN ( lowCVD risk ) , African-Americans Jackson , MS ( intermediate CVD risk ) non-Hispanic Whites North Karelia , Finland ( high CVD risk ) . Dr. Weiss use theoretical statistical approach molecular population genetics characterize cumulative effect population history amount , distribution , structure extant variation 13 candidate CVD susceptibility gene three population . His test linkage equilibrium homogeneity variation across several level stratification ( among individual , demographic variable , part gene , population , among gene ) sharpen understanding nature human genetic variation , particularly respect candidate CVD susceptibility gene . He make inference functional constraint gene tree pattern divergence among human population human chimpanzee . Dr. Weiss 's project provide inferential engine drive sample design sample selection Dr. Nickerson 's project provide demographic/historical background necessary genotype-phenotype inference Dr . Sing 's project . Dr . Sing develop model relationship DNA sequence variation 13 candidate CVD susceptibility gene identify , measure , characterize Dr. Nickerson 's Dr. Weiss 's project variation establish quantitative risk factor CVD , include total plasma cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride , systolic diastolic blood pressure collect 1,500 individual . His project establish subset DNA sequence variation candidate gene associate variation CVD risk factor subset individual three population . His elucidation relationship DNA sequence variation variation intermediate biological risk factor trait reveal opportunity intervention alter risk CVD establish whether effort direct across population , within population , individual .
