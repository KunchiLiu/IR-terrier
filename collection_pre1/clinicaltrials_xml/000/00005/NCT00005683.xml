	<brief_title>Clinical Interventions Respiratory Distress Syndrome Neonatal Lung Injury - SCOR Lung Biology Diseases Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study subproject within Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Lung Biology Diseases Infants Children . The clinical intervention study significance respiratory distress syndrome newborn bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic lung disorder fibrosis , alveolar loss reactive airway disease often follow pulmonary disease require treatment oxygen mechanical ventilation newborn period . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A series randomize , control trials/studies conduct . In first clinical study , full term infant severe respiratory pathology surfactant inactivation important assign randomly exogenous surfactant versus control group determine surfactant efficacious safe kind lung injury . In second study , infant le 29 week gestation receive prophylactic exogenous surfactant , assign randomly receive immediately follow birth initial stabilization 10-15 minute , address critical current issue surfactant therapy RDS . In third study , infant moderate RDS despite exogenous surfactant therapy randomly assign high frequency jet conventional ventilation group determine mode ventilation therapy would reduce barotrauma incidence and/or severity bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . In addition three clinical trial , another study involve therapy use superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) along surfactant multi-modal approach treat premature infant RDS lung injury secondary hyperoxia mechanical ventilation . This study depend result animal study SOD Project 5 . Finally , study address long term evaluation surveillance survival , rehospitalizations , health status , pulmonary sequela , school performance infant enrol randomized clinical trial , necessary long-term outcome assessment .</detailed_description>
