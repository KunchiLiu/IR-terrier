	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism often occur hospitalization surgery chronic medical condition . Consequently information deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism derive large referral hospital , substantial gap understand incidence , risk factor , outcomes deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism community . This one first study compare hospital acquire deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism among ambulatory resident community . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The five part study : 1. identify incidence cohort test hypothesis 25 year study period incidence deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism decrease , extent test suspected deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism increase , number test obtain patient deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism increase . 2. determine independent risk factor deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism estimate population attribute risk due independent risk factor deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism case-control study incidence cohort community control . 3. tested hypothesis deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism independent risk factor death adjusting age , sex co-morbid condition . 4. described occurrence post-phlebitic syndrome , pulmonary hypertension , recurrent deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism 25 year study period identify independent risk factor low extremity venous ulceration . 5. evaluate accuracy national pulmonary embolism mortality rate compare pulmonary embolism mortality rate calculate review inpatient outpatient medical record Olmsted County deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism patient death certificate pulmonary embolism mortality rate Olmsted County National Center Health Statistics . The study provide complete comprehensive population base estimate incidence , risk factor , survival outcome deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism available date . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
