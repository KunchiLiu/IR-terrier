	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In summer 1981 , Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) alert medical community unexpected outbreak Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia Kaposi 's sarcoma young homosexual men , individual know risk uncommon disease . Studies immunologic function patient demonstrate lymphopenia , cutaneous anergy , reduce helper T-lymphocyte ( T4 ) subpopulation , depress ratio helper T-lymphocytes suppressor T-lymphocytes ( T4 : T8 ) , abnormal lymphocyte response mitogen stimulation , decreased natural killer-cell activity , often hypergammaglobulinemia . The name acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) give disorder immunologic regulation opportunistic infection Kaposi 's sarcoma . Since time , AIDS report patient hemophilia others receive blood transfusion . The NHLBI delegate responsibility study elucidate , systematic prospective study , possible association blood product use AIDS . The incidence transfusion-acquired AIDS low preclude general prospective study transfusion recipient determine overall incidence disease . By focus patient group appear high likelihood develop AIDS require chronic , repeated transfusion therapy , information epidemiology disorder could readily obtain . Continuing medical evaluation patient apparent high-risk group prospective fashion allow identification significant emerge physiologic alteration follow time-course pathologic development . The purpose study develop clear picture immunologic change occur patient transfuse determine change occur long last . Since patient population heavily transfuse , study subject eventually develop AIDS . Information obtain study patient use answer question : Which factor determine particular person 's risk develop AIDS degree ? What alteration occur clinical manifestation AIDS ? Was progression normal defective cell-mediated immunity AIDS strictly unidirectional alter cell-mediated immunity study cohort ever regress normality ? If progression unidirectional , determine outcome ? Also , importance establish serum cell repository could overemphasize , since , new scientific information become available , specimen enable performance number different retrospective study . In 1984 serum repository HIV test establish . The task repository collect store serum sample blood donor four blood transfusion unit locate four major risk area AIDS , namely New York , San Francisco , Miami , Los Angeles . Blood obtain New York Blood Center New York City , Irwin Memorial Blood Bank San Francisco , Red Cross Los Angeles , American Red Cross , South Florida Region , Miami . The purpose repository determine outcome transfusion blood component retrospectively find show HIV infection donor . The collected serum separate , indexed , frozen , store . In 1984 second part Transfusion Safety Study , prospective study , initiate NHLBI separate request proposal . The test 201,000 serum specimen donor repository antibody HIV carry laboratory prospective study . Those donor confirm anti-HIV positive matching donor confirm anti-HIV negative recruit TSS subject . Recipients blood positive donor negative donor also recruit subject . In September 1984 , TSS begin nine month plan phase protocols data system prospective study develop . Subjects enter July 1985 June 1989 . Analysis continue November 1997 . There clinical center Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York City , Miami . The coordinating center University Southern California . The central laboratory include immunological standardization laboratory , immunological reagent laboratory , central process laboratory locate Los Angeles , one immunology laboratory locate Seattle , Washington Puget Sound Blood Center . DESIGN NARRATIVE : At baseline , subject receive physical examination , question medical history , give blood sample immunologic study . Each subject return specified interval repeat study specify protocol . Blood study include complete blood cell count , characterization immunologic cell T- B-lymphocytes natural killer-cells . Plasma Buffy coat cell suspension store frozen . Alanine aminotransferase level determine . Serologic test perform hepatitis , Epstein-Barr virus , cytomegalovirus . Markers immune status , include immune globulin level measure . The study end November , 1997 .</detailed_description>
