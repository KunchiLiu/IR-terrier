	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease lead cause death among adult United States . Although long ago widely believe African-Americans low incidence cardiovascular disease white , believe case . However , despite parity incidence cardiovascular disease , remain substantial Black-white difference utilization tertiary care cardiovascular service ( TCCS ) , coronary angiography ( CA ) , coronary bypass surgery ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) . Race differences find great consistency across study vary design . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use retrospective quasi-experimental population-based epidemiology design examine characteristic health care provider individual patient account utilization TCCS . The study four specific aim : 1 ) determine patient provider characteristic exclusive symptomatology predict Black-white difference referral coronary angiography ; 2 ) determine , patient refer coronary angiography , patient provider characteristic predict Black-white difference receipt coronary angiography ; 3 ) determine patient provider characteristic exclusive symptomatology predict Black-white difference referral CABG PTCA ; 4 ) determine , patient refer CABG PTCA , patient provider characteristic predict Black-white difference receipt CABG PTCA . The hospital record every 1996 cardiac discharge three Baltimore-area hospital review assign patient one three class . These class reflect medical appropriateness coronary angiography estimate American College Cardiology American Heart Association . All patient class 1 ( indicate general agreement coronary angiography indicate ) interview telephone ascertain barrier utilization factor may contribute use service . In addition , stratify sample 16 class 1 subject interview depth . An estimated 400 refer physician survey develop typology physician practice pattern . Results patient survey , physician survey , medical record review merge form analytical database . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
