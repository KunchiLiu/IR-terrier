	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Patients classical hemophilia ( hemophilia A ) Christmas disease ( hemophilia B ) expose many hepatotropic virus course therapy . Severe chronic hepatitis among patient likely related persistent infection non-A , non-B hepatitis virus , hepatitis B virus , delta hepatitis virus , defective RNA virus dependent upon coinfection HBV essential helper function . Carriers HBV could contract acute delta hepatitis infection invariably severe illness cause HBV alone . The morbidity mortality delta hepatitis infection remarkably high . Transmission delta hepatitis agent appear follow route transmission HBV . Direct parenteral inoculation classic mode transmission HBV suggest similar mode transmission delta hepatitis . In 1986 , hemophiliac treat commercial concentrate coagulation factor prepare pool plasma great risk contract delta hepatitis infection . About 50 percent patient delta hepatitis virus antibody . Also , study small cohort indicate hepatitis delta infection major cause chronic liver disease cirrhosis . Therefore , critical need evaluate frequency effect hepatitis delta infection hemophiliac , compare presume chronic non-A , non-B hepatitis , chronic hepatitis B alone , combine chronic delta HBV infection . The project award response Request Applications issue 1986 The Prevalence Consequences Hepatitis Delta Infection Hemophiliacs . The concept initiative originate Blood Resources Working Group Blood Diseases Resources Advisory Committee approve The National Heart , Lung , Blood , Advisory Council February 1985 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study conduct collaboratively within seven hemophilia treatment center comprise Southeastern Hemophilia Group . Upon entry study , patient data collect transfusion factor concentrate therapy , age , race , type hemophilia , sex , homosexuality , drug abuse HTLV-III antibody status . Liver function assess noninvasively . Since available test HDV infection limit sensitively necessarily specific HDV persistence , HDV RNA detect serum molecular hybridization use clone HDV cDNA single-stranded RNA probe . Western blot analysis use ass antibody response HDV . A multifactorial analysis clinical virological data conduct end first year study . Patients reevaluate clinically virologically six month interval ascertain risk factor acquisition HBV HDV infection , assess prevalence rate progression liver disease group . Follow-up patient previously transfuse , allow assessment efficacy current control measure HBV immunization use heat-treated factor concentrate prevention viral infection hemophiliacs . Plans extend follow-up HDV-infected v non-infected subject confound unexpected emergence human immunodeficiency virus infection hemophilic subject comprise study population .</detailed_description>
