	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Available data indicate cardiovascular disease become leading cause death American Indians . Some Indian group appear participate decline cardiovascular disease rate occur within overall United States population , , among Indians , rate appear increase . In addition , appear excessive mortality attribute cardiovascular disease young Indians . Several problem make difficult obtain adequate data prevalence severity cardiovascular disease health problem among American Indians . The small size , relatively young age , cultural anthropological diversity geographic dispersion American Indian population make impractical examine large number subject research vital statistic survey . Excess mortality among young Indians noncardiovascular cause may obscure true risk cardiovascular disease population . Definitions term 'Indian ' variable publish report . The denominator disease rate calculate often base uncertain estimate population risk . Definitions disease method ascertainment vary different study . In addition , health care service available Indians vary considerably different geographic area , possibly contribute difference report morbidity mortality . States large Indian population Arizona , Oklahoma , California , New Mexico North Carolina . Because major concentration Indian tribal group United States locate Southwest , half report study cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease risk factor conduct group . Studies report Pima , Papago , Navajo , Apache , Hopi tribes Arizona New Mexico region . In general , study conclude cardiovascular disease rate low Indian group United States population . The etiology , manifestation natural history cardiovascular disease among Indians well know . Current information indicate 43 percent heart disease death among Native Americans secondary myocardial infarction 32 percent due chronic ischemic heart disease . Below age 35 year , heart disease death rate Native Americans exceed report United States rate . A significant portion excess may due congenital heart disease . Limited data available current level time relate change risk factor ischemic cardiovascular disease among American Indians . Because absence systematic survey define population lack standardization methodology employ study different group , difficult interpret apparent increase risk factor time explain apparent difference cardiovascular disease rate difference risk factor distribution . Studies current risk factor level distribution great importance , however , since may provide best estimate future relative risk cardiovascular disease within Indian population . Multiple factor may contribute current risk factor level American Indians . Variations may exist among tribal group , secondary genetic admixture degree duration acculturation relation attain socioeconomic status . It important recognize generalization risk factor cardiovascular disease American Indians inappropriate available data apply group similar origin history . The study recommend Subcommittee Cardiovascular Cerebrovascular Disease Secretary Health Human Services Task force Black Minority Health 1986 approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council May 1987 . The Request Applications release October 1987 award make September 1988 . The study renew expand twice . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study conduct defined population Indians live reservation involve two component : review death certificate health care record : population survey prevalence risk factor cardiovascular disease . The population survey phase consist three examination cardiovascular disease risk factor , clinical cardiac disease , use medical service cardiovascular disease care . Elisa Lee University Oklahoma study member seven tribes Oklahoma . Thomas Welty Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service follow three Northern Sioux tribe . Barbara Howard Medlantic study Pima Indians Gila River Salt River Indian community . After initial three year Strong Heart Study renew : extend surveillance community mortality ; reexamine cohort approximate four year interval ass development cardiovascular disease change CVD risk factor . Echocardiography pulmonary function test added examination protocol second examination . In 1996 study fund continue follow-up morbidity mortality complete third examination study cohort . New measure added third exam include measure carotid atherosclerosis , arterial stiffness , substudy asthma , family study pilot . The third examination cohort complete August , 1999 3,200 member reexamine . In addition , 560 participant include substudy asthma . There approximately 1,000 death among cohort member 12 year since initial examination . Phase IV study begin FY 2000 five-year extension expand family study continue morbidity mortality surveillance original cohort . Each three field center recruit additional 900 participant member family contain least two SHS cohort member . Furthermore , pilot study family member invite follow-up exam 900 member enrol center . The Phase IV family study exam include cardiac carotid ultrasound exam , blood pressure , noninvasive measurement arterial stiffness ( tonometry ) , ECGs , anthropometry , medical history , behavioral assessment ( socio-economic status , diet , smoking , alcohol , physical activity ) , blood chemistry , lipid , DNA . The specific aim Phase IV study expand family study increase power genetic analysis , continue surveillance original cohort ascertain CVD case , investigate association pertinent biomarkers cardiac function development CVD , initiate mortality surveillance family member . The National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) provide fund gallstone component .</detailed_description>
