	<brief_title>Sleep Apnea Elderly Male Twins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The contribution genetic factor sleep disorder demonstrate twin family study , understand genetic underpinning sleep disorder consider important area research . Many suggest risk factor sleep apnea ( e.g. , craniofacial morphology , obesity ) genetic determinant . However , formal genetic analysis anatomical risk factor sleep-recorded physiological measurement far conduct . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator recruit subsample pair NAS-NRC World War II Twin Registry least one twin brother report sleep apnea symptom subsample control pair twin report symptom . They monitor subgroup twin pair overnight sleep recording . They also collect anthropometric measurement weight , height , neck circumference , craniofacial morphology blood sample determination zygosity DNA extraction future molecular study . The twin design powerful estimating genetic and/or environmental overlap physiological measurement sleep-recorded disordered breathing , obesity , craniofacial morphology . The investigator choose focus elderly male twin sample wealth data relevant study previously collect . Twin pair concordance discordance monitor sleep-disordered breathing allow full characterization genetic/familial individual environmental factor associate expression severity condition . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
