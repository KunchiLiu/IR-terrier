	<brief_title>Clinical Course Coronary Artery Disease Among Blacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Black population age-specific cause mortality rate among adult 3.5 time high white . There remain press need improve detection treatment coronary artery disease among Blacks attempt reduce unfavorable racial differential . Also , many fundamental advance understand atherosclerosis come study geographic pathology - epidemiologic comparison population group widely vary distribution risk factor . Two prominent feature epidemiology coronary artery disease among United States Blacks fertile ground comparative study high prevalence hypertension increase susceptibility Black woman disease . Knowledge gain study potentially apply coronary artery disease human population group , do work among Masai , Seventh-Day Adventists , group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In longitudinal study , patient recruit adult Emergency Service Cook County Hospital . Key end-points include : case fatality rate acute event ; long-term survival rate ; sudden versus non-sudden death rate ; occurrence first myocardial infarction among patient new onset angina ; functional recovery myocardial infarction coronary artery bypass graft . Baseline data collect group include : age , sex , education , weight , height , medical history , hyperlipidemia , alcohol cigarette use , medication . Both two-dimensional M-mode echocardiogram obtain exercise test perform . At time cardiac catheterization fast blood sample draw lipid analysis . Bi-plane ventriculography cineangiography perform . After discharge , patient return clinic three-month interval two year . Analyses conduct leave ventricular hypertrophy socioeconomic status predictor mortality . The two control group permit comparison baseline finding end-points . One hundred fifty patient control group follow long-term , primarily surveillance government vital status record . The study provide data survival rate , incidence new event , mode death , roles sex difference hypertension coronary artery disease , efficacy coronary artery bypass surgery . The study renew FY 1993 address series major question relate clinical epidemiology coronary artery disease among Black woman continue go study involve 2,806 Black men woman enrol hospital-based registry . An examination survival pattern relate risk factor cohort 1,559 Black woman primary focus project . The study renew 1996 continue follow original cohort examine interaction leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) mortality risk subgroup patient coronary heart disease , investigate impact leave ventricular geometry survival , define prognostic significance obesity . Also enroll new clinical cohort 5,600 patient , approximately equally divided Blacks white , Louisiana State University ( LSU ) Medical Center . The survival pattern group compare directly , contribution LVH Black : white differential estimate . The new cohort serve validation sample hypotheses derive original cohort . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
