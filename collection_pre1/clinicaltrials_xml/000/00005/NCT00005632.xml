	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Combining vaccine QS21 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy plus immune adjuvant QS21 treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine immunization glycosylated MUC-1 antigen contain MUC-1 ( 106 ) keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induce antibody , helper T cell and/or cytotoxic T cell response MUC-1 patient prostate cancer express MUC-1 . II . Determine post-immunization change PSA level objective parameter disease ( radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease present ) patient receive therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen contain MUC-1 ( 106 ) keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously ( SQ ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ week 1-3 , 7 , 15 , 27 total 6 vaccination . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year document disease progression .</detailed_description>
