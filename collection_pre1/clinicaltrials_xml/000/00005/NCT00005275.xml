	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study motivate increase recognition frequent occurrence sleep-disordered breathe general population mount evidence sleep-disordered breathing may increase risk cardiovascular disease , include coronary artery disease stroke , hypertension , may reduce quality life generally . Many clinical question remain unanswered concern sleep-disordered breathing well : example , , natural history disorder , intervention warrant ; determine risk recently develop treatment apply cost-effective manner . The initiative develop Pulmonary Diseases Advisory Committee , approve full Committee February , 1993 , give concept clearance October , 1993 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release January , 1994 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The SHHS add in-home polysomnography data collect cohort study . Using Compumedics SleepWatch polysomnograph , single over-night polysomnogram obtain home subject ; montage include oximetry , heart rate , chest wall abdominal movement , nasal/oral airflow , body position , EEG , ECG , chin EMG . In-home monitoring provide data occurrence sleep-disordered breathing arousal . Although SHHS prospective cohort study , cross-sectional finding provide new information pattern sleep sleep-disordered breathing general population . Consequently , initial analysis descriptive also address cross-sectional association sleep-disordered breathe prevalent cardiovascular disease quality life risk factor cardiovascular disease . Longitudinal analysis address sleep-disordered breathing predictor cardiovascular outcome change blood pressure . The extent information available key cardiovascular risk factor varies among parent cohort . Some additional data collect covariates enrollment SHHS . However , parent study principal source information risk factor cardiovascular disease participant . The cardiovascular outcome site include hospitalize acute myocardial infarction , nonfatal coronary heart disease , stroke , death due cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Change blood pressure diagnosis hypertension consider , participant complete standardize instrument quality life . The cardiovascular outcome adjudicate method already place ARIC , CHS , SHS , Framingham Field Centers CHS process New York Tucson Field Centers . Ancillary study address outcomes , cognitive functioning , consider full SHHS cohort . STATUS : Over 80 manuscript publish base substudies ancillary investigation . Three primary outcome paper publish 2009 2010 , base follow-up 2006-2007 . The study renew several time provide continue data collection follow-up , include new polysomnograms . The formal funding SHHS sit , end August 31 , 2008 , follow one-year no- cost extension . Funding cease participate site August 31 , 2009 , Data Coordinating Center PSG Reading Center grant additional no-cost extension support additional data collection parent cohort obtain follow 2009 , 2010 2011 ( depend cohort ) , all-cause mortality , incident CVD , stroke . The updated result present session ATS 2012 meeting San Francisco .</detailed_description>
