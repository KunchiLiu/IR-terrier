	<brief_title>Molecular Genetic Epidemiology Endocardial Cushion Defects - SCOR Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1987 , third renewal Ischemic Heart Disease Specialized Centers Research renewal consider , Cardiology Advisory Committee recommend scope SCORs broaden include peripheral vascular disease , congenital heart disease , heart failure . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council concur recommendation Request Applications Specialized Centers Research Coronary Vascular Disease , Heart Failure Congenital Heart Disease issue July 1987 . The study renew 1999 P50HL62178 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1990 , molecular genetic epidemiology endocardial cushion defect four group individual investigate subproject within SCOR Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease . Subjects include Down syndrome endocardial cushion defect , non-syndromic endocardial cushion defect , Down syndrome congenital heart disease , normal heart . Examinations carry relative subject ascertain whether endocardial cushion defect chromosome 21-related disorder , Down syndrome Alzheimer 's disease . This accomplish obtain family pedigree examine 1st , 2nd 3rd degree relative utilize electrocardiographic echocardiographic technique . Venous blood obtain probands relative association study DNA probe know relate chromosome 21 gene locate chromosome may affect cardiac embryogenesis . Segregation analysis focus family subject non-syndromic endocardial cushion defect determine whether evidence major gene defect result deformity atrioventricular canal . If evidence find , linkage study carry attempt pinpoint location major gene genome . When SCOR renew 1995 , objectives identify polymorphisms candidate gene use polymorphisms genetic association study patient . Subjects include Down syndrome atrioventricular canal defect , non-Down subject atrioventricular canal defect , Down syndrome subject functional heart disease , normal subject heart disease Down syndrome , Down syndrome subject perimembranous interventricular septal defect , non-Down subject perimembranous interventricular septal defect . In addition , polymorphism within candidate gene , well highly polymorphic short tandem repeat polymorphism ( STRPs ) , use genome-wide linkage search gene large family multiple affected individual . When association linkage study suggest involvement specific gene , search mutation gene carry . In addition , investigator determine whether likely candidate chromosomal region ( chromosome 21q21.1-qter ) involve non-Downs AVCD use molecular technique search allele loss , uniparental disomy , cryptic translocation . They also investigate molecular genetic variability associate endocardial cushion ventricular septal development Down syndrome subject without heart disease normal subject . Examinations carry relative subject ascertain whether congenital heart defect congenital anomaly . This accomplish obtain family pedigree , medical history , examine 1st degree relative ( , positive , 2nd 3rd degree relative ) utilize echocardiographic electrocardiographic technique .
