	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The cause essential hypertension remain unknown , generally agree genetic environmental factor important . Of latter , two lead contender nutrition include sodium intake weight gain , psychosocial stress . It probable single factor responsible , hypertension likely develop number factor act unison , different mechanism operate different individual . It also seem probable may two different component development hypertension , differ time course . First , number mechanism produce rapid change blood pressure , necessarily sustain long . Prime among sympathetic nervous system renin-angiotensin system . Although derangement describe patient essential hypertension , neither explain overall mechanism . Secondly , also slowly occur hypertrophy arterial wall , occur partly response transient increase pressure , also act positive feedback loop , serve amplify . It seem probable number different mechanism may involve first process , possibly include effect psychosocial stress nutrition , slow mechanism may final common path maintains amplifies development hypertension independently initiate cause . While relevance behavioral factor , stress hypertension commonly accept lay public , find much less acceptance among physician . This perhaps surprising , stress hard quantify scientific basis , particularly borne mind still agreement role sodium intake , comparatively easy quantify , development hypertension . The treatment patient mild hypertension major public health issue . There two possible strategy counter cost side effect universal pharmacological treatment , namely , define high risk patient find safe method treatment . Patients white coat hypertension show elevation blood pressure clinic situation . If demonstrated individual white coat hypertension increase risk exhibit physiological biochemical characteristic normally associate early hypertension , individual necessarily require drug treatment may treat desensitization . Also , study job strain may enable identification environmental risk factor may adverse effect certain individual ' blood pressure . If job strain influence blood pressure , present possibility entirely new non-pharmacological method prevent treat hypertension , manipulation work environment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : When study initiate 1984 , five interdisciplinary study conduct . Study 1 follow 1,500 hypertensive patient ambulatory blood pressure record last ten year , determine whether ambulatory blood pressure improve prediction morbid event relative clinic blood pressure . Study 2 evaluate factor contribute white coat hypertension , whether could treat behaviorally . Study 3 compare reactivity beta-adrenergic stimulation behavioral task normal patient hypertension depression . Study 4 test Job Strain Model laboratory investigate interactive effect blood pressure varying level workload task difficulty decision latitude degree personal control challenge behavioral task . Generalization measure reactivity assess comparison ambulatory blood pressure recording . Study 5 , cohort study 400 subject , determine whether individual high-strain job show great elevation blood pressure five year low-strain job . The study renew one year 1993 continuation extension study association occupational stress ( 'job strain ' , evaluate Karasek Job Content Survey ) hypertensive cardiovascular disease , evaluate principally ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) leave ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) . It originally case control study case ( hypertensive subject ) find likely expose job strain normotensive control , odds ratio 2.75 , great LVMI . This effect independent know risk factor hypertension . It extend prospective study 314 men woman study 9 worksites Waves observation five year . Preliminary result Waves 1 2 show longitudinal association persistent job strain progressive elevation ABP . In renewal , investigator increase sample size 100 subject add 4th Wave observation . In Wave 3 , add new outcome measure-ultrasound examination carotid artery , detect early structural change atherosclerosis . They also monitor physical activity continuously ABP monitor use Actigraph monitor . A new focus wa social support , show relate cardiovascular morbidity , possibly via interaction effect job strain . The investigator evaluate availability perceive satisfaction interact job strain outcome measure . The effect job strain urinary catecholamine cortisol also examine 210 subject , test hypothesis job strain associate overactivity sympathetic nervous system adrenocortical system , analogy Frankenhaueser 's Effort-Distress model . In Wave 4 also perform reactivity testing , order examine correlation reactivity , atherosclerosis , cardiovascular variable . The research help determine whether sequential linkage exist major psychosocial factor ( job strain lack social support ) , mechanisms mediate cardiovascular damage ( elevated ABP sympathoadrenal activation ) , resultant preclinical cardiovascular disease ( left ventricular hypertrophy carotid atherosclerosis ) . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
