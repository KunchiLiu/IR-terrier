	<brief_title>Charleston Heart Study - Predictors Coronary Disease Blacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease lead cause death among United States Blacks , coronary heart disease mortality rate among high world . There marked decline coronary heart disease mortality among Blacks United States include South Carolina since 1968 reason well explained , although hypertension control probably contribute decline . In spite decline , evidence emerge fatal non-fatal coronary heart disease rate Blacks exceed white . Charleston Heart Study data show coronary heart disease cumulative survival probability Black men low white men first 20 year 25 year observation period . A secular trend manifest relatively high rate Blacks event , evidence coronary disease major threat Blacks . The Charleston Heart Study initiate 1960 . Randomly select Black white men woman 35 year age examine obtain detail concern angina , myocardial infarction , hypertension , smoking , blood pressure , height , weight , serum cholesterol level . The total cohort 2,283 person . The last screening cohort 1974-1975 study start 1984 . Over one half Blacks United States live South Charleston Heart Study offer opportunity study disease disability status elderly Blacks , environment include urban rural resident . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In 1984-1985 25 year follow-up conduct original Charleston Heart Study cohort . The vital status 98 percent 1960 cohort ascertain . Ninety-three percent survivor revisit , interview , measure blood pressure , weight , height . The interaction socioeconomic status , type A behavior John Henry behavior score test . All-cause coronary heart disease mortality determine . In 1987-1988 approximately 1,300 survivor recall measurement functional cognitive status use Framingham Functional Disability Questionnaire comparison result Charleston Framingham could make . Measurements make blood pressure , height , weight , heart function auscultation , ECG , echocardiography . Lipoproteins , glucose , biochemical parameter assess . The biomedical sociodemographic determinant long-term survival Black men woman quantify compare white . The risk factor significance Minnesota-coded ECG abnormalities Blacks versus white identify quantified . Familial aggregation risk factor potential cause obesity assess . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
