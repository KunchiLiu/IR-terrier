	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental cancer vaccine mantle cell lymphoma form cancer white blood cell call lymphocyte . Although standard treatment lymphoma may achieve disease remission , none provide cure . Patients mantle cell lymphoma 18 year older treat previously chemotherapy may participate study . Candidates screen eligibility medical history physical examination . Other test may require include blood urine test ; lung function study ; image test magnetic resonance imaging , compute tomography X-rays ; biopsy ( surgical removal small tissue sample ) tumor , bone marrow , tissue . Patients enrol study begin treatment chemotherapy design reduce disease minimum , achieve remission shrink tumor much possible . Chemotherapy administer outpatient basis period around 12 18 week 3-week cycle follow : prednisone mouth day 1 5 ; etoposide , doxorubicin vincristine intravenously ( vein ) day 1 5 ; cyclophosphamide intravenously day 5 . Starting day 6 , patient receive chemotherapy 16 day . In addition , antibody call rituximab , attach lymphoma cell may increase effectiveness chemotherapy , give day 1 cycle . Patients also receive protein call G-CSF start day 6 cycle continue white blood cell count recovers day 19 . G-CSF naturally produce bone marrow may boost immune system . The chemotherapy drug rituximab infuse vein mean lightweight portable pump , patient teach use . Patients also teach give G-CSF injection skin , similar insulin injection . The first vaccination give least 3 month chemotherapy end repeat every 4 week maximum 5 vaccination . The vaccination give clinic . Patients also receive daily injection GM-CSF , growth factor naturally produce bone marrow boost immune system . These injection give day vaccination next 3 day . When vaccine therapy complete , patient treat successfully follow periodic clinic visit follow-up examination test . Patients lymphoma disappear entirely recurrence disease advise treatment possibility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Vaccination Treat Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Mantle cell lymphoma present particular clinical challenge aggressive incurable chemotherapy . Thus , novel treatment approach need . - In follicular center cell lymphoma , another incurable disease , recent evidence suggest molecular complete remission may achieve follow idiotype vaccination patient achieve minimal residual disease combination chemotherapy . - These result suggest idiotype vaccine may able induce clinically significant immune response lymphoma . Objectives : - To assess EPOCH-R/idiotype vaccination associate median progression-free survival consistent 36 month ; - To assess rituximab affect generation T-cell immunity idiotype . - To compare T-cell immunity use two different method isolate idiotype protein . Eligibility : - Tissue diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma . - Age great equal 18 year . - Previously untreated cytotoxic chemotherapy . All stage disease . - Lymph node great equal 2 cm accessible biopsy/harvest great 1000/microl circulate tumor cell blood . - ECOG performance status less equal 3 . Design : - In present study , propose investigate efficacy idiotype vaccine treatment previously untreated patient mantle cell lymphoma . In order achieve minimal residual disease , patient receive 6 cycle EPOCH chemotherapy rituximab ( EPOCH-R ) follow 5 idiotype vaccine injection . - This study complete accrual 26 patient open follow-up .</detailed_description>
