	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Thalidomide may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . It yet know combination chemotherapy effective without thalidomide multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy without thalidomide treat patient refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9922 Combination Chemo Plus Filgrastim With Without Thalidomide Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall progression-free survival remission rate patient refractory multiple myeloma treat dexamethasone , cyclophosphamide , etoposide , cisplatin , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) without thalidomide . II . Compare qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior transplantation ( yes v ) , prior treatment failure ( resistant v relapse ) , prior treatment regimen ( 1-2 v 3-4 ) , prior thalidomide ( v ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily cyclophosphamide , etoposide , cisplatin ( DCEP ) IV continuously day 1-4 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin day 5 continue blood count recover . Treatment continue every 3-4 week 3 course . Patients achieve stable disease well proceed maintenance chemotherapy DCEP administer every 8 week 3 additional course . Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy DCEP arm I plus oral thalidomide daily . Thalidomide continue maintenance chemotherapy continue chemotherapy complete disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 320 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
