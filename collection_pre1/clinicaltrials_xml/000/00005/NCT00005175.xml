	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension relate disease major cause morbidity mortality among United States Blacks . Among Blacks white , low level education associate high level blood pressure , stroke , coronary heart disease mortality . High level blood pressure United States Blacks compare United States white persist even control education . Furthermore , demonstrate individual live southeastern part United States continue high stroke coronary heart disease mortality rate live area United States . The number upwardly mobile Blacks , base education occupation , increase United States yet relatively little known relationship improvement socioeconomic status cardiovascular risk factor , particularly blood pressure . In Africa , four decade , hypertension regard rare disease among Black Africans . However , recent evidence hospital community base population suggest hypertension prevalent cardiovascular disease among Africans constitutes major public health problem , particularly West Africa . Furthermore , stroke increase health problem . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In longitudinal study , United States student recruit follow annually three year . The African student follow two year . At initial clinic visit blood pressure , heart rate anthropometric measurement obtain questionnaire complete concern socioeconomic status , family medical history , dietary practice , smoke drinking habit . One every four student blood pressure measurement reassess . Each participant collect overnight urine sample analysis sodium potassium . Fifty percent population wear physical activity monitor two day . Approximately ten percent student ' family study validate hypertensive status medical history parent report student assess know cardiovascular risk factor include obesity , smoking , alcohol intake , physical activity , behavioral factor . Univariate analysis conduct assess association dependent variable blood pressure independent variable include age , body mass index , height , sodium potassium . T-tests use analyze dichotomous variable sex , race , geographic location . Stratification use examine blood pressure level Blacks white socioeconomic status . Multiple regression model use determine whether physiological psychosocial variable predictive cardiovascular risk . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
