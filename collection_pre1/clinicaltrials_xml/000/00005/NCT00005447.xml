	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The long-term follow-up data analysis two epidemiologic study , general population study clinical trial provide basis study . The first study assess long-term relationship total physical activity ( work leisure time ) mortality random sample 1,656 Black white men woman resident City Buffalo , New York . The study focus participant ( 30+ year age baseline ) Buffalo Health Study , epidemiological investigation conduct Buffalo 1960 . As part investigation , detailed information gather participant regard number demographic socioeconomic characteristic ( age , body mass index , education , marital status , etc . ) participant ' usual daily activity ( weekday weekend ) work outside work . This information use compute total physical activity index . The study relate participant ' physical activity characteristic all-cause CHD mortality experience throughout follow-up period test whether relationship physical activity mortality similar across gender race . The detailed baseline demographic socioeconomic data allow analysis independence observe association physical activity mortality . The second study extend 17 year , follow-up National Exercise Heart Disease Project ( NEHDP ) , multi-center , randomized clinical trial design study effect regular , medically prescribe supervised exercise program rehabilitation male survivor ( age 30-64 baseline ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Three year finding trial report non-significant difference treatment control group all-cause mortality , recurrent MI favor exercise group . Other outcomes favor treatment group report one year include increased physical working capacity , decrease body fat , diastolic blood pressure , triglyceride . The study determine vital status original study participant , cause death decease . The long follow-up permit analysis whether long-term survival treatment group differ control . In addition , investigator able ass risk factor change observe first year trial present three year , whether change relate long-term survival , whether difference mortality observe sub-groups ( i.e . smoker ) three year remain 17 year , whether baseline patient characteristic ( i.e. , anxiety depression ) predict mortality . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
