	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect protein call secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor ( SLPI ) , skin wound heal . Produced naturally body , SLPI modify level elastase , substance break skin . Older people great risk impair wound healing , increased elastase activity inflammation . In addition , men heal slowly woman . Delayed heal associated infection pain lead development chronic non-healing skin wound . Healthy men woman 60 80 year old wish participate study brief history physical evaluation determine eligibility . Those enrol randomly assign receive gel form SLPI apply topically ( skin surface ) skin wound placebo ( look-alike gel active ingredient ) . Participants undergo follow procedure : First visit - The skin numb local anesthetic two small ( 4 mm ) wound ( size pencil eraser ) make upper arm . The drug placebo apply wound gauze place . Two blood sample ( 20 ml 7 ml ) draw hour apart determine blood level SLPI . Second visit - The day first visit , wound dress remove participant evaluate pain wound site , allergic reaction infection . A blood sample ( 7 ml ) take . Third visit - The wound examine photographed evaluate healing . In addition , strength wound may assess mean vacuum system place skin . ( This may cause tingle sensation wound . ) A piece four wound remove skin numbed dress apply . Fourth visit - The wound examine heal dress remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety topically-applied Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor ( SLPI ) peptide treatment impair wound heal state 60-80 year old subject great risk delay wound heal . Administration drug topically result reduced elastase activity inflammation , lead accelerate matrix deposition wound heal . Subjects randomly allocate one four possible group : topical administration SLPI placebo ( wound excise day 7 post-wounding ) topical administration SLPI placebo ( wound excise day 50 post-wounding ) . The dose SLPI determine dose-finding pilot study prior main study . Initial 4mm punch biopsy make upper inner arm ( two per arm ) , follow topical administration SLPI placebo . The wound leave heal four wound excise either day 7 ( 50 % volunteer ) day 50 post-wounding ( 50 % volunteer ) . The incidence side-effects , rate healing determine time-points . Successful demonstration enhance therapeutic effect may provide basis development strategy accelerate wound heal situation comprise , age chronic non-healing wound .</detailed_description>
