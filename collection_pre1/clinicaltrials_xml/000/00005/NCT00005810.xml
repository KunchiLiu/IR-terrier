	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Colony-stimulating factor filgrastim may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help person 's immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy plus filgrastim treating patient stage IV prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Filgrastim Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate ( objective PSA response ) duration response estramustine , docetaxel , carboplatin filgrastim ( G-CSF ) support patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient population .</detailed_description>
