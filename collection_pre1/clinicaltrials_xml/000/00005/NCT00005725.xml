Process measure describe adherence outcomes determinant . Secondary outcomes related CVD risk factor status also evaluate . Prior evaluation , pilot study determine best sequence deliver information relate dietary change ( i.e. , Na first , fat/cholesterol first , concurrent ) . Subsequent evaluation prior development final system dissemination plan , assessment make potential utility CARDES black population low literacy skill .
