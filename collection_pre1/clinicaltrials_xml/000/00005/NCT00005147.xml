	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease appear consequence interaction individual 's genotype exposure environmental factor . Genetic information potential contribute identification family individual biological predisposition develop coronary artery disease . Although numerous study suggest possibility link polymorphic genetic variation coronary heart disease , possible use single genetic locus combination locus establish person 's risk except case familial hypercholesterolemia . Apolipoproteins play critical role regulate cellular uptake lipoprotein specific receptor , regulate activity lipoprotein lipase lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase , indirect regulation intracellular enzyme , acyl-cholesterol acyl transferase HMG Co-A reductase . This study provide insight role environmental genetic effect phenotypic variation individual component molecule lipid metabolism well relationships component . Previous study conduct grant include : relationship quantitative level apo A-I coronary artery disease define coronary angiography ; effect exercise , alcohol , obesity , pregnancy apo A-I level ; relationship apo A-I HDL level child mode inheritance apo A-I level pedigree Rochester , Minnesota community ; characterization antigenic structure apolipoproteins coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects study draw Rochester Family Heart Study initiate recruitment family study January 1985 . In 31 month recruitment , 443 household contact 300 agree participate . In August 1987 individual identify household complete clinic visit provide 1,999 physical exam . The 300 household yield 276 three four generation pedigree 593 parent , 598 grandparent , 14 great-grandparents , 854 child . Disease information obtain medical record additional 400 grandparent . In 1988 additional 2,100 individual member 300 family survey . Medical record death certificate review evaluate coronary artery disease endpoint adults member pedigree . Clinical data collect included : history symptom coronary artery disease , arteriosclerosis obliterans , cerebrovascular disease surgery diseases ; smoking ; medication ; history genetic relationship . Measurements make cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL LDL cholesterol , apo A-I , apo A-II , apo E , apo C-III , apo C-II , apo B , apo Lp ( ) , LDL apo B , HDL apo E , DNA extraction . Lipid , lipoprotein , apolipoprotein phenotypes restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) measure candidate gene coronary artery disease . Genetic phenotype analysis conduct University Michigan . The RFLP apolipoprotein isotyping analysis conduct University Pittsburgh . RFLP analysis LDL receptor A-I gene analysis conduct Charing Cross Medical Center London , England . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
