	<brief_title>Effect Drug Therapy Reinfarction Risk Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Research heart disease 196Os 197Os primarily concern risk factor 'premature ' atherosclerosis , dramatically apparent work middle-aged men suffer heart attack die suddenly . This focus 'premature ' disease important initial step , result relative neglect study older adult woman . Coronary heart disease remain nonetheless major cause morbidity mortality among woman . Given consistent finding clinical trial calcium-channel blocker administer follow myocardial infarction decrease risk death reinfarction , drug class may actually increase risk , unlikely future trial therapy woman conduct . Yet calcium-channel blocker use increase frequency woman follow myocardial infarction . The ethical method conduct study safety drug woman observational study . Data study help guide clinical practice assist design appropriate secondary prevention trial woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : On-going study hormone-replacement therapy woman Group Health Cooperative Puget Sound ( GHC ) identify female enrollee suffer first heart attack since 1986 ; study expand inception cohort 1996 . Information medical record review GHC databases use ass risk factor co-morbid condition , entry cohort ten year follow-up , identify recurrent cardiovascular event death . A complete record prescription drug exposure follow-up period obtain subject GHC computerize pharmacy database . Although main hypothesis relate reinfarction risk woman , men study well facilitate comparison result observational study clinical trial . According conservative estimate available sample size , investigator 86 percent power detect relative risk 1.45 woman alone , 85 percent power detect relative risk 1.25 men woman combine , association calcium-channel blocker use fatal non-fatal reinfarction . The study also examine safety efficacy cardiovascular drug commonly use woman myocardial infarction , include angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor , lipid-lowering drug , estrogen replacement therapy .</detailed_description>
