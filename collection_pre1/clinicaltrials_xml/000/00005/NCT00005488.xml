	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Inherited factor play role pathogenesis myocardial infarction ( MI ) , grow interest identify common genetic susceptibility marker interact common environmental exposure contribute occurrence myocardial infarction ( MI ) population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study case-control design . The preliminary data address contribution common genetic environmental factor risk MI among woman 45 year age . Those data show common polymorphism gene cod two clot factor , coagulation Factor V coagulation Factor II , risk factor MI among cigarette smoker sample . These relationship , others observe , provide strong evidence gene-environment interaction thrombotic atherosclerotic factor early-onset MI . One intent determine whether risk early-onset MI related interaction environmental factor ( e.g. , cigarette smoking , exercise , alcohol consumption ) common polymorphisms gene cod thrombotic factor ( coagulation Factor V , coagulation Factor II , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , beta-fibrinogen ) atherosclerotic factor ( adhesion molecule E-selectin metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 ; lipid metabolism enzymes paraoxinase , lipoprotein lipase , cholesterol ester transfer protein ; apolipoproteins apolipoprotein E apolipoprotein B ) . Additionally , plan determine whether risk early-onset MI related interaction plasma lipoprotein ( ) level ( largely genetically determine ) environmental risk factor and/or polymorphisms candidate gene . Interactions among candidate polymorphism also assess . Newly-diagnosed case MI control interviewed person assess medical behavioral characteristic related MI risk . A venous blood sample obtain processed aliquot plasma white cell . DNA extract white cell test use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) , oligonucleotide ligation assay determine genotypes interest . Plasma test lipid , lipoprotein , homocysteine concentration . Analyses address overall association genotype MI risk , along posit gene-environment gene-gene interaction .</detailed_description>
