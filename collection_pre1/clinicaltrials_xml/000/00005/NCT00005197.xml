	<brief_title>Predictors Perioperative Cardiac Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Of 25 million patient undergo noncardiac surgery United States year , approximately three million risk coronary artery disease . Despite advance diagnosis therapy coronary artery disease , approximately 50,000 patient perioperative myocardial infarction , half 40,000 death surgery cause cardiac event . For perioperative myocardial infarction alone , health care cost exceed $ 500 million per year 1980s . Determining risk factor adverse postoperative cardiac outcome allow development preventive strategy efficient allocation health care resource . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Historical , clinical , laboratory , physiologic data subject collect hospitalization major elective noncardiac surgery general anesthesia six 24 month surgery . Myocardial ischemia assess continuous electrocardiographic monitoring , begin two day surgery continue two day . The study publish many finding title Study Perioperative Ischemia . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
