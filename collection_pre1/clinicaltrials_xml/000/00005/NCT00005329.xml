	<brief_title>Protein S Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Free protein S ( portion plasma protein S complex C4b binding protein ) cofactor anticoagulant effect activate protein C. Patients present acute myocardial infarction significantly reduce level free protein S. If major hypothesis prove correct , patient high risk myocardial infarction could identify could target future study examine specific intervention therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The blinded prospective study begin 1992 , although grant first award 1983 . The goal determine low level free protein S associate increased incidence myocardial infarction . Plasma sample obtain yearly 2,224 men age 50-59 year participant Second Northwick Park Heart Study sponsor British Medical Research Council Epidemiology Medical Care Unit . Clinical endpoint study document fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction . To prevent potential bias , laboratory blind clinical endpoint sample collect cause death study population adjudicate . ln addition free protein S , total protein S C4b bind protein measure . The study design permit assessment temporal relationship development low free protein S level occurrence myocardial infarction presence absence biologic gradient ( dose-response ) level free protein S frequency infarction . These two analysis important assess whether observe association causal whether low protein S occur consequence myocardial infarction . Three level free protein S define prior initiate study determine frequency myocardial infarction follow biologic gradient . The measurement potential marker risk laboratory , prothrombin fragment Fl+2 factor X activation peptide , permit comprehensive evaluation hemostatic risk factor myocardial infarction . A second study conduct woman examine protein S risk factor myocardial infarction . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
