	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease Trends 1980-91 -- A Gender Specific Perspective</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Pawtucket Heart Health Program community-based research demonstration project cardiovascular disease prevention town Pawtucket , Rhode Island non-intervention comparison town New Bedford , Massachusetts . The study initiate NHLBI August , 1980 . See also Study 1022 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There four major area analysis : 1 ) gender difference trend 1980 1991 total event rate , hospital discharge rate , in-hospital case-fatality hospital death coronary heart disease ( CHD ) stroke ; 2 ) gender specific analyse methodological issue may affect interpretation morbidity mortality surveillance data ; 3 ) gender difference presentation , diagnosis , treatment CHD stroke may influence morbidity mortality trend ; 4 ) gender difference association population trend risk factor morbidity mortality trend . The study conduct use morbidity mortality data collect Pawtucket Heart Health Program 1980 1993 , risk factor data obtain biennial cross-sectional household health survey conduct random sample resident two study community . Morbidity mortality data obtain accord standardized epidemiologic surveillance method . Hospitalized case coronary heart disease stroke identified hospital discharge record validate use standardize diagnostic algorithm base data abstract medical record . Out-of-hospital death identify death certificate data validate use algorithm base upon medical history data information concern circumstance death obtain informant interview . Gender specific trend age-adjusted age specific morbidity mortality compare . Trends rate estimate event classified accord ICD-9 discharge death certificate code contrast estimated case validate standardized diagnostic algorithm . Data regard circumstance death in-hospital treatment assess relation potential influence morbidity mortality trend . Absolute change time average annual percent change time evaluate use linear log-linear regression regression technique . Other analytic method include logistic regression analysis variance . Expected annual event rate men woman estimate risk factor data use equation base upon accelerated failure time Weibull model , impact risk factor mortality rate assess compare predict actual rate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
