	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In past several decade , relationship various lifestyle behavior development cardiovascular risk factor identify . Nutritional status/eating behavior physical activity pattern directly indirectly relate development coronary heart disease . For example , obesity , may result eat physical activity behavior , greatly increase risk hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , place individual great risk coronary heart disease . Dietary factor composition fatty acid cholesterol , composition vegetable protein complex carbohydrate , caloric excess high intake salt also relate development risk coronary heart disease . Physical activity adult also correlate coronary heart disease . Epidemiological research demonstrate increased physical activity associate reduce risk myocardial infarction . Regular physical exercise show beneficial effect relative weight obesity may act indirectly beneficially affect hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia glucose intolerance raise HDL cholesterol level . However , 1985 SCAN initiate , little information available concerning development nutritional status/eating behavior routine physical activity pattern child . Various psychosocial factor associate increase risk coronary heart disease . Among factor behavioral characteristic type A behavior cop style stressor . However , relatively little known 1985 concern development characteristic child characteristic become associated risk cardiovascular disease . SCAN initiate recommendation Preventive Cardiology Branch Task Force Group Five Year Forward Plan 1982-1987 , Conference School Health Education Research Heart , Lung , Blood Areas , Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute . A Request Applications release October 1984 . In 1985 , six grant award part Study Children 's Activity Nutrition ( SCAN ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There six project support SCAN program . They follow common protocol basically similar . Medical College Georgia : Five hundred one Black white child follow four year period food intake behavior , physical activity fitness , anthropometric measurement , blood lipid lipoprotein , heart rate blood pressure , psychologic characteristic associate coronary heart disease . West Virginia University : Two hundred eight predominantly white child adult follow since adolescence Bourbon County Study member cohort . Children participate cardiovascular fitness test , underwent blood pressure measurement , serum lipid determination . The effect television-viewing , child-rearing pattern , exercise , nutrition-related knowledge attitude assess four year period . Columbia University : Seven hundred ninety-four primarily Hispanic child parent follow four year determine extent diet physical activity predict coronary heart disease risk . Cross sectional longitudinal analysis perform . Georgetown University : Five hundred seventy Black child follow influence risk status old sibling day care versus home care nutrient intake physical activity . Eating event videotape , activity level record , measurement obtain height , weight , cholesterol , blood pressure , skinfold thickness . Dietary recall nutrition knowledge survey obtain . University Massachusetts : In Framingham Children 's Study , one hundred child direct descendent Framingham Heart Study participant follow four year . Measurements include height , weight , skinfold thickness , lipid profile , heart rate activity monitoring , assessment dietary intake four time per year . Memphis State University : Six hundred sixty-three child parent assess food intake , physical activity , parent-child interaction relate food intake exercise . Anthropometric cardiovascular data also collect every four month four year . Two study renew FY 1992 FY 1996 .
