	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The clinical trial literature surfactant clearly demonstrate surfactant therapy result improved early respiratory status improve mortality rate premature newborns infant suffer respiratory ailment due surfactant insufficiency . However , clinical trial experience regard efficacy ensure benefit would confer patient outside clinical trial environment routine medical care . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator already demonstrate epidemiological study publish New England Journal Medicine ( May 1994 ) morbidity , mortality , resource use among low birth weight inborn infant decline surfactant become available . This study broaden focus include infant exclude original study . The hypothesis study center investigator ' belief infant 1500 2500 gram weight group also experience reduced mortality , morbidity , resource use post-surfactant , mature severe respiratory disease , outborn i.e . transfer perinatal center . Finally , significant focus health care reform quality assurance clinical care investigator include hypothesis focus impact payer mortality , morbidity , resource use . The original study identify payer factor differentiate newborn regard measure outcome resource use . The investigator hypothesize would remain case . However , suspect might indication analysis among patient outborn HMO manage care influence birth occur , well fragile newborn clinical environment . All analysis use analytic datafiles National Perinatal Information Center 's Perinatal Center Database . A pre-and post-surfactant period create use eleven perinatal center provide data newborn 1985 1992 . Infants divide two group accord whether born surfactant introduce clinical practice . Regression model control race , sex , birthweight use assess morbidity , mortality , resource use . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
