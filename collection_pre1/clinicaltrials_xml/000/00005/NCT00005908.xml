	<brief_summary>This study assess usefulness technique call complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarray-an examination wide array gene identify disease-associated patterns-for measure tumor response chemotherapy breast cancer patient . The study look `` marker '' help select effective type chemotherapy . It also evaluate safety effectiveness new drug combination capecitabine docetaxel . Patients age 18 year old stage II III breast cancer whose tumor 2 centimeter large may eligible study . Those enrol treat surgery , standard chemotherapy use doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , capecitabine docetaxel combination . Patients physical examination , mammogram magnetic resonance image evaluate tumor begin treatment . They four 21-day treatment cycle docetaxel capecitabine , follow : docetaxel intravenously ( vein ) day 1 capecitabine pill ( mouth ) twice day day 2 15 . No drug give day 16 21 . This regimen repeat four time , tumor re-evaluated physical examination , mammogram , magnetic resonance imaging . Patients surgery remove cancer-either lumpectomy removal underarm lymph node ; mastectomy removal underarm lymph node ; modify radical mastectomy . After recovery , four cycle chemotherapy , time doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . Both drug give intravenously day 1 four 21-day cycle . Some patient mastectomy ( depend tumor characteristic whether tumor cell find lymph node ) lumpectomy also radiation therapy . Patients hormone receptor-positive tumor also receive tamoxifen treatment 5 year . In addition procedure , patient tumor biopsy ( removal small piece tumor tissue ) begin treatment , day 1 cycle 1 , cycle 2 , time surgery , physical examination , chest X-rays , bone scan , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , electrocardiogram , multi-gated acquisition scan-MUGA ( nuclear medicine test cardiac function ) echocardiograms heart function , mammogram blood test various time study . Patients follow National Institutes Health ( NIH ) 3 year diagnosis physical examination , blood test , X-rays , compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Although known whether treatment help individual patient 's cancer , possible benefit tumor shrinkage decrease risk disease recurrence . In addition , information gain genetic change chemotherapy help determine additional study use cDNA microarray measure tumor response warrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Chemotherapy With Docetaxel-Capecitabine Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial patient stage II stage III breast cancer test feasibility use cDNA microarray measure tumor 's biological response chemotherapeutic agent characterize cDNA expression pattern breast cancer primary chemotherapy . Thirty-six patient receive docetaxel/capecitabine induction chemotherapy follow surgery doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy ( TX/AC ) . We determine response rate TX induction therapy toxicities sequential combination ( TX/AC ) . We also obtain tumor tissue correlative biological determination .</detailed_description>
