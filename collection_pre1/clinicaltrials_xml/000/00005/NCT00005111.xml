	<brief_summary>This study determine rate sugar metabolism brain patient Fabry disease , genetic disease abnormal lipid metabolism . Compared healthy people , patient Fabry disease increase blood flow brain , may result abnormal brain metabolic activity . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compare brain sugar metabolism eight untreated patient , eight patient receive enzyme replacement therapy , eight healthy volunteer . Patients treat untreated Fabry disease normal volunteer may eligible study . Participants undergo follow two procedure : 1 . PET scan &lt; The patient lie PET scan machine . First , chest scan minute determine much radiation tissue chest absorb . A radioactive sugar call fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) inject catheter ( thin plastic tube place vein ) heart scan 45 minute measure amount FDG blood inside heart . The head scan 20 minute measure FDG brain . This measurement tell much sugar brain use energy . The procedure require insertion two three catheter . A special facemask may mold patient 's head help hold head still scan . 2 . MRI scan &lt; The patient lie table surround scanner ( metal cylinder ) 60 minute . A strong magnetic field radio wave use show image structural chemical change tissue . This study may provide information help explain abnormality Fabry disease effect treatment brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We find patient Fabry disease increase rest global cerebral blood flow compare healthy subject . This augmentation may result abnormal metabolic activity brain patient . The goal protocol study cerebral metabolic rate glucose ( rCMRGlu ) eight untreated patient Fabry disease , eight Fabry patient receive enzyme replacement therapy compare rCMRGlu eight healthy volunteer . In order minimize need arterial line shall image leave ventricle heart obtain ( 18 ) FDG time-activity curve need measure rCMRGlu . The method validate healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
