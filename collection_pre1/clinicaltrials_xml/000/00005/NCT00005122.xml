	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Evans County Studies initiate result request National Heart Institute late 1950 's develop epidemiological study area significant racial ethnic difference cardiovascular disease rate observe stable population available long-term follow-up . Evans County region United States know , time , high total death rate cause , coronary heart disease hypertension major contributor . At time , Black males female know four time less coronary heart disease white male , show sex difference coronary heart disease mortality , consume animal fat 50 percent hypertension . In 1960 , original Evans County Study cohort form 92 percent resident , Black white , age 40-74 year 50 percent sample resident age 15-39 year give complete physical examination variety laboratory test . The major purpose original study determine factor associate coronary related cardiovascular disease explain low frequency coronary heart disease Blacks . Of initial cohort 3,102 individual 1960 , approximately 2,500 re-examined 1967 1969 . Variables study included serum lipid level , blood pressure , blood clotting factor , catecholamine level , physical activity , social , psychological , economic factor . Necropsy data also collect . Follow-up continue remain cohort approximately 1,900 . Over year many additional study add . The Lipoprotein Phenotyping Study examine fraction fraction high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein relate increase risk coronary heart disease . The Black-White Neonatal Blood Pressure Study relate blood pressure level first year life subsequent development hypertension compare similar group geographical area Evans County group . The Contraceptive Steroids Blood Pressure Study , fund National Institute Child Health Human Development , related antecedent characteristic development hypertension thrombotic disease first time oral contraceptive user . The Evans County Health Department also participate Hypertension Detection Followup Program clinical trial continue surveillance cohort . Other study include : use define biracial pedigree cohort genetic model define possible inheritance hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary heart disease , thrombosis ; maintenance collection frozen serum food ; evaluate new test indicate difference intravascular coagulation racial social class group related physical activity , social mobility , dietary deficiency ; study possible relationship hypertension dietary sodium-potassium calcium selenium intake . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Follow-up original Evans County Study cohort achieve contact member annually mail , telephone , personal visit , weekly survey admission Evans Memorial Hospital Statesboro Hospital ; survey daily obituary local newspaper . In event death , autopsy report hospital record obtain . Twice year team consult neurologist cardiologist visit Evans County examine suspect survive case stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , angina pectoris . Home visit conduct patient visit medical facility . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
