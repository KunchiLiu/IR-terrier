	<brief_title>Family Study Congenital Cardiovascular Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congenital cardiovascular malformation major cause infant mortality United States . In 1985 , six defect -- hypoplastic left heart , tetralogy Fallot , truncus arteriosus , transposition great artery , endocardial cushion defect , ventricular septal defect -- among fifteen frequent cause premature death due congenital malformation , account 109,063 year life lose . This loss productive life continue spite major advance medical surgical treatment congenital cardiovascular malformation . Even successful treatment modality develop , survival reproductive year without improved understanding genetic risk produce additional unanswered question . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Clinical assessment case control include medical history , pedigree construction , complete evaluation pediatric cardiologist , two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography . First degree relative case control underwent clinical-echocardiographic evaluation also . The distribution cardiac defect pedigree within among proband group delineate . The frequency heart defect compare within among pedigrees case control . Regressive logistic model genetic determinant malformation test . The three participate clinical center include University Maryland Baltimore , Johns Hopkins Hospital , University Rochester Rochester , New York . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
