	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose autologous dendritic cell transfected autologous total tumor RNA patient stage III IV renal cell carcinoma . II . Assess toxicity feasibility treatment regimen patient . III . Evaluate regimen term cellular immune response , clinical response , overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo nephrectomy tumor RNA extraction follow leukapheresis collect peripheral blood mononuclear cell dendritic cell ( DC ) production . Patients receive autologous DC transfected autologous renal cell carcinoma RNA IV intradermally week 0 , 2 , 4 . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos DC IV maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18 patient accrue study 24 month .</detailed_description>
