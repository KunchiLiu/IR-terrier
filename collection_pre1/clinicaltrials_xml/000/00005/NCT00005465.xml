	<brief_title>Genetic Mapping Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : ALP phenotype B ( ALP-B ) , characterize predominance small , dense LDL particle determine gradient gel electrophoresis , associate increase risk myocardial infarction constellation atherogenic lipid apolipoprotein ( apo ) change . Based complex segregation analysis , ALP-B appear influence single major genetic locus dominant mode inheritance common allele frequency . This project design identify new gene involve susceptibility coronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator identify , collect constructed repository immortalize cell line lipid apo measurement member family informative ALP . They test gene implicate lipoprotein metabolism possible candidate ALP gene use highly informative DNA probe search genome linkage ALP gene . They also refine model inheritance ALP phenotype test genetic-environmental interaction . Forty informative family recruit repository . The family identify two source probands : former participant cholesterol-lowering diet study patient see lipid clinic University Washington . Each participate family member complete medical history questionnaire provide blood sample ALP phenotype determination , DNA study , lipid apo measurement . Linkage study LOD score analysis begin candidate gene approach , continue use DNA probe reveal restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLPs ) search genome linkage ALP gene . When linkage find , ALP genotype information use refine statistical model describe inheritance ALP phenotype , evaluate genetic-environmental interaction involve lipid apo level environmental behavioral factor .</detailed_description>
