	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory disease strongly relate exposure workplace . A considerable proportion adult onset asthma associate exposure . The importance occupational risk factor asthma underestimated , particularly among woman . The occupational asthma study ( ECRHS-OA ) form part wider international multicentre survey respiratory health ( European Community Respiratory Health Survey-ECRHS ) . The first phase ECRHS conduct 1991/92 examine risk factor asthma atopy subject age 20-44 year . The study update ( ECRHS-II ) , following-up approximately 17,000 young adult 12 country ( Australia , Belgium , France , Germany , Iceland , Italy , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , UK USA ) . The study provide valid precise estimate importance specific occupation , industry exposures relation asthma incidence prevalence , similar estimate respiratory symptom diseases also decline pulmonary function . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Longitudinal , community-based , multicenter study . Those subject take part first occupational asthma study survey re-contacted 1999 , determine risk factor incidence remission asthma , respiratory symptom , atopy , change bronchial responsiveness lung function . Subjects ask perform force spirometry , methacholine challenge provide blood sample IgE test . A questionnaire administrate trained interviewer deliver request information respiratory symptom disease , socio-demographic factor , tobacco smoking , complete occupational history since last survey , environmental exposure , family history , diet , treatment use health service . Modular occupational questionnaire develop subject employ cleaner , homemaker , welder , metal worker , nurse , subject expose organic dust paper textile industry . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
