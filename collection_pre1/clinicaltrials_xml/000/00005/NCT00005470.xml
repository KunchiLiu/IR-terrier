	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : African-American woman substantially high prevalence hypertension suffer great morbidity mortality due blood pressure elevation white-American woman . Much ethnic difference blood pressure due increase obesity African-American woman . In contrast , young African-American white-American girl similar level obesity blood pressure . The hemodynamic change occur develop obesity result ethnic difference blood pressure well characterize . Cross-sectional study adolescent show despite similar blood pressure level , African-Americans high total peripheral resistance white high cardiac output . Cross-sectional study adult show obesity associate elevation cardiac output . If obesity-related increase cardiac output superimpose underlying elevation total peripheral resistance African-American girl , hemodynamic factor could responsible develop ethnic divergence blood pressure see late adolescence African-American girl develop increase prevalence severity obesity . This investigation provide important new knowledge regard longitudinal change interrelationships among potential hemodynamic factor define association develop obesity blood pressure elevation . In clinical setting obesity difficult prevent treat , important understand mechanism obesity result elevate blood pressure . The result cohort study provide basis rational specific clinical strategy interrupt pathophysiologic process obesity lead hypertension place African-American woman particularly increase risk cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality . The NGHS initiate NHLBI 1985 contract-supported program determine Black-white difference development obesity 2,379 pubescent female due difference psychosocial , socioeconomic environmental factor . The study also seek determine whether difference development obesity lead Black-white difference coronary heart disease risk factor , blood pressure serum lipid . The study renew twice , last time investigator-initiated study . See National Growth Health Study complete write-up . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The ancillary study prospective cohort study 355 African-American 315 white-American female NHLBl Growth Health Study woman progress age 18-19 year age 21-22 year . The study include yearly measurement anthropometrics , blood pressure , echocardiographic determination cardiac output total peripheral resistance . In addition , factor may relate change cardiac output total peripheral resistance , circulate blood volume ( left ventricular end-diastolic volume ) , heart rate , leave ventricular contractility , whole blood viscosity , leave ventricular mass geometry measure . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
