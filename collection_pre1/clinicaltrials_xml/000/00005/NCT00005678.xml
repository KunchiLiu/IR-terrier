	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The MONICA Project undertaken World Health Organization ( WHO ) ten year international effort measure trend cardiovascular mortality coronary heart disease cerebrovascular disease morbidity ass extent trend related change know risk factor , daily living habit , major socioeconomic feature . Pilot study complete 1981 four country 1985 41 MONICA 's defined community 27 country . Each study site cover population around 300,000 person expect studied decade . The center measure incidence cardiovascular disease -- particularly coronary heart disease cerebrovascular disease -- assess extent trend related change know risk factor ( smoking , blood lipid , blood pressure , diet ) , daily living habit , health care , major socioeconomic factor study population . MONICA also expect introduce , country concern , new health statistical method would lead effective use national health information system . As Associate Member MONICA , NHLBI receive copy unclassified project documentation represent meeting MONICA Principal Investigators . However , central data analysis quality control evaluation available associate member . Under contract , NHLBI receive summary tabulation : population demographic vital statistic include number total death cardiovascular , coronary heart disease stroke death among resident Reporting Unit ; fatal non-fatal coronary stroke event ; ECG abnormality , chest pain symptom , cardiac enzyme measurement ; population survey prevalence rate distribution risk factor include limited blood pressure , total cholesterol , lipid lipoprotein , height , weight , cigarette consumption ; hospitalization medical care cardiovascular condition ; case fatality rate within 28 day onset heart attack , stroke , cardiovascular event . The NHLBI also receive report quality data performance site base circulation evaluation test case history .</detailed_description>
