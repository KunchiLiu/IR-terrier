	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project four-year randomize clinical trial show risk reduction lifestyle change lipid-lowering medication significantly reduce rate narrow minimum diameter coronary artery segment angiographically visible lesion 119 patient versus 127 control receive usual physician care . In collaboration trial , Dr. Ronald Krauss measure high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) subclasses gradient gel electrophoresis . HDL may divide two HDL2 three HDL3 subclass approximate estimated particle diameter : HDL3c ( 7.2-7.8 nm ) , HDL3b ( 7.8-8.2 nm ) , HDL3a ( 8.2- 8.8 nm ) , HDL2a ( 8.8-9.7 nm ) HDL2b ( 9.7-12.9 nm ) . The HDL- distribution also characterize diameter predominant peak , may lie either HDL3b HDL3a interval . Case control angiographic study suggest coronary heart disease risk increase HDL2b reduce relative HDL3c HDL3b . See also Study 27 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using data Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project ( SCRIP ) , follow specific question examine : 1 . Did risk reduction program change specific HDtL subclass compare control ? 2 . Did HDL gradient gel profile characterize men likely benefit multifactor risk reduction ? 3 . Did HDL-subclasses change significantly patient reduce fat intake , reduce body weight , take one follow medication : colestipol , nicotinic acid , clofibrate , probucol , gemfibrozil , fenofibrate , lovastatin , guar gum fish oil ? 4 . What cross-sectional association HDL-subclasses adiposity , fast post-load insulin glucose , diet medication baseline ? Preliminary analysis suggest : 1 ) During trial , men treatment group increase HDL2b ; 2 ) special intervention effective reduce coronary disease progression subject baseline predominant HDL-peak diameter median ; 3 ) HDL- subclass strongly influence diet adiposity drug trial ; 4 ) carbohydrate , alcohol caffeine associate specific subclass baseline . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
