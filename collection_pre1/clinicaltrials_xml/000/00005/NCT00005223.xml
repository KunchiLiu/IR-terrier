	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease lead cause death men woman 65 year age old , 1982 , estimate account 32.4 percent death age group may contribute death additional 12.1 percent . Coronary heart disease mortality rate increase steeply age , even 65 year age . Death rate male continue high female although sex ratio decline sharply age . Data Framingham suggest although incidence coronary heart disease rise age male female , incidence rate rise steeply elderly female compare elderly male . Despite magnitude problem , 1988 majority knowledge coronary heart disease risk factor related disease middle-aged person -- primarily male . More information need coronary heart disease risk factor elderly woman . Also , atherosclerotic process develop many year risk factor relate evolution atherosclerosis highly correlate within individual . Therefore , likely risk factor , lipoproteins apoproteins important determinant coronary heart disease old person primarily observe correlation within individual time , long-term association development progression atherosclerosis . In addition , identification high risk individual goal many epidemiologic investigation . It possible qualitative examination polymorphism apoproteins could fact assist identification woman high risk coronary heart disease need aggressive prophylaxis . These genetic marker represent second generation risk factor coronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study ancillary multicenter Study Osteoporotic Fractures ( SOF ) , prospective study risk factor hip wrist fracture support National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases . The cross-sectional study involve sample subject Pittsburgh Center . The distribution interrelationships lipoproteins apoproteins describe relationship age , year since menopause , type menopause , lifestyle factor physical activity , alcohol consumption , cigarette smoking , obesity , use estrogens/progestins . The frequency phenotypes polymorphisms apoprotein A-IV E examine determine whether phenotype associate specific pattern lipo- apoproteins . The hypothesis test degree lifestyle characteristic explain variability lipoprotein apoproteins depended genetic makeup individual . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
