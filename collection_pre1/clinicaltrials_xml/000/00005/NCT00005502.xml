	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death U.S . Despite encouraging decline age-adjusted coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality , prevalent CHD continue represent major health burden , particularly elderly population . Most community surveillance program , however , fully characterize problem restrict upper age limit 74 year thus include event occur increasingly grow part population . Observational study question existence change time prevalence anatomic coronary disease either post-mortem examination coronary angiography . This remain examined population-based setting . In addition , natural history myocardial infarction ( MI ) reperfusion area unknown ; particular , population-based data incidence post-MI heart failure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The record Olmsted County resident hospital discharge diagnosis MI 1979 1999 review , standard epidemiologic MI validation criterion apply ; post-MI outcome time determine , include post-MI heart failure , angina , 30 day case fatality long-term survival . In parallel analysis time trend CHD mortality , autopsy report review examine whether prevalence coronary disease autopsy change time . These study provide assessment clinical anatomical manifestation CHD , include outcome acute MI , time period characterize intensified primary prevention effort major change treatment acute CHD . The study renew July 2002 continue surveillance acute coronary heart disease event order address issue surround diagnostic precision risk stratification potential troponin high sensitivity C reactive protein ( CRP ) monitor secular trend severity treatment modality . Novel approach procurement carefully time blood sample allow direct measurement increase number case myocardial infarction use new biomarker , troponin . An examination make prognostic value quantitative peak troponin measure 24 36 hour high sensitivity C reactive protein measure early symptom onset myocardial infarction cohort .</detailed_description>
