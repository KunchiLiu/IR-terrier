	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness new drug combination treat patient severe aplastic anemia . Patients aplastic anemia produce blood cell , cause fatigue , easy bruise bleeding , susceptibility infection . In many case , low blood count result autoimmune process-that , patient 's immune system suppress production blood cell bone marrow . Although immune-suppressing drug , cyclosporine , restore normal cell count , many patient disease relapse . These patient require long-term therapy cyclosporine , cause harmful side effect . This study examine whether low dose cyclosporine give together mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) maintain blood count effectively full-dose cyclosporine treatment , whether MMF alone reduce chance future relapse . Patients 4 year age old severe aplastic anemia relapse immune suppress therapy may eligible study . Participants randomly assign receive either standard cyclosporine therapy experimental therapy cyclosporine MMF . Patients receive standard cyclosporine therapy receive full dose drug least 3 month . Those take cyclosporine MMF take MMF plus half-dose cyclosporine 3 month continue MMF additional 6 month . Both drug take twice day mouth . All patient 120 milliliter ( 4 ounce ) blood drawn begin study evaluate immune system activity bone marrow function , look genetic material certain virus . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy do begin study , 6 12 month . For test , area hip anesthetize special needle use draw bone marrow hipbone . The patient 's local doctor ask blood test chemistry , liver function cyclosporine level weekly first month every week . Patients return NIH evaluation 3 , 6 12 month treatment year . About 100 ml ( 7 tablespoon ) blood draw visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aplastic anemia characterize trilineage hematopoietic failure apparently empty bone marrow . While precise mechanism disease yet elucidate , much evidence indicate immunologically mediate pathophysiology . Clinical trial show approximately 75-80 % patient treat immunosuppressive drug , especially combination antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine ( CSA ) , demonstrate return hematopoieses improve blood count . This therapy consider standard care treatment aplastic anemia patient lack histocompatibility antigen-matched sibling donor also old patient regardless donor status . However , long length evaluation patient initial treatment , become increasingly clear substantial proportion suffer relapse pancytopenia . ATG CSA appear cure disease patient disrupt chronic autoimmune process . Recent data series patient treat ATG CSA , study European patient treat antilymphocyte globulin ( ALG ) CSA , indicate approximately 1/3 respond patient relapse require treatment within 1-2 year discontinuation CSA . About 15 % patient become dependent continued CSA administration order maintain blood count . Chronic CSA toxicity include increased susceptibility infection , hypertension , irreversible renal damage , well hypertrichosis , hyperaesthesias , gingival hyperplasia , headache , tremor , trouble complaint ; also possible increase risk late malignant disease . Therefore , major priority clinical research aplastic anemia development strategy produce durable response , well identify immunosuppressive agent use effectively few side affect cyclosporine . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) novel immunosuppressive drug proven efficacy treatment graft rejection renal transplantation . MMF different toxicity profile cyclosporine , specifically damage kidney . In study , randomize patient judge relapsed receive either standard treatment full dose cyclosporine half dose cyclosporine combine MMF . We anticipate combination cyclosporine MMF effective conventional high dose cyclosporine purpose treat relapse aplastic anemia would provide less toxic regimen long-term treatment disease .</detailed_description>
