Secondary aim include : 1 ) examine role several psychosocial variable maintenance , relapse , cessation process ; 2 ) describe examine longitudinal change follow smoking cessation ; 3 ) examine long-term ( beyond two year ) effect study 's intervention . The design study comprise two condition : 1 ) Control Condition ( N = 452 ) 2 ) Enhanced Treatment Condition ( N = 452 ) . two treatment condition common core seven-week cessation relapse prevention group program . Following group program , two condition differ format content treatment . Subjects Control Condition receive seven counselor-initiated phone call three month period . The content phone call represent effective component study vary depend whether subject smoke abstinent . Treatment Enhanced Condition tailor three group subject : smoker , abstainer , relapsers . Subjects smoke end core program receive three weekly group meeting follow three phone call , six monthly call . The content treatment base factor study find related failure quit ( negative affect , low motivation , low efficacy ) . Subjects abstinent end core program receive seven phone cell three month period six monthly call . The content treatment include efficacy motivation building exercise well continue contact six month Control condition . Follow-up data collect every three month 15 month beyond core cessation program . The hypothesis Enhanced Treatment , compare Control , would improve rate recycle failure quit , decrease relapse rate , increase sustain recycle follow relapse . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
