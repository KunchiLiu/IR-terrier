	<brief_title>Genetic Epidemiology Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism major national health problem , least 201,000 first lifetime case per year United States . Over 50,000 patient die within seven day , 20 percent , death rapid , insufficient time medical intervention . Recurrent VTE frequent also associate death well chronic impairment due venous stasis syndrome . Thus , identification high-risk patient target VTE prophylaxis treatment necessary improve survival prevent impairment . While clinical risk factor identify population risk , risk factor low predictive value individual patient . The high prevalence Factor V R506Q ( Leiden ) Prothrombin 20210G -- &gt; A mutation among VTE patient suggest hypothesis additional genetic abnormality coagulation ( thrombophilia ) associate substantial proportion VTE case . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study case-control design . Using stored DNA sample , investigator screen mutation within candidate gene Factor V R506Q ( Leiden ) Prothrombin 20210G -- &gt; A use either dideoxy , bi-directional dideoxy , restriction endonuclease fingerprinting , perform population-based case-control cohort study use previously identify 30-year VTE inception cohort . The specific aim : 1 ) screen genomic DNA patient VTE mutation within ( candidate ) gene encode prothrombin , thrombomodulin , tissue factor pathway inhibitor , tissue factor , factor VII , factor X , determine mutation predict change either protein expression structure ; 2 ) population-based case-control study , ) test hypothesis mutation associate VTE , estimate strength association , determine independence association control environmental risk factor coagulation abnormality , include interaction , b ) test hypothesis mutation associate death autopsy ; 3 ) estimate attributable risk VTE associate significant mutation , individually independently significant mutation collectively control environmental risk factor coagulation abnormality ; 4 ) population-based retrospective cohort study , estimate time-to-VTE recurrence test hypothesis significant mutation independent predictor VTE recurrence control environmental predictor coagulation abnormality , include interaction .</detailed_description>
