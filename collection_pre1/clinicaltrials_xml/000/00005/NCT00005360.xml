	<brief_title>HIV Diversity Pathogenesis Donor-Recipient Clusters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : Based anti-HIV-1 screen repository 200,000 blood donor serum collect late 1984 , Transfusion Safety Study identify enrol ongoing followup 133 seropositive donor 111 HIV-1-infected transfusion recipient . Included among 38 'transmission cluster ' compose donor one six link , infected recipient ( ) , , four case , infect recipient ' sexual partner . Frozen cell sera collect six-month interval six-year period member cluster available study . Specimens access sub-repositories cellular DNA , PCR-amplified HIV-1 sequence , viral isolates generate future investigation unique cluster . The study include analysis sequence diversity envelope ( env ) V3 , V4 , V5 hypervariable region within infect individual time , different member cluster different cluster . Sequence diversity profile PBMC serum analyze separately discern difference different blood component sample time . The pattern turnover specific sequence variant time ( evolution viral genotype ) correlate clinical immunological progression . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
