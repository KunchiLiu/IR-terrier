	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : With use antihypertensive medication increase steadily last 25 year , treatment hypertension common . Given high prevalence treatment hypertension , researcher longer assume participant epidemiologic study represent natural blood pressure measure , oppose treat blood pressure measure . The effect high prevalence treatment , however , fully investigate . Although might seem study `` natural history '' long relevant , great interest currently exist establish environmental genetic determinant blood pressure . Additionally , currently renew interest refine treatment guideline . For example , need account absolute well relative risk hotly debate recent year . The need continue exist , therefore , analyze observational data set meet evolve interest determinant blood pressure meet requirement refine risk estimate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To investigate effect blood pressure treatment analysis epidemiologic study , investigator conduct two interrelated analysis use simulation study data five observational study : The Framingham Heart Study ; NHANES I , II , III cohorts ; The International Collaborative Study Hypertension Blacks ( ICSHIB ) . They first conduct simulation study examine behavior different methodology two common analytic setting : relate body mass index level systolic blood pressure relate level systolic blood pressure coronary heart disease mortality . They plan use data five study derive parameter use simulation study . In study quantify level bias result ignore presence blood pressure treatment observational data . After conduct simulation study , repeat analysis relationship body mass index systolic blood pressure use available empirical data . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
