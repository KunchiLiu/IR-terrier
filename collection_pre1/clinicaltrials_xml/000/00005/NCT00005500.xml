	<brief_title>Collaborative Studies Genetics Asthma ( CSGA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma respiratory disease characterize variable airway obstruction , airways inflammation bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) . There recent increase asthma mortality prevalence US , especially African-Americans . Multiple study suggest genetic environmental factor important asthma susceptibility . The study recommend Pulmonary Diseases Advisory Committee February 1991 meeting give concept approval May 1991 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release October 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The CSGA compose five center ( Johns Hopkins University , University Chicago , University Maryland , University Minnesota , data coordinate center Wake Forest ) . At center , family ascertain two sibling asthma . All family member characterize spirometry , bronchial responsiveness methacholine reversibility test , skin-tests questionnaire data . The initial genome screen complete first 237 sib pair three racial group ( African-American , Caucasian Hispanic ) , genotyping remain family member family complete study renew 1997 . Therefore , initial aim CSGA map susceptibility region complete , detection several novel chromosomal region , replication several region previously link associate phenotype . In order determine importance region asthma susceptibility impact environmental rink factor , investigator l ) evaluate evidence linkage complete CSGA data use 2-point , multipoint multilocus approach asthma associate phenotype ( include BHR , total serum IgE skin test reactivity standardize allergen ) ; 2 ) perform fine mapping study region use additional genetic marker obtain &lt; 2 cM map ; 3 ) identify candidate gene novel sequence variant ; 4 ) characterize patient population asthma study identify variant respect asthma severity bronchial inflammation . These study allow identification asthma susceptibility gene variant , interaction gene environmental risk factor , well provide insight development improve treatment ultimate prevention asthma .</detailed_description>
