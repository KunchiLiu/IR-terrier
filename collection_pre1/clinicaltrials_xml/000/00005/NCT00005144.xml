	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1978 , select Review Panel biomedical behavioral scientist meet auspex NIH evaluate data link Type A behavior pattern coronary heart disease . Based scientific evidence available December , 1978 , member Panel issue report conclude Type A behavior pattern independent risk factor coronary heart disease , magnitude similar establish risk factor , cigarette smoking serum cholesterol . At time Panel meet , impressive evidence link Type A behavior pattern coronary heart disease prospective Western Collaborative Group Study ( WCGS ) , establish significant risk ratio Structured Interview-assessed Type A behavior pattern clinical manifestation coronary heart disease ; three angiographic study report significant association Structured Interview-defined Type A behavior pattern severity coronary artery disease . Supporting evidence provide prevalence study employ Jenkins Activity Survey ( JAS ) measure Type A behavior pattern , incidence prevalence data Framingham study , use six-item scale think assess aspect Type A behavior . Subsequent conference , study begin emerge call question robustness association Type A behavior pattern various manifestation coronary heart disease . The damaging prospective Type A study include MRFIT . In study , 3,110 men give Structured Interview Jenkins Activity Survey , follow average period seven year , receive annual medical examination . Analysis result end seven year reveal Type A behavior pattern , however assess , completely unrelated either coronary death document myocardial infarction . A major tool component score system Structured Interview determine many attribute comprise multidimensional Type A behavior pattern actually associate coronary heart disease . Component score demonstrated component consistent association coronary heart disease , even global Type A behavior pattern show relationship . Component analysis Type A behavior pattern MRFIT reveal attribute assess , Potential Hostility significantly relate incidence coronary heart disease . Several study conduct project . Tape-recorded Structured Interviews Western Collaborative Group Study reanalyzed ass relationship component Type A behavior incidence coronary heart disease . Rescoring complete Structured Interviews 1,000 subject undergone stress test blood pressure heart rate record . An analysis also conduct influence cigarette smoke situational stress cardiovascular response young male subject . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Study I , tape-recorded Structured Interviews MRFIT re-scored Potential Hostility . In Study II , Structured Interviews obtain new sample participant BLSA . In BLSA Structured Interview expand include question deal directly sample fully antagonistic self-descriptions , attitude , behavior . Alternative measure Agreeableness-Antagonism already available BLSA sample use validate score expand Structured Interview , biomedical information BLSA participant use test predictive utility Antagonistic Hostility risk factor coronary heart disease . Previous research score Potential Hostility Structured Interview examine Content , Intensity , Style well clinical judgement Total Potential Hostility . In present study , Antagonistic Hostility measure term Antagonistic Style Self-Descriptions . A total score define sum two component . Antagonistic Style score use 5-point scale rudeness , condescension , disagreeableness express toward interviewer . Matched unmatched logistic regression use evaluate Antagonistic Hostility risk factor morbidity mortality outcomes . Multivariate analysis use control standard risk factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
