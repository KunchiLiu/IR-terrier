	<brief_title>Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Venous Thrombosis - SCOR Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study , subproject within SCOR Thrombosis , help improve long-term clinical outcome patient proximal deep-vein thrombosis ( popliteal , femoral iliac vein thrombosis ) improve survival reduce morbidity recurrent thromboembolic event , help determine one specific biochemical measure , include antiphospholipid antibody activate factor VII , define subset patient increase risk recurrent venous thromboembolism . The study part SCOR Hemostatic Thrombotic Diseases , RFA release NHLBI April 1994 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Warfarin Trial A multicenter , randomize clinical trial conduct March 1996 January 2001 compare warfarin therapy three year warfarin therapy three month . The study perform thirteen participate hospital Oklahoma . The 600 hundred patient recruit , randomize either warfarin therapy three year warfarin therapy three month follow least three year . The primary outcome measure total mortality . Secondary outcome measure include vascular death , objectively document recurrent venous thromboembolism , bleed complication ( major minor ) . Additional specific aim include : determine prevalence antiphospholipid antibody , antithrombomodulin antibody , activate protein C resistance consecutive patient proximal-vein thrombosis ; determine measure , and/or level activate factor VII associate increase risk recurrent venous thromboembolic event , , whether event reduce continue long term warfarin treatment . These latter specific aim achieve perform laboratory parameter concurrently patient enter clinical trial , relate measure clinical outcome long-term follow-up . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
