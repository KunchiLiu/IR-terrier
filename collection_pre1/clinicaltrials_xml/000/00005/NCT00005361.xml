	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While natural history human lung function growth decline study intensively past 30 year , relatively data collect period peak volumetric function achieve , i.e. , around age 20 . As result , little known factor , demographic environmental , influence maximal attain lung function . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The longitudinal study collect information history respiratory illness , residential history , parental smoking , socio-economic status home characteristic via initial questionnaire administer cadet enrol West Point . A sequence four annual measurement lung function ( spirometry ) , prior-year respiratory health status activity pattern obtain spring year . Pollution exposures estimate match residential history historical pollution data store Environmental Protection Agency . Data meteorological variable ( temperature , relative humidity , wind speed ) altitude obtain residential location . The four annual lung function measurement provide precise estimate individual mean level FVC , FEV1 , FEF25-75 , PEFR , flow rate 50 percent 75 percent expire FVC . Subject-specific lung function level analyze relation history parental smoking prior exposure air pollution use analysis variance method , control potential confounding variable . In addition testing hypothesis regard respiratory effect passive smoke air pollution exposure , study also explore effect exposure change lung function age 18 22 respiratory illness symptom experience West Point . Finally , study establish cohort could follow future year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
