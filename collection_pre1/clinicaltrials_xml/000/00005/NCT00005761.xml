	<brief_summary>This study determine whether certain factor blood associate severity diabetic retinopathy . Patients age 10 year old diabetes mellitus diabetic retinopathy may eligible study . Those enrolled represent range diabetic retinopathy minimal severe . Participants undergo follow procedure : - medical history - thorough eye examination - photograph eye - blood test measure blood lipid ( cholesterol triglyceride ) serum creatinine ( kidney function ) - blood test measure level blood factor ( cell adhesion molecule , chemokines vascular endothelial growth factor ) may relate progression diabetic retinopathy - blood pressure measurement - urinalysis This study may lead good understand diabetic retinopathy develops progress .</brief_summary>
