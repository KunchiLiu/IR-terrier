	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : Airway responsiveness lung function , endpoint strong genetic basis , central obstructive airway disease ( asthma COPD ) . In contrast , dissection underlie gene require unique sample resource , accurate comprehensive phenotyping , efficient study design . To address three-pronged challenge , genomic screen bring together large , homogenous , mostly untreated sample Anhui , China , wealth expertise asthma phenotype , potent study design base extreme discordant sib pair . Since approach utilized extant asthmatic family population , support data collection require . The primary focus study two intermediate phenotype relate asthma COPD : airway responsiveness ( characterize increase responsiveness histamine methacholine nonspecific agonist measure slope dose response relationship ) force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . Since trait continuous , appropriate study design consider sibling extremely discordant phenotype . For many study , strategy feasible due thousand family must phenotyped identify sample sibling . The plan utilize organization well-established network China collect 150 extreme discordant sib pair intermediate phenotype . For airway responsiveness , estimate power sample , equivalent roughly 600 concordant sib pair , intend surpass power exist study , include U.S. Collaborative Study Genetics Asthma . Further , similar power , first study test linkage FEV1 . Moreover , augment power , potential phenotypic heterogeneity reduce stratify analysis total specific serum IgE level , skin test reactivity , peripheral blood eosinophilia , respiratory symptom , age , gender , bronchodilator response , cigarette smoking . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
