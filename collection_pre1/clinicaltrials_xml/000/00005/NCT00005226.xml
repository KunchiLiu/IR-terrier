	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The ARIC study large population-based , prospective , multicenter study support NHLBI begin 1986 , design investigate etiology natural history atherosclerosis cardiovascular risk factor . It involve investigation four cohort , 4,000 adult age 45 65 four different community . The study conduct surveillance hospitalize myocardial infarction , fatal cardiovascular disease , stroke cohort community drawn . Events classified Morbidity Mortality Classification Committee use standardized criterion . Data collect ARIC cohort baseline include : clinical history , physical examination include blood pressure , height , weight , anthropometry . A second history physical examination perform three year , annual telephone interview conduct intervening year . Laboratory study baseline three year include : electrocardiogram , pulmonary function test , ultrasonographic examination carotids one popliteal artery direct visualization atherosclerotic process peripheral large vessel , numerous blood study . Certain hemostatic lipid test perform 'cases ' ultrasonographically determine carotid atherosclerosis match normal 'controls . ' The ARIC clinical history collect dietary history use Willett Questionnaire , ask question regard fish consumption . However , specific question brief semi-quantitative . Direct measurement plasma fatty acid content ancillary study Minnesota cohort ARIC study give far objective information specific fatty acid consumption invaluable sort true role various fatty acid play prevention coronary heart disease . Furthermore , measurement plasma fatty acid Minnesota ARIC subject allow investigation relationship plasma fatty acid composition vast amount laboratory clinical outcome data ARIC study collect . Because clinical laboratory data ARIC participant already available computerize data base , tremendous amount valuable information derive plasma fatty acid relationship laboratory finding clinical outcome large , randomly select United States population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study ancillary ARIC study . A cross-sectional study examine association plasma fatty acid plasma lipid , hemostatic parameter , blood pressure . A nested case-control study examine association plasma fatty acid 75 Minnesota case carotid atherosclerosis versus 75 normal match control . A third study examine association plasma fatty acid incident clinical cardiovascular event , namely myocardial infarction stroke .</detailed_description>
