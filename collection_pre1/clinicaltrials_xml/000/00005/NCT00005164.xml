	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Blood Pressure Regulation Blacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic study demonstrate great prevalence essential hypertension Blacks disproportionately great hypertension relate mortality Blacks . Similar vascular consequence occur diabetes obesity . These three disease share common outcome , also overlap occurrence Blacks great prevalence rate three disorder . Insulin resistance document three disorder may contribute significantly vascular disease . This project originate response Request Applications Biobehavioral Factors Affecting Hypertension Blacks issue December 1982 . The original project support RFA three year . The first three year study focus hypothesis sodium load would augment cardiovascular response psychogenic stress Blacks high risk hypertension . The first phase study examine compare 80 Blacks white , 18-22 year age . The second phase involve additional 40 Black borderline hypertensive expose set study design examine possible interaction neurogenic renal control volume mechanism essential hypertension . The project renew regular research grant 1986 design investigated biobehavioral factor blood pressure control . In 1988 , study insulin resistance fund continued 1990 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects project consist Blacks enrol Collaborative Perinatal Project ( CPP ) birth study longitudinally adolescence young adulthood . Each subject bring study data blood pressure , growth , maturation birth late adolescence . Peripheral vascular structure study use measure forearm blood flow forearm vascular resistance . Measurements peripheral vascular structure compare data sodium sensitivity potassium sensitivity population . Insulin resistance study use euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique . Variations activity sodium-potassium pump sodium-hydrogen exchange red cell correlate insulin resistance determine hyperinsulinemia alters cation transport rate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
