	<brief_summary>The purpose study fourfold . It 1 ) determine dose interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) combination therapy give safely patient advance cancer ; 2 ) evaluate side effect treatment ; 3 ) examine body handle drug combination ; 4 ) determine whether therapy may cause immune system stop slow tumor growth . IL-2 approve drug treat melanoma kidney cancer . IL-12 experimental drug show anti-cancer activity animal , shrink tumor slow growth . Animal study suggest give together , drug may effective cancer either one singly . Patients 18 year age old advance solid-tumor cancer ( kidney , breast , lung , sarcoma others ) improve standard treatment may qualify study . Candidates physical examination , include blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) echocardiogram , DTH skin test ( test function immune system ) , chest X-ray lung function test determine eligibility . Bone marrow biopsy imaging procedure CT MRI scan may also require . Patients 50 year old also undergo exercise stress test . Treatment consist four course IL-2 IL-12 . On day one nine course , patient receive three dos ( one every 8 hour ) IL-2 intravenously ( vein ) . On day two , four , six , 10 , 12 14 , receive IL-12 intravenously . This followed recovery period day 15 35 . This regimen repeat another three cycle ; patient show benefit without severe side effect may continue additional cycle . Treatment first cycle administer hospital . If drug well tolerate , additional therapy may give outpatient basis . A biopsy ( removal small sample tumor tissue ) do begin study , complete first treatment cycle , possibly cancer slow , stop get bad , patient leaf study . These tumor sample examine evaluate effect treatment . Several blood sample also collect course treatment monitor immune system effect . A device call heparin lock may put place avoid multiple needle stick .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Renal cell cancer respond treatment variety antiangiogenic immunomodulatory drug . In RENCA model renal cell cancer combination IL-12 pulse IL-2 cure 88-100 % mouse establish tumor . The tumor regression observe model due antiangiogenic immunologic effect . Objective : To define maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity recombinant human IL-12 administer intravenously combination intermittent pulse recombinant human IL-2 adult various advance and/or refractory solid tumor . To evaluate pharmacokinetics intravenous rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2 administration adult various advance and/or refractory solid tumor . To provide preliminary assessment ability rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2 modify neovascularization gene expression local tumor site , induce measurable antitumor effect adult various advance and/or refractory solid tumor . To evaluate immunomodulatory activity combine systemic administration rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2 . Eligibility : Patients advance solid tumor proven effective therapy exist . Patients renal cell cancer require receive sunitinib sorefinib refuse option . The patient must normal organ function life expectancy least 12 Weeks . Normal pulmonary function ( documented PFTs ) , patient age 50 , normal stress thallium test . No prior treatment IL-12 . Design : Phase I dose escalation expansion cohort 10 patient treated maximum tolerate dose . Patients hospitalized treatment . IL-2 give intravenously every 8 hour day 1 follow intravenous administration IL-12 every day three dos day 2 , 4 , 6 . After two day rest schedule repeat . Cycles repeat every 36 day . Tumor response evaluate every treatment . Stable respond patient continue treatment evaluation every cycle treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Adult patient 18 year age old . Pathologically cytologicallyproven diagnosis nonhematologic malignancy , presence radiographically clinically evaluable disease . Patients solid tumor include renal , breast , lung carcinoma , well sarcomas proven effective therapy exist . Patients renal cell cancer receive sunitinib sorefinib refuse option . Patients must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy immunotherapy within four week entry onto protocol . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must free acute infection significant systemic illness . Negative serologic test hepatitis B require limit confound variable assessment potential hepatic toxicity combination . Negative serologic test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) require give uncertain impact rhIL12 and/or rhIL2 administration viral replication , potential alteration immune responsiveness among patient concurrently infect HIV . Adequate hepatic renal function evidence : Transaminases less 2.5 time upper limit normal ; Total serum bilirubin le 2.0 mg/dl ; Serum Cr le 2.0 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance great 60 ml/min/1.73M ( 2 ) . Adequate bone marrow function ( without growth factor support ) evidence : Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 1500 cells/mm ( 3 ) ; Platelets great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . For woman childbearing potential , negative urine pregnancy test within 14 day prior initiation study therapy require . For patient childbearing potential , contraceptive precaution must maintain study participation . Normal pulmonary function ( documented PFTs ) , patient age 50 , normal stress thallium test . Normal pulmonary function test define DLCO great 60 % predict FEVI great 70 % predict . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Criticallyill medically unstable patient . History presence brain metastasis . History coronary artery disease , angina myocardial infarction . Presence clinically significant pleural effusion . History malignant hyperthermia . Concurrent history autoimmune disease . History congenital acquire coagulation disorder . Patients history ongoing intermittent bowel obstruction . Women pregnant lactating exclude . Systemic corticosteroid , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , investigational agent within 4 week prior study entry . Patients receive following agent know immunomodulatory effect within 4 week prior study entry : GCSF/GMCSF , interferon interleukin , growth hormone , IVIG , retinoic acid . Patients history previous therapy rhIL12 exclude study participation . For patient renal cell carcinoma , history therapy rhIL2 exclude patient study participation . Patients concurrent administration investigational agent . Patients hematologic malignancy include leukemia lymphoma . History bone marrow stemcell transplantation . Intercurrent radiation therapy patient allow study opinion principal investigator ( ) use necessitated disease progression . For patient disease progression , radiation therapy administer clinically indicated patient withdrawn study participation .</criteria>
