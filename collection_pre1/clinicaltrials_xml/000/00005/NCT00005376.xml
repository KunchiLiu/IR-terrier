	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Effective perinatal treatment strategy past 20 year increase survival low birth weight infant . Accompanying increased survival 4-6 fold increase number child survive bronchopulmonary dysplasia , although birthweight specific incidence remain constant decline . Limited data currently available indicate individual BPD infant , childrearing adult , impair lung growth well fix reversible airway obstruction . The study part Institute-initiated program Collaborative Projects Women 's Health . The concept develop NHLBI staff give concept clearance February 1992 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release April 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study part four-grant collaborative project woman 's health . Based available data , Dr. Mary Ellen Wohl hypothesize bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) morbidity relate impaired lung growth first year life , improve adolescence accentuate female intrinsically small lung . To test hypothesis , measure lung size airway function teenager young adult , previously study school age , bear , 1 ) term , 2 ) prematurely , 3 ) develop respiratory distress syndrome newborn ( RDS ) 4 ) develop BPD . Children born 1987-89 previously study 10 month age novel lung function function method develop laboratory restudied school age . Techniques measure total respiratory system compliance resistance obtain force expiratory flow functional residual capacity apply cohort born premature infant 10-18 month age assess outcome current perinatal strategy . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
