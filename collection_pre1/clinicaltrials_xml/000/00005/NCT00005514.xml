	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : In first five year study analyse perform food consumption data collect semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire baseline follow-up Nurses Health Study Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohort . Dietary pattern derive food consumption data use factor analysis , cluster analysis , dietary index ( base prevail dietary recommendation ) . In addition , use exist datasets dietary validation study sub-samples two cohort , reproducibility validity dietary pattern define factor/cluster analysis dietary index evaluate . Further , use prospectively collect store blood NHS ( n-32,826 ) 1989-1990 HPFS ( n-18,000 ) 1993-1994 , investigator examine whether observed association dietary pattern CHD explain ( mediate ) plasma biochemical measurement ( include serum lipid , thrombotic factor , antioxidant , fast insulin , homocysteine level ) nest case-control design ; assess prospectively relationship dietary pattern biomarkers control sample . The study renew 2005 apply novel statistical method ( confirmatory factor analysis structural equation model ) validate various dietary pattern examine association risk type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease total mortality two large ongoing cohort study , Nurses ' Health Study ( n=121,700 ) Health Professionals ' Follow-up Study ( n=51,529 ) . In addition evaluate prevail dietary recommendation , study also examine role Mediterranean-type dietary pattern , Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) dietary pattern , Atkins-type diet predict health outcome . Using repeated measurement diet , study examine impact change eat pattern diet quality time subsequent risk diabetes , CVD , total mortality . In addition , examine relationship major dietary pattern novel plasma biomarkers inflammation endothelial function whether relationship mediate obesity . Finally , study test interaction dietary pattern individual single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) haplotypes several promise candidate gene inflammation endothelial dysfunction pathway risk coronary heart disease , include PPARa , PPARy , Adiponectin ( AdipoQ ) , PON1 , IL-6 , TNF-a , ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , E-Selectin , NOS3 , ACE gene , angiotensinogen ( ANG ) gene .</detailed_description>
