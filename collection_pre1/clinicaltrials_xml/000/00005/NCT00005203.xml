	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Low density lipoprotein cholesterol convincingly establish major coronary heart disease risk factor many epidemiologic study , clinical trial , experimental study . A strong inverse association exist high density lipoprotein cholesterol coronary heart disease . However , status low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) cholesterol plasma triglyceride level independent risk factor cardiovascular disease less clear . Case control study show positive association coronary heart disease plasma level apoprotein B , major protein LDL particle , inverse relationship apoprotein AI , primary protein constituent HDL particle . In fact , propose plasma level apoproteins may stronger risk factor lipid level . Thus , understand mechanism underlie variation lipoprotein apoprotein level among individual essential elucidate etiology coronary heart disease general population . Cardiovascular disease also know cluster family , may relate cluster lipid lipoprotein level among family member . A review suggest familial aggregation heart disease may primarily reflection familial aggregation know risk factor , include cholesterol level . The work Goldstein Brown familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrate genetic control lipoprotein metabolism play causative role development atherosclerosis . However , familial hypercholesterolemia relatively rare disorder : prevalence heterozygote estimate 1 500 , homozygotes 1 million . In 1987 , little understood common genetic contribution lipid lipoprotein abnormality lead familial aggregation coronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design cross-sectional family study . The recruitment screen probands conduct four-year period University Texas Dallas separate funding . The recruitment screen first-degree relative carry Berkeley . Blood sample obtain relative LDL subclass analysis lipid apoprotein determination . An interview conduct obtain demographic information information behavioral environmental risk factor smoke , exercise , diet . The data use determine whether LDL subclasses genetically control family hypercholesterolemia due overproduction LDL defective clearance LDL particle . Segregation analysis LDL subclasses two type family perform search single major genetic locus simultaneously test influence polygene environmental effect . The relationship LDL subclass phenotype characterize predominance small , dense LDL overproduction apoprotein B LDL clearance defect investigate family member . A determination make whether age-of-onset effect exist expression LDL subclass phenotype . Genetic-environmental interaction also study .</detailed_description>
