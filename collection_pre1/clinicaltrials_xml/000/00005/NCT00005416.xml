	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Little known track cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor risk related behavior , predict variable young child . Tracking important issue reflect extent disease process find among adult start childhood , whether behavioral social factor could use interrupt track . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Texas , physical risk factor data collect four annual clinic . Data childrens ' physical activity diet collect four time per year three year annual measurement clinic . Similar data , although different measurement technique , collect Georgia . For data analysis , specific longitudinal research question address whether physical risk factor ( blood pressure , lipid , lipoproteins body composition ) risk relate behavior ( diet physical activity ) track across annual assessment , whether variety behavioral social factor ( demographic characteristic family function ) affect track , whether relationship obtain among adults physical risk factor variable could find age child . The test relationship enhance availability multiple assessment blood pressure body composition point reliable assessment , multiple assessment diet physical activity within year . It enhance availability observational data physical activity diet , overcame limitation common self report approach measurement . Models develop data set cross validate . Procedures employ determine reason difference revise model produce maximal fit data set . The result analysis contribute well understanding age , factor , appropriate intervene mitigate CVD .</detailed_description>
