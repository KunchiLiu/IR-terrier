	<brief_title>Apolipoprotein Polymorphisms Risk Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Numerous epidemiological study show risk coronary heart disease strongly influence plasma lipid level , especially HDL LDL cholesterol , specific apolipoprotein constituent . Genetic study establish significant heritability lipid component , also identify relatively rare major gene result extreme lipid value increase risk coronary heart disease . Geneticists identified number segregate polymorphism four major apolipoprotein genomic region , use combination protein DNA assay . However , 1988 study initiate , relationship polymorphism risk coronary heart disease yet properly define . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study case-control design . Cases consecutively select pool eligible Latter Day Saints Hospital patient refer coronary angiogram . Eligibility criterion include reside Wasatch County Southern Idaho county , healthy time angiogram great 60 percent occlusion . Approximately 80-100 control retrospectively select clinic record past four year . Fasting lipid profile define case control term total cholesterol , total triglyceride , HDL level , LDL level , VLDL level , density gradient distribution HDL-LDL subfractions , level apo A-1 , apo B , apo E. The distribution genetic polymorphism four major apolipoprotein genomic region determine type case control isoforms apo E apo AIV wide variety DNA polymorphism . Approximately 800 first degree relatives case control also type DNA polymorphism . Data collect risk factor include smoking , alcohol use , obesity , physical activity , diet . Clinical data include medical family history cardiovascular disease medication status . Multivariate statistical analysis use define relative risk coronary disease associate segregate polymorphism , DNA haplotypes loci conjunction lipid profile risk factor . Analyses also conduct extent genetic segregation apolipoprotein genomic region influence distribution lipid profile whether distribution risk factor influence interaction environmental risk factor smoke genotype region .</detailed_description>
