	<brief_title>A Case Controlled Etiologic Study Sarcoidosis ( ACCESS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sarcoidosis systemic granulomatous disorder unknown etiology . While recognize distinct clinical entity century , information incidence , prevalence , risk factor , natural history United States remain quite limited . Data available occurrence United States indicate incidence range 1 10 per 100,000 prevalence 5 50 per 100,000 . Incidence appear high young adult , age 25 40 , high female male , much great African Americans ethnic group . Morbidity chronic disease well estimate mortality data . In 1981 , 10,000 discharge United States hospital sarcoidosis . Like mortality data , hospital discharge information probably substantially underestimate morbidity associate sarcoidosis typically manage outpatient basis . The Requests Proposals issue September , 1994 . Awards make June , 1995 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Each ten clinical center enrol patient sarcoidosis . Because population-based case-finding mechanism widely implement sarcoidosis , institution-based rather population-based design use . Participating institution locate geographic region disease know ethnic gender factor could address . Several investigator-initiated study carry . In addition etiology , ACCESS examine socioeconomic status clinical course patient sarcoidosis . Newly diagnose case sarcoidosis compare age , sex , race match control . Leads etiology sarcoidosis come diverse source : clinical laboratory investigation , alveolitis find precede granulomatous inflammation ; case control study , familial aggregation identify ; case report , recurrence granulomatous inflammation observe lung transplantation .</detailed_description>
