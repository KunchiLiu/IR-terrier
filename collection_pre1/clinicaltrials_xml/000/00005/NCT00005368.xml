	<brief_summary>To determine prospectively role elevate plasma triglyceride ( TG ) risk factor 20-year coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality familial combine hyperlipidemia ( FCHL ) familial hypertriglyceridemia ( FHTG ) , familial form hypertriglyceridemia . Also , perform genetic epidemiologic study recently identify lipoprotein risk factor CHD , include Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotypes ( ALP ) base subclasses low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , Lipoprotein ( ) ( Lp ( ) ) apolipoprotein ( apo ) B plasma level , apo E isoforms .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study provide valuable new data role triglyceride risk factor coronary heart disease genetic epidemiology lipoprotein risk factor , use exist sample family hypertriglyceridemia could study prospectively . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using sample 101 family identify studied Seattle early 1970s , study seek determine 20-year CHD mortality all-cause mortality increase sibling offspring probands family familial combine hyperlipidemia familial hypertriglyceridemia , compare group married-in spouse control . The study also seek determine elevate plasma triglyceride baseline predict 20-year CHD mortality family member . Based new blood sample family , inheritance LAP phenotype investigate , association elevate plasma Lp ( ) apo B level parental CHD mortality examine , association lipid level apo E isoforms investigate . A repository frozen white blood cell plasma aliquots future genetic study established.. These hypothesis address determine vital status 1009 family member 101 family , carefully classify cause death CHD decease family member , obtain new blood sample three generation family , include local non-local relative . New personal family history medical questionnaire also complete participant . The study renew FY 1997 June 30 , 2001 . The study three new specific aim : elucidate genetic basis small , dense , low-density lipoprotein , map chromosomal location ( ) gene ( ) influence phenotype use whole genome screen ; reveal common genetic influence ( pleiotropic effect ) combination interrelate lipoprotein risk factor ; evaluate familial CVD risk determine association CVD proband generation lipoprotein phenotype , include lipoprotein ( ) young offspring generation specific form familial hyperlipidemia .</detailed_description>
