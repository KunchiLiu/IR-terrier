	<brief_title>Epidemiology Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy ( Washington , DC Dilated Cardiomyopathy Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy often fatal cause heart failure young adult characterize dilatation ventricle , increase myocardial mass , impairment systolic function . Dilated cardiomyopathy common hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy , symptoms physical sign left-sided eventually right-sided heart failure . Histologic findings condition include nonspecific interstitial myocardial fibrosis myocyte hypertrophy . Despite large number systemic generalized disease process associate secondary dilate cardiomyopathy , majority case idiopathic . Mortality rate cardiomyopathy increase dramatically since 1970 , 1990 10,000 death annually attribute cardiomyopathy United States . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study prospective case-control design . Medical record possible case idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy discharge five Washington , D. C. acute care hospital two year period abstract standard diagnostic criterion could apply . Two neighborhood control identified case . Cases control match five year age interval , sex , telephone exchange . Cases contact annually two three year follow-up period determine vital status . The study determine whether report association idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy asthma could confirm possible role asthma medication , cigarette smoking , moderate alcohol consumption , diabetes mellitus etiology idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy . The role hypertension also studied.. Statistical analysis consist case-control comparison use conditional logistic regression technique , survival analysis use Kaplan-Meier curve proportional hazard model . The study also know Washington , D.C. Dilated Cardiomyopathy Study . Dr. Coughlin start research Georgetown University Washington , D.C. transfer Tulane University . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
