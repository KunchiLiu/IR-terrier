	<brief_title>Longitudinal Twin Study - Cohort Study Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Identifying individual young age risk future development hypertension adult life public health issue great importance . The imperfect nature blood pressure track throughout childhood adolescence , fact gene determine blood pressure childhood may one operate adulthood make clear improve predicting model need . The twin-parent study design allow test subtle genetic environmental hypothesis possible nuclear family twin alone . The longitudinal component permit analysis developmental change genetic expression hemodynamic determinant blood pressure . The inclusion unlike sex twin permit analysis consistency genetic environmental effect across sex . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The longitudinal comparison cardiovascular response adolescent twin parent initialed 1983 . Three cohort twin family enrol , cohort begin 18 month apart . Both monozygotic dizygotic twin include . Variables measure included demographic , family history , personality , blood pressure , anthropometry , stage puberty , dynamic exercise , isometric exercise , psychological stress , echocardiography , genotyping , lipid profile . Each cohort revisit every 18 month . A fourth cohort 330 preadolescent twin pair stratify sex zygosity recruit establish population-based twin registry . The hemodynamic determinant blood pressure assess non-invasive measurement cardiac function include echocardiography response isometric dynamic exercise . Zygosity determine questionnaire confirm dermatoglyphic analysis blood group test . Anthropometric hemodynamic measurement parent compare child . The study include five set longitudinal measurement , thereby permit evaluation whether different gene operate different age encompass pre-puberty , puberty , post-puberty .</detailed_description>
