	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect pamidronate drug decrease bone resorption ( breakdown ) osteogenesis imperfecta . This genetic disorder collagen , major protein bone . The abnormal collagen cause weak bone , child severe osteogenesis imperfecta sustain many fracture throughout life . They also growth deficiency , curvature spine , crumble teeth , hear loss , easy bruise heart lung problem . The study compare bone density , quality strength , final adult height , trunk height , functional ability child receive 1 ) pamidronate every 3 month , 2 ) pamidronate every 3 month + growth hormone injection , 3 ) pamidronate every 6 month , 4 ) pamidronate every 6 month + growth hormone injection . Children 2 year age old severe osteogenesis imperfecta ( type III IV ) may eligible study . Those enrol randomly assign group accord age ; child two four year age randomly assign receive pamidronate every 3 every 6 month . Children four year age old may participate growth hormone treatment group . These child continue growth hormone reach adult height fail grow much would expect someone growth hormone . Patients follow clinic every 3 month history , physical examination , X-rays , blood test , measurement ( weight , head circumference , bone length ) . Children receive 3 4 hour infusion pamidronate intravenous catheter ( thin flexible tube place vein ) day 3 day visit . ( Once insert , catheter leave place avoid multiple needle stick administer drug collect blood sample . ) Children take growth hormone give drug first treatment visit . At time , accompany parent instructed mix drug give injection . The child receive injection 6 day week ( Sunday ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteogenesis imperfecta inherit disorder connective tissue affect individual synthesize abnormal type I collagen . This result formation abnormal bone matrix predisposition bony fracture . Many unsuccessful attempt make increase bone mineral density individual hope improve strength bone result decreased fracture rate . Bisphosphonates synthetic analog pyrophosphate affinity hydroxyapatite . These drug act primarily osteoclast , impair development immature osteoclasts function mature osteoclast , well depress chemical signal adjacent cell , result shift balance deposition resorption bone . Conditions bisphosphonates use child include four broad category , 1 ) primary defect bone mineralization 2 ) bone matrix abnormalities 3 ) bone abnormality due systemic disease effect treatment systemic disease 4 ) significant soft tissue calcification bone abnormality . Pamidronate , aminobisphosphonate , potent inhibitor bone resorption . The purpose protocol evaluate effectiveness pamidronate child type III IV osteogenesis imperfecta cycle time vary . We plan compare child treat pamidronate every-three-month infusion cycle child treat every six month dose per infusion . We also plan continue compare child treat pamidronate growth hormone child treat pamidronate alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Children enrol study limit Sillence type III IV OI , determine clinical genetic criterion . Most child include study already enrol protocol Evaluation Intervention Ambulation , Growth , Basilar Invagination Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( 97CH0064 ) Growth Hormone Therapy Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( 92CH0034 ) . Screening candidate base telephone interview parent , referral record include : AP lateral radiograph low extremity spine , family , developmental , fracture medical history . An NIH clinical screening evaluation perform child appear history consistent OI protocol 04CH0077 , Screening Diagnosis Patients Connective Tissue Disorder . Patients admit screen visit less four year age well old 4 year age meeting criterion inclusion growth hormone protocol , protocol 92CH0034 , consider enrollment protocol 97CH0064 ( Evaluation Intervention Ambulation , Growth Basilar Invagination OI ) , old four year meet criterion consider coenrollment protocol 92CH0034 . The inclusion criterion protocol 92CH0034 follow : patient must clinical/biochemical diagnosis osteogenesis imperfecta type III IV , height less third percentile age , radiological evidence long bone epiphyses yet fuse . Patients exclude protocol 92CH0034 scoliosis great 40 degree unless scoliosis stable past two year , evidence severe basilar invagination . Patients previous exposure bisphosphonates outside trial consider participation trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability comply visit schedule , maintenance physical therapy program , ability administer comply GH injection central analysis outcome study . Failure comply condition constitute exclusion criterion . Pregnancy . Patients surgery place instrumentation spine ( i.e . result spine fusion ) .</criteria>
