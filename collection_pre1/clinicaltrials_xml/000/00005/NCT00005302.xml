	<brief_title>Drug Etiology Aplastic Anemia Related Dyscrasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It well establish drug play role etiology aplastic anemia , agranulocytosis , thrombocytopenic purpura . In 1985 , much evidence concern relation exposure drug risk three dyscrasia base case report . Such report could sometimes appropriate raise hypothesis , rarely serve establish association firmly . They could also subject selection bias due tendency publish report dyscrasia follow use drug already suspicion , could result spurious non-causal association . Moreover , since denominator population know , case report could never provide quantitative estimate association , either term magnitude incidence rate attributable specific exposures The sparse quantitative information exist variable quality methodological difficulty . And overall incidence rate , within order magnitude , could estimate three dyscrasia , virtually acceptably reliable information available incidence rate due specific drug . Even well know association aplastic anemia chloramphenicol , estimate incidence , give , imprecise . The list drug incriminate one time another etiology dyscrasia long pharmacopoeia . Based clinical evidence , however , pattern dyscrasia , overlap . Drugs commonly link aplastic anemia include chloramphenicol , phenylbutazone , oxyphenbutazone , sulfonamide , antithyroid drug ; , except chloramphenicol , also implicate etiology agranulocytosis , together phenothiazine derivative . The drug commonly link thrombocytopenia , also frequently link use quinidine . The exact listing drug relate disorder vary report , presumably , pattern drug use different population . One major concern 1985 new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug currently market United States . There numerous case report implicate drug etiology three dyscrasia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The design case-control study . All hospital least 100 bed geographically define area eastern Massachusetts Rhode Island enrol . All case aplastic anemia agranulocytosis identify prospectively purpose estimate incidence rate . A proportion case thrombocytopenic purpura identify incidence rate estimate . The eligibility case determine committee hematologist , accord strict diagnostic criterion . All identified case dyscrasias , suitable hospital control , , Massachusetts , neighbor control interview . Information obtain drug use , occupational chemical exposure , personal data , relevant medical history . The data use quantify known association three dyscrasia drug use , identify quantify previously unsuspected association , document absence association commonly use drug . Incidence rate aplastic anemia agranulocytosis attributable specific drug class drug estimate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
