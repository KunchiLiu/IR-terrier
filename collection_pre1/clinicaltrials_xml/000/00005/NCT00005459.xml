	<brief_title>Risk Coronary Heart Disease Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) low woman men . This attribute difference sex hormone , insulin sensitivity , environmental factor . Women Polycystic Ovary syndrome characteristic , include anovulation , hyperandrogenism insulin resistance , suggest male risk factor profile . The study test hypothesis woman PCOS great risk coronary heart disease non-PCOS woman . When study initiate 1991 , data available long-term followup woman PCOS . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1991 , investigator test hypothesis woman PCOS , comprise 5 percent female population , great risk coronary heart disease non-PCOS woman . They trace followed-up , via telephone interview , 244 woman PCOS 244 age-matched neighborhood control . They conduct cross-sectional study assess reproductive , hormonal coronary heart disease risk factor woman PCOS compare control . Evaluation consist office visit determine total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , fast two hour glucose insulin , blood pressure , lifetime cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , reproductive history , lifetime medication usage , family history PCOS , serum hormone concentration . At evaluation , physician diagnosis PCOS history , physical exam , hormone study make . In addition , information number pregnancy , number live birth , menstrual history , history surgical natural menopause obtain . Women evidence thyroid , adrenal pituitary disease exclude . The grant renew 1996 determine whether woman PCOS evidence increase prevalence rate subclinical atherosclerosis . Within PCOS population investigator perform five study determine risk factor subclinical atherosclerosis . First , evaluate relationship PCOS subclinical atherosclerosis measure carotid ultrasound . In study , determine whether woman , thirty year age old PCOS , high prevalence subclinical atherosclerosis age-matched control woman . Second , evaluate relationship PCOS subclinical vascular disease measure brachial artery flow mediate vasodilation . They determine whether PCOS case lower brachial artery flow mediate vasodilation control , whether distribution flow mediate vasodilation relate extent carotid artery wall thickness plaque . Third , evaluate whether subclinical atherosclerosis vascular disease relate follow cardiovascular risk factor within PCOS case control : HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , insulin , systolic diastolic blood pressure testosterone , waist-to-hip ratio body mass index ( BMI ) . Fourth , assess difference body composition PCOS case control woman , include intra-abdominal fat measure compute tomography ( CT ) abdomen sagittal diameter , percent body fat measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) . They evaluate relationship subclinical atherosclerosis body composition separately case control . Previous study clearly show PCOS woman different obese non-PCOS woman . Moreover , insulin , testosterone coronary heart disease risk factor also correlate measure use pair t-tests . Multiple regression use test whether PCOS case compare control increase intra-abdominal fat independent important confounders . Fifth , compare plasma level select coagulation factor include fibrinogen factor VII fibrinolytic factor PCOS case control . The study renew September 2000 August 2004 continue follow-up .</detailed_description>
