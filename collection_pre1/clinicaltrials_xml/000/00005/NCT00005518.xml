	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The major hypothesis study suppression immunoregulatory cytokine prevent factor VIII inhibitor formation hemophilia A murine model : successful , treatment protocol could develop individual identify high risk inhibitor formation . Through approach epidemiology immunology inhibitor formation , health care individual hemophilia may improve . The study response Request Applications release 1998 Immunogenetics Inhibitor Formation Hemophilia . . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A case-control study conduct compare prevalent hemophilia patient inhibitor identify HMS Study three age-matched control without inhibitor determine clinical laboratory characteristic associate inhibitor development . A histocompatibility study conduct identify pattern HLA Class II antigens molecular type hemophilic subject identify HMS , without inhibitor , may link inhibitor formation . An animal tolerance study conduct hemophilia A murine model , evaluate blockade T cell costimulatory pathways CTLA4-Ig anti-CD40L mAb , prevent inhibitor formation . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
