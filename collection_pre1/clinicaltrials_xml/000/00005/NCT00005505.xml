	<brief_summary>To investigate contribution neighborhood environment distribution cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk across different age range racial/ethnic group , use data three ongoing cohort study cardiovascular disease : Coronary Artery Disease Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) Study , Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) Study , Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There abundant evidence persistent difference cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality socioeconomic status ( SES ) . The determinant SES-related difference CVD outcomes risk factor fully establish . Previous work area focus predominantly individual-level SES indicator , recently attention shift role neighborhood community-level variable shape health outcome , independently individual-level SES . Several epidemiologic study suggest neighborhood characteristic may influence distribution disease risk , role neighborhood-level individual level SES variables shape individual-level outcome risk factor rarely address epidemiologic study CVD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Associations neighborhood socioenvironmental characteristic CVD prevalence incidence middle-aged elderly population investigate use data ARIC Study CHS . Associations neighborhood socioenvironmental characteristic CVD risk factor risk factor trend young middle-aged adult investigate use data CARDIA ARIC study . CARDIA ARIC data also use explore contribution neighborhood characteristic racial difference CVD risk factor . Census define area use proxy neighborhood . Participants link census-tract block-group residence use home address , neighborhood characteristic obtained 1990 U.S. Census . The three data set analyze separately . After exploratory descriptive analysis , regression model use investigate association neighborhood characteristic outcome control individual-level SES relevant covariates . Appropriate statistical method ( mixed effect model ) use account multilevel structure data ( individual nest within neighborhood repeat measure nest within individual ) , potential violation assumption independence observation might arise . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
