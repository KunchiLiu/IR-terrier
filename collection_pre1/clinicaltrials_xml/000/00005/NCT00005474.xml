	<brief_title>Markers Mechanisms Macrovascular Disease IDDM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Macrovascular disease lead cause death due IDDM . Risk marker identify non-diabetic population , may apply IDDM . The theme program project hyperglycemia interacts specific factor augment vascular risk establish novel mechanisms atherogenesis . Patients study originally participate DCCT , recently conclude NIKKD clinical trial demonstrate dramatic reduction microvascular complication intensive glucose control . The DCCT , conduct 1983 1993 1,441 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus subject 209 medical center , show keep blood sugar level close normal possible slows onset progression eye , kidney , nerve disease cause diabetes . The study part initiative , The Etiology Excess Cardiovascular Disease Diabetes Mellitus , release December 1995 . The initiative originate discussion NHLBI Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International ( JDFI ) , voluntary organization support research diabetes . Both agree combination advance understand etiology diabetes cardiovascular disease make oppportune time stimulate research understand reason excessive macrovascular complication associate diabetes . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In program project grant , three five subprojects epidemiological study . In first subproject , Glycoxidation Macrovascular Disease Diabetes , Timothy J. Lyons , subproject principal investigator , investigate mechanism underlie accelerated atherosclerosis diabetes , specifically , modification lipid , protein , carbohydrate interrelate oxidation glycation ( glycoxidation ) . The cross-sectional longitudinal study use approximately 900 Type 1 diabetic patient Epidemiology Diabetes Intervention Complications Study ( EDIC ) , multicenter study follow patient Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) , support National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) . Cross-sectional study perform detailed analysis potentially atherogenic low density lipoproteins triglyceride-rich lipoprotein patient without microalbuminuria macrovascular disease . In small cohort patient , categorize prone resistant macrovascular disease , level glycation oxidation product determine insoluble skin collagen , long-lived protein modification may reflect integrated glycoxidation many year . In longitudinal arm study , characterization lipoprotein select patient repeat selected patient progress either microalbuminuria macrovascular disease . By combine cross-sectional longitudinal information , investigator hope identify new marker identify diabetic patient particular risk disease progression . In Subproject 4 , The Role Thrombosis Macrovascular Disease IDDM , John Colwell subproject principal investigator , investigate abnormality hemostasis contributor excess cardiovascular morbidity mortality associate diabetes mellitus . Each 200 EDIC patient enrol study non-diabetic , control subject assess endogenous fibrinolysis evaluate prothrombin activation fragment F1+2 index thrombin generation fibrinogen hematocrit basic hemorheologic parameter . The study conduct cross-sectionally total EDIC cohort , longitudinally select EDIC patient whose diabetes either progress progressed microalbuminuria macrovascular disease . Hemostasis parameter correlate metabolic characteristic measure program project grant PAI-1 fibrinogen gene polymorphism . In Subproject 5 , Metabolic Genetic Factors IDDM Vascular Disease , W. Timothy Garvey subproject principal investigator , investigate whether metabolic genetic factor associate development macrovascular disease albuminuria approximately 60 IDDM patient . The investigator develop concept , base publish pre-data , patient upper body fat distribution become diabetic exhibit primary abnormality fatty acid metabolism secondarily exacerbate insulin resistance via alteration fatty acid composition skeletal muscle membrane , vascular reactivity via functional structural change vessel wall , consequently vascular disease risk . They test hypothesis , patient vascular complication , poor glycemic control alters circulate free fatty acid fatty acid composition muscle membrane enhance vascular reactivity induce insulin resistance . They perform hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp three IDDM subgroup ( without complication , albuminuria , macrovascular disease ) condition poor glycemic control intensive therapy asses glycemia-dependent independent component insulin resistance . They also test hypothesis insulin resistance candidate gene polymorphism determine part IDDM patient develop macrovascular disease albuminuria . They assess candidate gene polymorphism DCCT patient , test linkage/association macro- microvascular disease outcome , well abnormality encode protein . The study renew FY 2001 schedule end 2006 .</detailed_description>
