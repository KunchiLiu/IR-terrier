	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine trastuzumab combination chemotherapy treat patient locally recurrent metastatic urinary tract cancer . Monoclonal antibody trastuzumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity combination Herceptin , paclitaxel , carboplatin , gemcitabine patient metastatic locally recurrent urothelial cancer overexpress HER2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The complete partial response rate . II . The median overall survival . III . To prospectively evaluate percentage patient metastatic/recurrent bladder cancer overexpress HER2 histologically ( immunohistochemistry FISH ) serologically . IV . To generate preliminary data response therapy survival Her2 negative patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ; paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 15 minute day 1 ; gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 3 week . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 3 course past CR . Patients achieve partial response stable disease continue therapy CR disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow disease progression survival . Patients HER2-negative disease eligible treatment follow every 6 month response survival .</detailed_description>
