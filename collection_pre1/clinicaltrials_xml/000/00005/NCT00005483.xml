	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hyperhomocysteinemia , condition elevate plasma homocysteine concentration result impaired sulfur amino acid metabolism , may powerful risk factor occlusive vascular disease . However , little known distribution hyperhomocysteinemia general population . Furthermore , inadequate nutritional status might strong determinant hyperhomocysteinemia , importance population level ( measure prevalence hyperhomocysteinemia associate inadequate nutrition ) receive little study . Finally , level homocysteine associate elevated risk vascular disease clearly establish . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using previously collect plasma sample , study conduct distribution homocysteine prevalence hyperhomocysteinemia emphasis race , sex age . Investigations undertaken extent relationship hyperhomocysteinemia folate vitamin B12 . Finally , relationships describe prevalence hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence cardiovascular disease importance risk factor cause vascular disease among US adult assessed..</detailed_description>
