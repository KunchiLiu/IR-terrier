	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prospective epidemiologic data indicate strong relationship chronic anxiety and/or anxiety disorder risk sudden cardiac death . Other study show cardiac autonomic mechanism alter among stably anxious individual direction reduce parasympathetic elevate sympathetic control . The latter investigation , however , base small clinic sample incomplete assessment cardiovascular regulation anxiety . This investigation first large-scale population-based research examine cardiovascular physiology anxiety , help increase understand report association anxiety sudden cardiac death . This study also help identify group general population increase risk sudden death . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use ongoing well-characterized cohort , VA Normative Aging Study ( NAS ) , recruit middle-aged old community-dwelling men woman study . Using variety validate psychological psychiatric screening instrument -- include Brief Symptom Inventory , Composite International Diagnostic Interview , Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , Crown-Crisp Index -- study population characterize term symptom anxiety diagnosis anxiety disorder . Cardiovascular autonomic control assess among anxious non-anxious individual use non-invasive time-domain power-spectral measure heart rate blood pressure variability . Cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , end-tidal pCO2 simultaneously assess . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
