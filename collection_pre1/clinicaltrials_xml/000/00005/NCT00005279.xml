	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Tucson Epidemiology Study Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases support Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) mechanism since 1971 . The SCOR mechanism institute advance basic knowledge generate effective technique method clinical management prevention . In 1970 , chronic obstructive lung disease ( COLD ) bronchitis , emphysema , asthma tenth lead cause death United States . At time United States mortality emphysema increase rate 20-25 percent per year . In 1969 death rate COLD whole 15.6 per 100,000 rate consider one-half death COLD either underlie important contributory cause . By 1986 COLD risen fifth lead cause death United States death rate 31.3 per 100,000 . By 1972 many prevalence survey conduct United States abroad specific subgroup population . At time , longitudinal study limit scope examination conduct , dealt restrict age group , conduct study familial concordance disease . The Tucson study design include wide age span , family unit , variety feature relate reversible irreversible obstructive lung disease . Studies provide evidence relate acute low respiratory tract illnesses first year life development chronic lung disease later life . Epidemiologic study demonstrate geographic area high morbidity mortality rate due chronic obstructive lung disease among adult also likely show high incidence respiratory illness among child . A number risk factor may associate low respiratory tract illness child . Some study suggest familial genetic factor may predispose certain child respiratory disorder early life . Family size , viral bacterial infection , allergic reaction , air pollution , gas stove , formaldehyde , passive smoking implicate . Research need interrelationships potential risk factor low respiratory tract infection produce chronic respiratory disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Tucson Study Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases longitudinal design . By 1986 , nine survey complete 70 percent population survey baseline 1972 . Data collect survey include basic standardized questionnaire maximum expiratory flow volume ( MEFV ) curve use pneumotachograph equipment . Additional questionnaire include smoking , medical occupational history , socio-economic characteristic , height weight measurement . Blood sampled study alpha-1-antitrypsin level . Several survey include allergy skin testing , blood pressure , anthropometric measurement . Studies 504 out-migrants continue since 1982 . Twelve survey plan insure follow-up least 15 year adults . Funding represent approximately 26 percent dollar Specialized Center Research Chronic Diseases Airways ( P5OHL14136 ) use support Tucson Study . Childrens ' Respiratory Study Tucson also longitudinal design assess role infectious , physiologic , immunologic , allergic , genetic , environmental , familial factor development acute chronic lower respiratory tract illnesses childhood . Enrollment study population family occur May 1980 October 1984 . Healthy infant enrol within day birth , time baseline data collect . Cord 9-month blood evaluate number immunologic test . In first month life , prior low respiratory tract illness , subset population underwent pulmonary function test . During low respiratory tract illness , specimen obtain viral , chlamydial , mycoplasma culture test . Environmental factor evaluate included passive smoking , number sibling , overcrowd , air pollution . Data collection continue child family member year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
