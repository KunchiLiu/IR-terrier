	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Lipid Research Clinics program create 1971 . The objective evaluate current technique diagnosis hyperlipoproteinemia ; acquire data across age group prevalence different type hyperlipoproteinemia , particularly genetically determine form ; collect high quality data prevalence incidence atherosclerosis different pattern hyperlipoproteinemia ; improve method detection , diagnosis , medical care coronary heart disease . The program consist Population Studies Coronary Primary Prevention Trial . The coronary primary prevention trial describe Clinical Trials database . As result establishment U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Program Cardiovascular Diseases 1972 , lipid research clinic establish Moscow Leningrad 1974 . The U.S.S.R. component collaborative research consist two Prevalence Studies Follow-up Study , closely follow U.S. Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study protocol . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Prevalence Study : The Prevalence Study initiate 1972 determine prevalence different type dyslipoproteinemias ten North American Lipid Research Clinics . The Prevalence Study consist two screen designate Visit 1 Visit 2 , conduct accord standardize protocol well-defined target population . Data collection begin 1972 end 1976 . The median time two screen 96 day . The objective Visit 1 : provide estimate prevalence dyslipidemia specify population ; investigate distribution cholesterol triglyceride ; select participant Visit 2 . A total 60,502 eligible participant screen visit 1 . A 15 percent random sample ( N=9,107 ) Visit 1 participant elevated lipid ( N=6,882 ) take lipid-altering medication ( N=346 ) ask return Lipid Research Clinics Population Studies Visit 2 screen . The three group 16,335 participant represent approximately 25 percent subject screen Visit 1 . The objective Visit 2 : identify participant primary secondary dyslipoproteinemia ; determine prevalence lipid lipoprotein pattern association coronary heart disease , vascular disease , risk factor coronary heart disease ; determine relationship lipid lipoprotein pattern select nutritional , physiologic , sociodemographic variable education occupation head household , smoking , blood pressure , height , weight , triceps skinfold , Quetelet index , sex hormone usage female . Visit 2 procedure include interview , physical examination , ECG , clinical chemistry , one-day dietary recall . Family Study : The Family Study provide data relationship familial genetic attribute plasma lipid lipoprotein . A sample participant Visit 2 Prevalence Study choose participate probands . Basic demographic information collect plasma lipid lipoprotein measure first-degree relative probands . The Family Study initiate 1975 data collection complete 1978 . Follow-Up Study : The Follow-up Study , initiated 1977 , design relate baseline observation make 1972-1976 total cause-specific mortality . The study assess risk factor status plasma triglyceride , HDL cholesterol exercise electrocardiography cardiovascular disease mortality general , coronary heart disease particular . Follow-up baseline measurement include lipid clinical chemistry , one-day dietary recall , medication history physical examination . Assessments also make relationship estrogen use woman subsequent cardiovascular disease , coronary heart disease , cancer mortality relationship lipids lipoprotein level site-specific cancer , well relationship retinol level cancer mortality .</detailed_description>
