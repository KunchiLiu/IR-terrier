	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Rochester Family Heart Study initiate 1983 study genetic basis familial aggregation apolipoprotein A-I hypertension Rochester , Minnesota . Recruitment begin 1985 result data 2,259 individual 300 three generation pedigree . The study support R01HL24489 . Lipid level play central role determine predisposition coronary heart disease . In Western industrialize society diseases heart rank number one cause morbidity mortality adult population . Thirty percent death United States 1982 attributable coronary heart disease . Epidemiological study total community include Framingham , Massachusetts Tecumseh , Michigan establish long list factor predict increase risk coronary heart disease . Those implicated include male gender , age , positive family history , sedentary life style , diabetes , high blood pressure , cigarette smoking , overweight abnormal plasma level lipids lipoprotein . Although great variation among individual risk factor associate development coronary heart disease , disease typically involve infiltration cholesterol intimal wall artery begin early life . It hypothesize individual inherits experience array risk factor determine susceptibility disease process progress phase injury vascular wall , infiltration lipid , accumulation cholesterol ester , proliferation cell , stenosis finally occlusion lead coronary heart disease outcome . Lipid metabolism play central role determine progression process . A role elevate lipid etiology coronary heart disease support Lipid Research Clinics trial cholestyramine establish 20 percent reduction plasma low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particular , result 19 percent reduction coronary heart disease seven year high risk male . Most study date focus environmental factor associate variability risk factor . Biometrical study estimate role gene determine interindividual variability lipid lipoprotein phenotype compare contrasting level relate unrelated individual live together apart . With advent new technique measure variability gene product DNA level , possible expand study role gene lipid metabolism coronary heart disease . Knowledge genetic epidemiology coronary heart disease provide valuable tool clinical screen diagnosis make possible develop rational strategy intervene . Not individual respond way lipid-lowering strategy . By know gene involve regulate metabolic factor alter coronary heart disease able sort individual respond specific treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1987 use blood sample data RFHS , variation DNA level determine use restriction fragment length polymorphisms protein level isoelectric focusing . The relationship define population among apolipoproteins , cholesterol , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein cholesterol phenotype estimate do effect age , sex , smoking , drug use , obesity relationship . Estimates determine fraction interindividual variation apos attributable gene locus cod molecule . Estimates also determine fraction interindividual variation cholesterol , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein cholesterol attributable gene locus cod apos LDL receptor . A determination also make whether genotypic variation gene loci cod apo LDL-receptor contribute prediction coronary heart disease beyond provide effect gene loci interindividual variation apos , cholesterol , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein cholesterol . Radioimmunoassay medical information collection take place Mayo Clinic . DNA probe , DNA study special family , definition new restriction fragment length polymorphism take place Charing Cross Hospital London , England . RFLP type gene cod apolipoproteins LDL receptor electrophoretic type know apo E AIV protein polymorphism take place University Pittsburgh . The genetic architecture responsible phenotypic variability population large define University Michigan Washington University , St. Louis . The study renew 1992 carry six aim 1 ) provide new information four polymorphic gene involve reverse cholesterol transport ; 2 ) complete investigator ' study evaluate utility genetic variation 12 candidate gene prediction coronary artery disease ; 3 ) identify individual carry mutation impact coronary artery disease ; 4 ) begin molecular study individual define DNA change responsible . New noninvasive measure coronary artery disease asymptomatic individual use ultrafast cardiac compute tomography complement effort evaluate role measure genetic variation predict coronary artery disease . The study renew 1997 five specific aim . Aims 1 2 identified genomic region contain new coronary artery disease susceptibility gene , use 234 tandem repeat marker loci 10 centimorgan ( cM ) density variance component method linkage 274 multigeneration pedigree , globally particular context define gender , age , body mass index smoking . For region show linkage , confirmatory linkage analysis conduct second independent sample 301 multigeneration pedigree . In region linkage replicate , fine structure linkage analysis conduct , use additional marker locus , locate approximately every 1 cM . Specific aim 3 4 identified functional DNA variation new candidate coronary artery disease susceptibility gene . Direct DNA sequence cladistic analysis use estimate average , context dependent , dominant , epistatic effect associate functional DNA variation . Specific aim 5 estimate association risk coronary artery disease functional genotype identify cladistic analysis carry specific aim 3 4 consider intermediate biological risk factor link effect genetic environmental variation variation risk disease . The study renew 2001 July 2006 continue investigate innovative analytic molecular aspect risk coronary artery disease , particular , contribution polymorphic variation ApoE locus two candidate region genome variation plasma ApoE level .</detailed_description>
