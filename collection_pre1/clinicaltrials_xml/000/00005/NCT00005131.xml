	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although firmly establish coronary heart disease mortality rate United States fall 50 percent since mid 1960 's , systematic program study parallel coronary heart disease morbidity prevalence atherosclerosis . Such information essential understanding factor influencing time trend , quantify effect prevention versus treatment , guide future policy research service . It remain possibility mortality decline past year accompany reduction incidence , diminution extent underlie arterial disease . A trend confine mortality would require different explanation call different strategy prevention decline encompass whole spectrum clinical manifestation , would favor risk factor explanation . ARIC surveillance provide cardiovascular incidence rate , cohort provide information atherosclerosis , cardiovascular symptom , new establish risk factor medical care utilization representative resident community . New predictor atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease investigate use data obtain four examination center , ultrasound center five central laboratory . The 1978 Conference Decline Coronary Heart Disease Mortality 1979 Working Group Heart Disease Epidemiology recommend community surveillance program . As result , 1980 Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council approve Phase I surveillance pilot study . Phase II pilot study full-scale study approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee May 1982 . The Requests Proposals ARIC release September 1984 award make 1985 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : ARIC large-scale , long-term program measure association establish suspected CHD risk factor atherosclerosis new CHD event men woman four diverse community . The project two component : community surveillance morbidity mortality , repeat examination representative cohort men woman community . The representative cohort include 4,000 person community . Three reflect ethnic composition community live ; one cohort black . The community surveillance involve abstract hospital record death certificate investigate out-of-hospital death hospitalize myocardial infarction CHD death 800,000 men woman four community . All cohort participant examine four time ( 1987-90 , 1990-93 , 1993-96 , 1996-99 ) , contact annually update medical history . Atherosclerosis measure carotid ultrasonography . Arteriosclerosis measure use retinal photography . Cerebrovascular disease assess use MRI sample black white participant . Risk factor study include : blood lipid , lipoprotein cholesterol , apolipoproteins ; plasma hemostatic factor ; blood chemistry hematology indicator infectious inflammatory disease ; DNA marker risk factor , sit , supine stand blood pressure ; anthropometry ; fast blood glucose insulin level ; ECG finding ; heart rate variability ; cigarette alcohol use ; physical activity level ; dietary aspect ; family history . Novel factor test use nest case-control study store blood . The fourth final examination , include complete periodontal examination measure inflammatory marker complete 1999 , return rate 86 % . Community surveillance currently provide complete age , race , sex-specific rate hospitalization myocardial infarction coronary heart disease death community 1987-1997 . The study extend January , 2007 continue follow cohort annual telephone call hospital surveillance identify incident cardiovascular event 19 year . Community surveillance continue identify trend cardiovascular disease incidence , case-fatality , mortality 35-74 year old 19 year period . The diverse community compare respect CHD incidence medical care , cohort component , respect risk factor peripheral atherosclerosis . The result provide measure variation distribution determinant CHD U.S. , within limit ecologic analysis , suggest possible reason observe difference .</detailed_description>
