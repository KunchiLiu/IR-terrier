	<brief_title>SU5416 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum target-inhibiting dose SU5416 patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine relationship dose plasma level clinical safety profile antitumor effect treatment regimen term objective response , stabilization disease , progression-free survival patient population . III . Evaluate relationship dose plasma level SU5416 concentration ability treatment regimen reduce microvessel density induce apoptosis endothelial tumor cell patient population . IV . Determine prognostic surrogate serologic marker patient treat regimen . V. Determine pre posttreatment plasma serum level angiogenic growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial cell growth factor prognostic predict patient response regimen . VI . Determine elevate plasma level endothelial cell specific proteins reflective SU5416-induced endothelial damage and/or apoptosis useful surrogate marker assess response treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-deescalation study . Patients receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6-12 patient receive deescalating dos SU5416 maximum target-inhibiting dose ( MTID ) determine . The MTID define dose patient experience great grade 1 toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
