	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Essential hypertension multifactorial disorder Gaussian distribution genetic component appear polygenic heterogeneous . The study require clinical knowledge pathophysiology therapy hypertension , availability large racially diverse patient population General Clinical Research Center recruitment , characterization classification subject , combination knowledge molecular biology DNA preparation expertise molecular genetics molecular epidemiology genetic analysis . The study part Specialized Centers Research initiative Molecular Genetics Hypertension . The initiative originate deliberation September 1992 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . In May 1993 , program evaluation committee convene NHLBI charge task assess overall goal Hypertension SCOR program recommend area future need . The committee 's recommendation form basis propose initiative release Request Applications December , 1993 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study , subproject within Hypertension Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) , five substudies 1996 2001 . The first classified hypertensive relatively homogeneous subgroup accord intermediate phenotype base heritable biological trait , include anthropometric neurohumoral data obtain submit select subject 3-day inpatient protocol , data extrapolate applied stratify large subject population order enhance efficacy subsequent genetic analysis . The second substudy genotyped subject chromosomal locus use approximately 350 highly polymorphic microsatellite marker space every 5-10 centimorgans ( cM ) along chromosome . The strategy initially type marker select group hypertensive kindred independently demonstrate linkage . The third substudy analyze genetic marker data linkage use parametric ( lod score ) nonparametric ( affected-pedigree-member ) method . Suggestive finding pursue sib-pairs . The fourth substudy use case-control method confirm positive linkage substudy 3 identify particular allele association use method linkage disequilibrium DNA pooling . The fifth substudy screen assessed mutation candidate gene link hypertension patient control . A collaboration establish Framingham Heart Study , linkage analysis conduct hypertension cohort . The subproject renew February 2001 2006 continue clinical study expand collection hypertensive family , include subject undergone extensive clinical evaluation subgrouped intermediate phenotype , well family genetically isolated population Greece , Israel , South Africa . Various subset population submit different genetic analysis appropriate , include linkage association study , genome-wide scan genetic isolates , evaluation single nucleotide polymorphisms select gene , test quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) micro satellite marker map promise marrow region DNA sequence .</detailed_description>
