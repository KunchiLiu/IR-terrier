	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness medicine metformin help overweight child control food intake , weight , insulin , cholesterol , triglyceride ( blood fat ) level . Obesity high insulin level lead high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol triglyceride level heart disease . Metformin-approved Food Drug Administration treat adult type 2 diabetes mellitus-helps low insulin level may control weight gain adult . Overweight child 6 11 year old general good health may eligible study . Children study National Institutes Health Bethesda , Maryland . Candidates medical history physical examination fast blood test , provide 7-day record food intake part screen process . Those enrol randomly assign receive either metformin placebo ( look-alike tablet active medicine ) twice day six month period . After 6 month study period , child offer opportunity take metformin another 6 month . Participants hospitalize 2-3 day follow procedure : history physical examination ; fast blood test ; several urine collection ; X-ray study determine bone age amount body fat muscle ; magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan measure body fat ; `` hyperglycemic clamp study '' evaluate insulin resistance ; food intake testing ; nutrition consultation ; rest metabolic rate ; `` doubly labeled water '' test . For hyperglycemic clamp study , catheter ( thin flexible tube ) insert vein arm . A sugar solution give one tube blood sample draw every 5 minute measure insulin . For food intake testing , child ask hunger level , give various food may choose eat , question various interval finish eat hunger level . The doubly labeled water study involve drink `` heavy water '' ( water enrich special kind hydrogen oxygen ) . Urine specimen collect 2 , 3 4 hour drink water . The child also drink special milk shake call Scandishake repeat calorie intake hunger study . ( Two food intake study do separate day . ) One week heavy water test , additional urine sample collect one week later . After complete test , child begin treatment metformin placebo , plus daily vitamin tablet . Participants follow month brief history physical examination , include blood test . After 6 month , test describe repeat . All child complete second round tests-both take metformin take placebo-will offer metformin additional 6 month see month follow-up evaluation . Parents tell child receive metformin receive placebo child study complete first 6 month trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Treat Obesity Children With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence overweight obesity child adolescent United States double past 20 year . Obesity closely link development insulin resistance mediator unfavorable cardiovascular risk , hypertension dyslipidemia . These obesity-related risk factor often first appear childhood . Since obese child tend become obese adult , child increase risk persistence abnormality adulthood early occurrence obesity-related morbidity mortality . Obesity-related insulin resistance also largely responsible recently document rise incidence Type 2 diabetes youth . To date , FDA-approved pharmacotherapy child obesity insulin resistance . Metformin medication approve use adult Type 2 diabetes unique promotes weight loss improve feature insulin resistance syndrome . Preliminary study suggest metformin may promote weight loss obese non-diabetic child . However , mechanism metformin-induced weight loss elucidate . We propose evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy mechanism metformin-induced weight loss obese , hyperinsulinemic child age 6-12.99 year . We conduct six-month randomized , double blind placebo-controlled trial metformin . All study participant receive nutritional consultation advice appropriate diet . We study effect metformin weight , food intake , energy expenditure , insulin sensitivity , lipid . At end six-month placebo-controlled trial , subject offer metformin open label phase additional six month .</detailed_description>
