	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Evidence accumulate suggest essential hypertension begin early life potentially preventable . One possible pathogenetic mechanism implicate sympathetic nervous system abnormality manifest increased sympathetic drive heart . An elevated sympathetic nervous system tone decrease vagal inhibition responsible hyperkinetic circulation see significant proportion person borderline essential hypertension . Exaggerated blood pressure heart rate response mental stressor document normotensive child hypertensive parent . These change appear involve sympathetic over-responding fight-flight stimulus . Increased blood pressure variability induce stress might accelerate vascular change lead essential hypertension . Behavior environment might chronically elevate sympathetic nervous system tone damage cardiovascular consequence . Stressful working condition , defective anger management poor interpersonal problem solve skill implicated study stress-induced blood pressure increase . These influence may interact diet genetic risk exacerbate pathophysiology . Essential hypertension risk might reduce modify work live environment train young person risk cope avoid stressor elicit defensive over-responding . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This longitudinal study test two different model sympathetic nervous system influence early pathophysiology essential hypertension . The first neurogenic model evaluate determine whether excessively variable reactive blood pressure year 1 give rise excessive heart growth leave ventricular hypertrophy two year follow-up . The second neurogenic model evaluate determine high blood pressure exacerbate personality , stress , dietary sodium intake lead increase left ventricular hypertrophy follow-up . All ninth-graders enter two large Baltimore high school year 1 year 2 study screen yield 240 subject cohort . Initial screening include data blood pressure , height , weight , health habit , personality , medical history , health care utilization . Baseline exam include data basal blood pressure , aerobic exercise stress , cognitive stress , interpersonal stress , ambulatory blood pressure , echocardiogram , physical activity , Type A personality . The parent also interview assess family blood pressure status , health history , health care utilization dietary habit include sodium intake . Students re-examined twelve 24 month . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
