	<brief_title>R115777 Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate ( complete partial ) duration response patient small cell lung cancer least partial response one prior chemotherapy regimen least 3 month treat R115777 . II . Determine time disease progression , survival , quality life patient population treat drug . III . Assess safety R115777 patient population . IV . Assess presence ra mutation relapse patient available paraffin block . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hour 14 consecutive day follow 7 day rest . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Quality life assess baseline , day 15 course , end study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
