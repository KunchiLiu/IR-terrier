	<brief_title>Physicians ' Health Study : Study Low Cardiovascular Disease Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Physicians ' Health Study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled primary prevention trial design test whether 325 mg aspirin every day reduce risk cardiovascular disease whether 50 mg beta-carotene alternate day decrease cancer incidence among 22,071 male physician , age 40-84 year 1982 . On December 18 , 1987 , external Data Monitoring Board recommend early termination blind aspirin component trial , base emergence statistically extreme benefit aspirin fatal nonfatal myocardial infarction , well extraordinarily low cardiovascular mortality rate among study participant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In January 1982 , Physicians ' Health Study investigator purchase tape American Medical Association contain names male physician bear January 1 , 1907 December 31 , 1942 . The tape provide basis invitation join trial . A new computer tape purchase AMA contain name , address , date birth physician register December 1982 , current 1982 address , report death . This tape match Physician Health Study data file eliminate original tape , well know deceased time original mailing . When match complete , result new tape include name , recent address , date birth invited participate trial . A new master study tape compile include non-randomized potentially eligible respondent invitational mail well 35 percent random sample non-respondents . This group 138,460 comprise cohort . The National Death Index ( NDI ) search January 1 , 1982 January 25 , 1988 , official termination date trial physician cohort well 22,071 randomized participant . A copy death certificate obtain state department vital statistic death identify NDI order distinguish vascular non-vascular death . An Endpoints Committee , use death certificate medical record case , assign cause death enter data base . Analyses perform comparing : randomize versus non-randomized respondent ; randomize versus eligible unwilling participate ; randomize versus initially willing eligible enrol 18 week period exclude prior randomization . Baseline data enrollment form examine determine whether difference mortality rate could explain difference cardiovascular risk factor among group . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
