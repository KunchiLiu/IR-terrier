	<detailed_description>Our laboratory long-standing interest virus affect bone marrow . Many virus also may cause hepatitis . One specific syndrome , post-hepatitis aplastic anemia , suggest agent responsible severe sometimes fulminant hepatitis well profound bone marrow failure . In investigate role virus diseases , require small amount liver tissue molecular study . We request permission obtain sample patient undergo 1 ) liver transplantation 2 ) liver biopsy time surgery purpose virus discovery , include obtain control sample . For liver transplant sample , tissue obtain remove organ ; surgical circumstance , small amount tissue obtain liver biopsied medical indication . No additional risk patient result either procedure .</detailed_description>
