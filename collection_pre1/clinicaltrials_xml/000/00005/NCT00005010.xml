	<brief_summary>The purpose study see effective 2 drug , irbesartan pravastatin , slow kidney transplant failure . Many kidney transplant patient type chronic rejection . Chronic rejection disease cause scar damage kidney . Over time , chronic rejection lead kidney failure , make necessary patient start dialysis possibly receive another kidney transplant . Doctors would like see whether irbesartan pravastatin slow damage prevent kidney failure patient sign chronic rejection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal graft failure due chronic rejection , also know chronic allograft nephropathy , one lead cause repeat renal transplantation . Chronic rejection characterize progressive fibrosis scarring . Renal biopsy patient undergo chronic rejection show great expression profibrotic cytokine , include TGF-beta PDGF , normal kidney tissue . Moreover , cytokine activity chronic rejection resembles fibrosing renal disease . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEinh ) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor show protect effectively types fibrotic disease . These drug may protect fibrosis preserve renal function renal transplant patient chronic rejection , part block activation TGF-beta PDGF . This study evaluate impact irbesartan ( AII-RB act similar ACEinh ) pravastatin clinical progression chronic rejection expression TGF-beta , PDGF , connective tissue gene chronically reject kidney . Prior intervention , patient undergo transplant renal biopsy : 1 ) confirm presence chronic renal allograft nephropathy 2 ) quantify baseline mRNA level TGF-beta , PDGF , select cytokine connective tissue component . Patients randomize 4 arm : Group 1 receive pravastatin placebo plus irbesartan placebo ; Group 2 receive pravastatin plus irbesartan placebo ; Group 3 receive pravastatin placebo plus irbesartan ; Group 4 receive pravastatin plus irbesartan . Pravastatin administer dose 20 mg/day . Irbesartan initiate 150 mg/day titred 300 mg/day 2 week . Patients evaluate routinely serum creatinine potassium level , blood pressure , marker kidney function . In addition , monitor toxicity adverse event , particularly early rise serum creatinine muscle enzyme change . At Month 6 , serum creatinine rise 5.0 mg/dl earlier , repeat transplant kidney biopsy obtain compare baseline . Changes chronic allograft nephropathy cytokine mRNA level evaluate determine correlation clinical effect change activity profibrotic pathway . Study endpoints death renal failure manifest initiation dialysis retransplantation .</detailed_description>
