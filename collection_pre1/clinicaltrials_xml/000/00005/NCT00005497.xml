	<brief_title>Risk Factors Pulmonary Hypertension Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn ( PPHN ) , previously call persistent fetal circulation , birth defect affect approximately 1 1250 liveborn term infant ; even complex high-risk intervention , PPHN result substantial mortality morbidity . This defect result inappropriate muscularization fetal pulmonary vessel , experimental human evidence consistently suggest maternal cigarette smoking antenatal exposure NSAIDs , particularly aspirin ibuprofen , may play role etiology condition . Because exposures quite prevalent ( e.g. , ibuprofen currently take first trimester later pregnancy 15 percent 3.2 percent woman , respectively ) , test hypothesis considerable public health importance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The multicenter study case-control design . There 560 case infant PPHN four control per case ( 2240 ) . All control draw birth hospital case ; half control malformation PPHN , half normal formation . Cases control identify within five month birth 88 birth tertiary hospital area surround Boston , Philadelphia , Toronto . Mothers subject interview telephone within six month delivery ; standardize questionnaire inquire detail demographic factor ; reproductive , medical , pregnancy illness history ; medication use ( include detailed focus use over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic medication ) , smoke , nutrition . Because emerge genetic research suggest effect NSAIDs pathways possibly related etiology PPHN , buccal swab also collect stored future analysis . Exposure prevalence compare mother case control relative risk estimate , control potential confounding factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
