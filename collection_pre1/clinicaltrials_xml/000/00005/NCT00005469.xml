	<brief_title>Maturational Changes Cardiac Structures -- Blood Pressure Relationship -- SCOR Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although excessive leave ventricular mass view adaptation increase blood pressure , precede rise blood pressure hypertensive model . Excessive growth heart may reflect additional factor contribute eventual level blood pressure . In child , rapid heart growth may predictive subsequent high childhood blood pressure level great incidence cardiovascular disease adult relative . These study potential define maturational change know risk factor might help predict future hypertensive disease . The study subproject within Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Hypertension . The Request Applications SCOR release October , 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 124 prepubertal male female follow longitudinally five year . Yearly examination define stage sexual maturation . On four occasion year , subject study rest ambulatory blood pressure , echocardiography , anthropometry activity assessment . Once yearly , subject blood drawn hormone analyse whole blood viscosity estimate . From data , growth velocity heart rate change blood pressure determine . These parameter analyze determine rapid growth heart precede follow rise blood pressure observe puberty body size composition , sexual maturation hormone change , sympathetic activity . The study subproject within SCOR Hypertension . Approximately 7 percent total dollar award subproject . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
