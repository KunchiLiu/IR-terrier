	<brief_summary>To conduct multicenter epidemiologic study human retroviruses HIV-1 , HIV-2 , HTLV-I , HTLV-II volunteer blood donor area United States reportedly high medium low risk HIV . Also , determine prevalence retrovirus seropositivity first time blood donor ; rate retrovirus seroconversion repeat blood donor measure incidence infection ; ascertain risk factor antibody-positive donor ; characterize blood donor population geographic location , age , sex , race/ethnicity , donation history permit analysis prevalence , incidence , risk factor ; identify recipient retrovirus-positive blood unit conduct clinical laboratory follow-up recipient ; establish blood specimen repository long-term storage specimen study donor recipient future test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study I ( REDS I )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : HIV know transmissible blood , blood component , plasma derivative . The risk contract HIV infection blood transfusion greatly reduce United States implement stringent criterion donor acceptance , HIV antibody screening , new method virus inactivation coagulation factor concentrate . There additional human retrovirus , however , may pose threat safety nation 's blood supply . The human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus share many property , include preferred tropism certain lymphocytes similar mode transmission . They also differ significantly basis divide two distinct group : human T-cell lymphocytropic virus ( HTLVs ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIVs ) . HTLV-I , transform virus , prototype first group ( HTLVs ) . It associate adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) think involved central nervous system disorder refer tropical spastic paraparesis . This group also include HTLV-II , associate T-cell malignancy different ATL . A newly isolate human retrovirus , term HTLV-V , may etiologic agent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia , may also add group . HIV , previously know HTLV-III lymphadenopathy virus ( LAV ) , nontransforming virus , cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) prototype second group ( HIVs ) . New member group nontransforming human retrovirus isolated individual different country Africa . LAV-2 , also refer HIV-2 , isolate two AIDS patient Africa , first case AIDS United States cause HIV-2 report January , 1988 . A third member group , HIV-3 , detect Africa . Although HTLV family retroviruses distinct HIV family , group virus infect human T4 ( CD4 ) lymphocytes preferentially alter host 's T-cell function . Whereas HTLV-I HTLV-II primarily induce transformation proliferation T Lymphocytes cause T-cell lymphoma/leukemia human , HIV HIV-2 induce T-cell cytopathology lead depletion CD4 cell . The spread HIV blood transfusion represent highly efficient mode transmission . Blood component donor antibody HIV show transmit virus frequency great 90 percent . Packed red blood cell , platelet , fresh frozen plasma equally effective transmit virus recipient . It highly likely , therefore , recipient receive blood donor antibody HIV become infected virus . Fortunately , likelihood occurrence United States rare due implementation screening procedure safeguard . When study initiate 1989 , grow concern , however , human retrovirus HIV might threaten safety United States blood supply . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Blood donor ask participate multicenter study . Seropositive donor notify test result , counsel , invited join follow-up study . Data collect first interview include item possible exposure person retroviral infection , sexual preference contact , marital history , intravenous drug use , occupation , travel , knowledge AIDS rout HIV transmission . At subsequent visit blood specimen collect laboratory test assessment make change behavior reduce risk virus transmission . To calculate incidence prevalence rate , center identify appropriate study population analysis purpose collaboration coordinate center . For prevalence calculation , study population consist donor center indicate never donate blood previously . To calculate incidence , study population consist donor donate previously center . The incidence retroviral infection assess annually year three five . Clinical follow-up subject conclude 48 month begin enrollment . A blood profile center require calculate denominator value incidence prevalence determination . The blood profile , donor demographic characterization consist information regard total donor volume respect donation status ; new repeat donor , repeat , time last donation ; age ; sex ; race . An adjunct study development repository plasma cell sample infect donor negative control collect time . A potential byproduct repository ability future year retrospectively search REDS frozen repository file new retrovirus may appear United States population .</detailed_description>
