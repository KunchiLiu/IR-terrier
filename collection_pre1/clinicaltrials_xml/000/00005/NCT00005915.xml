	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 treatment plan try increase effect anti-HIV drug patient resistant drug effect . Sometimes increase patient 's viral load ( level HIV blood ) slow stop take anti-HIV drug . This always happen . Sometimes anti-HIV drug work first stop working . When usual anti-HIV drug longer seem work , virus call multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) . This study compare 2 treatment plan try increase effect anti-HIV drug patient MDR virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Anti-HIV Treatment Plans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase number patient develop multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) virus , determine genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing ( GART ) , due treatment failure suppress viral replication several round combination antiretroviral therapy . The best therapeutic strategy patient uncertain . Two strategy currently use ( 1 ) STI follow new antiretroviral regimen ( 2 ) immediate initiation new antiretroviral regimen . Patients screen presence MDR virus plasma HIV RNA level great 10,000 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01 : great 5,000 ] copies/ml . Eligible patient attend baseline visit [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01 : subsequent randomization visit ] qualify GART result provide . Patients consent participate phenotypic antiretroviral resistance testing ( PART ) do specimen blood draw use GART evaluation . After PART result available , patient randomize [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01 : If predict sensitivity available drug include PART , patient may still randomize . ] either 4-month STI follow new antiretroviral regimen immediate new antiretroviral regimen . The antiretroviral regimen choose base patient ' history GART PART result . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01 : Additional GART PART may request least 4 month antiretroviral treatment . ] Patients follow-up data collection do Months 1-8 every 4 month thereafter . Changes antiretroviral therapy , Grade 4 adverse experience , progression disease , death report occur . Patients see clinical management often deem necessary . All patient follow common closing date estimate 24 month last patient randomize . Some patient may participate Point Mutation Substudy [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01 : Plasma Point Mutation Substudy PBMC Point Mutation Substudy ] .</detailed_description>
