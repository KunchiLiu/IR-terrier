	<brief_summary>Rationale : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know vaccine therapy effective prostate cancer . Purpose : Randomized phase III trial determine effectiveness vaccine therapy treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : I . Compare time progression , time development disease-related pain , incidence grade 3 bad treatment-related adverse event patient asymptomatic metastatic hormone refractory adenocarcinoma prostate treat APC8015 versus control infusion . II . Compare response rate duration response patient . Outline : This randomize study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Autologous dendritic cell precursor ( ADCP ) harvest week 0 , 2 , 4 . Patients receive APC8015 comprise ADCP activate prostatic acid phosphatase-sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) fusion protein IV 30 minute begin 2 day harvest total 3 infusion . Arm II : ADCP harvest arm I . Patients receive unactivated ADCP IV 30 minute begin 2 day harvest total 3 infusion . Pain assess weekly 3 year 4 week objective disease progression . Patients follow monthly 3 year disease progression . At time disease progression , patient treat arm II may receive treatment Protocol D9903 . Projected Accrual : A total 120 patient ( 80 arm I 40 arm II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
