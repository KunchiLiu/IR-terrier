	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Stroke represent focal brain insult whereas chronic encephalopathy represent diffuse brain disturbance involve cognition memory . The predisposition stroke potential dementia increasingly apparent study work investigator sickle cell disease . The ontogeny two process require study mechanism could clearly articulate ; coordinate assessment cerebrovascular perfusion need decipher relationship focal perfusion deficit occlusion large small cerebral vessel . 150 subject enrolled study . Improved understanding mechanism underlie two devastate neurological complication SCD result prevention effective treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Three hypothesis test : ( 1 ) clinically-silent cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abnormality represent minimal expression neurovascular diathesis , harbinger clinically-overt stroke ( study A ) ; ( 2 ) sickle cell disease patient develop cerebral infarction predispose risk factor ( ) contribute neurological complication ( study B ) ; ( 3 ) sickle cell disease patient develop chronic encephalopathy dementia independent neurovascular diathesis ( study C ) . Study A prospective evaluation 50 SCD child age 6 12 year attempt identify subgroup patient risk development clinically-apparent stroke . These patient evaluate clinically , underwent MRI scan , magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , single photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) . Study B represent two study design analyze risk factor stroke . The first study retrospective case-control analysis 25 young adult suffer one stroke . These patient age-matched SCD control group clinically free stroke MRI , MRA , SPECT study . The second study represent prospective case-control analysis child follow study A . Study C represent prospective study 50 SCD child , 50 age-matched sibling closest available relative . Annual neurological examination neuropsychological evaluation perform search evidence chronic encephalopathy dementia . The longitudinal study design necessary dissect subtle variable contribute cognitive deficit . The study renew FY 1998 continue FY 2004 . Note : Darryl DeVivo PI Subproject begin FY 1988 compete renewal . The total grant begin several year prior . Dollars subproject estimate 10 % total fund award year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
