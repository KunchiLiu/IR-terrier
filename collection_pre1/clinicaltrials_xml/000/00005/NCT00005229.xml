	<brief_title>HIV-Associated Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : As AIDS reach epidemic proportion become apparent heart disease contribute morbidity disease . By 1988 , survival follow diagnosis AIDS improve , impact heart disease quality life survival patient increase parallel . The spectrum pathology comprise AIDS heart disease diverse contribution cardiac disease mortality quite unclear . Unanswered question include : seropositive individual would develop heart disease ; spectrum heart disease patient ; useful parameter risk stratification ; clinical course ; etiology due HIV infectious agent immunologic ; anti-viral agent immunosuppressive treatment affect disease course ? This project part Institute-initiated study AIDS-Associated Heart Disease Adults . The concept approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council September 1987 . The Request Applications also release September 1987 . Awards make July 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Asymptomatic patient recruit azidothymidine ( AZT ) versus placebo trial , open label AZT trial , isoprinosine versus placebo trial , Ampligen versus placebo trial George Washington University Medical Center . Symptomatic patient refer nearby clinic . Baseline information collect included age , sex , weight , HIV risk factor , date seroconversion , total CD4 lymphocyte count , clinical symptom , symptom AIDS-related complex , first opportunistic infection , development tumor neurologic symptom , anti-viral therapy , chest pain , symptom treatment congestive heart failure , evidence arrhythmia , initiation anti-arrhythmic therapy . Date cause death record along autopsy finding . Non-invasive serial electrocardiogram echocardiograms perform participant baseline every four month . Endomyocardial biopsy perform patient congestive cardiomyopathy , echocardiographic evidence leave ventricular dysfunction large pericardial effusion , significant arrhythmia . Endomyocardial biopsy obtain ten asymptomatic individual , five lymphadenopathy , five lymphadenopathy . Percutaneous pericardiocentesis perform patient large pericardial effusion obtain sample bacterial , mycobacterial , HIV cytomegalovirus culture . The fact majority patient participate clinical trial various anti-viral agent allow evaluation effect development heart disease . The second part project study pathogenesis HIV-associated heart disease . Light electron microscopic finding examine heart various clinical stage HIV infection . Cardiocytes examine presence HIV infectious agent . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record</detailed_description>
