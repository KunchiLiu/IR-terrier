	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progressive generally fatal disease cause fibrosis pulmonary interstitium . While many environmental agent cause diseases clinically similar , etiology idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis suggest environmental agent could incite tissue injury result disease ; furthermore , host characteristic could important role determine magnitude host response agent initiate injury .
