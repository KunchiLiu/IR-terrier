	<brief_title>Evaluating Strategies Control Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The availability effective treatment hypercholesterolemia raise hope million Americans could avoid postpone development heart disease . Because intervention potentially effective also costly , cost-effectiveness alternative approach detect treat hypercholesterolemia become critical issue health policy . The study part three-grant initiative , Cost-Effective Strategies Cholesterol-Lowering , recommend Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee January , 1988 give concept clearance September , 1988 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release March , 1990 award make April , 1991 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Assessments make : effect treatment health outcome ( symptomatic coronary heart disease , death coronary heart disease , mortality cause ) ; cost effectiveness specific dietary pharmacological intervention ; effect delay institute treatment ; effect change interval blood cholesterol test probability duration treatment delay ; cost health consequence modify screen treatment recommendation risk factor , age , gender ; population implication screen treatment strategy . Data Framingham Heart Study use estimate time pattern cholesterol level , fundamental evaluation change interval cholesterol test . Framingham data also use estimate relation event rate blood cholesterol level . Several component analysis validate test model prediction data Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial . The cost estimate base several additional source . Individual-level cost-effectiveness estimate several different intervention present along population-level projection consequence alternative strategy . The significance alter assumption uncertain value , long-term risk benefit specific medication , test sensitivity analysis .</detailed_description>
