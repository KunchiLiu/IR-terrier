	<brief_title>Ecteinascidin 743 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine partial complete response rate patient previously treat metastatic osteosarcoma treat ecteinascidin 743 . II . Further characterize toxicity profile pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship drug patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV 24 hour . Treatment continue every 6 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression least 2-6 course . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive least 2 additional course document CR . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . All patient follow death disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-33 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
