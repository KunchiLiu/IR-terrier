	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although coronary heart disease major factor morbidity mortality sex , study prior 1988 study initiate focused men overlook magnitude problem woman . Coronary heart disease mortality morbidity rate higher men woman , account 41 percent sex difference overall mortality United States . Women 's advantage , however , seem stable time universal . For example , 1920 , age adjust ratio male female coronary heart disease death approximately equal , 1975 1978 , increase level 2.47 United States . Also , sex mortality ratios heart disease differ widely across country range 5/1 Finland 1.87/1 Yugoslavia . Thus , rely biological difference alone explain sex differential convincing . Based Framingham data , among important risk factor predict coronary heart disease woman men -- aside age -- cholesterol , cigarette smoking , blood pressure . Consistent observation men likely fall victim coronary heart disease woman fact also exhibit high level risk factor compare woman , least age 45 . Standardization risk factor level control level risk factor coronary heart disease probability eliminate sex differential 45 54 year old Framingham Study . However , among 55 74 year old , sex differential due difference level impact risk factor . It conceivable sex mortality differential old age due sex differential primary coronary risk factor young age . Of particular interest fact primary risk factor appear influenced behavior . It possible gender difference behavior might explain gender difference primary coronary risk factor . Alternatively , evidence primary coronary risk factor solely responsible etiology coronary heart disease . Gender differences psychosocial variable , Type A behavior , hostility , occupational stress might play independent role etiology coronary heart disease systematically investigate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Gender difference primary risk factor determine , analysis control body mass since men score high body mass index woman body mass related level primary coronary risk factor . One-way analysis covariance perform plasma lipid lipoprotein , blood pressure , heart rate . Gender differences psychosocial variable associate coronary risk investigate . Analyses perform primary coronary risk factor baseline order investigate relationship occupational characteristic demand control age body mass index . Covariance analysis perform Type A/Type B high low occupational control high low demand sex . The role parental history heart disease , Type A behavior smoking elevate primary coronary risk factor among oral contraceptive user also investigate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
