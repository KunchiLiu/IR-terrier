	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic analysis acute , reversible respiratory health effect uncommonly perform , yet important health outcome acute response respiratory defense system appear represent one end continuum toward progressive , chronic potentially disable physiologic change . Repeatable epidemiologic study dose-response relationship necessitate accurate measure 'dose ' . However , occupational environmental setting , exposure toxin seldom find identical concentration and/or particle size among person activity pattern . In addition , air concentration account factor clearance metabolism may alter biologically effective tissue dose . These factor cause target tissue dose toxin vary greatly despite exposure similar air concentration . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The result toxicokinetic model individual measure tissue dose use 2-stage epidemiologic analysis place special emphasis definition individual dose-response curve exposure irritant dust , sodium borate , reversible effect peak expiratory flow irritant symptom . A primary advantage two stage epidemiologic approach permit particular attention focus factor determine sensitivity ( threshold ) reactivity ( slope ) individual . The use tissue dose estimate also compare simple exposure measurement epidemiologic analysis evaluate efficacy use dosimetric method epidemiologic study . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
