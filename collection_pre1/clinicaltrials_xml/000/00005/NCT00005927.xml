	<brief_summary>The adrenal gland , locate atop kidney , normally produce several type hormone . Tumors gland may may secrete hormone . It known cause tumor secrete hormone others . Some tumor benign confine adrenal gland , others malignant ( cancerous ) , spread part body . This study investigate adrenal gland tumor develop , secrete steroid hormone others , benign others malignant . Patients 3 70 year old know suspected adrenal gland tumor may eligible study . Participants hospitalize 7 10 day various test procedure may include follow : 1 . Medical history physical examination , include body measurement , appropriate . Children adolescents Tanner staging , include examination genitals , determine extent sexual maturity . 2 . 24-hour urine collection measure hormones urine . 3 . Imaging study , include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain , compute tomography ( CT ) X-ray study . 4 . Blood test see tumor secretes hormones response specific stimulus , include exercise , food , various hormone . The hormone give intravenous catheter , IV thin plastic tube insert arm vein . After stimulus , blood drawn IV every 30 minute 3 hour measure hormone level . Based result test , patient may additional blood test check hormone response special food , IV salt solution , hormone drug give either IV mouth ( pill form ) . 5 . Photographs document effect body abnormal hormone secretion adrenal tumor . 6 . Small sample blood tumor tissue research DNA ( genetic ) analysis . A discussion treatment option base result test . If surgery remove tumor recommend , procedure do NIH study protocol . If malignant tumor find treat surgically , chemotherapy radiation therapy may recommend . These option offer protocol , may available different NIH study ( example , National Cancer Institute ) . Referrals make patient request . Patients surgery may follow NIH outpatient clinic 1 year surgery . Patients certain type tumor may continue follow NIH year 5 year . A registry study participant create keep record correlate medical history tissue keep NIH . The registry also use inform participant research study may interest . No individual organization outside NIH access registry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The adrenal gland major source body steroid hormone . In normal physiology , pituitary hormone ACTH regulate secretion glucocorticoid , secretion mineralocorticoid aldosterone control renin-angiotensin system . In addition two class steroid , adrenal gland secretes lesser amount intermediate metabolite well dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) sulfate product ( DHEAS ) androstenedione , testosterone , estrogen , estrone . Dysregulated secretion hormone cause sporadic adrenocortical adenoma carcinoma , development specific clinical syndrome depend identity hormone secrete . In least subset cortisol-producing adrenocortical neoplasm , presence ectopic abnormal receptor describe , result regulation cortisol and/or aldosterone non-physiologic stimulus . The present study serve mechanism investigate individual steroid hormone-secreting adrenocortical tumor type purpose identify hereditary , congenital , acquire defect lead hormone oversecretion , also tumor formation . One first goal study ( recently ) examine prevalence ectopic receptor expression cortisol- and/or aldosterone- hormone secrete adrenocortical tumor . This lead understanding ontogeny tumor development novel therapeutic strategy ( e.g. , receptor antagonist ) control hormone oversecretion . We currently use information evaluation treatment patient . An important research goal study identify novel genetic defect lead tumor adrenal gland . This do set method , sequence collect DNA analysis expression large set gene use gene array/gene chip analysis . This information may help identify patient would benefit aggressive intervention strategy , especially potentially malignant tumor . This study also provide patient cohort necessary establishment bank tissue vary tumor adrenal cortex , may serve future experimental resource test new diagnostic therapeutic method . Finally , important recent goal study investigate effect excess aldosterone renal , cardiac , metabolic , bone system patient primary hyperaldosteronism , important subgroup patient adrenocortical tumor . Patients hyperaldosetronism study rigor patient hypercortisolism past ; study aim investigate relative contribution hyperaldosteronism etiopathogenesis number clinical problem patient adrenocortical lesion hypertension .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients adults child evidence existence tumor adrenal gland , indicate previously obtain image study and/or biochemical investigation hormonal secretion . This condition mean include possibility individual `` subclinical '' hormone secretion syndrome , may detectable biochemical level even absence frank clinical signs/symptoms . All eligible patient invited participate protocol , regardless sex , race ethnic origin . All population appear risk adrenal tumor , therefore subject population include Native Americans , Asian/Pacific Islanders , Caucasian , Hispanic , Black individual . Patients accept evaluation base referral clinician , may selfreferred , provide evidence supportive diagnosis hormone oversecretion . Patients must willing return NIH followup evaluation . Patients may withdraw study time . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Children le 3 year old exclude protocol limited resource available NIH care infant age . 2 . Individuals age 70 year age exclude possibility comorbidities may significantly affect appropriate initial workup postoperative management . In addition , research data may compromise inability interpret data collect patient age 70 year may multiple medication variety reason . 3 . Women pregnant nursing exclude hyperaldosteronism arm protocol . Women adrenal tumor secrete cortisol adrenal hormone may benefit clinically evaluation treatment tumor , consider enrollment clinically indicate . 4 . Individuals whose medical status allow , safety reason , participate provocative test unacceptably high risk surgical morbidity mortality exclude protocol , able participate profitably research aspects protocol . 5 . Individuals find know inherited syndrome cause hormone oversecretion exclude participation protocol , mechanism hormone oversecretion tumorigenesis likely distinct individual . Specific example syndrome may exclude protocol include individual Carney Complex , McCuneAlbright syndrome , MEN1 . If inquiry receive patient , refer appropriate ongoing protocol , possible .</criteria>
