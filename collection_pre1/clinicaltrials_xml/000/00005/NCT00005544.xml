	<brief_title>Community Based Study Adult Onset Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma incidence increase , adult work-related exposure may important factor-occupational asthma ( OA ) incidence increase 70 percent last decade accord recent registry base study . The true contribution occupational exposure adult-onset asthma unknown method measure OA give conflicting result . Methods base surveillance clinically diagnose OA account le one five percent adult-onset asthma . However , case-control method measure asthma risk industry suggest six 33 percent adult-onset asthma cause workplace exposure . The conflict may occur two factor : physician often fail diagnose report OA , irritant exposure may increase risk risk asthma without cause case meet clinical definition . Both factor important implication proper treatment prevention asthma adult . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Clinical case control method use identify role irritant exposure adult-onset asthma community-based prospective study asthma incidence . The study cohort typical US work population enrol HMO . Additional benefit study design opportunity validate questionnaire exposure assessment detection work-related asthma . Specifically , study : 1 ) Investigated incident case cohort 80,000 adult three year determine proportion meet clinical definition occupational asthma ( OA ) ; 2 ) Used nest case-control study determine incidence asthma occupation workplace exposure ; 3 ) Determined whether clinical OA account excess incidence adult-onset asthma associate workplace exposure sensitizers irritant ; 4 ) Prospectively follow asthmatic two year diagnosis determine impact adult-onset asthma lung function , employment , income , quality life , determine whether prognosis differ clinical OA asthma associate workplace irritant exposure ; 5 ) Tested intervention design increase appropriate clinical diagnosis , thus secondary prevention OA .
