	<brief_title>Identifying High Risk Patients With Syncope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Syncope common medical problem 30 percent normal individual report one syncopal episode . Thus , physician specialty frequently confront patient syncope . The spectrum disease may cause syncope broad , range common benign problem severe life-threatening disorder . Because complexity clinical situation obvious cause syncope find , patient may subject significant period hospitalization large number diagnostic test . Retrospective prospective study show many diagnostic test frequently employ infrequently diagnostic cause syncope . Thus , study show cause establish suggest , majority diagnosis assign base initial history physical examination . An initial electrocardiogram helpful assigning cause syncope approximately five percent additional patient . In prior study prolong electrocardiographic monitoring helpful assigning cause syncope approximately fifteen percent patient . Other study prolong electrocardiographic monitoring patient syncope reveal arrhythmias potential cause syncope find eleven sixty-four percent patient . Diagnostic procedure EEG , head CT scan , brain scan , cerebral angiography , echocardiography , cardiac catheterization rarely establish cause syncope useful employ selectively diagnosis specific etiology syncope . These study diagnostic evaluation syncope , therefore , clearly indicate subgroup patient syncope arrhythmias cause syncope apparent initial history , physical examination , EKG . Therefore , prolong electrocardiographic monitoring assume central role diagnostic evaluation group patient detection arrhythmias . Because prognostic therapeutic importance arrhythmia cause syncope , important identify patient likely arrhythmias data available presentation . There study prior 1987 attempt identify patient presentation . The predictor diagnostic arrhythmia presentation may helpful four reason . First , variables suggest high likelihood arrhythmia may provide basis decision regard need hospital admission . Secondly , predictor diagnostic arrhythmia may identify patient may need monitor immediately oppose electively . Thirdly , patient predictor diagnostic arrhythmia may appropriate candidate invasive diagnostic test intracardiac electrophysiologic study . Fourthly , since patient arrhythmias high risk sudden death , predictor may identify appropriate subset patient study involve therapeutic intervention . Since many patient syncope multiple risk factor sudden death , development multifactorial model effectively expeditiously predict degree risk sudden death may important management patient syncope initial presentation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Two model validate longitudinal study include one predict sudden death one predict diagnostic arrhythmia monitoring . The model prediction sudden death develop patient cause syncope establish initial history physical examination . The predictor model included history diabetes mellitus , renal insufficiency , leave ventricular hypertrophy , leave bundle branch block , leave axis deviation . The model predictor diagnostic arrhythmia develop patient cause syncope establish initial history , physical examination , EKG include history ventricular tachycardia abnormal EKG specific criterion . Patients syncope accrue emergency room , inpatient service ambulatory clinic Presbyterian University Hospital Pittsburgh . All patient underwent basic standardize evaluation consist history , physical examination , baseline laboratory test , electrocardiogram , prolong electrocardiographic monitoring , special diagnostic test necessary . Diagnosis cause syncope assign standardized criterion . Follow-up information regard sudden death mortality obtain three-month interval end study . Causes death assign standardized manner . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
