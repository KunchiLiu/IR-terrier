	<brief_summary>To re-examine relationship suppress anger , elevate blood pressure all-cause well coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality use data Life Change Event Study ( LCES ) conduct representative sample Tecumseh Community Health Study ( TCHS ) , n=696 , men woman , age 30-69 1971-1972 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suppressed Anger , Blood Pressure Mortality Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The psychosocial data ( e.g . anger-expression , stressful life event ) medical data ( e.g . blood pressure , smoke ) collect 1971/72 , additional information medical risk factor collect 1968/69 . Mortality ascertainment cause death complete end 1989 , TCHS staff , use National Death Index ( NDI ) . The estimated cumulative 18-year mortality rate 1989 Tecumseh cohort age LCES sample 26 percent male 16 percent female . Approximately 144 death expect . Out total TCHS cohort death , 35 percent estimate due CHD . Research question test included : ( 1 ) suppress anger predict coronary heart disease mortality well all-cause mortality ; ( 2 ) relationship suppress anger mortality modify risk factor ( e.g . blood pressure , marital stress , gender ) ; ( 3 ) certain anger-coping strategy among married couple increase mortality risk one member marital pair . Analyses do three level : whole sample , separately males female , subgroup 192 married couple do 'pairs ' . To determine univariate association anger-coping type all-cause mortality , percent decease compare among person group accord anger response . For situation-specific total suppress anger index , distribution score divide third . The significance association test use chi-square statistic . Logistic regression employ test significance association anger-coping measure mortality control sex , age , education , marital stress , relative weight , smoking , systolic blood pressure , CHD status , bronchitis , FEV1 score . Logistic regression also use determine whether risk factor , particularly blood pressure , gender marital stress , significantly modify relationship suppress anger mortality . The design measure study potential identify specific person-situation characteristic associate high risk total well cause specific mortality could use make knowledgeable recommendation health behavior intervention . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
