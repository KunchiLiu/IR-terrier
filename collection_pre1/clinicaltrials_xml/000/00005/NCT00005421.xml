	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Tracking -- Childhood Young Adulthood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blood pressure measurement childhood young adulthood less predictive future level take middle age . In part , may due fact within-person variability appear make large proportion total variability childhood adulthood . Previous work NHLBI support grant indicate repeat blood pressure measurements visit lead high childhood track correlation period three year . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Follow-up data use well multiple visit reduce large within-person variability blood pressure measurement improve tracking correlation . In addition , 'true ' 'corrected ' track correlation provide eliminate effect random measurement error . The effect examine time-varying covariates observe true tracking correlation . Besides compute track correlation , predictive value compute young adult blood pressure give childhood level . This probability young adult 's true blood pressure specific cutpoint conditional childhood blood pressure . These value validate use data Fels Longitudinal Study , include serial blood pressure measurement age range study . The prediction model also derive include term covariates age , sex , height weight . From model nomograms construct useful physician prognostic purpose . Thus , unique multiple-visit approach use data , effect random measurement error eliminate . These methodologic improvement strengthen usefulness blood pressure screen childhood detect high risk develop hypertension . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
