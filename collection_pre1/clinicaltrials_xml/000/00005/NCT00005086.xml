	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy treat patient stage IV locally advance metastatic bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Locally Advanced Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate combination docetaxel methotrexate follow gemcitabine cisplatin patient stage IV locally advance metastatic , previously untreated , transitional cell carcinoma urothelium . - Assess toxicity sequential regimen patient population . - Assess time event efficacy measure include time disease progression , duration response , overall survival patient treat sequential regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive methotrexate IV day 1 8 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 8 every 3 week 9 week . Patients receive cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 gemcitabine IV 100 minute day 1 8 every 3 week 9 week . This 18 week sequential regimen constitute 1 full course . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow death 2 year study entry , whichever come first . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-46 patient accrue study within 9-24 month .</detailed_description>
