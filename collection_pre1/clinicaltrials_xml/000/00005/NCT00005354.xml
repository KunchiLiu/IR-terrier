	<brief_summary>To investigate relationship coronary heart disease risk factor coronary artery calcification middle age adult Muscatine Study . From 1992 1995 , ultrafast computed tomography use measure coronary artery calcification . The study extend January , 2001 order examine role electron beam compute tomography detect presence quantity coronary artery calcification , marker atherosclerotic process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atherosclerotic heart disease , major cause mortality morbidity United States , show origin childhood . Deposition calcium occur early atheromatous process often observe postmortem study coronary artery aorta . Ultrafast compute tomography ( Fast-CT ) provide highly sensitive , non-invasive technique detect presence quantity coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) . The 'risk factor ' coronary artery disease determine measuring level potential factor middle-and older-aged adult determine predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , include coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease . Adult subject CAC great number coronary risk factor , include high cholesterol . In age group 30-39 year , 30 40 percent radiographic evidence coronary artery aortic calcification . In Muscatine Study , investigator examine coronary risk factor 2400 subject childhood ( age 9-11 year ) young adult life ( age 20 30 year ) . This population provide important information relate measure childhood young adult coronary risk factor predict development atherosclerotic process adult fourth decade life . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Beginning 1992 , longitudinal study use non-invasive technique ultrafast compute tomography examine relationship know coronary risk factor measure childhood early adult life order correlate association coronary artery calcification . Risk factor include lipid , lipoprotein , apolipoproteins , lipoprotein ( ) , apo ( ) genotype , homocyst ( e ) ine , leave ventricular mass . Beginning February 1996 , electron beam compute tomography use associate risk factor coronary artery calcification .</detailed_description>
