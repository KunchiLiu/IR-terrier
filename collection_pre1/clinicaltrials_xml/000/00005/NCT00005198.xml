	<brief_title>Survival After Myocardial Infarction A Biethnic Texas Community ( Corpus Christi Heart Project )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The decline coronary heart disease mortality United States may due decrease incidence clinically apparent coronary heart disease increase survival first clinical appearance . Prior 1987 , data available confirm either one directly . However , increase risk , decrease medical care , may predispose Mexican-American population increase recurrence myocardial infarction decrease post myocardial infarction survival , overall great mortality among survivor myocardial infarction , observed Anglos community set . The significance potential result lie importantly follow aspect research : estimation community-based incidence hospitalization suspect , definite possible myocardial infarction ; precise determination recurrence rate survival curve myocardial infarction community-wide hospital-based cohort ; analysis relation risk status ascertain hospitalization health care preventive practice assess periodically post-myocardial infarction ; comparison observation Anglos Mexican-Americans , group special interest concern expect difference natural history coronary heart disease near total lack relevant data . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients hospitalize acute coronary heart disease ( CHD ) seven acute care hospital Nueces County , Texas identify active concurrent case registration . Baseline data clinical , prognostic sociodemographic characteristic patient time event collect medical record interview patient . Patients event meet diagnostic criterion acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) follow directly contact three month post-discharge anniversary discharge thereafter ascertain vital status collect information recurrent myocardial infarction , change health status , health care practice interim . Endpoints include all-cause mortality death attribute coronary heart disease , fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction . Data analysis include examination survival recurrence myocardial infarction entire cohort myocardial infarction patient within ethnic group ; evaluation potential prognostic factor within ethnic group ; comparison survival myocardial infarction recurrence ethnic group adjustment baseline time-dependent covariates . The study renew 1992 continue identify hospitalize MI CHD mortality well angioplasty , bypass surgery among Mexican-Americans non-Hispanic Whites . The investigator calculate incidence rate hospitalize MI , use cardiac revascularization , rate post-MI mortality , cause CHD mortality community . They also describe trend aspect CHD eight year period determine ethnic difference exist . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
