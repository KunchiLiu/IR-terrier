	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : As bone marrow transplantation become one preferred treatment life-threatening disease blood , increase number patient must seek compatible marrow unrelated donor . The low probability find good patient-donor marrow match mean one- two-thirds ill patient never locate donor perfectly compatible marrow . Furthermore , volunteer identify preliminary match patient , 30 40 percent either unwilling medically unable actually donate marrow . Thus , volunteer attrition contribute significantly problem already inherent find suitable donor candidate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine relationship volunteer characteristic donor center factor volunteer psychological outcome two critical stage blood test process donor center rate volunteer cooperation stage . Longitudinal cross-sectional survey data gather total 2,900 potential marrow donor one two critical decision point process lead donation ( DR-blood-typing , CT-blood-typing ) , personnel 100 NMDP donor center . These data allow investigator ( ) describe distribution interrelationship donor center structural characteristic strategy center utilize volunteer recruitment retention , ( b ) determine donor center factor ( structural tactical ) volunteer background characteristic best predict positive volunteer-specific psychological outcome later type stage , examine revise model individual volunteer-specific outcome aggregate across-center retention rate . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
