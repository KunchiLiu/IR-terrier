	<brief_summary>This study determine effect angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor ( trade name Ramipril ) therapy inflammation stiffness artery wall . These two risk factor develop atherosclerosis-deposits fatty substance call plaque block blood vessel , cause heart attack stroke . Studies patient coronary artery disease suggest ACE inhibitor therapy reduces risk heart attack heart failure . This study examine effect treatment artery wall level substance blood indicate blood vessel inflammation . Patients 40 75 year old coronary artery disease cause atherosclerosis may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , cardiovascular ( heart blood vessel ) examination , electrocardiogram blood test . Those enrol randomly assign take either ACE inhibitor pill placebo ( look-alike pill medicine ) day 3 month . No pill take next month , participant take alternate pill next 3 month . That , take ACE inhibitor first 3-month period take placebo second 3-month period vice versa . Blood pressure take NIH Clinical Center patient 's physician end first second week study . At end 3 week , patient return Clinical Center blood draw 6 cc ( 1/2 teaspoon ) ass kidney function . In addition , end 3-month study period , patient undergo follow procedure Clinical Center : 1 . Fasting blood draw 60 cc ( 2 ounce ) measure electrolytes ( e.g. , sodium potassium ) blood marker inflammation 2 . Ultrasound ( use sound wave create picture ) study carotid artery ( artery neck lead brain ) -An ultrasound probe apply gently neck , ultrasound picture right leave carotid artery record tape . Heart activity blood pressure monitor procedure electrocardiogram blood pressure cuff . 3 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) carotid arteries-The patient lie table narrow cylinder ( MRI machine ) contain magnetic field . A flexible padded sensor call MRI coil place neck area . Earplugs place ear muffle loud thump sounds machine make magnetic field switch . During second half exam , contrast agent ( gadolinium ) inject intravenous catheter ( flexible tube place vein ) brighten image . The heart monitor procedure electrocardiogram .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vascular inflammation play major role progression clinical expression atherosclerosis may contribute stiffen artery increase risk myocardial infarction stroke . Therapies reduce vascular inflammation may reduce cardiovascular event . Angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor therapy reduce cardiovascular event patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , potentially reduce vascular oxidant stress activation gene encode protein mediator inflammation . However , find ACE inhibitor therapy patient CAD overall significant effect serum level cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , E-selectin ( surrogate marker vascular inflammation ) , although patient show reduction level , suggest either surrogate marker vascular inflammation may accurately reflect reduction vascular inflammation , subset patient biological response might reduce cardiovascular risk . The purpose protocol determine 1 ) effect ACE inhibitor therapy vascular inflammation patient coronary artery disease assess MRI carotid artery , 2 ) whether serum marker inflammation correlate reduce vascular inflammation thus may suitable surrogate determine success ACE inhibitor therapy .</detailed_description>
