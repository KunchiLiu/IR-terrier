	<brief_summary>This study involve collection blood sample patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) evaluate relationship platelet count , blood level hormone call thrombopoietin control platelet production bone marrow , blood level antibody thrombopoietin could interfere action hormone . Blood sample also store separately agree patient analysis gene might affect platelet production . At single outpatient clinic visit , patient medical history take , blood sample draw test . Results study may help understand control platelet production patient ITP , suggest new therapeutic approach .</brief_summary>
