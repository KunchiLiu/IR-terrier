	<brief_title>AIDS-Associated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1988 , lead cause death AIDS patient respiratory mechanism might play significant role pathogenesis . The project part Institute-initiated study AIDS-Associated Heart Disease Adults . The concept approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council September 1987 . The Request Applications also release September 1987 . Awards make July 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prevalence study one three subprojects common failure due chronic opportunistic pulmonary infection , primarily Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . Drugs azidothymidine ( AZT ) trimetrexate show effectiveness prolong life AIDS patient . With increased survival , believe cardiac disease might well become important complication AIDs . Reports describe syndrome rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy associate AIDS . The etiology AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy yet unknown although immunologic theme immunopathogenesis AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy . The two subprojects deal immunopathology study endomyocardial biopsy autopsy tissue serologic study . The AIDS Clinical Research Center Johns Hopkins Hospital serve source patient . All patient underwent serologic test echocardiography time entry six twelve month . The screen electrocardiogram identify 40 50 patient per year AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy . Approximately 30 patient per year contraindication endomyocardial biopsy . Comprehensive tissue study cellular immune study perform cohort autopsy , possible . Immunohistochemical technique situ hybridization biopsy autopsy material use determine AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy associate HIV infection heart viral opportunistic non-viral infection . Indirect immunofluorescence Western immunoblotting assay use patient serum determine prevalence heart autoimmunity . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
