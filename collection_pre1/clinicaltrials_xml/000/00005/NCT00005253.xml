	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The original grant 1990 1995 fund analysis clinical trial subgroup raise concern , patient high blood pressure , diuretic therapy may increase risk sudden cardiac death . Given size hypertensive population United States , prevalence diuretic therapy hypertension , persistent concern regard relation diuretic therapy risk primary cardiac arrest ( PCA ) , study prove particular interest clinician , epidemiologist , public policy maker , general public . Beginning 1995 grant renew , unexpected finding Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial -- adverse effect mortality two antiarrhythmic drug therapy -- heighten concern drug therapy diuretic may increase risk primary cardiac arrest . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The original study begin 1990 population-based case-control design . Using community-based surveillance system out-of-hospital primary cardiac arrest Seattle King County , Washington , case primary cardiac arrest ( PCA ) identify occur among 18,000 pharmacologically-treated hypertensive patient receive care Group Health Cooperative ( GHC ) 1977-1993 . Approximately 180 case identify . Controls obtain random sample GHC enrollees pharmacologically-treated hypertension , match case ratio 3 1 , accord age , gender , year occurrence PCA . The computerized pharmacy data base GHC allow ascertainment pattern exposure specific antihypertensive drug therapy identical fashion case control . Medical record review gather information potential confounding factor effect modifier , severity hypertension . Data analysis , use stratification logistic regression , determine whether use diuretic increase risk PCA compare use antihypertensive agent ; whether risk PCA depend upon dose diuretic therapy ; whether electrocardiographic abnormality modify risk PCA associate diuretic . The study renew 1995 determine whether treatment antidepressant , anticonvulsant , antiarrhythmic drug therapy potential proarrhythmia increase risk primary cardiac arrest . The study population-based case-control study nest within cohort patient receive medical care large pre-paid Health Care Plan Seattle , Washington . Cases patient primary cardiac arrest 1977 1994 . Controls stratify random sample patient , frequency-matched case age , gender , calendar-year , know heart disease . Treatment drug assess computerized pharmacy database . Ambulatory-care medical record review assess clinical characteristic , include indication therapy , severity heart disease , co-existing morbidity , risk factor . For antidepressant anticonvulsant drug , analysis stratify known heart disease , risk treatment might particularly large among patient know heart disease . For antiarrhythmic drug , analysis restrict single , current indication therapy -- maintenance sinus rhythm among patient chronic atrial fibrillation ; , availability prior echocardiogram , order control type severity underlie heart disease . After adjustment potential confounders , investigator estimate relative safety : 1 ) drug within therapeutic class ; , 2 ) dosage schedule specific drug . In addition , determine concurrent treatment drug alter cardiac conduction morbidity alter drug disposition influence risk among patient treat drug therapy .</detailed_description>
