	<brief_title>Endothelial Vasomotor Function Framingham Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Current research suggest loss vasodilator , anti-thrombotic , anti-inflammatory property vascular endothelium play dynamic role pathogenesis cardiovascular disease . Impaired endothelial function , include impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation associate cardiovascular disease risk factor . Further , grow evidence endothelial function improve risk modification . However , available study definitively resolve issue cross-sectional correlate endothelial dysfunction limit small sample highly select patient . For example , remain unclear whether hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , elevate glucose level independent determinant endothelial dysfunction . Most importantly , study show relation endothelial dysfunction increase cardiovascular risk . Such demonstration would increase understanding pathogenesis cardiovascular disease aid clinicians identify high risk individual would benefit intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using non-invasive brachial artery ultrasound , endothelial function examine 3,800 men woman Framingham Heart Study . The cross-sectional correlate endothelial function know coronary risk factor examine cross-sectional analysis perform relation endothelial function prevalent cardiovascular disease . Observations make adjusted relation endothelial function incident recurrent cardiovascular event . The central hypothesis presence endothelial dysfunction independent risk factor cardiovascular disease event . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
