	<brief_title>Postprandial Lipoproteins Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Fatty diet likely cause atherosclerosis , lipoproteins appear blood fatty meal may particularly atherogenic . Yet nearly publish research 1990 relationship blood lipid atherosclerosis human measure lipid fast casual sample . The atherogenicity postprandial lipoprotein , particularly remnants triglyceride-rich particle , suggest vitro study foam cell induction , feed experiment animal , observation Type III hyperlipoproteinemia human . Indirect evidence hypothesis arise research condition characterize high fast triglyceride low HDL-cholesterol , denser LDL particle , elevation apolipoprotein B intermediate-density lipoprotein . The hypothesis receive direct support two small study Krauss 1987 Simons 1987 show higher postprandial chylomicron remnant concentration coronary patient control . However , neither study statistical power evaluate relative association fast postprandial measurement disease . Such evaluation , close correlation fast postprandial lipoprotein , require study large sample size . The initiative originate Division Epidemiology Clinical Applications input Division Heart Vascular Diseases two Divisions ' Advisory Groups approve May 1989 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release September 1989 . Awards make July 1990 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Columbia University : Cases control recruited individual undergo electrocardiographic examination thallium stress test . Blood take eight hour period ingestion fat-formula meal . Plasma level lipid , lipoprotein , apoproteins , lipolytic enzyme activity , glucose , insulin measure . Apo E phenotype LDL size also determine . These factor , along sex , age , blood pressure , smoke status , waist-hip ratio use covariates analysis . Postprandial remnant lipoprotein also characterize . University North Carolina : Participants administer establish standardized fat challenge test contain vitamin A . Food frequency history also take . Blood specimens drawn fast 3.5 9 hour test meal . Various parameter fast postprandial lipemia , well marker intestinal hepatic triglyceride-rich lipoprotein measure . There five consortium associate study : University Minnesota , Johns Hopkins University , University Mississippi , Bowman Gray School Medicine , Baylor College Medicine .</detailed_description>
