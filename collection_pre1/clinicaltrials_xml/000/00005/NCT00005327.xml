	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cerebral infarction major contributor childhood morbidity mortality sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator test hypothesis young child SCA experience variable period asymptomatic progressive central nervous system ( CNS ) vasculopathy prior cerebral infarction ; pre-infarct CNS vasculopathy could identify non-invasive image technique : MRI , magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ; therapeutic intervention stage disease could significantly reduce subsequent occurrence cerebral infarction . MRI , MRA , TCD , standardize neurologic psychometric examination perform yearly cohort homozygous Hb SS child enrol 2-4 year age . Subjects without MRI evidence cerebral infarction significant cerebral vasculopathy ( cerebral arterial stenosis MRA and/or elevate blood flow velocity TCD ) randomize receive either therapy chronic transfusion therapy , order determine risk subsequent cerebral infarction untreated subject abnormality , extent transfusion therapy could significantly reduce risk . Subjects evidence prior cerebral infarction MRI , whether symptomatic asymptomatic , randomized receive either chronic transfusion therapy alone ( 'standard therapy ' ) chronic transfusion therapy plus ticlopidine , order determine whether ticlopidine could significantly increase efficacy standard therapy prevent recurrent cerebral infarction SCA . Subjects prior cerebral infarction also offer option bone marrow transplantation HLA-identical non-SS sibling donor available .</detailed_description>
