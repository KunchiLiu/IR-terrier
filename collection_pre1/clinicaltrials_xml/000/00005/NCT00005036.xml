	<brief_title>Irinotecan Compared With Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether advanced colorectal carcinoma patient previously treat 5-FU , overall survival patient treat OXAL + 5-FU + CF follow CPT-11 equivalent survival patient treat CPT-11 follow OXAL + 5-FU + CF . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation time tumor progression , time treatment failure , toxicity treatment , overall response rate patient treat two regimen . II . To compare quality-of-life measurement patient treat two regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord performance status ( ECOG 0-1 v 2 ) , primary indicator lesion ( hepatic v pulmonary v ) , age ( le 65 v least 65 year ) , alkaline phosphatase ( le 2 v least 2 time ULN ) , fluorouracil failure ( adjuvant v metastatic ) , membership ( intergroup v expand participation project ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 2 , fluorouracil IV bolus follow IV infusion 22 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience progression toxicity initial regimen may crossover regimen . At least 3 week must elapse regimen . Quality life assess baseline , prior chemotherapy course , crossover , end study . Patients follow every 6 month 3 year death .</detailed_description>
