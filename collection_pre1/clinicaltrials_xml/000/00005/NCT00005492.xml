	<brief_title>Pooled Analysis NHANES I/II -- Race , Gender , CHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over last 25 year , sustain marked decline death rate coronary heart disease ( CHD ) occur major segment U.S. population . Recently , however , decline proceed less rapidly black white , woman men . These trend focus attention possible heterogeneity risk factor pattern among demographic sub-groups . Previous study CHD risk factor black white use First National Health Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study ( NHEFS-I , 11-year follow-up ) , include group 's work , demonstrate potential strength , time founder problem low statistical power . With extension follow-up NHANES-I cohort ( 1971-1974 ) 1987 ( 14 year ) completion 14-year follow-up NHANES II cohort ( 1976-1980 ) , strong rationale exists undertake `` pool project . '' The result data set would provide optimal characterization CHD risk national level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study seek determine whether data NHANES I NHANES II could pool . To accomplish , distribution baseline measure assess determination make whether logistic prediction equation fit study . Also , gender-race difference examine individual exposure-outcome relationship , pattern co-morbidity , population attributable risk . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
