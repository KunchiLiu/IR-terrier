	<brief_title>AIDS-Associated Heart Disease -- Incidence Etiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular abnormality report Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) clinically , echocardiographically autopsy . Pericardial effusion , cardiac tamponade , echocardiographic abnormality clinical cardiomyopathy right left-sided congestive heart failure report isolated case report small retrospective series patient AIDS echocardiogram . The frequency abnormality specifically related AIDS find consecutively studied patient know 1988 study begin . The etiology abnormality also unclear . Since HIV infection result profound suppression T-cell macrophage-mediated immunity AIDS since significant abnormality B-cell lymphocyte function result abnormality humoral immunity , frequently life threaten superinfection bacterial , fungal , parasitic , viral organism . Some , herpes simplex , cytomegalovirus , cryptococcosis , toxoplasmosis histoplasmosis , know cause pericarditis myocarditis absence AIDS presence definite myocardial disease AIDS prove disease due HIV organism . Using echocardiography study cardiac structure function small series patient AIDS , abnormality identify 25 75 percent patient . All study retrospective ; none prospective control . Furthermore , type echocardiographic abnormality describe include presence pericardial fluid , mitral valve prolapse , chamber size abnormality , wall motion abnormality . Although abnormality could due infection HIV organism many possible reason echocardiographic abnormality . Among AIDS patient high incidence intravenous drug alcohol abuse , patient cardiac abnormality common . Since echocardiographic study compare HIV antibody- positive group patient appropriate control , know whether high report incidence echocardiographic abnormality relate specifically HIV infection , superinfection organism , related factor AIDS . This project part Institute-initiated study AIDS-Associated Heart Disease Adults . In September 1987 concept approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council Request Applications release . Awards make July 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients recruit in-patient out-patient clinic ward San Francisco General Hospital Moffitt-Long Hospitals . A medical history obtain physical examination conduct included electrocardiogram , chest x-rays Doppler echocardiogram . All study repeat every four month four year HIV-positive group . If clinical evidence cardiac disease appear , study include chest x-ray repeated time . If normal systolic function patient definite leave ventricular failure , radionuclide angiogram obtain evaluate leave ventricular diastolic function . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
