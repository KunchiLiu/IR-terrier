	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study , begin 1991 , focus gene influence lipoprotein profile member randomly ascertain Mexican-American family , particular emphasis genetic effect reverse cholesterol transport . An overall objective investigate pleiotropic effect `` lipoprotein gene '' interaction gene affect non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) antecedents body fat distribution . The interaction lipoprotein gene sex hormonal status environmental risk factor diet , exercise , smoking investigate . Genetic effect standard lipoprotein variable examine , e.g . plasma concentration lipoproteins apolipoproteins . Several novel lipoprotein phenotype also analyze , e.g . amount esterify unesterified cholesterol specific apolipoproteins lipoprotein subclass . Molecular , biochemical , statistical genetic approach use detect , localize characterize gene influence quantitative phenotype associate lipoprotein , NIDDM , obesity , quantify effect know candidate locus phenotype . The study renew 1997 . The subprojects describe summary statement follow . In Project 1 , gene mapping perform gene influence quantitative phenotype relate development atherosclerosis Mexican American family San Antonio Family Heart Study . A genomic search use 10 centimorgan map 3 91 short tandem report marker distribute throughout genome use determine chromosomal location six major gene influence HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , apo A1 , apob , SHBC , DHEAS . Evidence major gene effect seek lipoprotein phenotypes major gene yet detect . Genetic effect carotid fibrinolysis phenotype quantify use data recall 750 family member . Full pedigree variance component analysis well penetrance-based method use genomic search determine chromosomal location gene influence phenotype . To improve genetic model , strengthen evidence linkage , reduce number false positive , GxE interaction pleiotropic epistatic effect major gene quantify . In Project 2 , genome-wide search carry localize gene contribute quantitative variation trait relate atherosclerosis , NIDDM , obesity . The first , primary task genotyping 1,400 pedigree member 391 short tandem repeat ( STR ) marker use semi-automated , fluorescence base genotyping ABI automatic sequencer . When statistical evidence linkage evaluate Projects 1 3 confirmed , `` additional STRs '' type region localize gene . The initial map 10 centimorgan resolution . Multipoint linkage analysis gametic disequilibrium analysis use localize region contain gene interest . The human gene map consult identify candidate gene region , gene subject detailed molecular analysis identify structural functional difference underlie observe allelic effect . In Project 3 , genetic determinant NIDDM obesity determine effect gene specify lipoprotein , carotid wall thickness , phenotypes pertain cardiovascular risk . Core A , Field Clinical Operations five aim . The first reexamine 750 original study participant near sixth anniversary baseline exam . The second update demographic information , medical history , physical activity dietary habit . The third aim perform oral glucose tolerance test insulin measurement obtain fasting blood specimen project labs . The fourth perform B-mode ultrasonography exams internal carotid artery . The fifth construct computerize data file contain data . Core B , Computing Data Management , provide database management genotypic/phenotypic data , clinical interview data , pedigree base data . Core C , Clinical Phenotypes Resources , perform analysis measure LDL particle size frozen sample original 1,588 sample , measure LP ( A ) concentration performs apo ( ) phenotyping recall sample , measure plasma lipid HDL cholesterol recall sample , contract measurement fibrinolytic endpoint recall sample . Core D Administation Core .</detailed_description>
