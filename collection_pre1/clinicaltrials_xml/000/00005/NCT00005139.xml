	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart disease , coronary heart disease main form , stroke respectively first third common cause death Unites States . Hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , cigarette smoking demonstrate major risk factor coronary heart disease stroke . The first three risk factor suggest determined degree genetic factor . In 1975 National Heart Lung Institute convene Task Force Genetic Factors Atherosclerotic Disease review known field identify fruitful research priorities future study . The Task Force recommend utilizing exist genealogical file , sample study large kindred general population , evaluate genetic modifying factor , encourage collaborative study epidemiologist , biostatisticians population geneticist . The Utah population well suit study coronary prone pedigree . The high birth rate polygamy ancestral founder state produce large pedigree . Pedigrees relatively easy find trace available genealogical record . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A computer data base Utah resident develop include 1.2 million person genealogical file , 240,000 person death certificate file 120,000 person Health Family Tree questionnaire file . Over 1,400 person member 21 coronary prone pedigree clinically screen . Death certificate file use identify early coronary death define age 55 men age 65 woman . Mail phone contact make survive offspring , spouse , sibling decease proband determine risk factor profile probands close relative . Hospital chart also abstract assess risk factor profile probands . Clinical screen relative coronary probands conduct use detailed protocol assess standard coronary risk factor . Fasting blood test obtain total cholesterol , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein , apo B , apo A-1 , apo E. At clinical screening , information obtain relationship , date place vital event index person , spouse , offspring , sibling , parent , aunt uncle , grandparent , grand aunt uncle , great-grandparents . Information obtain blood pressure , height , weight , electrocardiogram , physician 's history physical examination . Information also collect tobacco alcohol use , hospitalization , medication usage , socioeconomic status , Type A personality , physical activity , reproductive history . Beginning 1983 investigator expand collection computerize detailed family history family high school student participate Health Family Trees , require health education course . Using Health Family Trees , sibling identify two sibling early coronary heart disease . The information Health Family Trees validate contact affected relative collect hospital data . These individual attend clinic screening . Detailed biochemical analysis blood sample individual compare find abnormality occur sibling coronary heart disease identify specific subtypes inherit early coronary disease . Testing genetic linkage DNA marker apolipoproteins specific abnormality also do . Healthy age-sex match control least three sibling coronary heart disease sibling parent serve control .</detailed_description>
