	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A major component prevention treatment coronary heart disease attenuation major underlie process , atherosclerosis , bring myocardial ischemia . In explore determinant atherosclerosis , diet-heart hypothesis emerge . Simply state , hypothesis excessive ingestion dietary fat , notably total fat , saturate fat cholesterol lower intake nutrient include unsaturated fatty acid possibly soluble fiber lead elevation serum LDL-cholesterol cause atherosclerosis . Support diet-heart hypothesis available epidemiologic , laboratory , clinical research . In spite broad range data support diet-heart hypothesis , importance diet often challenge . Cited controversy population-based , cross-sectional study provide conflict data . Several study include early report Framingham Tecumseh Study fail cross-sectional analysis link dietary variable serum cholesterol , lipoproteins coronary heart disease rate . The genetic possible dietary homogeneity population methodological weakness inherent singe serum cholesterol dietary assessment pose possible explanation differ result . Difficulties confirm diet-heart hypothesis across exist literature may arise several reason : methodological problem inherent estimate nutrient intake ; difficulty associate characterize behavior complex food purchasing ; wide intraindividual variation nutrient intake make single day estimate nutrient intake difficult interpret ; dissimilarity among dietary data collection technique ; vary length followup observation outcome variable longitudinal epidemiologic study ; differ method lipid measurement lack lipoprotein subfractionation . The Framingham data provide unique opportunity test diet-heart hypothesis cross-sectionally longitudinally , develop model study diet heart disease relationship , establish importance dietary variable atherogenesis morbidity mortality heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The association nutritional variable major atherogenic risk factor include dyslipidemia , elevate blood pressure , impair glucose tolerance , overweight investigate cross-sectionally total Framingham Offspring Study cohort 3,800 . The independent , quantitative effect dietary factor prediction cardiovascular morbidity mortality explore longitudinally two sample original Framingham cohort 20 30 year follow-up . Six major step follow set analysis : dimension reduction use cluster factor analysis ; zero order independent nutrition variable analysis ; stepwise multiple regression independent variable ; specification overall regression model ; stability validity test ; addition intervening variable use multiple regression technique . Multivariate analyse dependent variable conduct determine association interaction among variable . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
