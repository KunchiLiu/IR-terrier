	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite many improvement neonatal intensive care decade 1977 1987 , infant respiratory distress syndrome remain major public health problem . Increasing survival among premature infant lead emergence BPD major chronic respiratory disorder infancy . The vast majority BPD occur low birth weight infant weigh less 1,500 gram . Although incidence low birth weight birth decline 1977 1987 , rate low birth weight birth remain unchanged . These infant relative risk neonatal death almost 200 time great full-term infant . Among survivor , eight percent evidence chronic pulmonary disease forty week age . The Institute Medicine report low birth weight infant survive one year age hospitalize average 57 day birth versus 3.5 day full-term infant . Up forty percent infant would re-hospitalized almost two time average 16 day versus 8.7 percent normal birth weight infant average 8 day . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study nest case-control design . In first year project , diagnosis BPD standardize score system develop grade severity disease . Baseline data collect low birth weight neonate admit seven participate neonatal intensive care unit . Maternal interview conduct neonate survive seven day . The purpose interview collect information ; ight relate predisposition BPD , respiratory distress syndrome , prematurity . Specific area address included familial disease general respiratory disease particular , familial pattern prematurity , pregnancy birth history , circumstance surround delivery , environmental exposure , health habit smoking , socioeconomic variable . Severity score diagnosis infant base hospital log routine x-ray . Final analysis compare infant BPD without BPD , control confounders place special emphasis interaction effect . Full-term neonate serve control . The study renew 1994 order re-contact age 4-5 , exist cohort 634 child birth weight 1501 gram . This cohort unique representative low birth weight survivor geographic area , born time period rapid advance neonatal care ( Aug 1 , 1988-June 30 , 1991 ) . These child enrol admission 6 neonatal intensive care unit ( NlCUs ) Wisconsin Iowa , extensive data already collect . The re-contact consist telephone interview parent , include standardized functional assessment . Information health care major diagnosis also collect verified medical record abstracting . Information socioeconomic insurance status obtain . The study respond need global assessment low birth weight survivor , since previous study United States focus specific morbidity outcome . Special feature already exist data include score respiratory distress syndrome bronchopulmonary dysplasia severity new validate severity index , baseline family health history information perinatal data . The cohort also span time period general availability exogenous surfactant availability investigational new drug ( 8/1/89 ) availability marketing ( 8/1/90 ) . The study therefore provide opportunity investigate long term effectiveness new therapy unselected NlCU population . The data analyze describe overall status cohort , examine trend outcomes across time period , find predictor outcome among neonatal socioeconomic indicator investigate whether variability center . The study renew 1998 continue follow-up cohort 403 low birth weight neonatal care survivor , bear August 1988-June1991 . The time period birth include approval date surfactant therapy . Hence , first child treat surfactant general neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) enter school age , provide opportunity evaluate school performance ass true chronicity respiratory limitation . A large NICU follow-up data base cohort contain extensive baseline assessment respiratory disease , neonatal treatment diagnosis , well functional assessment , health status health care utilization age 4-6 . The addition data age 10 confirm dispute finding functional outcome may lower among child bear surfactant release marketing , prevalence long-term respiratory problem remain . The new outcome data collect include school performance school record parent teacher questionnaire , respiratory function peak flow meter respiratory symptom medication parent interview questionnaire . The study renew 2002 continue research evolving risk factor outcomes bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) neonatal condition low birth weight ( VLBW , &lt; 1500g ) infant child . The renewal comprehensively document neonatal early childhood course outcomes VLBW birth Wisconsin occur calendar year 2003 2004 ( 800-850 per year ) , use establish methodology add risk factor information examine currently propose inflammatory hypotheses BPD etiology . The study also implement validate new diagnostic criterion severity BPD develop recent NIH workshop .</detailed_description>
