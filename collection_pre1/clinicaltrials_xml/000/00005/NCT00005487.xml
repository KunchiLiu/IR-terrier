	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : To study relationship risk factor atherosclerosis avoid bias involve rely solely clinical disease outcome , objective unbiased measure cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) introduce NHLBI-initiated epidemiologic study CVD etiology . Two well-developed example include echocardiography carotid ultrasound . The observation risk subsequent cardiovascular event mortality increase 1.5 2-fold per 50 gm/m echocardiographically-defined leave ventricular mass Framingham lead inclusion echocardiographic LV mass assessment several population sample . Development validation duplex ultrasound image measure atherosclerosis provide first time method visualize atherosclerotic process level vessel wall suitable application population-based study . Use carotid ultrasound Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) Study demonstrate strong relationship carotid wall thickness clinical CVD traditional CVD risk factor age , sex , lipid , hypertension , smoking , diabetes , obesity dietary fat . Using powerful nested case-control design , atherosclerosis case non-atherosclerotic control select entire population distribution wall thickness , ARIC also demonstrate strong association carotid atherosclerosis Lp ( ) Lp ( ) phenotypes , antibody infectious agent , fibrinolytic factor inflammatory factor , cellular adhesion molecule , homocysteine level , dietary magnesium antioxidant . Carotid ultrasound echocardiography also include Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) quickly demonstrate bear strong relationship overt CVD old population sample , associate many conventional CVD risk factor , strong predictor subsequent overt cardiovascular event . More importantly , short-term risk clinical event show low non-existent absence subclinical disease . Subclinical disease measure thus enhance study CVD risk examine early stage CVD objective manner free bias related severity , diagnostic suspicion , completeness medical investigation . Because subclinical disease asymptomatic previously unknown participant , unlikely direct impact health behavior , lifestyle modification medication use , may limit detection risk relationship clinical disease . In addition , continuous nature subclinical measure greatly increase power detect risk association compare discrete measure , presence absence clinical event . Most importantly , subclinical measure permit epidemiologic investigation CVD risk focus biology CVD rather vagaries diagnosis . Application non-invasive measure ongoing prospective , population-based study demonstrate surprisingly high prevalence subclinical disease . Atherosclerotic plaque extremely common extracranial carotid artery United States men woman old 45 year detected subject low risk define traditional risk factor . Coronary calcium , specific marker coronary atherosclerosis , present 10 percent woman 30 percent men age 30-39 increase prevalence age . One-sixth men nearly one-fifth woman Framingham echocardiographically define leave ventricular hypertrophy , 30 percent person age 65 CHS MRI-defined cerebral infarct . Standardized measure retinal arteriovenous nicking , strongly associate hypertension cerebral infarction , present 14 percent middle-aged ARIC participant . Quantitative retinal arteriolar narrowing increase across entire range blood pressure , even person receive effective antihypertensive therapy , may provide integrated measure duration severity hypertension . Risk associate subclinical disease measure show grade continuous ( similar risk associate conventional CVD risk factor hypertension cholesterol ) rather demonstrate threshold level risk increase sharply . This suggest intervention yield even modest reduction level subclinical disease explore potential impact reduce CVD risk . To design intervention , factor contribute development progression subclinical disease must identify . The recognition plaque rupture key event coronary thrombosis plaque rupture tend subcritical stenosis associate lipid-laden lesion shift focus etiologic research factor lead formation rupture unstable plaque , inflammation impair endothelial function . Inflammatory infectious factor long know associate CVD epidemiologic study recognition importance plaque rupture provide plausible mechanism relationship . Continued research inflammation CVD risk population thus provide promising avenue elucidate mechanism plaque rupture . It also exemplify cyclical complementary nature risk factor identification population experimental study , progress clinical event population level tissue cellular level experimentally , back tissue population level study subclinical disease . The project originate Epidemiology Biometry Program Division Epidemiology Clinical Applications . The concept derive NHLBI Task Force Research Epidemiology Prevention convene 1993 , investigation subclinical disease progression clinical disease recommend major focus future NHLBI population study . This follow Special Emphasis Panel Longitudinal Cohort Studies June 1995 , strongly recommend study base subclinical disease measure , inclusion underrepresented minority , particularly Hispanics , population base research . A subsequent Special Emphasis Panel Use Cardiac EBCT MRI Epidemiologic Studies Cardiovascular Disease June 1996 , recommend inclusion carotid cardiac MRI EBCT elucidate progression subclinical clinical disease identify subclinical disease characteristic strongly associate increase risk . In November 1997 , Requests Proposals release Coordinating Center , Field Centers , Special Laboratory Center , Ultrasonography Reading Center , Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reading Center , Electron Beam Computed Tomography Reading Center . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Participants recruit Field Centers screen evidence subclinical coronary atherosclerosis , use electron-beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) another noninvasive measure subclinical disease , coronary risk factor . A sample high risk coronary heart disease event , within define age- , sex- ethnicity-strata age- , sex- , ethnicity- , center-matched sample participant represent normal spectrum subclinical coronary disease reexamine depth approximately six month later evidence subclinical disease characterization possible precursor disease event . The cohort characterize respect coronary calcification ( use compute tomographic scanning ) , ventricular mass function ( use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ) , flow-mediated endothelial function , carotid intimal-medial wall thickness distensibility carotid artery ( use ultrasonography ) , low extremity vascular insufficiency ( use ankle-brachial blood pressure index ) , electrocardiographic measure , standard coronary risk factor , sociodemographic factor , lifestyle factor , psychosocial factor . Blood sample assay putative biochemical risk factor store case-control study . DNA extract lymphocyte immortalize study candidate gene possibly genome-wide scanning . Four clinical examination , 18 24 month apart , plan . Exam 2 , begin September 2002 end January 2004 , include repeat coronary calcification measure carotid MRI subset cohort . Exam 3 underway . A second cardiac compute tomography perform cohort Exams 2 3 . Because study provide examination result participant physician , expect significant amount clinical intervention individual , depend severity disease , acceptance test result medical community , aggressiveness individual treating physician . The study collect information nature magnitude intervention control analyse . Approximately 15 percent high risk participant select comprehensive examination follow-up . Assuming large proportion high risk participant refer intervention substantially modify risk , effective sample size accounting intervention effect assume 10 percent , rather 15 percent . All participant follow identification characterization cardiovascular disease event , include acute myocardial infarction form coronary heart disease , stroke , congestive heart failure ; mortality ; cardiovascular disease intervention receive . The study involve seven Field Centers , Coordinating Center ( subcontract Central Lipid Laboratory ) , Special Laboratory Center ; separate Reading Centers Ultrasonography , Magnetic Resonance Imaging , Electron Beam Computed Tomography ( EBCT ) . The MESA expand 2003 MESA Family Study add . The purpose MESA Family study locate identify gene contribute sub-clinical cardiovascular disease United States minority population . These goal address study 2700 individual 900 sibships ( sibtrios large ) , evenly distribute among African-Americans Hispanic Americans , utilize exist framework NHLBI Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . In Aim 1 , MESA Family Study determine extent genetic contribution variation coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) ( EBCT helical-gated CT scan ) intimal medial thickness ( IMT ) ( B-mode ultrasound ) two population . This aim accomplish examination ( phenotyping ) 1800 sibling 900 MESA index case ( evenly divide African-Americans Hispanic-Americans ) . In Aim 2 , biological candidate region human genome link quantitative sub-clinical cardiovascular disease trait ( coronary calcium IMT ) identify genome scan approach , include fine mapping best region . This aim use MESA Study resource ( Data Coordination Center , Central Laboratory , CT Ultrasound Reading Center , 6 Clinical Field Centers ) combine resource cardiovascular genetic epidemiology expertise Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Wake-Forest School Medicine . In Aim 3 , gene localization identification accomplish association study positional well biological candidate gene subject 3 minority population MESA ( African-Americans , Hispanic-Americans , Chinese-Americans ) . Whereas purpose MESA ( parent study ) ass sub-clinical CVD identify epidemiological risk factor multi-ethnic population , purpose MESA Family Study identify gene ( quantitative trait locus , QTLs ) contribute sub-clinical CVD risk factor . In combination traditional risk factor assessment , identify inherited marker useful management patient vascular disease . These result permit targeted diagnostic test pharmacologic intervention , identification subject could benefit specific prevention protocol result increase overall well US population .
