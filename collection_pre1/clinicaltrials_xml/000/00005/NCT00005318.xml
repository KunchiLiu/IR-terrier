	<brief_title>ARDS - Clinical Epidemiology Role Inflammatory Response - SCOR Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The result provide : ) well understanding evolution inflammation clinical condition lead lung injury ; b ) well understand mechanisms initial injury propagation ; c ) information help predict course outcome individual patient . These data useful guiding choice time specific therapeutic intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study subproject within Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Acute Lung Injury . Leonard Hudson subproject principal investigator . The epidemiological aspect focus refine clinical criterion predict patient high risk onset ARDS , identify patient early possible onset lung injury . The major hypothesis uncontrolled sustained alveolar inflammation increase severity ARDS prolong course , sustain inflammation likely occur ARDS follow sepsis syndrome multiple trauma . The investigator also test hypothesis pattern inflammatory response blood lung important determinant whether lung inflammation persist resolve . Important component inflammatory response study include ; 1 ) coordinate sequence cytokine blood lung lavage fluid ; 2 ) expression adhesion molecule blood leukocyte ; 3 ) circulate marker diffuse endothelial injury ( VWF ELAM1 ) ; 4 ) product arachidonic acid cascade ; 5 ) induction endogenous protein modify host response bacterial product endotoxin ; 6 ) inflammatory cell population proteins lung . Patterns inflammation correlate clinical risk , critical clinical event , outcome measure . The study renew 1999 : develop clinical prediction tool provide individual risk assessment onset outcome lung injury ; determine incidence outcome acute lung injury / adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) population beyond single institution ; determine relationship inflammatory response injury lung endothelial epithelial barrier ; investigate determinant host susceptibility modulate occurrence ALI/ARDS patient risk .</detailed_description>
