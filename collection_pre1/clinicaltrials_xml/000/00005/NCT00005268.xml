	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension , complex disease involve interplay genetic environmental factor , affect estimate 50 million Americans major predispose factor myocardial infarction , vascular disease , stroke , renal failure . It estimate segregation analysis twin study approximately 45 percent interindividual difference blood pressure account genetic difference . The identification gene whose variant contribute high blood pressure far-reaching effect understand pathophysiology circulation may suggest new preventive measure rational therapeutic approach . One principal advantage genetic approach identifies primary molecular defect . As result , possible stratify general hypertensive population subgroup base genotype intermediate phenotype thereby evaluate preventive strategy therapeutic approach homogeneous group . In addition , identification hypertensive gene also provide basis understand interaction gene environmental factor . It likely particular environmental variable exert effect presence certain genotype . Until recently , technique dissect genetic determinant high blood pressure available developed extent would make Family Blood Pressure Program initiative feasible . However , several recent advance technology analytical method , together rapid construction genetic map , substantially improve chance detect genetic factor . The concept Family Blood Pressure Program conceive Report Expert Panel Genetic Strategies Heart , Lung , Blood Diseases . The initiative approve Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee ( AHLMAC ) March , 1993 . The genetic-epidemiological aspect approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee ( CAPAC ) February , 1993 . The Request Applications release March , 1994 . Awards make September , 1995 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The network consist five center : two field center , rat genotyping center , human genotyping center statistical genetics informatics , genetic analysis center . After genetic locus regulate blood pressure identify , genomic marker use study genetic linkage red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport , hyperkinetic hyperadrenergic state , renin-angiotensin system sibships test several Black population . The well-characterized Tecumseh population utilize first step determine genetic linkage hypertension , use quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) approach . A total 250 white sibships Tecumseh population examine use 400 anonymous marker candidate gene . Approximately 100 marker demonstrate linkage use examine 250 African-American sibships Maywood , Illinois . Fifty refine candidate marker use study several extant Black population Jamaica Nigeria , well individual two population . A unique feature network inclusion rat genotyping center . Crosses inbred hypertensive normotensive rat use identify genomic region link hypertension . The region use identify homologous human candidate gene addition already select previous research . The GenNet Network renew September 2000 continue study hypertension-associated phenotype United States white , African Americans , Mexican Americans , West Africans Caribbeans . The Family Blood Pressure Program whole carry five specific aim renewal period . These aim group accord two complementary theme : First , investigator create analyzed database blood pressure-related phenotype genotype data FBPP participant ( Aim 1 ) . Within link region , identify allelic variation within positional candidate gene evaluate relationship polymorphism blood pressure level hypertension status ( Aims 2 3 ) . Second , use quantitative measure target organ damage identify gene influence susceptibility develop hypertensive heart kidney disease ( Aims 4 5 ) . In addition Program specific aim , network , include GenNet , carry specific aim alone , base unique aspect population interest expertise investigator . In GenNet , progress make identification single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene work underway develop rapid genotyping method individual pool sample . The search gene diverse human population complement map study rat strain , link region overlap region show evidence linkage human study select positional cloning . In next phase FBPP end August , 2008 , major emphasis place make Program share resource hypertension researcher United States throughout world . In Aim 1 , investigator build , maintain update publicly available knowledge-base facilitate research non-FBPP investigator genetics hypertension , risk factor complication . In Aim 2 , use state-of-the-art genetic linkage analysis method identify additional linkage region use subgroup pedigree physiologically relevant combination phenotype aid localize hypertension gene . In Aim 3 , use combination bioinformatics , dense array SNPs , state-of-the-art data analysis follow-up region interest identify underlie hypertension gene . The region followed-up include identify current phase FBPP Aim 2 renewal phase . In Aim 4 , evaluate hypertension gene identify Aim 3 association multiple measure reflect cardiovascular renal complication hypertension , include leave ventricular mass microalbuminuria . It long-term goal FBPP hypertension genetics community develop comprehensive picture genetic architecture human hypertension , include risk factor , complication , response treatment .</detailed_description>
