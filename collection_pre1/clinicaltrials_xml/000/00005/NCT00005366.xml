	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension prevalent Black white men , prevalent men woman . Furthermore , even control blood pressure , concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy , early structural adaptation hypertension , prevalent Black white men , prevalent men woman . Concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy strong predictor , age , cardiovascular morbidity associate high blood pressure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In biracial sample , concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy concentric remodelling assessed echocardiographic measure leave ventricular mass relative wall thickness . Laboratory procedure use : ( ) assess hemodynamic neurohumoral response exposure diverse battery physical psychological stressor , ; ( ii ) evaluate alpha beta adrenergic receptor responsiveness , baroreceptor reflex gain minimal forearm vascular resistance . Since blood pressure typical workday establish predictor leave ventricular hypertrophy , also assess . A new biobehavioral model test implicated hemodynamic pattern behaviorally-evoked pressor response pathogenesis concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy . One prediction model predisposition exhibit increase vascular resistance stress ( characteristic black men ) would favor development concentric hypertrophy . Thus , systemic vascular resistance response , evaluate laboratory , hypothesize independently predict leave ventricular mass relative wall thickness , even control establish risk factor , include workday blood pressure . Sympathetic nervous system function examine test hypothesize mechanisms responsible race gender difference hemodynamic pattern blood pressure regulation . The result study emphasize importance race gender prescribe pharmacological and/or behavioral treatment hypertensive heart disease . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
