	<brief_title>Evaluation Low Literacy CVD Nutrition Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The setting study Minnesota Extension Service 's Expanded Food Nutrition Education Program ( EFNEP ) , U.S. Department Agriculture-funded program improve nutrition knowledge behavior low-income individual responsible food preparation . The emphasis EFNEP obtain adequate nutritious food , dietary behavior prevention chronic disease . Because large proportion population 8th grade education ( 30.9 percent nationally ) , EFNEP provide access individual low literacy skill need nutrition education disease prevention . For example , pilot study indicate 34 42 respondent never blood cholesterol level check . The study part NHLBI initiative `` CVD Nutrition Education Low Literacy Skills '' . The initiative originate within Prevention Demonstration Branch DECA , approve September 1988 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council , release July 1990 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study develop education strategy use focus group Minnesota Extension Service 's Expanded Food Nutrition Education Program ( EFNEP ) program participant EFNEP paraprofessional deliver program . The intent focus group identify concern , interest , barrier , perceive needs nutrition education cardiovascular disease prevention . This information use develop effective education strategy address need study participant , accomplish study goal effect dietary change ( specifically , decrease dietary fat cholesterol intake ) cardiovascular disease risk reduction . The effectiveness nutrition education program evaluate randomized trial , pre- post-intervention measure dietary fat intake plasma total HDL cholesterol outcome measure . The study conduct Hennepin , Ramsey Dakota Counties , total adult EFNEP enrollment 1,842 people . Because EFNEP enrollment predominantly female ( 94 percent ) , study limit adult woman , age 18 old . All 22 EFNEP paraprofessional county randomize intervention control group . Randomization level paraprofessional simplify program delivery minimize contamination intervention control group . The differential change fat intake plasma cholesterol level intervention control group estimate use analysis covariance , adjust within paraprofessional correlation potential confounders . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
