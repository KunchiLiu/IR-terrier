	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study subproject Specialized Center Research Cardiopulmonary Disorders Sleep . Frequent sleep-related respiratory disturbance ( SRRD ) recognize occur many 70 percent elderly 15 percent middle-aged subject . Although widely agree subject obvious daytime sleepiness occur association severe obstructive sleep apnea ( Respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) &gt; 30 ) benefit treatment sleep disorder ; consensus ( paucity data ) regard treatment benefit subject less profound disorder . Rational utilization health care resource diagnosis treatment sleep apnea require assessment whether adverse health effect occur consequence mild moderate level SRRD , whether health effect may reversible treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The neuropsychological performance , sleepiness general functional status evaluate 330 subject , include subject little apneic activity ( RDI &lt; 5 ) , mild activity ( RDI 5-14 ) , moderate activity ( RDI 15-25 ) . Of subject , 75 percent select clinic-based sample , 25 percent recruit ongoing population-based study . 150 subject mild moderate activity randomize receive 'conservative ' medical therapy ( CMT ) CMT plus nasal continuous positive air pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . Simple statistic , well multivariate technique , use determine relationship SRRD ( associate hypoxemia , sleep fragmentation , physiological sleepiness ) : ) intellectual ability , attention vigilance , psychomotor performance , learn memory , executive function , b ) general health status function . Potential benefit treatment specific sleep apnea subject mild moderate SRRD also determine two month CPAP therapy . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
