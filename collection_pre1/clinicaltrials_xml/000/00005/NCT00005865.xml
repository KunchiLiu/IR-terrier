	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving drug different way may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give vinorelbine mouth infusion effective treat non- small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness vinorelbine give mouth infusion treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare safety efficacy oral versus intravenous vinorelbine patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . II . Compare quality life patient treat regimen . III . Compare pharmacokinetics treatment regimens patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral vinorelbine weekly . Arm II : Patients receive vinorelbine IV 10 minute weekly . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess several time treatment 4 week treatment . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 195 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
