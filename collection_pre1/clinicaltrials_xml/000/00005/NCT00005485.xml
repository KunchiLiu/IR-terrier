	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart disease stroke remain first third lead killer Americans , disproportionate share burden borne African Americans . Cardiovascular total mortality know high among African Americans among white Americans , reason difference remain unknown . In addition , well-documented decline CVD coronary disease mortality past three decade share equally black white . Age-adjusted death rate identical group 1980 , 1994 rate among African Americans 14 % high white . The race difference magnitude coronary heart disease ( CHD ) mortality great woman men higher middle age , CHD death tend occur black 5 year earlier white . Excess cerebrovascular disease incidence mortality black even great difference note CHD . Cardiovascular mortality rate Mississippi , approximately 25 % high United States average , high United States race-sex group . Age-adjusted CVD mortality African American woman Mississippi 75 % high white woman 1994 . The mortality African American men 47 % high white men . Prevalence hypertension nearly 40 % great African Americans white sequelae frequent severe . Evidence target organ damage renal failure leave ventricular hypertrophy common black white hypertensive comparable level blood pressure . Many risk factor also common black , include diabetes , high serum lipoprotein level [ Lp ( ) ] , obesity ( woman ) . Other risk factor , elevate total cholesterol , reduce high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol , heavy cigarette smoking , common white . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Jackson Heart Study ( JHS ) initial examination , begin fall 2000 , include men woman age 35 84 , take 3 year complete . The coordinating center , locate Jackson State University , collect analyzes data . The undergraduate training center Tougaloo College offer coursework student public health epidemiology , provide practical experience health research prepare potential career field . The exam center University Mississippi responsible recruiting participant conduct examination . JHS uniquely position answer key question regard excess burden CVD among African Americans address critical shortage minority investigator train epidemiology prevention . These question answer incorporate state-of-the-art physiologic epidemiologic method stable population-based minority cohort , provide research experience , build research capability minority institution . The Second Exam begin September 2005 .</detailed_description>
