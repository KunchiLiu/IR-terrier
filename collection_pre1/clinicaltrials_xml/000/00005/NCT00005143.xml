	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The last fifty year research cardiovascular diseases show strong association individual risk factor level disease rate within among many culture . The potential medical treatment cardiovascular disease limit insidious development atherosclerosis hypertension , high immediate mortality coronary disease stroke , inadequacy treatment advance stage cardiovascular disease . All factor , couple predictable safety general feasibility individual risk factor reduction , provide stimulus develop community-wide strategy prevention cardiovascular disease . The Stanford Three Community Study , conduct 1972 1975 , Five City Project ( FCP ) design test feasibility effectiveness community-wide preventive approach . Both Three Community Study Five City Project show risk factor reduce community-wide level , particularly smoke rate blood pressure level . These study congruent contemporary study , Belgium Heart Disease Prevention Project North Karelia Project . Despite success , however , additional question . Would reduction risk translate reduction morbidity mortality ? The North Karelia Project apparently associate fall mortality Belgium Heart Disease Prevention Program . However , U.K. Heart Disease Prevention Project effective Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial reduce mortality . It appropriate responsibility scientific community inform general public implication research give advice prudent preventive measure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study quasi-experimental design two California city , Salinas Monterey , select intervention city three similar city , San Luis Obispo , Modesto , Santa Monica control city . The selection city subject several criterion include : location Northern California ; population exceed 30,000 total five city exceed 300,000 provide sufficient statistical power ; ethnic , socioeconomic demographic similarity ; independence city ; share newspaper electronic medium treatment control city share medium market treatment city ; independence two treatment city . The education program begin 1980 completion baseline population survey continue eight year . Education method include use television radio , newspaper , book , pamphlet , community program develop health department , school , voluntary organization , hospital non-profit health service agency . The effectiveness program evaluate population survey Monterey , Salinas , Modesto , San Luis Obispo Santa Monica morbidity mortality surveillance system . In initial year survey 1979-1980 , approximately 600 people community visit survey center . This comprise first independent sample community . After average 15 month , individual return survey center follow-up evaluation . This cohort sample study every year five survey determine process change cardiovascular risk relate behavior time . Five randomly-selected independent sample survey study cross-sections community time . Questionnaires dietary measure chief source data health-related behavior . The questionnaire contain component : demographic measure ; attitude opinion measure ; health knowledge assessment relate prevention heart disease stroke ; stress behavior ; diet , nutrition , weight behavior ; smoke behavior ; physical activity behavior ; communication medium use ; medical history include medication use . A random 40 percent initial sample complete 24-hour dietary recall re-administered fourth cohort survey also administer 50 percent random sample fourth independent survey . Biological measurement consist height weight , blood pressure , rest heart rate , plasma thiocyanate , total cholesterol , triglyceride cholesterol content lipoprotein subfractions , expire air carbon dioxide , urinary sodium , potassium creatinine , exercise test . Data also collect plasma apolipoprotein A-1 B high density lipoprotein subfractions 2 3 . A comprehensive dietary assessment also conduct . Community surveillance conduct allow calculation comparable , city-specific rate total mortality , cardiovascular mortality , fatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal myocardial infarction , fatal nonfatal stroke . Development community surveillance system do close collaboration Minnesota Heart Health Project Pawtucket Heart Health Project insure comparability . Only cardiovascular disease event always result hospitalization monitor included myocardial infarction stroke . Fatal case identify county death certificate file . Both fatal nonfatal hospitalized event investigate abstract medical record onto set standard form . All non-hospitalized death investigate contact decedent 's family medical history circumstance death contact decedent 's physician medical information . Data monitor severity coronary event quality care . An Acute Coronary Care form design cooperation Minnesota surveillance project MONICA project . The form field test September 1985 implement retroactively 1980 1981 case . The study renew 1992 1 ) extend morbidity mortality surveillance three year ( June 1994 event December 1992 ) ; 2 ) extend analysis publication Five City Project ( FCP ) result method ; 3 ) provide small amount incremental support enable use frozen plasma sample earlier FCP population survey conduct nest case-control study association HDL subfractions apolipoproteins fatal non-fatal cardiovascular disease . Extension surveillance data collection need insure detection impact morbidity mortality significant risk factor change occur treatment city , compare control city , 1986 . The nested case-control study involve match survey surveillance data set identify person document event participate one five population survey , identify contact potential control certain free CVD , analysis plasma sample freeze -80 degree centigrade apolipoproteins A-I B HDL2,3 subfractions . This allowed multifactor assessment association factor CVD person many variable know .</detailed_description>
