	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare treatment new drug sirolimus ( SRL ) versus standard treatment cyclosporine ( CsA ) tacrolimus child receive kidney transplant . SRL new medication may prevent body 's immune system reject organ transplant . After receive kidney transplant , body recognizes donate kidney foreign invader trigger immune system attack kidney . This lead rejection new kidney fail transplant . To help reduce risk kidney rejection , transplant patient give immunosuppressant drug , reduce body 's normal immune response allow transplant organ function . CsA tacrolimus two drug often give transplant patient . However , powerful drug , cause serious side effect put patient increase risk infection . SRL new drug show reduce transplant patient 's chance reject new kidney , without serious side effect . This study necessary test safety effectiveness SRL child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Treatment With Sirolimus Versus Standard Treatment Patients Who Have Received Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful kidney transplantation gradually improved year ; much improvement result use CsA . However , adequate tolerable immunosuppression difficult achieve CsA , rejection episode still frequent . CsA nephrotoxic , drug toxicity often mask rejection episode . Other immunosuppressant therapy result range complication , include metabolic disturbance , adrenocortical insufficiency , increase risk infection . Therefore , effective drug less toxicity need prevent acute rejection , especially pediatric population overall graft survival rate remain significantly low compare adult transplant recipient . SRL immunosuppressive agent develop prophylaxis acute renal allograft rejection . SRL unique mechanism action . It inhibit T B cell activity . In Phase I II trial adult , SRL generally well tolerate exhibit apparent nephrotoxic property , significantly low rate rejection see SRL compare placebo . Patients receive extensive prestudy screening , include renal core biopsy , chest x-ray , bone density study , blood test , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Patients randomly assign 1 2 study treatment group 2:1 ratio ( 142 patient receive SRL , CsA/tacrolimus , corticosteroids 71 patient receive standard CsA tacrolimus-based double triple drug therapy ) . SRL administer oral dose 3 mg/m2/day . Patients follow 3 year therapy , 1 month follow-up . A renal core biopsy perform time study entry Months 6 , 18 , early termination patient study . Patients undergo physical examination various blood test specify time interval 37-month study period . Efficacy assess compare composite endpoint biopsy-proven acute rejection , graft loss , death 36 month treatment . Safety assess compare composite endpoint graft loss death 36 month treatment .</detailed_description>
