	<brief_title>Prospective Assessment After Pediatric Cardiac Ablation ( PAPCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Radiofrequency catheter ablation catheterization laboratory technique cure cardiac arrhythmia , become common pediatric cardiology practice . Recent analysis suggest ablation therapy cost-effective compare surgery , also antiarrhythmic medication . Despite good initial success rate technique , low initial complication rate , concern possible long-term effect technique pediatric age group . There report damage cardiac valve , also development new arrhythmia , include sudden death , result ablation child . Recurrences observe frequently follow initially successful procedure . Finally , animal data suggest immature myocardium prone severe damage result ablation procedure . Few , , data exist support long-term safety ablation technique child . Therefore , ablation therapy become standard approach child , important carefully assess long-term risk patient group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multi-center , prospective , five-year study . The collection data intend provide follow information : 1 ) incidence serious cardiac damage result ablation ; 2 ) incidence time course recurrence initially successful ablation ; 3 ) incidence proarrhythmia follow ablation . A total 480 pediatric patient enrol prospectively evaluate ablation supraventricular tachycardia interval follow ablation clinical history examination , electrocardiogram , 24-hour Holter monitor , echocardiogram , non-invasive study read outside consultant . In addition , complete Registry pediatric patient undergoing ablation participate center establish allow comparison study group provide population estimate success complication rate .</detailed_description>
