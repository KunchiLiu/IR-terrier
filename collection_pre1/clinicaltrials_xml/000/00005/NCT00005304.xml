	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Patients classical hemophilia ( hemophilia A ) Christmas disease ( hemophilia B ) expose many hepatotropic virus course therapy . Severe chronic hepatitis among patient likely related persistent infection non-A , non-B hepatitis virus , hepatitis B virus , delta hepatitis virus , defective RNA virus dependent upon coinfection HBV essential helper function . Carriers HBV could contract acute delta hepatitis infection invariably severe illness cause HBV alone . The morbidity mortality delta hepatitis infection remarkably high . Transmission delta hepatitis agent appear follow route transmission HBV . Direct parenteral inoculation classic mode transmission HBV suggest similar mode transmission delta hepatitis . Hemophiliacs treat commercial concentrate coagulation factor prepare pool plasma great risk contract delta hepatitis infection . About 50 percent patient delta hepatitis virus antibody . Also , study small cohort indicate hepatitis delta infection major cause chronic liver disease cirrhosis . Therefore , critical need evaluate frequency effect hepatitis delta infection hemophiliac order obtain data natural history chronic liver disease , compare presume chronic non-A , non-B hepatitis B alone , combine chronic delta HBV infection . This grant award response Request Applications issue 1986 Prevalence Consequences Hepatitis Delta Infection Hemophiliacs . The concept initiative originate Blood Resources Working Group Blood Diseases Resources Advisory Committee approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council February 1985 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Both prevalence study longitudinal study conduct several center . In prevalence study , active hepatitis delta viral infection establish non-invasive serologic technique hepatitis delta virus RNA/cDNA probe detect hepatitis delta virus RNA immunoblotting method detect hepatitis delta antigen . These test avoid need liver biopsy verify infection . In longitudinal study , patient assign core auxiliary group core group sample every six month biochemical evidence liver disease auxiliary group year . Serogroups 0,3,5 , 6 participant evidence delta hepatitis infection assign core group . Those patient immune hepatitis B virus anti-hepatitis delta virus positive assign two control , match center , age , sex , hemophilia diagnosis severity , serogroups 5 without evidence hepatitis delta virus infection . Thus , role delta virus infection liver disease hepatitis delta virus immune patient evaluate . Follow-up continue four year .</detailed_description>
