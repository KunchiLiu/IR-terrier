	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess efficacy flavopiridol term response rate patient previously untreated relapsed mantle cell lymphoma . - Assess toxicity regimen patient population . - Determine time progression , responses observe , response duration patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour daily 3 day . Treatment continue every 3 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course document CR . Patients partial response receive 2 additional course document maximal tumor shrinkage . Patients stable disease receive maximum 4 course . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month relapse death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-30 patient accrue study within 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
