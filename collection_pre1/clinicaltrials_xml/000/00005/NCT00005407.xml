	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension well-recognized risk factor cardiovascular disease adult . Furthermore , many study show track among longitudinal pediatric blood pressure determination . An important unresolved goal pediatric hypertension research define level pediatric blood pressure child increase risk adult hypertension . When grant award February 1991 , two NHLBI Task Forces Blood Pressure Control Children publish report 1977 1987 . One goal task force define appropriate percentile blood pressure child . In Second Task Force Report , result nine large epidemiologic study combine data base 70,000 reading blood pressure percentiles derive function age sex . However , many research worker state height strongly relate blood pressure age urge Normative data pediatric blood pressure demarcate height rather age . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Blood pressure percentile construct function age , sex , race , height , thus provide comprehensive profile pediatric blood pressure distribution previously publish work . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
