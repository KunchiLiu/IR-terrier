	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension clearly identify major risk factor coronary heart disease stroke . Hypertension screen intervention program child base concept high normal blood pressure may childhood antecedent adult hypertension blood pressure 'tracks ' childhood , adolescence , adulthood . Blood pressure track well establish adult young adult result various study child controversial . At Symposium High Blood Pressure Young 1979 , conclude insufficient information recommend specific intervention prepubertal child blood pressure level upper percentile blood pressure distribution . Studies longer duration large population size repeat blood pressure measurement time require determine blood pressure level young age predictive adult hypertension . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Spring 1978 total 10,423 child , age 6-8 screen . A subsample invite join study blood pressure measurement . The sample select follow : child top five percent initial systolic blood pressure distribution ; child bottom five percent initial systolic blood pressure distribution ; random sample one two remain Black child ; random sample one nine remain white child ; remain child race . Included family 200 Native American child . Of 2,641 selected child , 878 refuse leave sample 1,753 . Baseline data age , race , sex , triceps skinfold thickness , dietary history , urinary sodium potassium excretion , physiological measure , life event change , medical history , demographic data body size measurement child parent collect first home interview conduct 1978 1979 . The child follow twice per year 1978 1980 1982 1985 blood pressure body size . Annual measurement make blood pressure , height , weight , skinfold thickness , body girth . Screenings continue early 1991 cohort 19-21 year age . Several substudies conduct include relationship red blood cell cation transport essential hypertension , Type A behavior assessment , familial aggregation coronary-prone behavior .
