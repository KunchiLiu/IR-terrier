	<brief_title>Seasonal Variation Blood Cholesterol Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Significant seasonal variation blood cholesterol level show number cross-sectional study , important implication national screen therapeutic guideline . However , phenomenon well study : little known etiology seasonal variation lipid subfractions . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator assess magnitude time seasonal effect total cholesterol important lipoprotein subfractions ( low-density lipoprotein , high-density lipoprotein , triglyceride , apolipoproteins AI B , lipoprotein ( ) ) sex different age . They also identify quantified effect main factor determine variation assess seasonal variation blood element think play role development coronary heart disease , include hemostatic factor antioxidant Finally , explore implication phenomenon public health policy . Baseline serial measure repeat quarterly one year . These include measure : serum lipid lipoproteins ; antioxidant vitamin ; platelet hemostatic factor ; demographic factor ; weight , waist-hip ratio , height , body mass index ( BMI ) blood pressure ; dietary intake ; physical activity ; light exposure ; psychologic factor . Meteorologic data also collect . Data collect write questionnaire use computer-assisted even telephone interview ( CATI ) , use collection dietary , physical activity individual light-exposure lifestyle data . Activity light data verify subset 80 patient use monitoring device . Analyses include method describe seasonal variation dietary , physical activity , psychologic , light exposure data repeat measure linear regression model determine role specific dietary , physical activity , psychologic , light-exposure related covariates explain variability blood lipid , antioxidant vitamin , hemostatic factor . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
