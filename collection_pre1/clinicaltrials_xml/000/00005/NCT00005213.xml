	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : CARDIA longitudinal study influence lifestyle coronary heart disease risk factor young adult post-young-adult year , time period risk cardiovascular disease think undergo crucial evolution . Four center participate study . The Chicago CARDIA population consist 1,100 Black white men woman age 18 30 baseline , diverse socioeconomic background . TOMHS two phase double-blind randomize controlled clinical trial determine whether pharmacologic therapy conjunction nutritional-hygienic intervention person mild hypertension result great reduction cardiovascular morbidity nutritional-hygienic treatment alone . Four clinical center involve Phase I . Participants randomize one six treatment group . Each group receive nutritional-hygienic treatment plus one following : placebo , diuretic , alpha blocker , beta blocker , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , calcium channel blocker . Randomization stratify assure balance within treatment group regard participant ' drug treatment status prior randomization . The primary endpoint cardiovascular morbidity . Abnormalities cellular sodium metabolism long think play role pathogenesis hypertension . Techniques measure membrane electrolyte transport rate refine , provide opportunity characterize sodium metabolism cell hypertensives . The early clinical study examine erythrocyte leukocytes easy accessibility possibility would reflect vascular tissue metabolism , document difference sodium flux hypertensives normotensives . Subsequent study support early finding abnormality membrane cation transport associate essential hypertension . The finding 1988 indicate one transport system might alter essential hypertension system affect similarly , hypertensives show change transport system study . The consistent finding observe sodium-stimulated lithium countertransport ( LCT ) . Clinical population-based study reveal mean LCT significantly elevate among hypertensive . In contrast , increase , decrease , normal mean value report sodium cotransport , increase normal mean value adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -dependent sodium-potassium pump activity . The relationship LCT blood pressure examine several study . The large epidemiological survey involve 3,800 men woman age 5 75 Gubbio , Italy . LCT significantly positively associate systolic diastolic blood pressure population control age , sex , weight , , control also factor know related blood pressure serum uric acid glucose , relationship inconsistently significant cross-sectional study . In cross-sectional research , LCT find account three percent variation blood pressure study healthy blood donor adjustment weight age . Other cross-sectional population-based study involve small number show significant relationship LCT diastolic blood pressure adolescents white adult , among Black adult ; also LCT systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , Black child white adolescent . Much data available 1988 derive small number cross-sectional study , chiefly clinical , population-based . Large sample need provide adequate power detect relationship among LCT demographic , dietary , factor . Prospective data need ass whether LCT independent risk factor future development high blood pressure people normotensive baseline , whether LCT could modify , whether change associate change blood pressure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In cross-sectional CARDIA investigation , study conduct relationship among lithium countertransport , blood pressure , factor relate blood pressure age , sex , race , weight , body mass index , pulse , dietary factor , alcohol intake , serum glucose , triglyceride , cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , uric acid , ionized total calcium . Prospective data also collect TOMHS examine whether lithium countertransport modify mild hypertension diet combination diet antihypertensive drug . Lithium countertransport assay erythrocytes second examination CARDIA baseline , 12 month , 24 month TOMHS . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
