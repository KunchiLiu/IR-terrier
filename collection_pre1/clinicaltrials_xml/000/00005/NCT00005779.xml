	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe give C4-V3 , possible HIV vaccine , alone conjunction 4 different dos interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , HIV-infected patient take anti-HIV drug lower amount HIV patient ' blood . ( This study change vaccine administer alone 4 different dos IL-12 . ) Immune cell know cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) help destroy HIV-infected cell . However , patient , CTLs decrease time . This allow HIV level rise AIDS symptom develop . The C4-V3 vaccine contain small piece HIV protein boost CTL level , allow body 's immune system fight HIV . Giving IL-12 , normal part immune system , C4-V3 may make vaccine effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Candidate Vaccine C4-V3 Alone With Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) HIV-Infected Patients Receiving Effective Anti-HIV Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses important initial decrease HIV viral load see first several month acute infection . These beneficial CTL responses diminish disease progression recover antiretroviral therapy alone . Recent study suggest vaccine may help restore CTL response . This study test effectiveness C4-V3 vaccine , synthetic peptide vaccine represent 4 epitope HIV gp120 , include HLA B7-restricted CTL epitope . Administering IL-12 , immunostimulatory cytokine , conjunction C4-V3 may enhance HIV-1 specific immune response global immune function . All patient continue antiretroviral regimen study . Twelve patient assign equally 1 3 cohort ; patient receive 4 dos C4-V3 . Cohort 1 receive C4-V3 alone ; 4 patient receive 2 dos complete 8 week treatment , toxicity data review . Barring serious adverse event , 4 patient enrol Cohort 2 receive C4-V3 plus low dose IL-12 near vaccine injection site . Once 4 patient receive 2 dos C4-V3/IL-12 complete 8 week treatment , toxicity data review . Barring serious adverse event , 4 patient enrol Cohort 3 receive C4-V3 plus high dose IL-12 administer . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/1/00 : Twenty patient assign equally 1 5 cohort ; patient receive 4 dos C4-V3 . Cohort 1 receive C4-V3 alone ; 4 patient receive 2 dos complete 6 week treatment , toxicity data review . Barring serious adverse event , 4 additional patient enrol Cohort 2 receive C4-V3 plus low dose ( dose level 1 ) IL-12 . Barring serious adverse event , 4 additional patient enrol Cohort 3 receive C4-V3 plus high dose ( dose level 2 ) IL-12 . Barring serious adverse event , 4 additional patient enrol Cohort 4 receive C4-V3 plus high dose ( dose level 3 ) IL-12 . Barring serious adverse event , 4 patient enrol Cohort 5 receive C4-V3 plus high dose ( dose level 4 ) IL-12 . ] Patients follow safety evaluation change viral load Week 48 . If toxicity relate C4-V3 IL-12 persists Week 48 , affect patient follow resolution toxicity .</detailed_description>
