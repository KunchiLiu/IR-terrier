	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The classic study daily activity prior myocardial infarction onset conduct Master 1960s fail show consistent relationship particular activity disease onset . However , conduct time less known pathophysiology myocardial infarction , less understanding effect daily activity physiologic process likely lead myocardial infarction onset , epidemiologic method less well developed present . Certain activity considerable interest , wake time , time assume upright posture , eat take medication , examine examine walk heavy exertion , evaluate without reference control exposure . In addition , modern enzymatic method confirmation diagnosis acute myocardial infarction utilize . Despite deficiency , study Master provide foundation hypothesis onset myocardial infarction almost always random event . Observations morning increase incidence myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death , myocardial ischemia demonstrate timing event wholly random . The extensive data time onset pain myocardial infarction publish 1976 World Health Organization report Myocardial Infarction Community Registers 19 European center . Data 8,900 patient clearly demonstrate peak incidence onset pain 8 11 a.m. Data Multicenter Investigation Limitation Infarct Size ( MILIS ) Study reveal significant circadian variation increase incidence myocardial infarction period 6 a.m noon . The morning increase detect despite fact data concern time awaken prior medication usage lack patient population . This finding confirm Willich study 1,700 patient infarct onset determine creatine kinase timing . The patient show four-fold increased morning onset myocardial infarction relative occurrence night . When relationship infarction onset time awaken clarify , possible precipitant evaluate , increase information trigger process available . Such information assist design preventive therapy evaluate randomized trial . The Determinants Study begin 1989 , shortly widespread acceptance circadian variation Ml occurrence . The study initiate utilize state-of-the art epidemiologic technique determine role daily activity trigger Ml . The investigator create new epidemiologic technique ( case-crossover method ) , develop test 24-page interview form , establish large study group hospital train interviewer , instituted quality control measure , enrol 2,000 subject . The Triggers Ventricular Arrhythmias ( TOVA ) Study begin FY 1999 grant number Modifiers Determinants Studies . The TOVA study investigate factor associate trigger discharge implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Myocardial Infarction Onset Study ( Determinants Study ) support 1989 1993 case-control design . Coronary care unit Boston Worcester , Massachusetts area collaborate . Eligible patient interview concern : whether myocardial infarction first nature timing pain ; time wake day onset infarction time assume upright posture ; number time patient awake sleep assume upright posture night day prior myocardial infarction ; whether patient receive therapy beta-blocker aspirin time medication take 24 hour precede myocardial infarction ; age smoking status . A questionnaire administer : educational background ; marital status ; occupation ; usual activity recent past , specifically , day onset include diet , coffee consumption , smoking , exercise ; sleep habit ; geographic location infarct occur . Data also abstract medical record . Patient enrollment end fourth year . Relative risk associate hypothesized risk factor onset myocardial infarction estimate compare observed exposure frequency immediately prior myocardial infarction expect value derive exposure frequency patient time day patient time day . The grant renew 1994 November 1998 conduct new study entitle Modifiers Myocardial Infarction Onset ( Modifiers Study ) . The Modifiers Study elucidate pathophysiology acute myocardial infarction ( Ml ) onset utilized methodologic technique , 50-hospital national study group , finding complete NHLBl-funded Determinants Myocardial Infarction Onset Study ( Determinants Study ) . The Modifiers Study identify factor increase decreased susceptibility patient trigger acute Ml previously identify . It hop Modifiers Study would answer major question raise result Determinants Study . It test hypothesis concern five group factor potential modifier susceptibility trigger acute MI : l ) Pharmacologic mean Prevention - beta blocker , aspirin , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor estrogen use decrease susceptibility trigger ; 2 ) Timing - susceptibility increase morning winter , exogenous rather endogenous daily rhythm determine onset ; 3 ) Traditional chronic risk factor - diabetes , hypertension , smoke increase susceptibility regular exercise decrease susceptibility ( trigger exertion ) ; 4 ) Gender - woman less susceptible triggering ; 5 ) Dietary factor - chronic moderate alcohol use anti-oxidants decrease susceptibility . To test hypothesis , 5,700 interview need . By completion Determinants Study March 1993 , 2,000 interview complete . It estimate continuation Modifiers Study 77 interview per month would provide require 3,700 additional interview December 1997 . TOVA begin FY 1999 identify activity ( heavy exertion ) trigger ICD discharge , assess factor ( beta-blockade ) modify susceptibility triggering , determine ICD discharge occur frequently certain period ( i.e. , 3 hour awaken , Monday , winter ) , utilize electrograms record prior ICD discharge identify sympathetic activation trigger . TOVA use cohort design nest case-crossover analysis . TOVA characterize trigger episode ICD discharge 1,140 patient treat 31 center nationwide four year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
