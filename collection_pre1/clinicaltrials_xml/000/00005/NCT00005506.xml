	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study mesh longitudinal case-control study , HL-35333 , Carotid Atherosclerosis Follow-Up Study . HL-35333 comprise 280 individual old 45 equally divide men woman , half half without CAD evaluate risk factor baseline complete follow-up yearly B-mode three year . The Carotid Atherosclerosis Follow-Up Study quantify interassociations angiographically define coronary artery disease CAD risk factor progression . The NIH fund continuation effort review exist ultrasound tape study order additionally evaluate association factor extracranial carotid arterial dimension ( ECAD : interadventitial lumen diameter ) change ECAD time . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study assess brachial artery reactivity among 100 CAD subject 100 control previously enrol study relationship extracranial intima medium thickness ( ECIMT ) assess B mode ultrasonographic measurement CAD status . Most subject three consecutive B mode measurement 12 month interval . These subject brachial artery reactivity measurement accord standardize protocol . Linear regression analysis use relate brachial artery reactivity CAD status , gender risk factor predictor . Interaction effect also assess CAD status risk factor also gender risk factor . Similar analysis perform relate percent dilation ECIMT measurement . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
