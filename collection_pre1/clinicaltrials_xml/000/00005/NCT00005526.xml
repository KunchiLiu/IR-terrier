	<brief_title>Genetic Basis Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) dilatation abdominal aorta , undetected , lead rupture . The mortality associate rupture AAA estimate 90 percent , elective repair mortality risk approximately 6 percent . Ruptured AAA lead cause death among old Americans . The identification marker AAA risk could lead preventive intervention . AAA aggregate family , segregation analysis show familial risk AAA best explain segregation major gene autosomal recessive mode inheritance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Affected relative pair ( primarily sibling pair ) AAA evidence family history connective tissue disorder genotyped 150 highly informative microsatellite polymorphism mark autosomal genome resolution 20 cM . The linkage AAA locus test use robust affected pedigree member method identify genomic region might contain gene predispose individual develop AAA . The existence predispose gene ( ) confirm location refine use define search strategy , genotyping increase level resolution , re-analysis family data . The predispose gene ( ) identify combination saturation map molecular analysis candidate locus . The association AAA environmental measure investigate determine equation estimate risk relative AAA patient base upon environmental measure genotype . Power calculation base upon number structure family already collect demonstrated feasibility identify gene predispose AAA use strategy , even presence significant heterogeneity respect loci involve . In addition identify gene necessary AAA linkage analysis , series analysis association undertaken identify true susceptibility gene neither necessary sufficient cause disease , modify individual 's risk develop AAA . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
