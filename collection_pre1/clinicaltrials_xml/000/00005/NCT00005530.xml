	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Clinical study indicate high carbohydrate intake may exacerbate dyslipidemia often see insulin resistance . Consequently , much debate optimal dietary pattern individual NIDDM minimize risk microvascular disease . Data topic free-living population scarce . In addition , association dietary antioxidant CVD risk evaluate large community sample person diabetes . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Potential dietary determinant hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance evaluate , include high intake dietary fat simple sugar low alcohol consumption . As major focus , dietary factor may contribute elevate CVD risk among person exist insulin resistance , include impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) examine . Five datasets epidemiologic study available evaluate specific hypothesis men woman Black , Hispanic non-Hispanic white ethnicity . The unique contribution dataset follow . The San Luis Valley Diabetes Study San Antonio Heart Study enable prospective analysis large number subject IGT NIDDM ; Mexico City Study provide sample contrast dietary pattern non-white population ; Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study allow removal genetic influence evaluate association within monozygotic twin pair ; Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study ( IRAS ) provide direct measurement insulin sensitivity subclinical atherosclerosis across spectrum glucose tolerance three ethnic group . An understanding accuracy dietary assessment instrument use three ethnic group critical interpretation finding relate diet CVD risk variable . Therefore , second component research also conduct , evaluation comparative validity food frequency interview use multi- cultural IRAS population use series 24-hour dietary recall standard .</detailed_description>
