	<brief_title>Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Children cardiomyopathy represent dismal outcome group diseases follow pediatric cardiologist , 40 percent infant child symptomatic cardiomyopathy fail medical surgical management first year follow diagnosis . For 57 percent child cardiomyopathy , etiology know . Although pediatric cardiomyopathy common , considerable variation cause . Therefore , specific etiology , center pediatric cardiology see sufficient number patient make major advance understand group disease . The registry develop collect organize relevant data condition . Data accrue report registry lead increase awareness knowledge pediatric cardiomyopathy cause , well development new diagnostic therapeutic approach . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The registry consist prospective , population-based cohort patient New England Central Southwestern United States retrospective cohort patient diagnose 1991 1996 . Annual follow-up data collect patient . Specific hypothesis l ) period registry , percentage case diagnose idiopathic decrease ( i.e. , etiology find ) 2 ) time diagnosis cardiomyopathy , factor gender , ethnicity , age , type cardiomyopathy , presence absence syndrome help predict outcome . Definition entry exclusion criterion , clinical quality assurance , accrual retention participate clinical center largely direction University Rochester Rochester , New York Baylor College Medicine . Virtually pediatric cardiology center United States , Puerto Rico , Canada express willingness send patient information registry . The study continue May , 2010 investigate natural history cardiomyopathy transplantation , establish longitudinal cohort investigate functional status child cardiomyopathy , conduct viral genetic test assess association genetic viral marker cardiomyopathy clinical functional outcome . There three specific aim . The first expand natural history cardiomyopathy transplantation integrate Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry ( PCMR ) Pediatric Heart Transplant Study databases order examine whether cardiac transplantation modifies clinical course cardiomyopathy child . The second specific aim focus functional status pediatric cardiomyopathy patient . The study establish longitudinal course functional status child cardiomyopathy , analyze relationship clinical event outcomes . This accomplished assessment functional status pediatric cardiomyopathy patient , include subset child undergo heart transplantation , continuation current PCMR Functional Status Substudy extension study child post-transplant-period period . The third specific aim relate viral genetic test investigate genetic viral marker cardiomyopathy associate clinical functional outcome . Cardiac tissue blood sample collect 300 child cardiomyopathy viral genome genetic screen 9G4.5 gene ) use Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Repository , result correlate clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
