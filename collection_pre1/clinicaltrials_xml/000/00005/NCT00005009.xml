	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether Varivax safe use child kidney transplant whether protects child serious infection . Varivax vaccine varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , virus cause chickenpox ( varicella ) shingle ( zoster ) . Healthy child already receive Varivax shot protect chickenpox . Few child kidney transplant receive Varivax doctor concern Varivax might cause serious reaction . On hand , VZV infection life-threatening disease child . For reason , doctor ultimately want learn whether Varivax might safely prevent VZV infection child kidney transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Varivax® Pediatric Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric renal transplant patient face lifetime immunosuppressive therapy place high risk potentially life-threatening infection primary varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) . Treatment acute episode VZV infection possible expensive provide long-term protection . Furthermore , therapy overcome VZV infection lead renal graft rejection . Varivax proven safe , immunogenic , effective normal host recommend universal administration general population age 12 month . It currently label use immunocompromised patient . However , recent study pediatric leukemia pediatric renal transplant patient suggest attenuate live vaccine confer protection minimal adverse event even presence immunosuppression , provide encouragement careful study VZV immunization renal transplant patient . This study aim quantify safety immunogenicity Varivax population pediatric renal transplant patient least susceptible VZV infection , i.e. , minimal maintenance immunosuppression least 1 year transplant . Patient enrollment stag allow study physician closely monitor patient sign disseminate varicella reaction graft rejection . Initially 1 patient enrol study . If first patient reach Week 8 without severe adverse reaction , 3 study center enroll 3 additional patient . If 8 week later 3 patient severe adverse reaction , 3 study center enroll 3 patient . At end period , ascertain safety vaccine first 7 patient , study open remain center . Patients receive 2 dos Varivax 6 8 week apart . Each week 6 8 week first vaccine dose , patient undergoes venipuncture clinical assessment characterize renal graft liver function identify sign varicella infection . Additional telephone follow-up occurs Day 4 twice weekly thereafter . Parents guardian monitor patient evidence rash fever immediately report rashes fever study physician . If , 6 8 week , patient demonstrates severe reaction vaccine require antiviral therapy , patient receives second vaccine dose . The patient receives weekly on-site telephone follow-up 6 week . Other visit occur 9 week 14 week second vaccine dose 1 year first vaccine dose . At visit patient undergoes venipuncture clinical assessment identify potential rejection event varicella infection characterize VZV antibody responses cytokine change response vaccine .</detailed_description>
