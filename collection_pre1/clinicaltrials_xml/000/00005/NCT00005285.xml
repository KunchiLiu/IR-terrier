	<brief_title>Effect Maternal Smoking On Neonatal Lung Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Over past four decade , significant research effort devote understanding epidemiology pathophysiology chronic obstructive airway disease ( COPD ) adult life . Epidemiologic study uniformly identify cigarette smoke predominant risk factor occurrence COPD . Other factor socioeconomic status , environmental pollution , occupational exposure , inherent genetic susceptibility observe limited role risk factor . A number study suggest postnatal maternal cigarette smoking measurable effect lung function child . One longitudinal analysis problem child 5-19 year age identify significant effect growth FEV1 force expiratory flow 25th 75th percent volume point ( FEF25-75 ) volume-time curve . These investigator , however , point effect observe could result utero consequence maternal smoking pregnancy and/or exposure factor severe respiratory illness document occur increase frequency early infancy measure study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Pregnant woman identify first trimester follow monthly . Assessments make smoke habit , urinary cotinine measurement , general medical condition , status pregnancy . Within two week birth infant evaluate partial forced expiratory flow-volume curve measurement passive respiratory system compliance resistance . Measurements repeat interval age five . Babies also observe regularly respiratory illness experience , passive exposure cigarette smoke , general respiratory health . The study help elucidate : effect maternal cigarette smoking lung function birth development function five year ; effect postnatal factor lung development ; extent report increased frequency respiratory illness infant smoke mother result utero exposure tobacco smoke product postnatal passive smoking . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
