	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1990 , increase recognition obstructive sleep apnea occur commonly may lead serious adverse cardiopulmonary psychoneurologic health effect . In subject numerous prolonged apnea , nocturnal hypoxemia disrupt sleep may lead pulmonary hypertension , cor pulmonale , excessive daytime sleepiness . Systemic hypertension prevalent subject obstructive sleep apnea general population . The health consequence less severe disease extensively study context general population study . However , snore , symptom related sleep apnea , may double risk ischemic heart disease . The prevalence systemic hypertension high snorer nonsnorers , find potentially considerable public health concern . An increased number death due cardiovascular disease elderly subject disorder breathe sleep also demonstrate . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study cross-sectional longitudinal design . Index case identify Rhode Island Hospital Sleep Laboratory control local industry . During home visit , questionnaire data symptom , medical history , exposure collect follow measurement make : blood pressure , height , weight , spirometry . Structural assessment upper airway make brief physical examination , facial structure document lateral photograph . Airflow , chest wall movement , oxygen saturation , heart rate sleep record ambulatory monitoring device . Observations field confirm extended laboratory study sample family demonstrate great least concordance sleep-related respiratory disturbance . These subject detail assessment upper airway structure cephalometry posterior rhinometry , assessment ventilatory control responses chemical resistive loading , assessment sleep stag in-hospital polysomnography . Familial correlation without adjustment specific risk factor compute . These analysis allow : determination risk development sleep apnea due familial factor ; improve understanding influence genetic acquire risk factor interaction development sleep apnea : characterization generally healthy population increase risk sleep apnea study subsequently longitudinally natural history study molecular genetic marker pedigree study . The study renew FY 1996 . The cohort expand addition 85 family identify affected proband , lead total 300 family . These new cohort member characterize fashion similar previously use . Follow-up conduct initially recruit apnea level , blood pressure , body fat distribution , cranial facial dimension , pulmonary function , factor interest . For 450 individual , follow-up extended nine year . A nested case-control study also conduct include 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring echocardiography . A principal analytic tool variance component modeling . The study renew FY 2001 March , 2005 . Further study conduct cohort 2,200 previously undergone overnight sleep study . A total 700 cohort member family sleep apnea , genome scan perform , undergo additional physiological biochemical measurement longitudinal follow-up derive detail phenotypic characterization sleep apnea relate cardiovascular disease risk factor subclinical disease . Newly available technology use quantify specific sensitive index obstructive breathe parameter sleep fragmentation . Subjects also undergo biochemical profile evaluation vascular function , include assessment novel cardiovascular disease risk factor may relate sleep apnea base common gene role index sleep apnea disease severity .</detailed_description>
