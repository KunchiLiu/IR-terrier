	<brief_title>Myocardial Infarction Current Oral Contraceptive Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It establish oral contraceptive formulation use 1960s 1970s increased risk myocardial infarction , venous thromboembolism , stroke . Oral contraceptive formulation change , prescribe practice , need information effect newer formulation use . Myocardial infarction important cardiovascular disease term incidence mortality attribute use oral contraceptive ; although overall incidence myocardial infarction relatively low woman childbearing age , incidence low smoker . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A case-control design use . The case series consist woman 18 44 year age admit document first myocardial infarction 100 collaborating hospital Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Pennsylvania . Nurse interviewer administer standard structure questionnaire case control drug use , race , religion , medical history myocardial infarction risk factor . Information collect : cigarette smoking ; history hypertension , diabetes mellitus , angina , abnormal plasma lipid ; reproductive menstrual history ; alcohol coffee consumption ; personality type use Framingham Type A scale ; family history myocardial infarction ; exercise ; education occupation patient spouse . Information also obtain time duration oral contraceptive use . The effect oral contraceptive use consider among nonsmoker , light smoker , heavy smoker . Individual oral contraceptive formulation classify accord dosage type estrogen , formulation type , grouping . Multiple logistic regression analysis fit regression equation method maximum likelihood use simultaneous control potential confounding factor . The study renew 1995 continue data collection establish effect triphasic OCs MI risk , particular attention joint effect heavy smoking . The new data collection also permit definitive analysis effect monophasic OCs . Triphasic formulations become popular 1995 account half OC use . There enough user triphasic OCs present study informative analysis , data study issue . The study end December , 1999 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
