	<brief_title>Etiology Blood Dyscrasias : Analysis International Agranulocytosis Aplastic Anemia Study Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Agranulocytosis aplastic anemia rare serious blood disease cause drug environmental factor . In 1980 , limit quantitative estimate risk various exposure , particularly drug , two dyscrasia . The data collect IAAAS , multicenter population-based case-control study conduct 1980 1986 eight region . The study fund pharmaceutical company investigate single hypothesis , information obtain drug factor , enable general investigation dyscrasia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study retrospective data analysis . Standard case-control method use . In instance , multivariate analysis use control confound , especially simultaneous use causal drug . Adverse effect relative safety drug relation two dyscrasia document . Because IAAAS population-based , incidence rate provide directly , excess risk estimate associated drug . Such quantitative measure association generally unavailable . Among drug analyze various category psychotropics , antihistamine , cardiovascular drug , individual drug allopurinol . Factors drug also evaluate , include exposure radiation chemical benzene insecticide , history viral infection , history allergy condition . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
