	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Normative Aging Study ( NAS ) multidisciplinary longitudinal study age establish Veterans Adminstration 1963 . Six thousand male volunteer Greater Boston area screen acceptance study accord laboratory , clinical , radiologic electrocardiographic criterion . Volunteers history presence chronic condition heart disease , diabetes , cancer , peptic ulcer , gout recurrent asthma , bronchitis , sinusitis admit study . Also disqualify either systolic blood pressure great 140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 90 mm Hg . Acceptable condition include childhood disease rheumatic fever kidney infection preclude prior military service , well hepatitis , malaria , jaundice anemia , long sequelae present function intact . Eventually , 2,280 men accept NAS , range age 21-81 year mean 42 year . Participants enrol receive first medical examination 1963 1968 . Subsequently , men 51 year age report medical examination every five year . After age 51 report every three year . In 1986 , A total 1,894 subject remain active observation 756 33.2 percent age 65 . The study test hypothesis dietary intake genetic factor predispose development obesity . Obesity , particularly abdominal obesity characterize high waist/hip ratio , associate insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia . The hyperinsulinemia stimulate sympathetic nervous system influence peripheral dopaminergic serotoninergic system development hypertension coincident cardiovascular disease . The study fund result Request Applications Research Nutrition Cardiovascular Disease release 1986 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There three study . In first study , entire 1,894 subject Normative Aging Study Veterans Administration use . The study cross-sectional longitudinal investigation influence diet obesity production hyperinsulinism increase level catecholamine , relationship intermediate outcome cardiovascular end point , namely postural change blood pressure occurrence myocardial infarction . Subsets subject upper low quartile body mass index upper low quartile waist/hip ratio use second third study . The second study cross-sectional explored interaction insulin resistance , sympathetic nervous system activity cardiovascular function 80 individual . The third study also cross-sectional , use stratify subset subject , characterize nutrient effect renal function , particularly sodium excretion renal amine production . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
