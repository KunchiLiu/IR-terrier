	<brief_summary>To identify large cohort child transfuse decade prior second-generation anti-hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) donor screen ( 1982-1992 ) . This identify case study persistent infection chronic hepatitis child , allow determination annualized risk transfusion-associated hepatitis ( TAH ) infection child , data currently available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Accumulating data indicate 70 80 percent adult infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) develop persistent infection may associate chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma end-stage liver disease . Despite potential mortal outcome , progression indolent , serious chronic sequela may occur 10 50 year , time many transfuse adult die unrelated cause . Infants child , hand , far likely survive transfusion episode , long life span HCV acquisition , inference , experience decades-long evolution HCV-related cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The year 1982-1992 select TAH incidence adult still high time subject would age 15 enrollment unlikely expose sexual contact IV drug use . Maternal testing perform exclude perinatal transmission . Sixty-five hundred child meet eligibility criterion study transfuse Children 's National Medical Center ( CNMC ) period , archival serum specimens available 22 percent . The total eligible cohort contact ask provide blood sample test antibody HCV newly discover hepatitis G virus ( HGV ) . Subjects find antibody positive initial screen enrol long-term followup include serial determination alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , liver-related assay , viral serology confirmatory testing , PCR HCV HGV RNA , HCV genotyping , evidence chronic hepatitis , liver biopsy . Biopsy may also perform subset chronic viremia , normal ALT , pending approval advisory panel liver expert . A serum repository establish evaluation new diagnostic method HCV , HGV , etiologic agent posttransfusion hepatitis . This study determine minimal rate transfusion-induced HCV HGV infection allow annualized incidence estimate determination national burden transfusion-induced hepatitis virus infection child , value currently unknown . In addition , use archival sample interval transfusion testing , study determine duration infection rate viral persistence . Finally , prospective followup liver biopsy establish extent disease chronically infect . If persistent infection chronic liver disease common child adult , would major implication anti-viral therapy program might shift treatment emphasis pediatric population response rate might higher long-term benefit would great .</detailed_description>
