	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study part initiative , Obstructive Sleep Apnea Children , release December , 1997 co-sponsorship National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research National Institute Child Health Human Development . The goal initiative define abnormality airway structure function responsible obstructive sleep apnea child , age 3 12 , identify physiological clinical measure associate increased morbidity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A 3 stage stratify sampling procedure conduct pre-adolescent Tucson school child age 6 12 year age . Stratification perform follow factor : age , ethnicity , gender snoring status . In initial phase , 2500 ( 625 year ) pre-adolescent Tucson school child age 6 12 year age survey use questionnaire design elicit symptom sleep disordered breathing ( SDB ) include obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . From data , subset 90 snore 30 non-snoring child ( 500 total ) recruit year home polysomnography , basic anthropometric measurement battery neurocognitive test perform order identify group child SDB include OSA group without condition . In third phase study , 20 child SDB 20 without recruit year ( 80 total ) undergo intensive anatomic physiologic test include cephalometry , measurement upper airway geometry resistance use acoustic reflection oscillation technique control ventilation study . The intent study : 1 ) determine prevalence symptom SDB pre-adolescent Caucasian Hispanic child ; 2 ) compare prevalence objectively measure SDB pre-adolescent Caucasian Hispanic child ; 3 ) determine whether physiologic anatomic difference among pre-adolescent child SDB include obstructive sleep apnea upper airway resistance syndrome ( UARS ) quiet wakefulness ; 4 ) determine association SDB school performance , neuro-cognitive ability daytime symptom . The study extend November 2008 follow large cohort pre-adolescent child determine whether untreated sleep apnea associate identifiable decrement neurocognitive performance school performance , well perturbation blood pressure growth , approximately four year initial enrollment identification sleep apnea . The study also aim identify pre-adolescent anthropometric ethnic variable associate future development and/or regression sleep apnea .The study secondarily aim determine whether abnormality ventilatory drive find pre-adolescence child sleep apnea persist approximately four year untreated sleep apnea .</detailed_description>
