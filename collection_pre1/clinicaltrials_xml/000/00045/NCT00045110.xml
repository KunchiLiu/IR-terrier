	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma Recurrent Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib patient recurrent malignant glioma recurrent progressive meningioma . II . Determine safety profile drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . IV . Determine 6-month progression-free survival , 12-month survival , objective tumor response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord study phase ( I vs II ) , concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( yes v ) , histology ( recurrent GBM v recurrent anaplastic glioma v recurrent meningioma v stable GBM ) , preoperative candidacy ( yes v ) , concurrent steroid ( yes v ) . Phase I : Patients concurrently receive EIAEDs receive oral erlotinib daily . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : Once MTD determine , additional patient concurrently receive EIAEDs treat erlotinib phase II dose . Patients concurrently receive EIAEDs treat erlotinib predetermine dose . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
