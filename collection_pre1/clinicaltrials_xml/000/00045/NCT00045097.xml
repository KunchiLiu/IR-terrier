	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity ixabepilone , term objective response rate , patient incurable , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior taxane therapy ( yes v ) . Patients ( without prior taxane exposure ) receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1-5 . An additional cohort 37 patient receive prior taxane therapy accrue receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1-3 high start dose . For patient , course repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive 6 course satisfactory response may treat every 4-5 week . Patients remove unacceptable toxicty follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 105 patient ( least 74 21 without prior taxane exposure ) accrue study within 26 month .</detailed_description>
