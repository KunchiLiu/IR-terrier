	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody trastuzumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . It yet know whether trastuzumab effective treat primary breast cancer woman complete adjuvant chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different regimen trastuzumab observation compare well work treat woman breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Women With Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival woman HER2-positive primary breast cancer treat trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) 1 year v trastuzumab 2 year vs standard supportive care . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare relapse-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare distant disease-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence cardiac dysfunction patient treat regimen . - Evaluate safety tolerability regimens patient . Secondary - Compare time recurrence patient treat regimen . - Compare time distant recurrence patient treat regimen . - Compare outcome , term disease-free survival , overall survival , recurrence-free survival , distant disease-free survival , time recurrence , time distant recurrence , cardiac safety , overall safety , patient treat trastuzumab 1 year vs 2 year . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord nodal status ( nodal status prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy v positive node prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy v 1-3 positive node prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy v 4 positive node prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy regimen ( anthracyclines taxanes vs anthracyclines v anthracyclines taxanes ) , receptor status endocrine therapy ( negative v positive prior endocrine therapy v positive prior endocrine therapy ) , age ( 18 34 v 35 49 v 50 59 v 60 ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 1.5 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive trastuzumab arm I . Courses repeat every 3 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm III : Patients receive trastuzumab . Patients may later receive trastuzumab arm I arm II . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 4,482 patient ( 1,494 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
