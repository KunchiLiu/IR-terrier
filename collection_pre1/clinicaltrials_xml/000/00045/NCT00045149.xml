	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy cellular adoptive immunotherapy use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Treating person 's white blood cell laboratory reinfusing may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness biological therapy treat patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety toxicity cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprise autologous CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone target cancer-testis antigen patient metastatic melanoma . - Determine duration vivo persistence therapy patient . Secondary - Evaluate antitumor effect therapy patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) clone generate ex vivo . Patients receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprise autologous CD8+ CTL clone target cancer testis antigens IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hour day 1-14 course 2-4 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate clinical response completion fourth course eligible receive additional T-cell infusion . Patients follow 9 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
