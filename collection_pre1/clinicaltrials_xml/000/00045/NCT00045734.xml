	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy imatinib mesylate , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent meningioma . II . Determine response rate overall survival patient treated drug . III . Evaluate safety profile drug patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . V. Determine surrogate endpoint angiogenic activity drug patient . VI . Correlate molecular abnormality tumor response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord concurrent use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( yes v ) , histology ( benign vs atypical malignant ) , neurofibromatosis positivity ( yes v ) , preoperative candidacy ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per stratum ) accrue study within 8-12 month .</detailed_description>
