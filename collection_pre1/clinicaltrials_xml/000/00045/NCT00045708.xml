	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Trial BMS-247550 Treatment Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose BMS-247550 administer adult recurrent malignant glioma , receive ( Group A ) receiving ( Group B ) anticonvulsant know metabolized P450 hepatic enzyme complex . II . To describe pharmacokinetics route administration , measure BMS-247550 , determine effect hepatic enzyme induce drug , anticonvulsant , pharmacokinetics . III . To determine response rate adult patient recurrent glioma BMS-247550 administer MTD . IV . To describe toxicity associate regimen adult patient recurrent malignant glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine percent patient 6 month progression free survival , duration progression free survival survival associate therapy adult patient recurrent malignant glioma . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation , multicenter study follow phase II , safety efficacy , multicenter study . For phase I , patient stratify accord cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsant use ( yes v ) . Phase I : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3 patient receive escalate dos ixabepilone maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : Once MTD determine , additional patient receive ixabepilone MTD . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 10-15 patient accrued phase I portion study . A total 22-33 patient accrue phase II portion study within 4-6 month .</detailed_description>
