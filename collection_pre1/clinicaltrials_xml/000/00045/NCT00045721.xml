	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Chemotherapy place surround tissue surgery remove tumor may kill remain tumor cell . O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine may increase effectiveness carmustine make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study safety combine O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine carmustine implant treat child recurrent malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine Implants O ( 6 ) -Benzylguanine Treating Children With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine dose O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine reliably inhibit alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity pediatric patient recurrent malignant glioma . - Describe toxic effect O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine carmustine implant ( Gliadel ) patient . - Investigate antitumor response patient treat regimen . - Characterize pharmacokinetics O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine administer continuously 9-day period . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine . Patients receive O ( 6 ) -benzylguanine ( O6-BG ) IV 1 hour immediately follow O6-BG IV continuously 9 day . Two day initiation continuous infusion O6-BG , patient undergo maximal tumor debulking . At time surgery , patient receive 8 polifeprosan 20 wafer carmustine ( Gliadel ) implant resection cavity . Cohorts 14 patient receive escalate dos continuous infusion O6-BG optimally biologically effective dose ( BED ) determine . The BED define dose least 11 14 patient meet target complete suppression alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase level . Patients follow day 11 , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , month 6 , 9 , 12 , every 6 month 4 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
