	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Biological therapy interferon alfa use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Combining biological therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine chemotherapy biological therapy treat patient locally advance metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose CCI-779 combination interferon alfa patient locally advance metastatic renal cell cancer . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive interferon alfa ( IFN-A ) subcutaneously 3 time week . Beginning week 2 , patient also receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts least 6 patient receive escalate dos CCI-779 IFN-A maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 20 additional patient treat dose level . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
