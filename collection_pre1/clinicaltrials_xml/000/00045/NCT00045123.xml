	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . R-flurbiprofen may effective delay recurrence localize prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness R-flurbiprofen treating patient localized prostate cancer risk recurrence follow radiation therapy and/or prostatectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-Flurbiprofen Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Risk Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect R-flurbiprofen time systemic disease progression evaluate minimum 3 year patient localize adenocarcinoma prostate intermediate high risk recurrence rise prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level radiotherapy alone , prostatectomy alone , radiotherapy prostatectomy . - Determine effect drug change serum PSA level time prior androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) patient . - Determine effect drug time initiation ADT patient . - Determine effect drug number patient require ADT . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine population pharmacokinetics R-flurbiprofen bioinversion R-ToS patient population . - Determine number patient systemic disease progression end study . - Determine time clinical disease progression patient treat drug . - Determine time prostate cancer-related mortality time cause mortality patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk recurrence base Gleason score diagnosis ( 5-7 v 8-10 ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral low-dose R-flurbiprofen twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral high-dose R-flurbiprofen twice daily . - Arm III : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily . In arm , treatment continue 5.5 year ( 66 month ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate increase prostate-specific antigen without objective disease progression require androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) continue receive R-flurbiprofen . Patients develop local recurrence systemic disease may withdraw study receive additional therapy study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 390 patient ( 130 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
