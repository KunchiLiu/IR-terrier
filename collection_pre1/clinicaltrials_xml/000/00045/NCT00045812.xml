	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness SCH-58235 ( Ezetimibe ) lower sitosterol , plant sterol cholesterol blood level patient homozygous sitosterolemia add patient ' current treatment regimen . Homozygous sitosterolemia inherit disorder sterol metabolism excess many plant sterol , include sitosterol , absorb enough excrete . ( Sterols substance use form hormone , vitamin membrane find animal plant lipids. ) . Patients develop atherosclerosis coronary heart disease early childhood , well problem include arthritis , arthralgia , tendon xanthoma ( lipid deposit ) . Current sitosterolemia treatment may include low sterol diet , medication , intestinal surgery , combination . Ezetimibe member new class drug call `` specific cholesterol absorption inhibitor '' may lower cholesterol , sitosterol plant sterol blood level . Patients homozygous sitosterolemia 10 year age old may eligible study . Participants medical history physical examination randomly assign one two treatment group . One group , include 80 percent study participant , take 10 mg Ezetimibe day , second group ( 20 percent participant ) take placebo ( inactive look-a-like pill ) . Patients 7 clinic visit 12-week study , follow procedure test do : - Measurement vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , breathe rate temperature ) - Dietary maintenance - interview well patient adhere diet - Medication review - interview medication patient take - Blood draw test - Urine sample test - Pregnancy test woman childbearing potential - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measure electrical activity heart - Blood draw determine sitosterol , plant sterol level , lipid level ( cholesterol blood lipid concentration ) - Xanthoma measurement ( ruler X-ray foot )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SCH-58235 ( Ezetimibe ) Treat Homozygous Sitosterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Homozygous sitosterolemia autosomally inherited recessive disorder sterol metabolism . Patients homozygous sitosterolemia present accelerate atherosclerosis initial CHD event occur childhood . In addition , patient tendon xanthomas , hemolytic episode , well arthritis arthralgia . Plasma level sitosterol dietary sterol markedly elevate homozygous sitosterolemic patient , diagnostic disorder . A low sterol diet provide limited reduction sitosterol level currently available medical treatment , bile salt binding resin , usually insufficiently effective poorly tolerate . SCH-58235 member new class therapeutic agent , specific cholesterol absorption inhibitor , develop treat hypercholesterolemia . Preclinical animal study clinical study human demonstrate significant reduction serum cholesterol level SCH-58235 treatment . In current study , efficacy safety SCH-58235 study patient homozygous sitosterolemia , inherit condition wide range plant sterol , include sitosterol , excessively absorb inadequately excrete , lead dramatic increase tissue deposition . SCH-58235 may lower sitosterol level directly inhibit sitosterol absorption ( since plant sterol cholesterol structurally similar sterol ) and/or inhibit cholesterol absorption indirectly increase hepatic uptake plasma LDL increase cholesterol sitosterol excretion . These mechanism action could lead reduction plant sterol LDL cholesterol level patient , thereby provide important clinical benefit . The current study determine SCH-58235 safe well tolerate provide significant reduction plant sterol ( plasma sitosterol campesterol ) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration patient homozygous sitosterolemia . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study last 12 week . Patients diagnosis homozygous sitosterolemia elevate plasma sitosterol level current regimen study . Patients eligible enroll study whether current regimen medication ( ) , surgical ( prior ileal bypass ) , apheresis , combination treatment , active regimen . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety 10 mg/day SCH-58235 patient homozygous sitosterolemia continue elevate plasma sitosterol level .</detailed_description>
