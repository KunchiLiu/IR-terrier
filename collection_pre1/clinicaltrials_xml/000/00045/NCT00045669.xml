	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity imatinib mesylate , term objective response rate ( partial complete response ) duration overall response , patient unresectable and/or metastatic adenoid cystic , lymphoepithelioma-like , myoepithelial salivary gland cancer . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Correlate activity c-kit downstream kinases pre- post-treatment tumoral biopsy clinical course patient treated drug . - Determine effect treatment drug tumor sample patient term proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis . - Correlate steady state level drug achieve clinical laboratory correlative endpoint patient . - Determine whether early change metabolic activity correlate molecular change predict outcome therapy patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease receive treatment 6 month . Patients follow within 3 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within 6-19 month .</detailed_description>
