	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient advance carcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction treat erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . II . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine degree dysphagia relief patient treat drug . IV . Determine toxicity tolerability drug patient . V. Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression response treatment patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
