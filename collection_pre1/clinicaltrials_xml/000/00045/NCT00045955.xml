	<brief_title>Long-Term Safety Performance Fexofenadine Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence respiratory allergy US increase gradually past several year , current estimate suggest allergic rhinitis bronchial asthma affect approximately 20 % 5 % population , respectively . Rhinitis asthma frequently coexist , large-scale population survey indicate 38 % subject rhinitis asthma , 78 % subject asthma chronic nasal symptom . Safety concern increase use inhaled corticosteroid , heterogeneity disease , poor compliance asthma medication regimen , point need development safe convenient oral therapy asthma . Oral leukotriene receptor antagonist ( eg montelukast ) late class inflammation-modulating asthma drug appear cause few long-term side effect systemic corticosteroid reduce need shorter-acting bronchodilator reliever medicine . However variability response patient observe clinical experience agent still limit . Histamine important chemical mediator inflammation asthma . The benefit antihistamine treatment patient mild moderate asthma well document , however clinical use previously limit due high dos require efficacy associated side effect include sedation cognitive impairment . Recent evidence indicate addition H1-receptor antagonism , new nonsedating , non-impairing antihistamine appear possess various anti-inflammatory property concentration achieve therapeutic dosage suggest additional benefit drug management allergic diseases asthma . The purpose study ass long-term safety performance fexofenadine compare montelukast subject asthma .</detailed_description>
