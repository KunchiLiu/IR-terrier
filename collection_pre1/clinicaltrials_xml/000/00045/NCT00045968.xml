	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine efficacy investigational therapy call DCVax ( R ) -L patient newly diagnose GBM surgery indicate . Patients must enter screen participate site prior surgical resection tumor . Patients receive standard care , include radiation Temodar therapy two three additionally receive DCVax-L , remain one third receive placebo . Patients randomize placebo arm option receive DCVax-L crossover arm upon documented disease progression . ( note : DCVax-L used patient brain cancer sometimes also referred DCVax-Brain )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Drug DCVax®-L Treat Newly Diagnosed GBM Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III trial design evaluate impact disease progression survival time , well safety , patient follow treatment DCVax ( R ) -L , immunotherapy treatment GBM . The experimental therapy use patient 's tumor lysate white blood cell precursor dendritic cell isolate . The dendritic cell starter engine immune system . The white cell make dendritic cell educate `` teach '' immune system recognize brain cancer cell . Eligible patient receive series injection DCVax-L , activate boost immune response tumor cell . The primary study endpoint PFS ( progression free survival ) , first secondary endpoint overall survival ( OS ) . Other endpoint include performance status , immune response , also safety . Interim analysis assess efficacy incorporate trial design . Side effect report early trial mostly mild , may include skin reaction redness , pain &amp; swell injection site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must meet follow inclusion criterion . All test eligibility criterion must complete within four week completion radiation chemotherapy , follow surgery . Patients must sufficient tumor lysate protein generate surgically obtain tumor material . Patients must also sufficient DCVaxL product available manufacturing . These determination make Cognate BioServices , Inc. ( Cognate ) communicate clinical site Sponsor , designee . Patients newly diagnose , unilateral GBM ( Grade IV ) eligible protocol . An independent neuropathologist review diagnosis enrollment process . Subjects ≥18 ≤70 year age surgery capable informed consent . Patients must able understand sign inform consent document indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must life expectancy &gt; 8 week . Patients must KPS rating ≥70 baseline visit ( Visit 3 ) . Primary therapy must consist surgical resection intent gross near total resection contrastenhancing tumor mass , follow conventional external beam radiation therapy concurrent Temodar chemotherapy . Patients biopsy exclude . These primary treatment must complete least two week prior first immunization . Patients may receive steroid therapy part primary treatment . Steroid treatment must stop least 10 day prior leukapheresis . Patients must progressive disease completion radiation therapy . Patients suspected pseudoprogression enrol analyzed separately . Patients must willing forego cytotoxic antitumor therapy except temozolomide essentially accord schedule Stupp Protocol ( Stupp et al . N Engl J Med 352 : 98796 , 2005 ) treat DCVaxL . DCVaxL treatment must give describe temozolomide/Temodar treatment schedule must give essentially accord Stupp Protocol . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( e.g. , hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl , white blood count 360011,000mm3 , absolute granulocyte count ≥1,500/mm3 , absolute lymphocyte count ≥1,000/mm3 , platelet count ≥100K/mm3 . Eligibility level hemoglobin reach transfusion . Adequate liver function ( SGPT , SGOT , alkaline phosphatase ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin ≤1.5mg/dl ) , adequate renal function ( BUN creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN ) prior start therapy .</criteria>
