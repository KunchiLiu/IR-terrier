	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Women With Metastatic Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival woman metastatic recurrent breast cancer treat 2 dose level celecoxib . Secondary - Compare side effect 2 dose level drug patient . - Compare overall survival patient treat 2 dose level drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease status study entry ( complete response v partial response v stable ) prior metastatic/recurrent chemotherapy regimen ( 1 vs 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral high-dose celecoxib twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral low-dose celecoxib twice daily . In arm , treatment continue first disease progression . At disease progression , treatment assignment unblinded treatment may continue treat physician 's discretion . Patients initially randomize low-dose arm may either continue dosage crossover high-dose arm . Patients initially randomize high-dose arm may continue dosage . Treatment disease progression may continue 12 month . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 132 patient ( 88 high-dose arm 44 low-dose arm ) accrue study within 22 month .</detailed_description>
