	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy STI571 metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) demonstrate expression CD117 ( c-kit ) and/ PDGFR . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity STI571 MBC expression CD117 ( ckit ) and/ PDGFR evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To determine toxicity profile tolerability STI571 patient MBC . III . To define serum , tissue image surrogate endpoint activity STI571 MBC . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Treatment continue least 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
