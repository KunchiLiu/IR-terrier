	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy vaccine therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine chemotherapy radiation therapy vaccine therapy treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy cisplatin , etoposide , thoracic radiotherapy follow cisplatin , etoposide , monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine ( TriAb ) , monoclonal antibody GD2 anti-idiotype vaccine ( TriGem ) , term overall progression-free survival patient limited stage small cell lung cancer . - Determine immune response 2 anti-idiotype vaccine use regimen patient . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen patient . - Determine response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) patient measurable disease treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 29-33 . Thoracic radiotherapy administer 5 day week , begin day 1 chemotherapy , 5 week . Patients undergo radiotherapy boost 1.5 week . Patients stable disease least partial response proceed consolidation therapy . - Consolidation therapy ( begin within 3-5 week last dose induction chemotherapy radiotherapy ) : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 week 11 14 . Patients also receive monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine ( TriAb ) monoclonal antibody GD2 anti-idiotype vaccine ( TriGem ) intradermally day 1 week 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 ( 4 injection ) monthly subcutaneously 2 year . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response consolidation chemotherapy undergo cranial radiotherapy 5 day week 3 week . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 90 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
