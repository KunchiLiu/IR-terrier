	<brief_title>CT-2103 Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) third-line treatment patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) IV 10-20 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
