	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy bortezomib , term response rate , patient previously untreated relapsed Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine time progression , stable disease duration , response duration patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week . Patients complete partial response stable disease follow every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-25 patient accrue study within 1.5-2 year .</detailed_description>
