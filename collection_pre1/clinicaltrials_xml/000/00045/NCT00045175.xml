	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Topotecan may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Combining chemotherapy topotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine UCN-01 topotecan treating patient recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase II dose UCN-01 topotecan patient recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine relationship clinical pharmacokinetic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive UCN-01 IV 3 hour day 1 topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos UCN-01 topotecan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 12 additional ovarian epithelial cancer patient treat recommended phase II dose . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-30 patient accrue study within 6-10 month .</detailed_description>
