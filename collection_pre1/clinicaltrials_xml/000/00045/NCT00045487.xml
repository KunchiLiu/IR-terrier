	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity erlotinib patient advance renal cell carcinoma . - Evaluate safety tolerability , term toxicity profile , drug patient . - Determine biologic activity drug , term early disease progression , progression-free survival , 12-month survival rate , overall survival , patient . - Determine pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Analyze postreceptor effect epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosinase kinase inhibition drug cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis tumor biopsy patient . - Correlate change biological measurement index outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-40 patient accrue study within 8-10 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Papillary RCC permit immunohistochemical evidence strong ( 23+ ) EGFR expression . Disease recurrent refractory IL2 IFNbased therapy new diagnosis previously untreated patient appropriate candidate receive IL2 base treatment Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Prior nephrectomy resection metastatic lesion permit full surgical recovery occur . Age &gt; 18 year Because dose adverse event data currently available use OSI774 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Life expectancy least 12 week ECOG performance status 0,1 2 Karnofsky &gt; 60 % Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hematopoietic 1 . Absolute neutrophil count least ≥ 1,500/ul 2 . Platelet ≥ 100,000/uL 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL , concomitant erythropoetin permit Hepatic . Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit b. AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ≤5 time ULN liver metastasis present ) Renal a. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 Calcium . Corrected calcium &lt; 12.0 mg/dl , concomitant hypocalcemic agent permit Complete supportive palliative care continue provide ameliorate sign symptom preexist may arise study interfere objective study . The use erythropoietin biphosphonates permit . Patients must tumor block available EGFR expression analysis eligible treatment study . History active malignancy ( RCC ) past 3 year , nonmelanomatous skin cancer situ breast cancer situ cervical cancer . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition OSI774 . Prior treatment EGFR target therapy . Inability understand write informed consent document . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Major surgery , significant traumatic injury occur within 21 day prior treatment . Abnormalities cornea base history ( e.g. , dry eye syndrome , Sjogren 's syndrome ) , congenital abnormality ( e.g. , Fuch 's dystrophy ) , abnormal slitlamp examination use vital dye ( e.g. , fluorescein , Bengal Rose ) , and/or abnormal corneal sensitivity test ( Schirmer test similar tear production test ) . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease . Pregnant woman exclude study OSI774 epidermal growth factor inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect base data suggest EGFR expression important normal organ development . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must also agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother OSI774 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated OSI774 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction OSI774 . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Informed Consent No study specific procedure perform without write sign informed consent document . Patients demonstrate ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document exclude study entry .</criteria>
