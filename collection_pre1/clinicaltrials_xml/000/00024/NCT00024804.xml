	<brief_summary>This study four objective : 1 ) provide investigator opportunity study bone specimens patient various skeletal disease ; 2 ) treat patient skeletal disease NIH ; 3 ) expose NIH trainee certain skeletal disease ; 4 ) gain knowledge skeletal disease stimulate study bone biology . Anyone disease affect skeleton may eligible study . All evaluation , test , procedures treatment give study participant use standard care skeletal disease . No experimental evaluation treatment offer . Patient evaluation include medical history , review medical record routine physical examination . Based finding , procedure may recommend , include blood test , urine test , image test , X-rays , bone densitometry , bone scan , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Bone specimens participant collect research use . Specimens obtain bone remove patient plan surgical procedure perform medical care , patient may request bone biopsy removal small piece bone tissue part patient evaluation procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human diseases commonly manifest skeletal system . The skeleton may primary secondary target disease disease may congenital acquire . While understand molecular cellular biology bone mineral disorder increase last several year , much remain understood underlie biology skeleton . The gap understanding skeletal biology evident paucity tissue-specific therapy skeletal disease . Within study , plan obtain tissue clinical specimen outside institution well evaluate subject bone mineral disorder NIH Clinical Center . Subjects undergo clinically indicated test possibly receive treatment , limited therapy base best professional judgment investigator treatment medication commercially available FDA law . Objectives : The objective protocol : 1. allow receipt tissue clinical specimen investigator outside inside NIH 2. provide protocol within subject common rare disorder bone mineral metabolism study , evaluate treat NIH 3. provide protocol trainee evaluate subject bone mineral disorder 4. provide pool subject bone mineral disorder , research question arise future research study generate . Study Population : The study population include subject : - know suspected bone disease and/or know suspected disorder mineral metabolism - Subjects meet eligibility criterion accept regardless gender , race , ethnicity . Design : This protocol training , evaluation treatment protocol . Outcome measure : 1 . To successfully enroll , evaluate , manage subject common rare bone mineral metabolism disorder . The purpose : ) educate trainee investigator b ) provide mechanism subject diseases uncertain unknown diagnosis evaluate . 2 . To collect receive research clinical specimen common rare bone mineral metabolism disorder subject see outside medical facility well see NIH . Specimens collect research purpose . 3 . Analysis research subject outcome data collect subject enrol study generate future research study related common rare bone mineral metabolism disorder .</detailed_description>
