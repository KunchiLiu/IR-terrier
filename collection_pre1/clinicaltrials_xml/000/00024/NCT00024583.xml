	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A variety study report association birth weight proxy measure fetal nutrition chronic disease risk adulthood , particularly `` metabolic disease '' type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . These finding lead theory `` fetal programming '' adult chronic disease . This theory highly provocative suggests prevention many chronic disease start improvement materno-fetal nutrition . A mechanism fetal programming adult chronic disease risk , however , identify . In addition , epidemiological study ecological retrospective , poor identification exposure dose timing , control confounders . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cohort study determine whether famine exposure first , second , third trimester gestation associate difference sibs CVD risk factor adulthood , specifically centralized obesity , insulin resistance , increase blood pressure , dyslipidemia , diagnose type 2 diabetes . Using data collect , investigator propose : ( 1 ) evaluate key assumption maternal undernutrition pregnancy result fetal program CVD risk factor ; ( 2 ) good identify critical period gestation may occur ; , ( 3 ) determine strength association chronic disease risk factor adulthood . The study utilize innovative sib-pair design case , `` probands , '' expose fetal undernutrition Dutch Famine 1944-45 , match same-sex full sibling bear different year expose . The timing birth within famine period allow investigator classify proband exposure approximately trim gestation . Thus , compare previous study , well able identify `` critical period '' - early , mid , late gestation - fetal programming effect likely occur . In addition , investigator randomly select sample unexposed probands birth date 1943 1947 , immediately famine , matched sibling . All expose unexposed probands ascertain prenatal delivery record three hospital Western Netherlands famine intense . These record include information maternal family medical history , socioeconomic status , pregnancy characteristic ( blood pressure , weight gain , etc . ) , birth outcome , include anthropometry gestational age . Siblings identify use national Population Registers ( Bevolkings register ) , hospital prenatal delivery record obtain . In addition collect information perinatal hospital registry record , subject undergo home interview clinical examination . The interview collect information sociodemographic characteristic , economic status , health history , include obstetric history , current health medical treatment , health behavior , include physical activity . The clinical examine include fast blood draw lipid , glucose , insulin concentration , glucose tolerance test additional blood draw 30 120 minute post-glucose load . Blood also store future DNA isolation assay genetic polymorphism could influence association among study variable . Anthropometry include height , weight , waist circumference , abdominal sagital diameter . A food frequency questionnaire also administer either interview examination phase . An innovative part study measurement hand morphology : specifically , fingertip ridge-count difference digit-lengths . These characteristic establish 19th week gestation fix thereafter throughout lifetime . There evidence development characteristic prior 19 week gestation may influence environmental factor , include materno-fetal nutrition . The investigator test hypothesis finger hand characteristic marker undernutrition first half pregnancy predict adult CVD risk factor .</detailed_description>
