	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obesity highly prevalent American Indian child , increase risk development cardiovascular disease , hypertension diabetes . Although increase energy expenditure , increase physical activity , decrease dietary fat intake slow rate body fat gain , appear child actually decrease physical activity mature pre-to post-pubescence . Several study show decline activity great female male , great non-whites white ; however , study support finding . Further , data available American Indian child , population great risk . Additionally , inconsistency report respect relationship body weight body fat energy intake dietary fat intake . At heart problem difficulty measure self-reported physical activity dietary intake accurately . Accurate self- report measure necessary use large scale study require investigate relationship physical activity dietary intake disease . The Healthy People 2000 : National Health Promotion Disease Prevention Objectives include seven objective emphasize increase physical activity child adolescent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study combine longitudinal cross-sectional design investigator modify best exist method self-report physical activity dietary intake child adolescent , evaluate validity use total energy expenditure ( TEE ) measure doubly label water ( DLW ) criterion . They use method measure physical activity dietary intake two age cohort male female American Indian child ( 8-10-years 11-13-years ) baseline two year later , two set interim measurement . Change TEE baseline two-year follow-up also measure use DLW TriTrac accelerometer . Equations estimation percent body fat cross-validated population . The study fill exist gap improve exist instrument measurement physical activity dietary intake child adolescent , provide longitudinal data change variables child time , plus provide cross-sectional data age gender group compare exist literature . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
