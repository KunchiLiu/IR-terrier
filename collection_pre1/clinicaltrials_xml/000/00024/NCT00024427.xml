	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving drug different combination may kill tumor cell . Chemoprotective drug triacetyluridine may protect normal cell side effect chemotherapy . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective treat pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness fluorouracil plus triacetyluridine gemcitabine treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer treat surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triacetyluridine Fluorouracil Compared With Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced , Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival patient unresectable locally advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer treat triacetyluridine high-dose fluorouracil v gemcitabine . - Compare time tumor progression , overall response rate , response duration patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( II III v IV ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive high-dose fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) IV 30 minute weekly week 1-3 follow 1 week rest . After dose 5-FU , patient receive oral triacetyluridine every 8 hour total 8 dos . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute weekly week 1-7 follow 1 week rest ( course 1 ) . Subsequent course give week 1-3 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 260 patient ( 130 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 30 month .</detailed_description>
