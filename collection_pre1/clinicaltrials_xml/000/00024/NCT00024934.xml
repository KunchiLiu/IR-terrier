	<brief_summary>This study examine safety BlyS , experimental drug develop treat immune deficiency . As July 17 , 2001 , 7 person common variable immune deficiency ( CVID ) receive BlyS , problem report . This study test safety drug people IgA deficiency . Patients 18 year age old IgA deficiency recurrent chronic sinus lung infection chronic diarrhea malabsorption may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest X-ray breathing test ( spirometry ) . Participants divide five group three person receive different dos ( 0.1 , 1 , 5 , 15 45 micrograms/kilogram body weight ) BlyS . The first group receive single dose low dose level ( 0.l mg ) . Each succeed group receive single high dose follow 2-week observation period precede group . The drug inject skin , vital sign ( temperature , pulse , blood pressure breathe rate ) monitor one hour dosing . Blood sample collect several time day dose ( dose 1.5 , 3 , 5 , 8 12 hour dose ) 1,2 , 4 , 8 12 week dose measure BlyS level evaluate safety . Participants receive one three high dos additional blood sample collect 36 , 48 60 hour dose . Blood also collect participant 6 12 month dose look unexpected long-term effect . A total 289 ml ( 1.2 cup ) blood collect . Blood check change blood count , kidney liver function , antibody level autoimmune problem . Saliva collect four time place cotton ball mouth-once dose three time dose-to measure antibody level . Urine sample also collect study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-Lymphocyte Stimulator ( BLyS ) To Treat Selective IgA Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B Lymphocyte Stimulator ( BLyS ( Trademark ) ) member tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) superfamily cytokine express peripheral blood monocyte dendritic cell . Cellular receptor BLyS detect mature immunoglobulin ( Ig ) express B-lymphocytes . In vitro study show BLyS increase B cell number , Ig production , antigen-specific immunoglobulin response , induces production secretory IgA . B-cells collect patient Common Variable Immune Deficiency show evidence BLyS binding B cell enhance immunoglobulin secretion . In 28-day toxicology study mice , pharmacological effect restrict B lymphoid tissue include B lymphocyte hyperplasia , increase splenic weight without significant increase spleen size , increase immunoglobulin production . Murine model suggest pharmacological effect fully rapidly reversible . The biological profile BLyS suggest may therapeutic utility treatment immunodeficiency disorder characterize low absent immunoglobulin selective IgA deficiency ( IGA-D ) . Risk BLyS might contribute IGA-D complication assess . A series special vitro short-term vivo study show BLyS enhance tumorigenicity allergy/hypersensitivity . Enhanced autoimmunity immune complex formation could rule two mouse study BLyS administer high dos multiple dose schedule . Renal change glomerular protein deposit note subset mouse treat 0.1 1.0 mg/kg first study 0.3 3.0 mg/kg second study . Renal change reproducible either 2 repeat mouse study design replicate condition first study . Renal change observe GLP toxicity study mice treat 4 week BLyS follow 2-week recovery period , exploratory monkey study . This study phase I ; single-dose , open-label , non-randomized , dose escalation study BLyS administer subcutaneously total 20 evaluable subject IgA-D. Each subject receive single dose BLyS . The propose study consist screen phase , 1-day treatment phase pharmacokinetic sampling , day 2 day 3 follow-up , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12-week acute safety evaluation . Dose escalation next cohort dependent result 2-week acute safety evaluation . Autoimmunity interim infection history evaluate 4-6 week 6 12 month . Long-term data collect incidence malignancy minimum one year .</detailed_description>
