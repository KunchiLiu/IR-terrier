	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether change percent apoptotic cell tumor biopsy treatment BMS-275291 valid endpoint patient HIV-related Kaposi 's sarcoma . II . Determine safety tolerability drug patient . III . Determine antitumor effect drug patient . IV . Determine effect drug overall quality life tumor-specific symptom patient . V. Determine effect drug CD4 CD8 cell count percentages HIV viral load patient . VI . Determine effect drug human herpes virus-8 ( HHV-8 ) viral load correlate HHV-8 viral burden , tumor stage , prognosis patient . VII . Determine peak plasma concentration drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral BMS-275291 1-2 time daily . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-275291 recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) determine . The RPTD dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity 1 6 patient experience clinical response least 5 6 patient demonstrate biologic activity . An additional 29 patient treated RPTD . Quality life assess day 15 first course every 28 day thereafter . Patients follow least 1 month .</detailed_description>
