	<brief_summary>Liposome entrap mitoxantrone ( LEM ) mixture commercially available mitoxantrone HCL ( Novantrone ) combination lyophilize lipid . Mitoxantrone , active agent investigational formulation , currently market chemotherapeutic agent . The rationale development liposomal formulation primarily improve safety profile drug , may permit dose intensification and/or increase cumulative dose may administer , result enhanced efficacy . LEM give patient advance solid tumor determine dose drug patient tolerate . Patients receive intravenous LEM every 21 day disease progress toxicity occur require treatment discontinuation . Anti-tumor effect LEM assess patient evaluate safety tolerability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Liposome Encapsulated Mitoxantrone ( LEM ) Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) LEM . II . Measure blood pharmacokinetics LEM follow IV administration . III . Observe anti-tumor effect LEM . PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This open-label study patient advance and/or metastatic , histologically-documented solid tumor consider unresponsive available conventional treatment . LEM administer IV 45 minute . At least three patient study dose level least three patient complete one 21-day course patient enrol next dose level . Study drug administration continue every 3-week schedule absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . A subsequent course treatment may administer least 21 day prior LEM dose administer study criterion meet . Cohorts 3 patient per dose level study . This expand 6 DLT occurs , follow total 6 patient possible MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : It expect 21 30 patient enter study determine MTD : 3 per dose level , expand 6 DLT occurs , follow total 6 patient possible MTD . The dose level identify MTD may expand 12 patient permit additional safety assessment .</detailed_description>
