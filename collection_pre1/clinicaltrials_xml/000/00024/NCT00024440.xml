	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen may help fludarabine cyclophosphamide kill cancer cell make sensitive drug . It yet know fludarabine cyclophosphamide effective without oblimersen . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness fludarabine cyclophosphamide without oblimersen treat patient relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide With Without Oblimersen Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare complete response nodular partial response patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia treat fludarabine cyclophosphamide without oblimersen . - Compare overall response rate , response duration , survival , time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare clinical benefit safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease response prior fludarabine-containing therapy ( responsive v refractory ) , number prior regimen ( 1-2 v 3 ) , duration response last prior therapy ( 6 month vs 6 month few ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 via infusion pump ( end day 8 ) fludarabine IV 20-30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 5-7 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 11 continue blood count recover . - Arm II : Patients receive fludarabine IV 20-30 minute follow cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1-3 . Patients also receive G-CSF SC begin day 7 continue blood count recover . Treatment arm continue every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 month every 2 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 200 patient ( 100 per arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
