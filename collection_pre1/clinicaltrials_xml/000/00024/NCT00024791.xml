	<brief_summary>This study examine brain control eye-hand coordination ( visuomotor skill ) child spastic diplegia determine whether impairment skill relate learn difficulty school child experience . Spastic diplegia form cerebral palsy affect legs hand . The brain injury cause leg problem disease may also cause difficulty eye-hand coordination . Healthy normal volunteer child spastic diplegia 6 12 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen review medical school record , psychological testing , neurological physical examination , assessment muscle function arm legs . Participants may undergo one follow procedure : Neuropsychological testing ( 1 2 hour ) - involve sit computer answer question , whether letter screen make real word . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( 45 minute ) - use strong magnetic field radio wave provide image brain . The child lie table narrow cylindrical machine scan obtain . Both child parent wear earplug muffle loud noise radio wave make image form . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) electromyography ( EMG ) ( 1 2 hour ) - EEG us electrodes record electrical activity brain . The electrodes special cap worn head procedure . EMG record electrical activity muscle . Electrodes place skin certain muscle . During test , child make simple repetitive movement , finger tapping . The cap electrodes skin remove end test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal Career Transition Award acquire research train clinical neurophysiologic dimension motor disorder cerebral palsy . Dr. Mark Hallett Human Motor Control Section , NINDS , act principal mentor train award . Cerebral palsy group syndromes non-progressive motor impairment result static injury develop brain . The process growth development complicate motor syndromes cerebral palsy lead change clinical picture . Mirror movement child spastic hemiplegia prominent affect hand 10 year age , symmetric less noticeable age . Investigators speculate callosal maturation responsible change . Understanding affect development motor manifestation cerebral palsy critical develop effective rehabilitative strategy stage life . Many child cerebral palsy make significant contribution society adult , achievement possible overcome physical educational impediment effective therapeutic intervention . Research therapeutic strategy decrease possibility perform inappropriate irreversible intervention . A major obstacle research group patient difficulty distinguish motor syndrome . Neurophysiology help distinguish specific hypertonic pattern contribution child 's functional disability . The focus research propose award use neurophysiologic method enhance understand motor disability spastic diplegia explore affect development disorder . One set study , coincide train physiology motor control , explore basic physiologic aspect motor syndromes spastic diplegia . These study assess diplegic child goal clarify physiologic nature motor disorder relationship functional status patient . A second set study examine motor skill spastic diplegia child different age goal define affect callosal development motor syndrome cerebral palsy .</detailed_description>
