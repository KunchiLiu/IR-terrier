	<brief_summary>IL13-PE38QQR oncology drug product consist IL13 ( interleukin-13 ) PE38QQR ( bacteria toxin ) . IL3-PE38QQR protein exhibit cell kill activity variety IL13 receptor-positive tumor cell line indicate may show therapeutic benefit . In reciprocal competition experiment , interaction IL13-PE38QQR IL13 receptor show highly specific human glioma cell . Patients receive IL13-PE38QQR via catheter place directly brain tumor . Tumor recurrence confirm biopsy . The next day , patient start continuous 48-hour infusion IL13-PE38QQR tumor . The dose ( concentration ) increase pre-resection infusion endpoint reach ( histologic evidence tumor cytotoxicity maximum tolerate dose ) . Tumor resection plan one week biopsy , plus minus 1 day . A histologically-effective concentration ( HEC ) determine use pathologic observation . At end resection , three catheter place brain tissue next resection site assess within 24 hour use MRI . On second day surgery , IL13-PE38QQR infusion begin continue 4 day . The low pre-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration use start dose post-resection infusion . After HEC maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , pre-resection infusion longer administer . Subsequent patient tumor resection placement three peri-tumoral catheter study entry . IL13-PE38QQR infuse start second day surgery continue 4 day . Escalation post-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration continue previously-defined HEC MTD reach , duration post-resection infusion increase one day increments 6 day . If post-resection MTD obtain , increase duration infusion . In final stage study , catheter place 2 day tumor resection , 4-day IL13-PE38QQR infusion begin day catheter placement . Patients observe clinically radiographically toxicity duration tumor control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine concentration IL13-PE38QQR produce histologic evidence toxicity tumor , correspond drug toxicity , follow 2-day continuous infusion recurrent malignant glioma prior surgical resection . II . Determine toxicity IL13-PE38QQR administer 4-day continuous infusion via catheter brain adjacent tumor resection site , surgical resection , concentration select concentration . III . Determine toxicity increase duration continuous infusion IL13- PE38QQR via catheter brain adjacent tumor resection site , surgical resection , select concentration . IV . Determine feasibility safety IL13-PE38QQR administration follow post-operative placement stereotaxic catheter 2 day tumor resection , utilize post-operative imaging study plan catheter placement . A 4-day continuous infusion MTD plan . V. Describe time progression survival patient treat IL13-PE38QQR . PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This study design determine two dose level . The first define histologically effective concentration ( HEC ) agent administer prior tumor resection . The second define use safety tolerability study drug administer tumor resection dose HEC . Safety tolerability increase duration infusion tumor resection assess . Patient cohort treat escalate pre-resection dose-levels stop criterion pre-surgery dose meet , hold post-resection dose constant start level . Stopping criterion dose escalation pre-surgery infusion determination HEC maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Subsequent cohort treat post-operatively escalate dose level stop criterion post-surgery dose meet . Stopping criterion dose escalation post-surgery infusion reach HEC determine pre-operative infusion determination MTD . After HEC reach , subsequent cohort treat post-operative infusion increase duration HEC maximum duration define study reach MTD define . ( If MTD already detect , duration escalate . ) After stage study evaluate escalation infusion duration complete , study expand evaluate post-operative placement catheter tumor resection . This stage study assess feasibility safety stereotaxic placement catheter 2 day tumor resection use post-operative imaging study planning . Patients receive 96 hour post-resection infusion MTD . Cohorts least three patient enter dose level . Each cohort observe least thirty day completion administration study drug allow observation toxicity next cohort enrol . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Depends number dose-levels , estimate 25-50 patient .</detailed_description>
