	<brief_title>SU6668 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine optimal biologically effective dose SU6668 patient advance solid tumor . II . Assess safety tolerability therapy patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetic profile interpatient pharmacologic variability therapy patient . IV . Determine extent , frequency , duration tumor responses patient treated therapy . V. Determine recommend phase II dose SU6668 future clinical study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral SU6668 twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression 100 % . Cohorts least 6 patient receive escalate dos SU6668 optimal biologically effective dose ( OBD ) determine . Once OBD reach , dose escalation continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine ( possible ) . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
