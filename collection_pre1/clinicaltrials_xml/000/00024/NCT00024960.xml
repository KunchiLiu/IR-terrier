	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) examine role chemical messenger dopamine stuttering . It measure compare number dopamine receptor amount dopamine release brain stutterer normal volunteer . The result may provide information drug block dopamine 's effect might work enable fluent speech . Healthy normal volunteer people developmental stutter age 18 55 may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history possibly physical examination laboratory test . Participants hear test cognitive function test measure speech , language , memory visual skill . In addition , undergo follow procedure : - PET scanning measure brain blood flow dopamine distribution brain . PET us radioactive material show cellular activity specific tissue body . Before start procedure , thin plastic tube ( intravenous , IV line ) place vein arm subject special plastic mask mold face . ( The mask use insure position head change scan . ) For scan , subject lie bed position scanner . A preliminary `` transmission '' scan do make necessary measurement adjustment . Following scan , 10 injection radioactive water give IV line . During injection , subject performs series speech tasks-such singing , tell story , recite nursery rhymes-that elicit either fluent speech stuttering . A special camera detect radiation emit produce image brain blood flow stutter normal speech . Next , raclopride ( radioactive material attache dopamine receptor cell surface ) give IV line picture brain take . Fifty minute raclopride injection , amphetamine-a drug increase brain dopamine levels-is inject IV line picture take show dopamine distribution brain . Fifty minute amphetamine infusion , IV line remove . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain complement interpret information PET scan . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural change tissue . The subject lie table surround metal cylinder ( scanner ) . During procedure , may take 20 minute 2 hour , subject may ask perform simple task , speak move arm . They speak staff member via intercom time procedure move machine time request . Participants may ask return two scan session within year . For scan , 1 injection radioactive water give .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical response dopamine ( DA ) antagonists patient developmental stutter suggest pathophysiology disorder may involve abnormality central DA system . This hypothesis never test use method measure pre- postsynaptic dopaminergic mechanism within CNS . A new PET technique permit evaluation mechanism human subject . 11C raclopride , relatively selective D2 receptor antagonist , use estimate postsynaptic DA receptor bind potential follow establishment equilibrium condition . A low dose bolus amphetamine use release DA presynaptic neuron displace ligand postsynaptic binding site , order estimate size releasable presynaptic DA pool . We propose use technique individual developmental stutter control subject test hypothesis stutter due dopaminergic hyperactivity within CNS . The cause hyperactivity hypothesize due increase either postsynaptic binding potential size releasable presynaptic dopamine vesicular pool ( case postsynaptic receptor may regulate ) . Our study help conjoin modify pathophysiological model . If low dose amphetamine use demonstrate difference people stutter control , second study conduct see stutter behavior per se measurable effect DA release differs effect similar speech task control subject . Lastly , third study , DA releasability measure recovered stuttering affect stutter part family many member stutter . The culmination study attempt isolation DA marker use phenotyping tool genetic study stutter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA STUTTERING AND CONTROL SUBJECTS : Subjects must age 18 55 . Subjects must good general health except primary neurological diagnosis stutter . Subjects may evidence hypertension cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease hyperthyroidism . EKG thyroid function test must within normal limit . Subjects must history traumatic head injury include head trauma result loss consciousness history substance abuse , include alcohol ( exclude caffeine ) . Subjects screen history psychiatric illness , depression , anxiety obsessivecompulsive disorder accord DSMIV ; subject diagnose exclude . Subjects screen past medical history family history speechlanguage disorder ; subject personal significant family history speechlanguage disorder unrelated diagnosis stutter aphasia exclude . Also subject immediate family member significant history heart attack stroke exclude . Women pregnant currently breastfeed exclude study . Subjects pacemaker , aneurysm clip , cochlear implant , shrapnel fragment significant history exposure small metallic object , might become lodged tissue head , neck exclude due MRI . The following criterion must meet identify individual stutter : Affected individual regard stutter disorder , report instance speech know exactly wish say , due production impairment ; instance may accompany feel tension somewhere within vocal tract . Individuals may seek treatment stutter . Speechlanguage pathologist confirms diagnosis stutter disorder affect individual , document presence silent sound prolongation , syllable repetition , word/phrase repetition , interjection pause nonlinguistic locus speech . Affected individual least 5 % dysfluent least 2 speak task use assess fluency . Recovered stutterer must history stutter document speech pathologist responsible evaluation treatment individual childhood . A history stuttering may alternatively document parent least one family member friend . Recovered individual must report long monitor speech routine basis use speech therapy technique speak . Speechlanguage pathologist must judge recovered individual currently free overt stuttering ( le 1 stutter behavior/100 word ) . Onset stutter affected individual recover stutterer must occur childhood ( 3 10 yearsofage ) , unrelated psychological neurological trauma .</criteria>
