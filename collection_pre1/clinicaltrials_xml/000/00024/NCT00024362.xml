	<brief_title>BBR 3464 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Can Treated With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival patient inoperable locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat BBR 3464 . II . Determine response rate , duration response , time disease progression , duration stable disease patient treat drug . III . Determine incidence severity toxic effect drug patient . IV . Determine disease-related symptom patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BBR 3464 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day minimum 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 9 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
