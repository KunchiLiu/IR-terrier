	<brief_summary>LErafAON liposome encapsulate c-raf antisense oligonucleotide . Raf-1 protein produce human cell , normal cancerous , may help protect tumor cell radiation . Antisense oligonucleotides specific drug , decrease amount certain target protein block gene make . Antisense oligonucleotide raf gene reduce amount Raf-1 protein tumor cell . Liposomes tiny globule fat , carry drug body . The experimental agent LErafAON compose liposome carry antisense oligonucleotide Raf-1 protein . It hop decreased Raf-1 cancer cell make sensitive radiation therapy . Patients advance solid tumor receive IV infusion LErafAON least 60 minute , per week , 8 week . In absence progression , patient may continue weekly treatment . Pre-medications administer prior dose study medication . Cohorts least three patient enter escalate dose-levels . Each cohort observe least ten day receive first dose treatment additional patient treat high dose level . Patients follow one month receive last dose study medication . The study stop maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) identify . Dose escalation within patient allow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose LErafAON Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity MTD LErafAON give weekly IV infusion 8 week patient advanced malignancy . II . Characterize plasma pharmacokinetics LErafAON IV infusion . III . Document vivo inhibition Raf-1 protein LErafAON . IV . Detect anti-tumor effect intravenous LErafAON . PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This Phase I Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) study patient recurrent solid tumor malignancy . Study medication administer intravenous infusion least 60 minute , per week , 8 week . In absence progression , patient may continue weekly treatment . Pre-medications administer prior dose study medication . Patients follow one month receive last dose study medication . Patients Complete Response ( CR ) , Partial Response ( PR ) , Stable Disease ( SD ) Week 8 disease assessment may continue receive study medication disease progression ( PD ) . Cohorts least three patient enter escalate dose-levels . Each cohort observe least ten day receive first dose treatment additional patient treat high dose level . Patients follow one month receive last dose study medication . The study stop maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) identify . Dose escalation within patient allow . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Estimated enrollment 15-35 patient ; 3 per dose level , expand 6 DLT occurs .</detailed_description>
