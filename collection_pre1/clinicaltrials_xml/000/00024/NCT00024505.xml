	<brief_title>Multidisciplinary Study Right Ventricular Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : ARVD uncommon disorder consider major cause sudden death life-threatening arrhythmia , particular young population . The prevalence ARVD unknown certainly underestimated difficulty obtain correct diagnosis . It appear particularly frequent certain geographical area , probably founder effect , northeast Italy , large number ARVD case family describe . A noncontrolled study University Padua report frequency familial form 30 percent , indicate existence defective gene large proportion case . In United States frequency disease unknown , number case seem increase . The etiology ARVD unknown recently . The main hypothesis involve apoptotic mechanism , case , viral infection . However , last couple year , two gene cause ARVD identify . The first one encode plakoglobin , protein cardiac junction adhesive signal function . The second ARVD gene cardiac ryanodine receptor ( RYR2 ) , characterize recently Dr. Danieli 's group . In fact , discovery recent study , RYR2 still consider potential candidate . The discovery first disease gene provide basis candidate gene approach follow hypothesis `` final common pathway . '' Thus , major candidate become gene involve cell-cell adhesion encode ion channel . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This multidisciplinary , multicenter , collaborative study investigate cardiac , clinical , genetic aspect ARVD . The specific aim ( 1 ) establish North American ARVD Registry enrol ARVD patient family member , base standardize diagnostic test criterion , prospective longitudinal follow-up study ; ( 2 ) determine genetic background ARVD identify chromosomal locus specific gene mutation associate disorder ; ( 3 ) determine influence genotype clinical course patient ARVD explore phenotype-genotype association contribute improve diagnosis , risk stratification , therapy ; ( 4 ) develop quantitative method assess right ventricular function order enhance specificity sensitivity ARVD diagnosis .</detailed_description>
