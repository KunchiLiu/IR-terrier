	<brief_title>PS-341 Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival 18 week overall survival patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat PS-341 . II . Determine objective response rate patient treat drug . III . Correlate p27 level tumor tissue objective response rate patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive PS-341 IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3-6 month 2 year registration . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-50 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
