	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor effect monoclonal antibody huJ591 patient progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer . - Determine biodistribution dosimetry antibody patient . - Determine effect biodistribution delivery sequence unlabeled vs indium In 111-labeled antibody patient . - Determine HAHA response patient treat regimen . - Correlate dose monoclonal antibody huJ591 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity patient . OUTLINE : Patients assign one two treatment group . - Group I : Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 IV follow indium In 111 monoclonal antibody huJ591 day 1 . - Group II : Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 concurrently indium In 111 monoclonal antibody huJ591 group I . Treatment group repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week monthly 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14 patient ( 7 per treatment group ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
