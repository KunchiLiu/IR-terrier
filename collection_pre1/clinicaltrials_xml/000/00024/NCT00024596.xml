	<brief_title>Family Heart Study - Subclinical Atherosclerosis Network ( FHS-SCAN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , along related health expenditure , mortality , morbidity , remain among significant health-related condition United States develop country . The substantial resource expend investigate problem lead significant scientific advance basic biology , clinical management , epidemiology , public health intervention approach . Despite real advance , remain much do term understand basic biological social process , treatment , public health program . Just earlier research effective identifying variety epidemiologic risk factor cardiovascular disease , recent advance make possible bring bear variety new powerful tool detail study basic process involve atherogenesis . Application tool , combination synthesis prior basic epidemiologic result , provide powerful approach model-driven many previous study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Subclinical Atherosclerosis Network multicenter study genetic epidemiology coronary aortic calcification inflammatory marker . It examine two area great interest contemporary vascular medicine , namely vascular calcification inflammation approximately 3000 person recruit Family Heart Study , additional person African American descent contribute HyperGEN Study . Considerable data , include large number genotype , collect Family Heart Study . The subject bring back additional data collection , include measurement inflammatory marker coronary aortic calcification compute tomography ( CT ) . The network quantify coronary aortic artery calcium volume 441 select , informative pedigree ( approximately 3,000 individual ) previously examine extensively genotyped ( approximately 400 marker span genome ) NHLBI Family Heart Study , order identify gene associate human atherosclerosis . An additional 275 African American sibships ( approximately 600 individual , also examine comparably genotyped ) include address study question high-risk population . Assessment inter-individual variability inflammatory burden host response , extensive metabolic , behavioral , environmental data already collect pedigree provide enhance phenotypic homogeneity increase analytic power assess genetic basis atherosclerosis . State art laboratory statistical method use find , localize characterize influence predispose gene atherosclerosis inflammatory response . Novel genetic analysis method use address issue phenotypic , genetic population heterogeneity , epistasis , complex interaction among genetic environmental risk factor , optimize detection genomic region affect phenotypic susceptibility .</detailed_description>
