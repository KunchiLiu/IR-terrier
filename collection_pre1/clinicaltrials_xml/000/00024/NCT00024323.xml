	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose cisplatin administer 3-AP patient advanced cancer . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine antitumor responses patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cisplatin . Patients receive 3-AP IV 2 hour day 1-4 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 2 3 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos cisplatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
