	<brief_summary>LErafAON liposome encapsulate c-raf antisense oligonucleotide . Raf-1 protein produce human cell , normal cancerous , may help protect tumor cell radiation . Antisense oligonucleotides specific drug , decrease amount certain target protein block gene make . Antisense oligonucleotide raf gene reduce amount Raf-1 protein tumor cell . Liposomes tiny globule fat , carry drug body . The experimental agent LErafAON compose liposome carry antisense oligonucleotide Raf-1 protein . It hop decreased Raf-1 cancer cell make sensitive radiation therapy . Patients advanced malignancy receive daily IV infusion LErafAON 2 week ( total 10 dos ) clinically indicate palliative radiotherapy . Cohorts least three patient enter escalate dose-levels . Each cohort observe toxicity least two week completion treatment study medication next cohort enrol . The study stop maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) identify . Dose escalation within patient allow . Safety supportive care requirement assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose LErafAON Combined With Radiotherapy Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity MTD LErafAON administer daily I.V . infusion , combination radiotherapy , patient advance malignancy . II . Characterize plasma pharmacokinetics LErafAON IV infusion . III . Assess vivo inhibition Raf-1 protein LErafAON . IV . Determine efficacy radiate non-radiated tumor . PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This study traditional Phase I MTD study . Cohorts least three patient enter escalate dose-levels . Patients receive daily IV infusion LErafAON 2 week ( total 10 dos ) . Each cohort observe least two week post treatment study medication allow observation toxicity next cohort enrol . Dose escalation proceed MTD identify . Dose escalation within patient allow . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 27 patient ; least 3 per dose level , expand 6 dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) occur .</detailed_description>
