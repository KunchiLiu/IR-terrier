	<brief_summary>This study examine underlying mental process determine people understand social behavior , remember information , think . Language , planning , problem solving , reason , social behavior , memory critical part cognition make daily life . This study explore association performance various experimental task day-to-day functioning . Healthy normal volunteer patient certain kind brain damage ( primarily focal degenerative lesion human prefrontal cortex ) psychiatric disorder may eligible study . Candidates central nervous system trauma , disease dysfunction screen routine neurological examination history . Participants may ask complete write test , sit front computer monitor press key indicate decision appear screen ( example , whether statement accurate ) answer question test examiner . A skin conductance response ( SCR ) test may do along cognitive test . SCR use electrode ( piece metal attach wire ) place finger measure subject 's emotional reaction test . Participants may also evoke response test , subject watch word scene TV screen response record electrode place scalp ( similar electroencephalogram ) . The test schedule average one session week , session last 30 minute 3 hour . Generally , 15 session schedule 1-year period . Special arrangement make accommodate participant out-of-town . Participants may magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . This test use radio wave strong magnetic field picture structural chemical change tissue . For procedure , subject lie table space enclose metal cylinder ( scanner ) 1 hour . In addition , study subject invite participate training study design improve plan social behavior . Participation require come NIH daily 1- 2-month period 1 2 hour visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Test A Model Representational Knowledge Stored Human Prefrontal Cortex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol test comprehensive model underlie knowledge representation store human prefrontal cortex develop principal investigator . Utilizing variety standardize experimental neuropsychological task technique , investigate hypothesis regard role dorsolateral prefrontal cortex planning , problem-solving , reason ventromedial prefrontal cortex social cognition emotional processing . We ascertain relationship so-called `` cold '' cognitive process plan `` hot '' social process attitude formation specific brain region within prefrontal cortex . Besides cognitive paradigm , use skin conductance event-related EEG record technique subject perform select cognitive task order determine relationship autonomic central nervous system marker emotional modulation speed/duration processing task performance . The data collect protocol value 1 ) Developing model form knowledge representation store human prefrontal cortex ; 2 ) Developing outcome measure drug behavioral treatment disorder prefrontal cortex function ; , 3 ) Developing biologically plausible computer model cognitive sub-components store human prefrontal cortex compose complex skill refer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Controls : Healthy normal control match specific patient group age , education , gender , race recruit advertisement community among friends relative patient . Individuals neurological psychiatric history medical condition would compromise interpretation test result include . Patients : Patients select referral Cognitive Neuroscience Section , NIH Clinical Center , referral recruit approved advertisement appropriate medium medical journal . All patient must diagnose CNS disorder lesion localization ( suspect ) verify CT MRI scan available refer physician complete NIH Clinical Center . Subjects without neurological , neuropsychological , image evidence compatible one recruit diagnosis exclude study subject cooperate neuropsychological testing ( base family report report refer healthcare professional ) . The bulk patient recruit protocol focal degenerative lesion HPFC . We also recruit patient nonfrontal lesion order determine specificity deficit observe patient HPFC lesion . These patient undergo test expect marked cognitive deficit test frontal lobe function . Patients different basal ganglion disorder limbic system lesion include lesion involve differ subset subcortical structure think play important role automatic activation store plan social behavior . Another prediction SEC model patient basal ganglia disorder deficit primarily overlearned component task require visuomotor interaction ( e.g. , visuomotor serial reaction time task ) spar performance high level cognitive planning task n't require simple visuomotor response . The bulk patient patient focal penetrate head injury see NIH part newly fund study conduct primarily , solely , National Naval Medical Center . Patients dementing disorder ( e.g. , frontotemporal dementia ) suitable assessment structure knowledge , particular , systematic general breakdown social nonsocial SEC knowledge representation . Patients focal lesion ( e.g. , dorsolateral frontal ) study assess damage specific subcomponents structured event complex model . Occasionally , single case intensively study due unique behavioral presentation ( see lengthy description ) . A durable power attorney appoint patient unable make decision aspect protocol . In past protocol , almost always spouse . The age range braindamaged patient determined entrance protocol . An equal number leave right unilateral lesion seek determination laterality difference . Patients lesion limit ( rather simply include ) frontal lobe also especially seek . Minors ( age 617 ) include protocol order examine 3 specific question : ( 1 ) What distinction retrievable SEC knowledge ( e.g. , plan social rule ) learn prior adolescence subsequent adolescence ? ; ( 2 ) Does learn development aspect social cognition require intact prefrontal cortex ? ; ( 3 ) Will effect early prefrontal cortex lesion appear age 14 ? The first question address study healthy normal child age 14 experimental social cognition plan task slightly modify use adult ( see six study describe ) . The second question address study single case group child prefrontal cortex lesion social cognition task age 14 . The third question address study child prefrontal cortex lesion incur age 14 age 14 social cognition , metacognition , plan task .</criteria>
