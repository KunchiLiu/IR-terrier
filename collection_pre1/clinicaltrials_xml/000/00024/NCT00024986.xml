	<brief_summary>This study test safety , side effect antiviral activity different dos tenofovir DF child adolescent human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Tenofovir DF belongs group drug call nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor . These drug prevent virus replicating ( make copy ) . HIV become resistant many drug use fight virus drug become ineffective . In laboratory test , tenofovir DF remain effective HIV long anti-HIV medicine , resistance develop , virus may still sensitive drug . HIV-infected child age 4 18 year weigh least 10 kg ( 22 pound ) may eligible study . They must able receive antiretroviral therapy complete least two previous antiretroviral course treatment without benefit . Upon enter study , participant physical , eye neuropsychiatric examination , blood test , include test determine anti-HIV drug patient resistant , echocardiogram ( echo ) , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest X-ray , head CT scan , skin test , special test examine bone . These physical exam test repeat throughout study determine change health . Participants continue current anti-HIV therapy 2 week stop medicine 1-week 'washout ' period . After washout period , patient begin take tenofovir DF . For first 2 day drug , small blood sample ( 1/2 teaspoon ) collect 11 time 48-hour period . A heparin lock ( tube keep place vein ) may put place avoid multiple needle stick . Blood sample collect another 4 day measure well tenofovir DF alone work HIV drug add treatment regimen . After first 6 day , least two anti-HIV drug add . They select base result earlier blood test resistance child 's medication history . After 3 day combination therapy , patient continue therapy outpatient basis . They see clinic every 4 week start study every 12 week physical exam , lab test procedure need . The study last approximately 48 week . Patients benefit therapy may able continue receive tenofovir DF drug company sponsor part another study , protocol study may amend lengthen treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Treat Pediatric HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pediatric phase I study determine biologically active dose obtain information concern safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF , ( 9 - [ ( R ) -2 [ [ bi [ [ isopropoxycarbonyl ) oxy ] methoxy ] phosphinyl ] -methoxy ] propyl ] adenine fumarate ( 1:1 ) ) , formerly know PMPA prodrug , potent nucleotide analogue HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) inhibitor , demonstrate antiviral activity NRTI-resistant HIV-1 . In addition obtain needed biological activity , pediatric safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic data , study utilize tenofovir DF 's potent antiretroviral activity novel resistance mutation pattern , together serial measurement plasma HIV viral load , T-cell flow cytometry , genotypic phenotypic viral resistance analysis conduct pilot study pediatric HIV pathogenesis , response antiretroviral therapy develop strategy optimize management pediatric antiretroviral therapy . We also use initial viral decay dynamic patient characteristic model prediction long-term response antiretroviral therapy . We enroll child become refractory experienced toxicity prior antiretroviral therapy . Initial viral genotyping phenotyping perform fail regimen , data use create effective combination regimen tenofovir DF . After initial 6 day tenofovir DF monotherapy , patient receive tenofovir DF combination optimal antiretroviral therapy determine baseline viral resistance mutation pattern history . The patient follow least 96 week assess long-term tolerability toxicity , assess clinical , virological , immunological response tenofovir DF .</detailed_description>
