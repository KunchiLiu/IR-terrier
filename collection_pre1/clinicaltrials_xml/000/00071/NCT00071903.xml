	<brief_summary>This study examine whether tendency thrombosis , formation blood clot inside blood vessel , role development pseudotumor cerebri ( PTC ) . PTC cause symptom sign isolate elevated blood pressure cranium , cover brain . The disorder lead significant , negative effect visual system . Increased pressure cerebrospinal fluid , , fluid around brain , factor , cause disorder clear . There documentation cluster PTC within family . It suggest potential genetic polymorphisms-abilities take different forms-may become evident exposure condition know trigger PTC . Thrombosis come interaction genetic environmental acquire factor , , result blood clot specific time location . Because disease occur episode , interaction genetic nongenetic risk factor important . Cystinosis recessive disorder cause deposit cystine within lysosome cells-that , sac-like cell part contain various enzyme . Involvement kidney remain primary characteristic , eventually lead renal failure . Of risk factor make easy blood clotting , high level substance call homocysteine particular interest . Too much homocysteine blood plasma common finding patient kidney failure , recently identify independent risk factor disease blood vessel . Participants age meet Dandy criterion PTC may eligible study . Pregnant woman exclude . There also control group nephropathic cystinosis patient PTC . Participants ask undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history . - Physical examination , evaluate eye nervous system . - Collection blood DNA test . - Collection cerebrospinal fluid , procedure call lumbar puncture spinal tap . The evaluation patient generally last 3 4 day . For collection cerebrospinal fluid , patient 's skin back numbed local anesthetic . A special needle insert back , small amount fluid drawn needle . There pain minute , although headache last 24 hour . Also , may bruise , local pain , bleeding , infection needle enters . Patients may also magnetic resonance image scan head . During MRI scan , patient lie still table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . Patients able communicate MRI staff time may ask move machine time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Susceptibility Thrombosis Pseudotumor Cerebri Nephropathic Cystinosis : A Case-Control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During follow-up cystinosis patient protocol # 78-HG-0093 `` Use Cysteamine Treatment Cystinosis '' , find 6 NIH patient develop papilledema diagnose pseudotumor cerebri ( PTC ) , whose occurrence previously report cystinosis . The goal protocol identify role thrombosis susceptibility development PTC nephropathic cystinosis patient view recent finding regard genetic susceptibility thrombosis PTC general . We propose case-control study . A total 9 nephropathic cystinosis patient develop PTC 9 control nephropathic cystinosis patient without PTC screen base upon thrombosis susceptibility screen panel , include total homocysteine , protein C S , antithrombin III , fibrinogen , Factor VIII , Factor IX , Factor XI level , test PT , PTT , activate protein C resistance , antiphospholipid antibody ( ACA panel Lupus AC ) screen FV Leiden mutation , FV G1628A polymorphism , FV R2 allele , Prothrombin 20210 mutation 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene C677T polymorphism patient severe homocysteinemia ( great equal 100 micro mol/l ) . We compare prevalence factor lead thrombosis susceptibility case control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The inclusion criterion include confirm diagnosis pseudotumor cerebri ( past present ) patient nephropathic cystinosis . Patients diagnose pseudotumor cerebri base upon modify Dandy criterion : 1. sign symptom relate increased intracranial pressure ; 2. localize neurological sign exception unilateral bilateral sixth nerve palsy ; 3. neuroimaging study show mass lesion hydrocephalus ; 4. elevate opening pressure normal cerebrospinal fluid content lumbar puncture . Nephropathic cystinosis patient age meet Dandy criterion PTC consider study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant patient exclude study .</criteria>
