	<brief_title>Evaluating Brain Responses Facial Expressions Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research elucidate neurophysiological abnormality associate process emotionally valenced stimuli MDD . Neuroimaging technology lead identification specific abnormality amygdala , ventral striatum medial prefrontal cortex response affective picture . Much knowledge involve structure emotion processing elucidate animal model include classical fear condition reversal-learning paradigm . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study apply similar technique human study emotional processing . The amygdala show play role learn fear ( aversive ) condition emotional stimulus , ventral striatum show play role appetitive conditioning , area prefrontal cortex recruit extinction condition response . These area also implicate key structure abnormal expression emotion MDD . Dysregulation connection amygdala prefrontal cortex hypothesize influence depressed subject ' tendency ruminate emotional event memory , may associate inability properly regulate emotional processing habituation extinction mechanism . Research suggest depressed individual impaired ability disengage habituate emotional stimulus perceive sad . In addition study emotional processing conscious , cortical level , significant evidence suggest many aspect emotional processing occur conscious awareness , preconscious level . The technique backward mask ass automaticity emotional processing response affective stimulus . In MDD , backward mask serf avoid confound interpretation presence cognitive processing , may result depressed subject perseverate emotional stimulus . The propose study build previous fMRI research investigate neurophysiological difference process aversively condition emotional stimulus depress compare healthy individual . Using fMRI technology variation paradigm develop Morris et al. , subject MDD classically condition presence unmasked specific target face ( angry sad ) subsequent neural response stimuli assess utilizing backward masking technique . The BOLD hemodynamic response rate habituation extinction face compare depressed subject MDD healthy control , currently depress versus currently remit subject MDD , MDD subject pre- post-antidepressant therapy . The present amendment propose include additional paradigm test battery . This new paradigm extensively examine different pharmacological manipulation , healthy individual undergo fMRI yet examine patient population . The task complement paradigms presently include extend research encompass appetitive well aversive emotional processing . This research use evaluate neural process involve emotional dysregulation MDD may direct future research potential therapeutic approach treatment mood anxiety disorder abnormalities emotional processing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers ( n=65 ) Healthy Control Sample ( n = 30 , phase 1 ; n = 15 , phase 3 ; n=20 , phase 5 ) : Righthanded subject ( age 1855 ) select meet criterion major psychiatric disorder , know firstdegree relative mood disorder , current score Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 17 item ) depress range ( less equal 7 ) . Control subject match depressed subject age , gender , education . MDD Samples ( n =80 ) MDD SampleCurrently Depressed ( n = 30 , phase 1 ; n = 15 , phase 3 ; n=20 , phase 5 ) : Righthanded subject ( age 1855 ) select primary MDD currently depress DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD current HDRS score moderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great equal 18 ) . MDD SampleRemitted Depressed ( n = 15 , phase 2 ) : Righthanded subject ( age 1850 ) select past history MDD DSMIV criterion . Healthy Relatives MDD Subjects ( n=45 ) Righthanded subject ( age 1855 ) select firstdegree relative MDD meet criterion psychiatric disorder . Subjects match depressed control subject age , gender , education . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects recruit drugna receive psychotropic drug least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) prior scan . Effective medication discontinue purpose study . Subjects also exclude ) serious suicidal ideation behavior , b ) psychosis extent ability provide inform consent doubt , c ) medical condition concomitant medication ( see Appendix III ) likely influence cerebral blood flow neurological function include cardiovascular , respiratory , endocrine neurological disease , ) history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSMIV criterion ) , e ) current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test prior scanning ) , f ) general MRI exclusion criterion , g ) history nonresponse Zoloft intolerable adverse side effect Zoloft treatment . Additional exclusion criterion apply control subject : ) subject current past history axis I psychiatric condition , b ) subject firstdegree family member current past history mood disorder . Subjects beyond age 55 exclude reduce biological heterogeneity encompass MDD criterion , reduce variability BOLD signal . Subjects whose first major depressive episode arise temporally major medical psychiatric condition also exclude , since functional imaging result generally differ report primary MDD .</criteria>
