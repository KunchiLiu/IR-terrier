	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness new formulation triamcinolone acetonide treatment retinal blood vessel disorder . Triamcinolone steroid drug decrease inflammation scar routinely use treat eye inflammation swell . The commercially available form drug associate potentially harmful side effect think due preservative preparation . This study use formulation contain potentially harmful preservative . Preliminary finding study suggest injection steroid eye reduce retinal thickening improve vision . However , may also cause mild discomfort lead vision-threatening condition . The effect drug condition study protocol know . Patients follow condition involve disorder retinal blood vessel may eligible study : - Choroidal neovascularization associate age-related macular degeneration ( 50 year age old ) - Macular edema associate retinal vein occlusion ( 18 year age old ) - Diabetic macular edema ( ( 18 year age old ) Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination - Eye examination ass visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Indocyanine green angiography identify feeder vessel may supply abnormal blood vessel . This procedure similar fluorescein angiography , use green dye flash invisible light . - Optical coherence tomography measure retinal thickness . This test shin light eye produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measurement repeat study determine retinal thicken get good worse , stay . - Stereoscopic color fundus photography examine back eye . The pupil dilate eye drop allow examination photography back eye . - Triamcinolone acetonide injection treat eye . A numbing eye drop , antibiotic eye drop , injected antibiotic put eye triamcinolone acetonide inject eye 's vitreous ( jelly-like substance inside eye ) . After injection , patient lie back 30 minute . An antibiotic eye ointment use 2 day follow treatment . - Blood test measure liver kidney function . Patients return clinic follow-up visit 1 , 4 , 7 day , 1 month first treatment . Patients whose condition improve 3 month receive injection , return eye examination least year 3 year . Patients whose condition improve treatment return follow-up visit 6 9 month first injection every 6 month 2 year . At visit , determination make whether another injection need . After repeat injection , patient return follow-up visit 1 , 4 , 7 day injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use intravitreal injection corticosteroid ( triamcinolone acetonide ) appear promising treatment variety ocular disease associate inflammation . To date , drug available , 'Kenalog-40 Injection ' produce Bristol Myers Squibb , formulate intraocular use . This formulation use intraocularly associate case non-bacterial endophthalmitis , think due presence benzyl alcohol and/or polysorbate 80 . Both suspected irritant . The purpose study evaluate safety novel preservative-free formulation triamcinolone acetonide ( TAC-PF ) four dosage level . The study open-label , single-masked , randomized Phase I study investigate safety potential efficacy new formulation TAC-PF . Sixteen participant retinal vascular disease randomly assign receive via intravitreal injection one 4 dose level ( 1 mg , 4 mg , 8 mg , 16 mg ) TAC-PF . Depending participant 's response , injection may repeat 3 month interval . Participants follow 3 year . The primary outcome assessment post-injection intraocular toxicity related event include increased inflammation , increase intraocular pressure , significant decrease BCVA , cataract formation , retinal detachment , intraocular hemorrhage . The secondary outcome improvement 15 letter best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA , ETDRS ) baseline year 3 , decrease retinal thicken area leakage .</detailed_description>
