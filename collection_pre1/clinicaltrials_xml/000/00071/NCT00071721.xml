	<brief_summary>The purpose trial demonstrate whether valproate therapy delay emergence agitation and/or psychosis outpatient probable Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) experience agitation psychosis illness . A secondary aim determine whether valproate therapy delay progression cognitive functional measure illness . This trial also assess tolerability safety low-dose , long-term valproate therapy . Valproate , anticonvulsant drug , select possible symptomatic efficacy agitation AD , know safety profile numerous clinical population , view recent data support neuroprotective potential AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study represent novel clinical trial strategy design assess prospective `` prophylactic '' therapy psychopathology Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ass approach may alter several aspect pathophysiology AD , perhaps result alteration clinical progression illness . Interpretation result support study relevant biomarkers image data . Valproate select possible symptomatic efficacy agitation AD , know safety profile numerous clinical population , view recent data support neuroprotective potential AD . The primary hypothesis chronic valproate administration participant AD lack agitation psychosis baseline delay emergence agitation and/or psychosis . An effect nature may significant public health implication , instance , delay institutionalization . This randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind , multicenter 26-month trial valproate therapy target dose 10-12 mg/kg/day 300 outpatient mild moderate Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) lack agitation psychosis baseline since onset illness . Participants regular clinic visit well telephone contact assessment behavior , cognition , function , safety tolerability . The chief secondary aim determine whether valproate administration participant AD attenuate clinical progression illness measure reduced rate cognitive functional decline . In addition , issue relate safety tolerability low-dose ( 10-12 mg/kg/day ) therapy address . Biological specimen obtain study marker select relevance disease well postulate mechanism action valproate therapy . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan perform prior experimental treatment one year subset participant order address possible drug-placebo difference brain volume measure . Approximately 300 participant 25-35 clinical trial center United States enrol . Participation include men woman diagnosis probable Alzheimer 's disease , age 55 old , weigh least 40 kg ( 88.2 lb . ) , reside community baseline , Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) 10-20 inclusive , experienced agitation psychosis since onset illness require treatment psychotropic medication exception antidepressant use treatment depressive symptom limit use sedative sleep . Participants , relative , guardian authorize representative informant give ample opportunity inquire detail study . Informed consent form cover consent trial well genetic research biological sample storage MRI scan provide protect patient 's right confidentiality .</detailed_description>
