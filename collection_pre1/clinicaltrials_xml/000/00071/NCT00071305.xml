	<brief_summary>This study evaluate magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) alone together electroencephalography ( EEG ) non-invasive presurgical evaluation . It look contribution method determine location epilepsy seizure , compare invasive method . EEG measure electronic potential difference scalp . On hand , MEG non-invasive technique record activity neuron brain , record magnetic field cause synchronized neural current . It ability detect seizure . Because magnetic signal brain vary , technique must balance two key problem : weakness signal strength noise . The EEG sensitive extra-cellular volume current , whereas MEG primarily register intra-cellular current . Because electrical field quite dependent conductive property tissue , magnetic field significantly less distorted tissue , MEG well spatial resolution . There great deal evidence EEG MEG provide complementary data underlie current ion . Patients 18 year age old epilepsy relieve , consider candidate surgery accept epilepsy surgery , may eligible study . Before surgery , participant either sit lie , head helmet cover entire head , openings eye ear . Brain magnetic field record 275-channel OMEGA system . Throughout session , visual two-way audio communication maintain patient . Acquiring data participant conduct several session , last 10 60 minute , exceed total 120 minute . If first record sufficient quality , patient may repeat twice . Those participant find clear seizure focus proceed directly surgery part treatment . Those whose seizure focus ambiguous proceed invasive monitoring . Participants follow outpatient clinic interval 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month . They may periodically undergo reimaging consider appropriate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Seizure Localization Patients With Medically Refractory Localization Related Epilepsy : Synchronized MEG-EEG Recordings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : We use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) alone , combination EEG ( MEG-EEG ) , study contribution method combination localize yield non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation compare invasive method . We also correlate seizure origin localize data surgical outcome , , retrospect , calculate proportion patient invasive monitoring could avoid . Study Population : Participants study patient medically refractory localization-related epilepsy undergo epilepsy surgery part standard clinical care . Study Design/Methods : We use 275-channel whole-head MEG System ( CTF Systems 2001 Inc ) . Patients undergo supine rest MEG-EEG record prior surgical procedure . The result data integrate data obtain patient 's standard pre-surgical evaluation , compare invasive data obtain chronic invasive monitoring ( clinically indicate ) , and/or intra-operative electrocorticography ( patients-standard care ) . When analyze data , reader blind result modality ( MEG vs. EEG , non-invasive vs. invasive ) . The patient follow outpatient clinic 1- , 3- , 6- 12-month interval . Surgical outcome grade accord Engel International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) outcome scale . The finding protocol indicate lead epilepsy surgery . Outcomes : The primary outcome measure proportion seizure focus detect delineated non-invasively invasively . The secondary outcome measure proportion patient seizure foci co-localized invasively non-invasively , correlation obtain localize data modality surgical outcome , correlation anatomical location epileptogenic zone surgical outcome .</detailed_description>
