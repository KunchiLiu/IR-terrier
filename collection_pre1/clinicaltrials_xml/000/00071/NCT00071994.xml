	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Advanced Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( Liver Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate ability ZD1839 improve progression free survival patient advance unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . II . Evaluate response rate ZD1839 advance unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . III . Evaluate effect ZD1839 measurable disease patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . IV . Evaluate effect ZD1839 serum alpha-fetoprotein level patient abnormal pretreatment serum level . V. Evaluate toxicity ZD1839 advance unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . VI . Investigate biologic marker outcome patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treat ZD1839 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
