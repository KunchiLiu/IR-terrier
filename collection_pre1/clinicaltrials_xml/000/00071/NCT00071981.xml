	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare cytotoxic T-cell response 12 melanoma peptide restrict Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -A1 , -A2 , -A3 patient metastatic melanoma vaccinate without 12 melanoma peptide without helper peptide . - Compare helper T-cell response 6 melanoma helper peptide restrict HLA-DR molecule patient treated vaccination . - Determine whether addition 6 melanoma helper peptide vaccine contain multiple class I Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) -restricted peptides augments T-cell response class I restrict peptide patient . - Determine , preliminarily , whether booster vaccination maintain immune response patient treat vaccination . - Compare rate clinical response survival patient treat vaccination . - Determine , preliminarily , whether cellular immune response correlate clinical response survival rate patient treated vaccination . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord HLA type ( HLA-A1 v HLA-A2 v HLA-A1 -A2 v HLA-A3 ) plan sentinel immunize node biopsy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive 2 injection multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprise 12 melanoma peptide restrict Class I MHC ( 12MP ) emulsify sargramostim ( Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF ) Montanide ISA-51 Montanide ISA-51 VG ( ISA-51 ) intradermally ( ID ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 week 1-3 1 injection primary site day 1 week 5-7 . - Arm II : Patients receive 2 injection multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprise 12MP 1 tetanus helper peptide emulsify GM-CSF ISA-51 ID SC day 1 week 1-3 1 injection primary site day 1 week 5-7 . - Arm III ( close accrual 5/19/08 ) : Patients receive 2 injection multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprise 12MP 6 melanoma helper peptide ( 6HP ) emulsify GM-CSF ISA-51 ID SC day 1 week 1-3 1 injection primary site day 1 week 5-7 . - Arm IV : Patients receive 2 injection multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprise 6HP emulsified GM-CSF ISA-51 ID SC day 1 week 1-3 1 injection primary site day 1 week 5-7 . In arm , patient continue therapy absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression necessitate urgent therapy . Patients evaluate 8 12 week . Beginning 2-3 week week-12 evaluation , patient evidence disease progression may receive booster vaccination accord randomized treatment arm . Patients receive booster vaccination ID SC weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 9 week 1 course , every 12 week 2 course , every 24 week 2 course OR 2 year ( whichever come first ) provide patient require urgent change therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year survival 5 year study randomization . ACTUAL ACCRUAL : A total 175 patient accrue study March 2005 January 2009 .</detailed_description>
