	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity oxaliplatin term response rate patient persistent recurrent endometrial carcinoma refractory curative establish therapy . - Determine nature degree toxicity treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 19-51 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
