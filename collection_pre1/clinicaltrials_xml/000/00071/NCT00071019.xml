	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) major cause death industrialized develop country . Links genetic dietary factor modify risk CHD give fundamental insight cause improve population-based CHD prevention strategy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study identify gene modulate association dietary fatty acid ( FAs ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The study use DNA sample obtain population-based , case-control study Costa Rica 2,150 subject experience myocardial infarction 2,150 match control . Biochemical measurement , dietary data , general information available population . One unique aspect study adipose tissue biomarkers polyunsaturated FAs use evaluate dietary exposure variable . Adipose tissue biomarkers ( i.e. , alpha-linolenic linoleic acid ) good indicator intake population . Furthermore , study show increased level biomarkers adipose tissue strongly associate decrease risk MI , whereas increase 18:2 trans FAs increase risk MI . Gene-diet association study `` candidate pathway '' approach use elucidate genetic mechanism link risk MI exposure polyunsaturated FAs [ include ci trans isomer linoleic acid ( n-6 ) , alpha-linolenic acid ( n-3 ) ] . The focus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gene , PPAR-regulated gene , involve vascular inflammation . Among control , investigator examine whether genetic dietary factor independently affect biochemical marker ( phenotype ) propose gene . They also test whether phenotype clearly identify genetic dietary factor examine together . Because polyunsaturated FAs important activator PPARs capacity regulate gene expression level transcription , metabolic system suitable candidate study .</detailed_description>
