	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate group African Americans Caucasians hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , compare response rate combination treatment pegylated interferon alfa-2b ribavirin , identify possible cause racial difference response therapy . The study enroll total 260 participant , age 18 old , 10 period . In next 5 year 132 subject study locally , include 112 African Americans 20 Caucasians . Participants recruit clinical practice hepatologists ( liver doctor ) University Tennessee Health Science Center also select referral local hepatology clinic Memphis VA Hospital . Volunteers treat pegylated interferon alfa-2b injection weekly oral ribavirin 2 time day 72 week . Study procedure include multiple blood draw . Participants may involve study related procedure 72 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The University Tennessee Health Science Center ( UTHSC ) Memphis Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center establish 2000 support clinical basic research understanding basis chronic disease hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection response therapy clinically infected patient . The primary research goal understand African American ( AA ) patient chronic hepatitis C susceptible chronic infection response rate combination therapy 50 percent less non AA patient . The present study support ongoing work continue provide clinical sample patient chronic hepatitis C undergoing treatment . The specific aim 2005-2010 Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center : determine human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class II-dependent immune regulation T cell specificity affect difference immune response HCV response therapy AA patient compare non AA patient ; determine difference interferon-induced signaling patient respond therapy ; measure compare sustain virologic response standard treatment hepatitis C AA non AA patient . Researchers plan continue enrollment patient `` African American Response Therapy Hepatitis C '' study ( 112 African American patient 20 Caucasian patient ) order meet current specific aim . Participants include adult African American Caucasian patient compensate chronic hepatitis C previously treat interferon and/or ribavirin . Patients meet entry criterion enrol . The total number patient enrol 260 10-year period . In next 5 year 132 subject ( 112 African American , 20 Caucasian ) study locally . Patients recruit primarily clinical practice hepatologists UTHSC . Patients also select referral local Gastroenterology Hepatology clinic Memphis Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Hospital . Patients treat weight base pegylated interferon alfa-2b weekly weight base ribavirin twice day . Duration treatment pegylated interferon alfa-2b ribavirin 72 week . Treatment discontinue 24 week persistent viremia patient wish discontinue therapy . Ribavirin administer orally dose 13 +/- 2 mg/kg per day twice daily , 200 mg capsule . Pegylated interferon alpha-2b administer subcutaneous route .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult , male female , AfricanAmerican Caucasian , age 18 older . Serum positive hepatitis C virus Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) assay [ e.g . Deoxyribonucleic acid , ( BDNA ) ] . Liver biopsy prior entry protocol pathology report confirm histological diagnosis consistent chronic hepatitis . Compensated liver disease follow laboratory parameter Entry visit : Hemoglobin value great equal 12 mg/dL Neutrophil count great equal 1,200/mm^3 Platelets great equal 60,000/mm Albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dL within 20 percent low limit normal ( LLN ) Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dL Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) within normal limit thyroid disease control Reconfirmation documentation sexually active female patient childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception ( intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , progesterone implant rod ( Norplant ) , medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DepoProvera ) , surgical sterilization , barrier method ( diaphragm + spermicide ) , monogamous relationship male partner vasectomy use condom + spermicide ) treatment period 6 month discontinuation therapy . A urine pregnancy test obtain entry prior initiation treatment must negative . Female patient must breastfeed . Documentation sexually active male patient practice acceptable method contraception ( vasectomy , use condom + spermicide , monogamous relationship female partner practice acceptable method contraception ) treatment period 6 month discontinuation therapy . Written inform consent specific protocol obtain prior entry . Hypersensitivity interferon ribavirin . Any cause chronic liver disease chronic hepatitis C. Active hemolytic anemia . Evidence advance liver disease history presence ascites , bleed varix , spontaneous encephalopathy . Any known preexisting medical condition could interfere patient 's participation protocol include : ( Central Nervous System ) CNS trauma uncontrolled seizure disorder ; poorly control diabetes mellitus ; serious pulmonary disease ; immunologicallymediated disease ; gout ' medical condition requiring , likely require course study , chronic administration steroid . Patients evidence ischemia stress testing , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) evidence ischemia , significant arrhythmia , cardiac failure , recent coronary surgery , uncontrolled hypertension , angina myocardial infarction within 12 month . Pretreatment stress test require participant great 50 year age 45 year age diabetic . Patients clinically significant retinal abnormality . Substance abuse , alcohol ( great 80 gm/day ) , intravenous ( IV ) drug inhale drug . If patient history substance abuse , consider inclusion protocol , patient must abstain use abused substance least 3 month . Patients history organ transplantation exclude . Patients infected human immunodeficiency virus . Preexisting psychiatric condition ; especially severe depression , history severe psychiatric disorder , major psychosis , active suicidal ideation and/or suicidal attempt exclude . Patients history mild depression may enter protocol meet follow eligibility criterion monitor intensively . Mild depression include either situational depression limit period depressive symptom , significantly interfere patient 's work daily function . All patient complete Center Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ( CESD ) . The CESD 20item selfreport scale design measure depressive symptomatology experience week prior interview . The item score fourpoint scale ( 03 ) , total score range zero 60 . CESD score 1620 suggest minor depression , score great 20 suggest major depression . The score determine real time . A score 16 high prompt question consideration treatment referral psychiatry . Detailed followup patient may individualize accord his/her need ; would usually include predetermined visit .</criteria>
