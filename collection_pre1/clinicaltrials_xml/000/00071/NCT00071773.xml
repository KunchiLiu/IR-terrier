	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Laser Photocoagulation Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy disorder major public health importance , account majority visual loss among work age Americans . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know diabetes , prevalence diabetic macular edema approximately 20 percent patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 25 patient type 2 DM take insulin , 14 percent patient type 2 DM take insulin . The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) show moderate vision loss , define double visual angle ( e.g. , 20/20 reduce 20/40 ) , reduce 50 percent focal/grid laser photocoagulation accord ETDRS protocol . Although several treatment modality currently investigation , demonstrate mean reduce risk vision loss diabetic macular edema ETDRS laser photocoagulation , demonstrate ETDRS , intensive glycemic control , demonstrate Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) . In DCCT , intensive glucose control reduce risk onset diabetic macular edema 23 percent compare conventional treatment . Long-term follow-up patient DCCT show sustain effect intensive glucose control , 58 percent risk reduction development diabetic macular edema DCCT patient follow Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications Study . In brief , study protocol involve enrollment patient &gt; 18 year age DME involve threaten center macula prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation DME . These patient standard care would treat laser photocoagulation . Eligible eye randomly assign receive either modified-ETDRS technique mild macular grid ( MMG ) technique . Outcome assessment include Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) , fundus photography , fluorescein angiography standardize best-corrected visual acuity . The study consist two phase : Phase 1 ( primary study ) , consist first 12 month follow , structure protocol follow ; Phase 2 , consist second third year follow , management DME include technique laser photocoagulation , discretion investigator . During Phase 1 , follow-up visit occur 15 week ( 3.5 month ) +14 day , 34 week ( 8 month ) + 28 day , 52 week ( 12 month ) + 28 day . The primary outcome phase 1 12 month . The primary study objective Phase 1 include : - Develop standardized study procedure future DME study - Obtain outcome data ( e.g . change retinal thickness , area retinal thickening , area hard exudate , need retreatment , onset new area DME change visual acuity ) follow use modified-ETDRS photocoagulation technique patient DME various level retinopathy severity . - Collect pilot data use MMG technique determine whether subsequent large scale definitive trial conduct Phase 2 ( 2nd 3rd year follow ) conduct collect data , generate hypothesis , long-term outcome DME , irrespective treatment receive . Protocol visit occur 2 year + 8 week 3 year + 8 week . During phase study , therapy laser photocoagulation may use treat DME investigator 's discretion . Because treatment photocoagulation allow one year , 'pure ' result regard outcome laser technique obtain group , available subset patient . The data collect relatively low cost risk usual care . Therefore , collection potentially hypothesis-generating data exploratory analysis justify could important design future study . Interpretation result analyse complicated lack standardize protocol regard patient receive treatment treatment provide . Therefore , result interpret caution . The phase 2 data collection may useful follow : - Evaluation retreatment rate patient respond laser additional treatment require 12 month . This long term analysis `` pure '' group patient provide important information DME recurrence rate need retreatment study eyes patient whose DME improve either two protocol-specified treatment receive Phase 1 treatment necessary 12-month visit . - Provide long-term safety data MMG . This important due less well studied nature MMG , especially long term . - Provide long-term outcome data current standard treatment ( modify ETDRS laser ) today 's patient population assist power future study require least 3 year follow . - Provide data outcome intravitreal steroid patient laser treatment successful . For many patient still DME 12 month , anticipate intravitreal steroid administer . The continued follow patient provide opportunity explore effect steroid retinal thickness visual acuity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; = 18 year . Patients &lt; 18 year old include diabetic macular edema ( DME ) rare age group diagnosis DME may questionable . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes ; Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes ; Documented diabetes ADA guideline ( see DRCR.net Procedures Manual ) . No history renal failure require dialysis renal transplant . No condition opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ; Patients poor glycemic control recently initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 3 month enrol . Ability willingness provide inform consent . No expectation subject move area clinical center area cover another clinical center next 12 month . Study Eye Criteria : At least one eye must meet following criterion : Best correct Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity score &gt; = 19 letter ( approximately 20/400 good ) . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema base clinical exam within 500 micron macular center investigator believe laser photocoagulation indicate . A thickness 250 micron central subfield OR thickness 300 micron one four subfields directly adjacent central subfield optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . No prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation macula . No prior medical treatment DME ( e.g. , intravitreal/peribulbar steroid ) . No panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within prior 4 month . No anticipated need PRP within next 4 month . No major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , intraocular surgery , scleral buckle , glaucoma filter , cornea transplant , etc . ) within prior 6 month . No Nd : YAG laser capsulotomy within prior 2 month . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An eye consider eligible ( 1 ) macular edema consider related cataract extraction ( 2 ) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface disease ( eg . vitreoretinal traction epriretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photo . No ocular condition ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity first 12 month study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome ) . Glaucoma per se exclusion . A patient may two `` study eye '' eligible time randomization . An eye become eligible randomization consider study eye purpose data analysis treatment decision although information gather eye )</criteria>
