	<brief_summary>This study examine safety Zenapax ( daclizumab ) patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . MS think cause over-reactive immune response . T-lymphocytes ( cell immune system ) , think damage myelin , substance cover nerve part spinal cord damage patient MS . Interleukin-2 natural substance body necessary growth T-lymphocytes . Zenapax genetically engineer antibody block activity interleukin-2 thus interfere growth lymphocyte . Therefore , Zenapax may prevent damage myelin occur multiple sclerosis . Patients 18 65 year age relapse remit MS may eligible study . Patients secondary-progressive primary progressive MS may participate . Candidates screen complete neurological medical evaluation review medical record . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Baseline evaluation : Participants four magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan 3-month period assess disease activity . For MRI scan , patient lie table slide scanner - narrow metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . Only patient activity certain level eligible continue treatment phase study . - Zenapax treatment : Patients receive intravenous ( vein ) infusion Zenapax . The first two infusion 2 week apart , follow 13 monthly infusion . - MRI scan : Patients undergo MRI scan every infusion evaluate disease activity identify new brain lesion . - Blood urine test : Blood urine sample collect clinic visit routine laboratory evaluation , immunologic study , genetic test determine predisposition respond Zenapax treatment . - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) : This procedure do last month start treatment seventh month treatment examine immune change occur cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , circulate surround brain spinal cord . A local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . - Skin test : A needle place skin do assess patient 's immune status common antigens tetanus , mumps candida . - Lymphocytopheresis : Lymphocytes collect three time - last month baseline start treatment , fifth month treatment , last month treatment - immunologic study . Blood collect needle arm vein similar way donate blood . The blood flow vein catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The lymphocyte remove rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) return body , either needle another needle arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zenapax ( Daclizumab ) Treat Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) consider T cell-mediated autoimmune disease leading central nervous system ( CNS ) inflammation , demyelination , axonal loss , lead substantial disability young adult . Existing approve treatment include interferon beta , glatiramer acetate mitoxantrone . These therapy moderately effective reduce disease activity . The Neuroimmunology Branch ( NIB ) last three year test tolerability safety monthly intravenously administer daclizumab ( Zenapax ( Registered Trademark ) ) , humanize monoclonal antibody IL-2 receptor alpha chain , patient receive interferon-beta , respond incompletely therapy interferon-beta . Daclizumab well tolerate inhibited inflammatory disease activity almost 90 % . Under amendment protocol , demonstrate efficacy daclizumab maintain interferon-beta therapy discontinue . In current trial , test efficacy daclizumab alone relapsing-remitting MS patient . This trial single-centre , open-label , baseline treatment cross-over phase II trial . Daclizumab administer intravenously 1mg/kg bodyweight . Contrast-enhancing MRI lesion serve primary outcome measure phase II trial , number clinical , MRI , immunological parameter measure secondary tertiary outcome . Daclizumab promise new immunomodulatory treatment relapsing-remitting MS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRETREATMENT SCREENING : To eligible entry study , patient must meet follow criterion time enrollment . Reassessment inclusion criterion occur day zero twelvemonth treatment phase . Between age 18 65 year , inclusive . Patients relapsingremitting MS accord publish criterion . EDSS score 1.0 5.5 . Patients either failed standard therapy ( interferonbeta , glatiramer acetate ) clinical measure , eligible standard therapy , opt start continue standard therapy . Patients able provide write , informed consent prior test protocol , include screen baseline investigation consider part routine patient care . Age criteria inclusion study follow publish diagnostic criterion multiple sclerosis . Due uncommon occurrence MS individual age 18 requirement study large MS cohort include rarely occur patient , appropriate low age range . Patient decision start , continue standard immunomodulatory therapy , make patient discuss conventional treatment option ensure patient make informed decision . Additionally , consent document provide patient explicitly state currently approve therapy potential benefit . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIATING THERAPY : To eligible proceed treatment phase study , patient must least two new gadoliniumenhancing lesion great four sequential baseline MRI scan ( average great equal 0.5 gadoliniumenhancing lesion ) . Patients relapse 30 day initiation treatment . If relapse occurs period eligibility criterion otherwise fulfil , treatment ( day one ) delay corticosteroid administer . If corticosteroid administer , MRI period consider . An additional MRI add 4 week follow completion corticosteroid , maintain total four MRI 's analyzed baseline period . In event relapse , baseline period prolong , necessary , meet criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRETREATMENT SCREENING : Patients exclude study exclusion criterion exist time enrollment . Reassessment exclusion criterion occur day zero twelve month treatment phase . MEDICAL HISTORY : Diagnosis secondaryprogressive primaryprogressive MS , define publish diagnostic criterion . Abnormal screening/baseline blood test exceed limit define : Serum alanine transaminase aspartate transaminase level great three time upper limit normal value . Total white blood cell count le 3000/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count le 85000/mm ( 3 ) Serum creatinine level great 2.0 mg/dl Serological evidence HIV active hepatitis A , B C infection since effect daclizumab defined patient Positive pregnancy test Pregnant breastfeed female . History sign immunodeficiency . Concurrent clinically significant ( determined investigator ) cardiac , immunological , pulmonary , neurological , renal major disease . Any contraindication monoclonal antibody therapy . Contraindication monoclonal antibody therapy include prior history serumsickness similar hypersensitivity reaction receipt monoclonal antibody intravenous immunoglobulin therapy . Patients cognitive impairment unable provide write , informed consent prior test protocol , include screen baseline investigation consider part routine patient care . TREATMENT HISTORY : If prior treatment administer , patient must follow treatment agent required period prior enrollment : Glatiramer acetate , interferonbeta 24 week IVIg , azathioprine , methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , mitoxantrone , plasma exchange , cyclosporine , oral myelin , cladribine immunosuppressive treatment 24 week Corticosteroids 6 week Prior treatment investigational drug procedure evaluate individually investigator . MISCELLANEOUS EXCLUSIONS : History alcohol drug abuse within 5 year prior enrollment . Female patient postmenopausal surgically sterile use acceptable method contraception . Acceptability various method contraception discretion investigator . Documentation patient postmenopausal surgically sterile must available prior enrollment . Male patient surgically sterile practice adequate contraception . Acceptability various method contraception discretion investigator . Documentation patient surgically sterile must available prior enrollment . Unwillingness inability comply requirement protocol include presence condition ( physical , mental , social ) likely affect patient return followup visit schedule .
