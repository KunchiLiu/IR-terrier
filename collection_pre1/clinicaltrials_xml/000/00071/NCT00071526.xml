	<brief_summary>Several study report diabetic subject low plasma vitamin C concentration non-diabetic subject . Although urinary vitamin C loss diabetic subject report increase two study , difficult interpret due lack control vitamin C intake , inadequate sampling , lack control subject , methodology uncertainty vitamin C assay sample processing . Consequently , unclear whether diabetic subject truly low plasma high urine vitamin C concentration . We propose low plasma vitamin C concentration diabetic subject due part inappropriate renal loss vitamin C subject healthy control . We study vitamin C concentration patient type 1 type 2 diabetes match healthy research subject . Vitamin C concentration plasma , neutrophil ( proxy tissue concentration ) urine measure outpatient . In willing admitted Clinical Center , measure 24-hour urinary excretion vitamin C vitamin C free diet , creatinine clearance , measure glomerular filtration rate . On day 2 inpatient study , subject receive single 200mg dose oral vitamin C measure vitamin C concentration frequent blood urine sample determine renal threshold relative bioavailability vitamin C. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) determine genomic DNA responsible two protein mediate sodium-dependent vitamin C transport , SVCT1 SVCT2 . If low plasma high urine vitamin C concentration find diabetic subject , study need explore mechanisms determine recommend dietary allowance patient population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We propose study unlimited number male female subject age 18 65 . This include healthy subject subject type 1 type 2 diabetes . To include study , study subject good general health significant illness compromise clinical stability complication diabetes mellitus alone context metabolic syndrome . Subjects ischemic heart disease and/or peripheral artery disease eligible arm 1 protocol . serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 healthy volunteer , normotensive time study , blood pressure less equal 140/90 diabetic subject , blood pressure less equal 170/95 long clinically stable usual state health , example , chest pain , shortness breath , headache , syncope fatigue The aim study determine whether diabetic subject lose vitamin C urine normal clinical condition ( i.e . treatment ) native untreated state uncontrolled hyperglycemia . Therefore patient discontinue medication . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( arm 1 ) : Exclusion criterion include follow : significant organ malfunction lead clinical instability include liver disease , pulmonary disease , stroke anemia investigator discretion serious chronic illness history serious chronic illness result clinical instability complication diabetes pregnancy alcohol abuse , drug addiction use illegal drug positive HIV hepatitis ( B C ) screen test ( subject notify test result ) . presence concomitant condition judgment investigator influence vitamin C metabolism vitamin C renal handling EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( arm 2 3 ) : Exclusion criterion include follow : significant organ malfunction lead clinical instability include liver disease , pulmonary disease , ischemic heart disease , heart failure , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , anemia investigator discretion serious chronic illness ; history serious chronic illness ; coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease result clinical instability pregnancy alcohol abuse , drug addiction use illegal drug positive HIV hepatitis ( B C ) screen test ( subject notify test result ) . presence concomitant condition judgment investigator influence vitamin C metabolism vitamin C renal handling For inpatient subject , additional exclusion criterion consumption hospitalization food beverages vitamin C free diet .</criteria>
