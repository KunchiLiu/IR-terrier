	<brief_summary>This study evaluate state completely deprive sleep effect recording magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) , relation alert someone sleepy someone perceives . EEG measure electronic potential difference scalp . On hand , MEG non-invasive technique record activity neuron brain , record magnetic field cause synchronized neural current . It ability detect seizure . Because magnetic signal brain vary , technique must balance two key problem : weakness signal strength noise . The EEG sensitive extra-cellular volume current , whereas MEG primarily register intra-cellular current . Because electrical field quite dependent conductive property tissue , magnetic field significantly less distorted tissue , MEG well spatial resolution . There great deal evidence EEG MEG provide complementary data underlie current ion . The complex relationship sleep epilepsy well know . Sleep use many year powerful EEG activator . Many researcher support hypothesis specific activate effect sleep deprivation epileptic discharge . Sleep deprivation define sleepless state longer 24 hour . The increase use MEG diagnosis could improve procedure evaluate patient surgery epilepsy , make invasive study less necessary . Patients 18 year age old , diagnosis epilepsy document last routine EEG ( least 2 week earlier ) routine EEG day baseline MEG-EEG without interictal epileptiform discharge ( IEDs ) may eligible study . Participants rat accord Epworth , Stanford , Karolinska Sleepiness Scales , determine subjective sleepiness . They randomly assign stay awake night sleep hospital overnight . That , sleep deprivation non-sleep deprivation synchronize MEG-EEG recording perform random order . Then sequence sleep deprivation non-sleep deprivation reverse within 14 21 day . During recording , patient either sit lie head helmet cover entire head , openings eye ear . Brain magnetic field record 275-channel OMEGA system . Throughout session , visual two-way audio communication maintain patient . Recording session last 90 180 minute , patient allow take break least 10 minute scanner . Attempts make encourage patient stay awake sleep amount time recording , acquire comparable amount sleep awake recording .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activating Effects Sleep Deprivation Synchronized MEG-EEG Recordings Epilepsy Patients With Non-Diagnostic EEG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : We would like evaluate activate effect complete sleep deprivation ( SD ) synchronize MEG-EEG recording , component singly , relation degree alertness recording ( awake vs. sleep ) subjective degree sleepiness assess standardized scale . We postulate acute SD increase diagnostic yield synchronize MEG-EEG activate modality ( MEG , EEG ) degree . The increase diagnostic utility MEG could improve epilepsy surgery evaluation procedure many patient render invasive study less necessary . The medical economic utilization expensive resource MEG could thus rationalize . Population : Participants study epilepsy patient whose last routine interictal EEG ( perform least two week earlier ) , subsequent pre-screening EEG screen MEG-EEG show interictal epileptiform discharge ( IEDs ) , therefore consider non-diagnostic . Study Design/Methods : We use 275-channel Whole-head MEG System ( CTF Systems 2001 Inc. ) . Patients screen , non-SD SD MEG-EEG degree sleepiness assess use Epworth , Stanford Karnolinska sleepiness scale . Starting one day MEG-EEG , SD non-SDMEG-EEG perform random order within 14-21 day . This ensure equal amount sample effect SD non-SD data set . The MEG-EEG session last 90 180 minute . Patients may take break least 10 minute scanner . We attempt record comparable amount awake sleep data . At least thirty minute artifact-free baseline , non-SD SD MEG-EEG analyze . For purpose blinding , modality read independently two reader , blind relationship MEG-EEG data sleep deprivation , result obtain modality subjective degree sleepiness . Only interpretation modality agree upon reader accept . When agreement , third independent reader resolve disagreement . Outcomes : The primary outcome measure proportion seizure focus detect delineated SD synchronize MEG-EEG recording . Comparisons also make record modality , accord state alertness record subjective feeling sleepiness recording .</detailed_description>
