	<detailed_description>Intracranial aneurysm `` blister '' form within artery base brain . A rupture aneurysm may lead subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . The mortality rate patient suffer SAH 40 44 percent , many survivor endure major disability . Most deaths SAH due rapid massive brain injury initial bleeding , correctable medical surgical intervention . Thus , prevention aneurysm formation paramount importance . Scientific evidence suggest genetic component play important role development intracranial aneurysm , however specific gene identify . The Familial Intracranial Aneurysm Study collaborative research effort neurologists neurosurgeon throughout United States , Canada , Australia New Zealand identify possible gene may increase risk stroke , particularly , development aneurysm blood vessel brain . This study involve 475 family multiple affect family member , also determine effect environmental factor cigarette smoke high blood pressure expression genes.A group physicians throughout North America , Australia New Zealand form collaborative effect identify gene may important development aneurysm blood vessel brain . This study affect individual family , know Familial Intracranial Aneurysm ( FIA ) study , sponsor National Institutes Health involve 475 family . FIA II involve additional 200 family plus 1800 subject Intracranial Aneurysm family history . These family individual use replicate finding FIA I. FIA II take place North America . To eligible participate study , family must two affected pair sibling ( brothers/sisters ) 3 family member affect intracranial aneurysm . Subjects participate eligible family history , confirm intracranial aneurysm . Participants ask complete family history questionnaire ( family history ) medical history questionnaire . They also blood pressure measure give small sample blood . In addition , medical record request confirm diagnosis intracranial aneurysm . There monetary compensation participation . The identification susceptibility gene , along good understanding environmental interaction cigarette smoking , may result prevent development intracranial aneurysm and/or intracranial aneurysm rupture people risk condition .</detailed_description>
