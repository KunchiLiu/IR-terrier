	<brief_summary>This study examine central region brain activation pattern associate simple vocal behavior condition normal auditory feedback-when people hear speak . Such feedback play major role learn maintain human voice control . But voice control harm neurological injury disease , reduce ability person orally communicate . Research show auditory feedback continuously monitor , bring automatic voluntary correction amplitude ( loudness ) frequency ( pitch ) human voice . This study aim determine area brain activity dependent level blood oxygen . It provide new knowledge basic vocal motor control provide basis investigation integration hear speak human vocal expression throughout life . Participants 18 45 year age normal hearing voice function steady heart rate may eligible study . Participants evaluate speech-language specialist , regard history voice health measure voice function . They test ability vary voice amplitude frequency test hearing . Also , undergo electrocardiogram determine heart rate . For study , participant undergo MRI scan . During MRI scan , patient lie still table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan 45 90 minute . Patients may ask lie still 90 minute time . As scanner take picture , loud knocking noise , patient wear headphone muffle sound . The headphone also enable patient hear voice . The patient 's head position coil 25 30 cm diameter support headrest . A microphone place 2 cm patient 's mouth communication collection data . Also , angle mirror attach head coil , patient look outside scanner . By way projection screen , patient receive visual cue vocalize , use voice . Patients ask repeatedly follow vocalization task : ( 1 ) rest , ( 2 ) hum sigh without voice ( exhale ) , ( 3 ) hum sigh audibly , ( 4 ) hum audibly increase decrease voice frequency , ( 5 ) hum audibly increase decrease voice amplitude . During scan , patient able communicate MRI staff time may ask move machine time . Some scan may do 3 Tesla scanner . It late advance MRI , strong magnetic field common 1.5 Tesla scanner . Functional MRI do person perform task , move limb speaking . The fMRI scan take 1 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Auditory feedback play uniquely prominent role learn maintenance human voice control . Yet much know central voice motor control come research non-human primate production genetically-determined vocalization rely upon auditory feedback . Extrapolation study bat echolocation suggest midbrain network underlie automatic audiovocal error correction human ; however , bat human differ greatly anatomical physiology .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female race ethnicity eligible participate study . Volunteers must age 18 45 normal hear voice function . Participants select steady heart rate . A history voice training require , participant must able produce grossly independent voice F0 amplitude change . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Contraindications participation include : pregnancy , cardiac pacemaker auto defibrillator , artificial heart valve , neural pacemaker , surgical metal clip brain , eye , blood vessel , cochlear implant , ocular implant foreign body metal shaving splinter , insulin pump , implant drug infusion device , shrapnel , bullet shot wound , tattooed makeup . Participants screen NMR Center Safety Screening Questionnaire also include item intraventricular shunt , transdermal medication patch , wire suture , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , body piercings . Given surgical staple , orthopedic pin , orthodontic brace dental implant longer consider absolute contraindication MRI , Dr. Saxon Dr. Kearney approve disapprove participation study base judgment MR compatibility item , use publish guide include reference . Volunteers also exclude find pregnant , report tendency toward claustrophobia unable reason lie still within MR scanner .</criteria>
