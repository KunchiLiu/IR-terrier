	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Two Blood Transfusion Strategies Surgical Patients With Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Red blood cell transfusion extremely common medical intervention United States worldwide ; 14 million unit blood transfuse United States . Between 60 70 percent blood transfuse surgical setting . Despite common use red blood cell transfusion , threshold transfusion adequately evaluate controversial . A decade ago , standard care administer peri-operative transfusion whenever hemoglobin ( Hgb ) level fell 10 g/dl ( `` 10/30 rule '' ) . Concerns safety blood , especially respect HIV hepatitis , absence data support 10 g/dl threshold lead current standard care , administer blood transfusion base presence symptom , specific Hgb/hematocrit level . However , randomize clinical trial do surgical patient test efficacy safety withhold blood patient develop symptom , `` 10/30 '' approach transfusion . Patients underlie cardiovascular disease great risk adverse effect reduce Hgb level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This multi-center randomized trial test effectiveness transfusion strategy maintain postoperative Hgb level 10 g/dl ( liberal transfusion ) improve patient outcome . This compare restrictive ( symptomatic ) transfusion strategy blood transfusion withhold patient develops symptom anemia Hgb le 8 g/dL . Participants randomly assign one two transfusion strategy . The liberal ( 10 g/dl ) threshold strategy use enough red blood cell unit maintain Hgb level 10 g/dl hospital discharge . Restrictive ( Symptomatic ) transfusion strategy patient receive red blood cell transfusion symptom anemia , although transfusion also permit , require , Hgb level fall 8 g/dl . Outcomes include functional recovery ( primary outcome : ability walk 10 foot across room without human assistance death 60 day post-randomization ) , low extremity activity daily live instrumental activity daily live , survival 60-days long-term , disposition ( i.e. , nurse home placement ) , postoperative complication ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , death hospital , pneumonia , wound infection , thromboembolism , stroke ) . Ambulation 60 day know highly predictive ultimate functional outcome well mortality one year . Because inability walk important implication quality life , common problem , far outweigh small risk viral infection complication transfusion elderly patient . The trial also evaluate effect transfusion threshold postoperative risk acute cardiac ischemia . The strategy enhance surveillance ischemic event increase number EKG serum troponin measurement beyond already call original FOCUS protocol . There ancillary study trial ( R01 HL085706 ) examine delirium outcome subsample 139 patient . We assess short-term ( hospital ) longer-term ( 30 day ) severity delirium .</detailed_description>
