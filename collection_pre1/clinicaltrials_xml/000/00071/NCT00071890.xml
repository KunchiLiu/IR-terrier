	<brief_summary>This study examine whether interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) give interruption antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment could significantly extend period time patient temporarily take ARV treatment also preserve CD4 count 350 cell per microliter . There evaluation toxicity , extremely harmful effect , ARV , effect quality life . The use ARV medication greatly improve condition mortality HIV-infected patient . But use long term , medication associate great toxicity medication fatigue . As result , patient may adhere ARV use , resistance virus may grow . The CD4 molecule surface helper T-lymphocytes , T-helper cell . It serve primary receptor HIV-1 HIV-2 , allow virus gain entry host . The CD4 count increase immediately response ARV , give estimate state patient 's immune system . Thus , strong marker immediate risk opportunistic infection , one take advantage person 's weaken immune system . IL-2 molecule naturally produce activate T cell . In patient HIV , IL-2 treatment increase CD4 count clinical importance increase clear . This study compare decline CD4 count , ARV interrupt , two random group participant : ( 1 ) receive three cycle IL-2 ( one every 8 week ) combination ARV therapy first 24 week study stop ARV ( 2 ) receive ARV therapy without IL-2 24 week stop ARV . Patients 18 year age old HIV-1 infection ARV therapy least 1 year , currently CD4 count 500 cell per microliter high never CD4 count le 200 cell per microliter viral load less limit detection , may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure test : - Physical examination . - Blood test measure blood lipid ( fat ) , sugar , complete blood count include platelet , chemistry . - Assessment fat distribution . - Questionnaire quality life . In addition , participant randomly place group receive IL-2 ARV get echocardiogram beginning study week 24 . They receive start dose 6 million unit IL-2 injection skin twice day . Each three IL-2 cycle last 5 day . After 24-week period , participant group stop take ARV medication CD4 count still equal great 500 cell per microliter . The study continue 120 week . Participants ask continue visit clinic every 8 week evaluation viral load CD4 count . Every 24 week , ask answer questionnaire quality life . Blood test measurement also do follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Study Evaluating Effect IL-2 Preservation CD4 T-Lymphocytes After Interruption Antiretroviral Treatment HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 T-Lymphocyte Count Greater Than 500 Cells/mm3 Who Received Antiretroviral Tx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication greatly improve morbidity mortality HIV-infected patient long-term use agent associate significant toxicity medication fatigue lead problem adherence eventual development virologic resistance . The spectrum ARV toxicity broad include development lipodystrophy syndrome lipid abnormality glucose intolerance diabetes , increase evidence suggests increase risk cardiovascular complication ARV-treated HIV-infected individual . Current PHHS treatment guideline recommend defer ARV treatment initiation asymptomatic HIV-infected individual CD4 count great equal 350 cells/micro liter , treatment initiation CD4 count le 350 cells/micro liter . Several patient start antiretroviral therapy high CD4 count ( base old treatment initiation guideline ) experience significant immunologic reconstitution ARV initiation , elect interrupt antiretroviral therapy CD4 count reach level current recommendation therapy initiation ( le 350 cells/micro liter ) . Studies date suggest baseline nadir CD4 count best predictor long duration treatment interruption may beneficial respect reversal delay long-term ARV-associated toxicity improve quality life . It known intermittent cycle IL-2 administration lead expansion CD4 pool prolong survival CD4 T cell . In study hypothesis test IL-2 give prior ARV treatment interruption could significantly prolong period ARV treatment interruption preservation CD4 count 350 cells/micro liter , prolongation beneficial respect antiretroviral related toxicity quality life . The study two part : first part ( 24 week ) patient randomize 1:1 either receive three cycle IL-2 ARV therapy ARV therapy alone . In second part ( week 24 week 120 ) , participant interrupt therapy restart CD4 le 350 cells/micro liter . The main comparison week 72 , proportion patient two group remain drug CD4 great 350 cells/micro liter compare . At regular interval ( every 24 week ) lipodystrophy measurement quality life questionnaire evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 18 year . HIV1 infection confirm ELISA Western Blot screen . Category A B HIV1 infection . Antiretroviral treatment : start least 12 month prior screen visit ; stable continuous least 12 week prior screen visit ; modify virologic failure . IL2 naive CD4 ( + ) Tlymphocyte count great equal 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) twelve week prior screen ( historical ) screening . Nadir CD4 ( + ) Tlymphocyte count great equal 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) prior screen visit ( , measurement whose value may less 200/mm ( 3 ) since diagnosis HIV infection . Plasma HIV RNA le 50 copies/ml 12 week precede screening ( historical , less limit detection different method and/or cut use ) screening . For woman childbearing age : use effective contraception ( hormonal birth control pill injection , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization and/or mechanical barrier method diaphragm condom ) ; participant agreement fully comply prevention transmission recommendation period viremia sexually active ( latex condom without additional barrier method ) . Desire interrupt antiretroviral therapy . Ability sign inform consent ( later W2 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Previous treatment IL2 . Combined treatment interferon , interleukin , antiHIV vaccine , systemic ( topical inhale ) corticosteroid hydroxyurea within previous 12 week . Diagnosis AIDS . Acute infection 14 day precede inclusion . Pregnant , lactate woman desire conception use contraception . Hemoglobin le 10 g/dl ; neutrophil less 1,000/mm ( 3 ) ; platelet le 50,000/mm ( 3 ) ; creatinine great 1.5 time upper limit normal ( N ) ; bilirubin great 3N ; AST ALT great 3 N. Progressive disease malignant , psychiatric , cardiac , pulmonary , thyroid , renal neurological ( peripheral central ) origin severe disorder hemostasis . Severe uncontrolled hypertension . Previous progressive pathology contraindicate administration IL2 . History extensive psoriasis , Crohn 's disease autoimmune disease involve severe complication . HTLV1 infection ( ELISA positive ) . Hepatitis B virus coinfection treat lamivudine tenofovir adefovir . Since atazanavir use associate high bilirubin level ( mostly indirect ) absence clinical consequence , subject atazanavir bilirubin 4.5 time N may allow participate level stable approval PI PI designate cover physician .</criteria>
