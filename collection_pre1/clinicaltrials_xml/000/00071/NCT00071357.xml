	<brief_summary>This study examine non-invasive method ass vasculature , , development blood supply necessary growth tumor . The hope identify way gene express within tumor , area show low flow versus show high flow dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) . Most patient solid epithelial cancer , develop free surface lining inside body , die distant spread tumors-metastasis . After spread , cure difficult tumor detect early locally . Tumors develop new supply blood . Traditional anticancer therapy goal cause decline tumor . Yet focus tumor 's blood supply , microscopic difference tumor clonal difference within tumor may avoid . Doing may overcome tumor resistance treatment may result treatment universally apply across tumor type . Female patient 18 year age enrol protocol Analysis Brain Metastasis Patients Breast Cancer , without Over-Expression HER-2 , undergo MRI scan immediately surgery invited participate study . Patients see oncology outpatient clinic NIH Clinical Center referral outside physician may eligible study . Participants undergo DCE-MRI immediately craniotomy-the surgery scheduled-in conjunction clinically indicate MRI . The preoperative MRI take 30 minute , DCE-MRI take 15 minute . During MRI , patient lie still table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . They may ask lie still 5 minute time . As scanner take picture , loud knocking noise , patient wear earplugs muffle sound . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan may ask move machine time . During part MRI , patient receive contrast agent , one gadolinium-based , vein . This agent change relative brightness contrast MRI image condition . Before agent use , patient ask previous allergic reaction gadolinium-based contrast agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Metastasis epithelial tumor , breast cancer , brain common problem , significant consequence respect neurological dysfunction shorten survival . One necessary step tumor growth anywhere development blood supply . Objectives : We seek compare new , non-invasive method assess neo-vascularization , dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) gold-standard-microvessel counts-and see identify gene expression pattern within tumor , area show low flow versus high-flow DCE-MRI feature within tumor influence degree neovascularization . This prospective study utilized conjunction protocol entitle `` Analysis Brain Metastasis Patients Breast Cancer , without over-expression HER-2 '' evaluate breast tumor metastatic brain . Study Population : A series woman breast cancer metastatic brain ( n=39 ) ( n=39 ) over-express growth factor receptor , HER-2 , enter prospective trial pre-operative MRI imaging perform matter standard medical practice . At time pre-operative MR , propose add one additional , 10-minute MR series , dynamic , contrast-enhance image assess extent blood flow various aspect tumor . Anticipated Risks Benefits : There obvious risk benefit patient participate protocol . It felt study involve minimal risk . Estimation Outcome/Potential Meaning : We believe protocol help u identify tumor high low degree neovascularization well identify tumor-intrinsic factor via microarrays perform microdissected tissue . This become important issue cytostatic treatment , anti-angiogenic agent , enter clinical area , use singly combination cytotoxic therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A woman know radiographic evidence breast neoplasm metastatic brain , agree participate protocol `` Analysis Brain Metastasis Patients Breast Cancer , without overexpression HER2 , '' undergo preoperative MR scan immediately surgery . 2 . Medicallyindicated ( diagnostic and/or therapeutic ) brain tumor resection . 3 . Informed consent female patient , age 18 older . In general , patient le 18 year age rarely breast cancer metastatic brain . 1 . Inability provide inform consent prior surgery . 2 . Medical condition correct prior surgery would standard contraindication craniotomy ( brain tumor patient ) . 3 . Conditions preclude MR image brain ( Patients pacemaker , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel injury implantable electronic device ) know allergy gadolinium . 4 . Men</criteria>
