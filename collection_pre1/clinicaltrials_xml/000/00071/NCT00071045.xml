	<brief_summary>This study collect biological sample use research experiment aim well understand clinical feature certain disease . The specimen may use evaluate effectiveness know therapy , refine treatment approach , identify potential new therapy , explore opportunity disease prevention . The following individual 2 year age old may eligible study : - Patients cancerous solid tumor cancerous non-cancerous blood disorder screen enrolled treatment study NIH Clinical Center - HLA-compatible donor family member ( 18 year age old ) patient evaluate enrolled NIH study stem cell transplant donor - Patients cancerous solid tumor cancerous non-cancerous blood disorder bone marrow failure condition participate NIH treatment protocol travel NIH Clinical Center refer participation home health care provider . Research sample collect participant blood drawn bone marrow , urine , stool collect , tumor tissue biopsied part general medical care . Investigators may periodically request additional sample blood , stool , urine . Participants 18 year age old may donate large number white blood cell procedure call leukapheresis . This procedure part general medical care would do research purpose . For apheresis , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein subject 's arm . Blood flow vein cell separator machine , white cell separate red cell , platelet , plasma spin process . The white cell remove collect , rest blood return subject second tube place arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Tissue Specimens From Patients With Solid Tumors Blood Disorders Their HLA-Compatible Family Members</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol collect blood , bone marrow , urine , stool , buccal mucosa and/or malignant non-malignant tissue patient either evaluated enrollment , consent NIH Clinical Center treatment protocol , receive therapy disease home health care provider . Since substantial proportion clinical translational research Hematology Branch involve patient undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation , protocol also open people identify suitable HLA-compatible donor patient undergoing evaluation already enrol allogeneic stem cell transplant protocol receive stem cell transplant home health care provider . These HLA-compatible donor serve source peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( peripheral blood draw leukapheresis ) use evaluate allogeneic graft versus host graft-versus-tumor effect . The primary objective provide mechanism collection , track , store , dispense , analyze dispose laboratory research sample patient HLA match donor . There primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
