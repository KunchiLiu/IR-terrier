	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety multiple biweekly intravenous dos Replagal 26 week 25 child Fabry disease way agent improve health patient population . Fabry disease genetic disorder inherit X-linked recessive trait . It cause deficiency enzyme alpha galactosidase , normally break lipid , fatty substance , call ceramidetrihexosidase , build block cell body . The deficiency break lipid eventually cause lipid accumulate injure cell . Problems blood vessel , kidney , heart , nerve result . The disease typically occur childhood adolescence , repeat episode severe pain extremity symptoms . There definitive treatment , pain management important caring patient Fabry disease . Although know exactly lipid accumulation bring problem , study another lipid storage disorder , Gaucher 's disease , show illness reverse lipid remove appropriate enzyme , Replagal , give intravenously . In study , gene response body 's cell Fabry disease describe , gene response change enzyme use . Patients 7 17 year age Fabry disease may eligible study . They undergo follow test procedure : - Physical examination . - Neurological examination . - Vital sign . - Urinalysis . - Blood test determine complete blood count chemistry . - Questionnaire pain . - Tests pertain sweat . - Electrocardiogram . - Doppler blood flow study . - Diary recording symptom use pain medication . Participants go evaluation , period 5 day , either inpatient outpatient . Participants receive intravenous infusion Replagal every week , dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight . Vital sign measure infusion immediately 1 hour afterward . There careful monitoring allergic reaction side effect . The infusion time take approximately 40 minute . This study last 6 month , possibility extend another 6 months-a maintenance study patient continue receive Replagal dose every 2 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective clinical trial evaluate : 1 ) safety multiple biweekly ( i.e . every week ) intravenous ( IV ) dose Replagal 26 week 25 child age 7-17 year old Fabry Disease , 2 ) pharmacokinetics Replagal patient population . Safety determine standard clinical laboratory measurement .</detailed_description>
