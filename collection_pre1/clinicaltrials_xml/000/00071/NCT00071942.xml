	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity associate repeated vaccination admixture recombinant vaccinia virus ( rV-MUC-1 rV-TRICOM ) . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) rV-MUC-1 rV-TRICOM vaccine admixture . III . To evaluate toxicity add GM-CSF admixture rV-MUC-1 rV-TRICOM . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess host immune reactivity follow rV-MUC-1 rV-TRICOM without GM-CSF administration . II . To determine whether vaccination rV-MUC-1 rV-TRICOM without GM-CSF associated antitumor activity . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients receive vaccination comprise recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine intradermally day 1 29 ( total 2 dos ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 10 patient ( include 5 HLA-A2-positive patient ) receive vaccination MTD sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously day 1-4 29-32 . Patients follow 4 week , monthly disease progression , annually 15 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 11-22 patient accrue study within 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
