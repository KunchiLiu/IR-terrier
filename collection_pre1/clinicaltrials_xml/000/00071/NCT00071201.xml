	<brief_title>Evaluate Efficacy , Safety PK Adefovir Dipivoxil Liquid Suspension Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 48 patient chronic hepatitis B enrol four group represent vary degree renal function . Grouping achieved estimation creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) use Cockcroft-Gault method calculation time screening : Group 1 : Mild ( Clcr = great equal 50 less 80 mL/min ) Group 2 : Moderate ( Clcr = great equal 20 less 50 mL/min ) Group 3 : Severe ( Clcr = great equal 10 less 20 mL/min ) Group 4A-B : End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) include hemodialysis : - Group 4A ( Clcr = le 10 mL/min ) - Group 4B ( Patients undergo hemodialysis ) At baseline visit ( day 0 ) , blood urine sample collect pre-dose ( prior 0 hour ) patient receive oral dose liquid adefovir dipivoxil accord treatment guideline outline protocol . Pharmacokinetic parameter plasma determine day 0 week 12 visit patient week 48 visit group 1 , 2 , 3 , 4A patient . Pharmacokinetic parameter urine determine day 0 , week 12 week 48 visit group 1 , 2 , 3 , 4A patient . At week 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 visit , pharmacokinetic assessment plasma determine pre-dose ( Ctrough level ) group 1 , 2 , 3 , 4A . For group 4B patient , pharmacokinetic assessment determine week 4 8 prior upon completion hemodialysis . Evaluations safety efficacy conduct 4 weekly interval week 48 group 1 , 2 , 3 , 4A , week 12 group 4B . At visit , patient receive next study medication allocation . Study medication administration continue total 48 week .</detailed_description>
