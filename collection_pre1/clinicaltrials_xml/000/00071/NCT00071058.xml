	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness treat adrenocortical cancer combination chemotherapy use doxorubicin , vincristine , etoposide addition drug mitotane tariquidar , possible , surgery . Adrenocortical cancer cell large amount protein call P-glycoprotein `` pump '' anti-cancer drug cell , decrease effectiveness . Continuous infusion doxorubicin , vincristine , etoposide may improve chemotherapy result block P-glycoprotein pump , may use tariquidar , experimental drug know block P-glycoprotein pump . Patients 18 year age old adrenocortical cancer recur , spread , treat surgically may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination ; review pathology slide ; blood test ; electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ; image test , include compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis ; chest x-ray ; possibly bone scan imaging test need evaluate cancer , urine study , echocardiogram . Also , biopsy ( removal small sample tumor tissue ) may require specimen available confirm cancer . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Tumor biopsy . Before start chemotherapy , small piece tumor remove study P-glycoprotein pump determine tumor genetics . - Blood draw . Blood drawn treatment begin establish baseline level future blood test . - Central venous catheter placement . A specially trained physician place plastic tube major vein chest . The tube use give study drug medication withdraw blood sample . It stay body month remove treatment complete . The tube placement do local anesthetic radiology department operate room . - Chemotherapy . Treatment cycle 21 day . Doxorubicin , vincristine , etoposide give central venous catheter infusion pump continuously 96 hour start day 1 cycle . The dose drug may increase decreased cycle cycle , base side effect . Mitotane give pill form start day 1 cycle 1 take every day throughout entire study . The mitotane dose gradually increase long side effect tolerable . Tariquidar give central venous catheter 30-minute infusion day 1 3 every cycle . The tariquidar dose remain throughout study . Treatment continue two cycle cancer go , surgery do remove remain cancer , , surgery option , cancer grown define progressive disease . - Nuclear scan . A nuclear scan do treatment begin day 1 day 3 first treatment cycle administration tariquidar evaluate P glycoprotein response treatment . - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan . These scan do every two treatment cycle follow disease progress . - Surgery . Surgery remove area cancer may consider point study ( include begin treatment ) , deem beneficial . Treatment study drug begin resume surgery . The length treatment depend response treatment surgery whether cancer remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) rare tumor optimally treat surgical resection . However , many patient present unresectable disease relapse common surgical resection create need effective systemic therapy . Several investigator report response variety chemotherapy agent , without clear improvement overall survival . A possible explanation disappointing result high level expression P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) see majority adrenocortical cancer . Pgp , membrane protein function drug efflux pump lower intracellular concentration various drug , implicate mechanism drug resistance . A prior National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) study ( refer MAVE ) try improve response rate use combined modality approach chemotherapy surgery . Prior vitro study show mitotane inhibit Pgp continuous exposure doxorubicin vincristine effective overcome Pgp-mediated resistance drug give intermittent schedule . The MAVE study use daily oral mitotane infusional doxorubicin , vincristine , etoposide prior tumor resection patient resectable potentially resectable tumor . The result show overall response rate 19 % ( include minor response ) , overall median survival 13.5 month . These result similar report previous regimen adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) . A possible explanation failure achieve high response rate may mitotane unable inhibit Pgp . Although serum level mitotane achieve patient show block Pgp vitro , inhibition Pgp patient accomplish , document validated surrogate assay use Pgp-expressing CD56+ cell Pgp substrate , rhodamine . Thus question whether Pgp inhibition would improve response rate remain unanswered . This trial attempt answer latter question use agent , tariquidar ( XR9576 ) , proven inhibit Pgp humans minimal toxicity alone combination chemotherapy . Tariquidar use regimen prior MAVE study effort improve response rate overall survival patient ACC whose option time limit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Pathologic confirmation adrenocortical cancer Laboratory Pathology , NCI Diagnosis recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma . Measurable disease presentation . A life expectancy least 3 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Age great equal 18 year . Last dose chemotherapy experimental therapy 4 week ( 6 week case nitrosourea ) prior enrollment date . Last radiotherapy treatment 4 week prior start treatment protocol must sit measurable disease receive radiation . Prior mitotane therapy allow . Patients need mitotane therapy prior start protocol . Organ marrow function define : Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time ULN ( upper limit normal ) , unless patient meet criteria Gilbert 's Syndrome , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 3 time ULN , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 3 time ULN Creatinine clearance great equal 40 ml/min ( measure time urine collection ) serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1000/mm^3 , Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 Ability understand sign inform consent document . Ability willingness follow guideline clinical protocol include visit National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , Bethesda , Maryland treatment follow visit . The effect chemotherapy develop human fetus potentially harmful therefore woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method ) study period 1 month last dose chemotherapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients adrenocortical tumor potentially curable surgical excision alone determine Principal Investigator discussion surgical consultant . Uncontrolled illness include , limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , seizure disorder , psychiatric illness may limit compliance study requirement . These illness may exacerbate chemotherapy . Untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) due poor prognosis patient difficulty ascertain cause neurologic toxicity . Pregnancy due possible adverse effect develop fetus . Lactating woman breastfeed due possibility transmit chemotherapy child . The presence second malignancy , squamous cell carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer complicate primary objective study . Cancer survivor free disease least two year enrol study . Currently receive treatment ( discontinue ) follow agent : diltiazem , nicardipine , phenothiazine , phenytoin , verapamil Pgp inhibitor interfere primary objective study .
