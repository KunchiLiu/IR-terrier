	<detailed_description>FMS predominantly affect woman characterize chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance , multiple tender point physical examination . The pathophysiological mechanism underlie FMS clearly understand , neuroendocrine factor seem major importance . Studies familial association suggest genetic factor play role FMS . This study establish pattern genetic linkage family FMS . Participating family member undergo brief physical exam ( include tender point exam ) , donate blood sample , complete detailed questionnaire include experience pain , fatigue , depression , bowel symptom , headache , anxiety , physical limitation . Measurements serum serotonin relate compound also obtain . To detect genetic factor , genome-wide linkage scan use 405 microsatellite marker perform .</detailed_description>
