A microarray tool analyze gene expression , consist small membrane glass slide contain sample many gene arrange regular pattern . The goal identify potential molecular signature . It hop discovery patient likely others develop brain metastasis , major negative effect quality life survival . Female patient 18 year age know evidence radiology breast tumor metastatic brain removal brain tumor diagnosis treatment may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure test : - Craniotomy , , surgical opening skull , removal brain tumor . - Blood specimen take central vein artery operation , throughout need , several day afterward , measure blood chemistry , blood count , forth . - Physical examination image central nervous system surgery . - Urine serum , , pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Patients also undergo blood test 3-month interval surgery 5 year . The purpose determine tumor cell blood , may explain reach brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : The molecular genetic event permit tumor metastasis well understood . The process whereby tumor cell escape primary , local tumor , spread distant sit body find create condition conducive growth disparate tissue remain area intense investigation . Metastasis epithelial tumor , breast cancer , brain common problem , significant consequence respect neurological dysfunction shorten survival . Objective : To study two subset patient breast cancer metastatic brain , identify gene protein facilitate metastasis , particularly woman over-express growth factor receptor HER2 , increase risk brain metastasis recently identify . Study Population : 78 patient breast cancer metastatic brain ( 39 woman whose tumor HER2- ( - ) 39 woman whose tumor HER2- ( + ) ) compare publish microarray study non-metastatic breast cancer patient tumor type well one another help explain differential trend toward metastasis patient treat Herceptin , new therapy direct HER-2 over-expressing tumor . Anticipated Risks Benefits : Less minimal risk patient sample tissue already remove brain part medically-necessary surgery sample blood . No direct benefit patient expect . Outcome Estimate Potential Meaning Field : That detail investigation gene protein express differentially non-metastatic metastatic breast cancer , well HER2- ( - ) HER2- ( + ) subtypes identify new previously-unsuspected target new therapy either prevent development brain metastasis treat brain metastasis effectively .</detailed_description>
