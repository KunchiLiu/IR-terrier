	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether AVONEX ( Interferon Beta-1a ) , compare placebo , reduces total dose IVIg administer Visit 5 Visit 9 ( Week 32 , End Study ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Avonex Subjects With Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) acquire peripheral neuropathy unknown origin . The etiology well understood presumed immunological . Evidence come observed similarity Guillain-Barre syndrome favorable response immunomodulatory treatment . CIDP peripheral nervous system demyelinate neuropathy sometimes corollary disorder central nervous system demyelination multiple sclerosis ( MS . The precise mechanism underlie pathogenesis uncertain , number mechanism support potential role immunomodulatory treatment interferon beta ( e.g. , Biogen Idec Inc. 's AVONEX ) . The rationale use AVONEX CIDP derive observation pathogenesis condition similarity MS , mechanism action AVONEX , clinical trial perform CIDP support role IFN-beta , unmet need currently exist availability safety issue exist therapy . This Phase 2b study dose-ranging study design provide scientific evidence regard safety efficacy AVONEX CIDP . In addition , study aim demonstrate responsiveness clinical relevance change MRC sum score ODSS CIDP patient .</detailed_description>
