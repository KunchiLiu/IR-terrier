	<brief_summary>This research do look safety value vaccine cancer find blood skin know Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) Sezary Syndrome . In laboratory , research find special white blood cell , call dendritic cell ( DCs ) , able stimulate immune system ( group cell protect body germ disease ) way help body fight cancer . Autologous ( body ) DCs prepare ( mixed together ) laboratory cancer cell ( Sezary cell ) allow DCs pick part Sezary cell make vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunization Against Tumor Cells Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although etiology CTCL completely understand , immunologic factor appear play important role . Dendritic Cell ( DC ) -tumor cell vaccine several feature suggest application immunotherapy human tumor . Importantly , DC-tumor cell immunization potential simultaneously stimulate CD4+ CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity multiple tumor antigen . The vaccine prepare subject 's blood , obtain leukapheresis . From leukapheresed blood , monocyte-derived DCs malignant lymphocytes isolate . The DCs load lymphocyte-derived tumor antigen . Formulations release criterion must meet vaccine administer . Completion date provide represent completion date grant per OOPD record</detailed_description>
