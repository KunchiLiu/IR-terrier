	<brief_summary>This study examine whether anti-fungal drug caspofungin prevent Candida infection adult patient intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . Caspofungin approve treat certain fungal infection , include fungal blood stream infection due Candida . Because ICU patient high risk Candida , would beneficial preventive drug , thereby reduce complication due infection . Patients 18 year age old pregnant may enrol study day 3 4 ICU admission expect stay least 2 additional day ICU . Participants randomly assign treatment either caspofungin placebo ( inactive substance ) . Before treatment , patient medical history physical examination . Blood urine test do routine test look fungal infection . Additional sample may collect test fungal infection include rectal swab stool sample ; wound culture patient wound , sputum culture patient tube throat help breathe produce sputum . Patients take caspofungin placebo day 28 day . In addition , undergo follow procedure : - Review treatment side effect medicine take , daily treatment , 1 week treatment , 2 week treatment - Physical examination week , last day treatment , 1 week treatment - Urine test week , last day treatment , 1 week treatment look possible fungal infection - Blood test twice week , last day treatment , 1 week treatment , 2 week treatment laboratory safety test look fungal infection - Collection additional sample ( rectal swab stool sample , wound culture , sputum sample ) week , last day treatment , 1 week treatment look possible fungal infection</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , multi-center randomize double-masked placebo-controlled trial caspofungin versus placebo prevention invasive candidiasis high-risk adult critical care set . The objective study evaluate efficacy caspofungin prophylaxis invasive candidiasis high-risk ICU subject compare risk invasive candidiasis subject receive caspofungin risk receive placebo . The secondary objective evaluate rate invasive candidiasis subject meet clinical prediction rule ; prospectively ass effect colonization risk factor development invasive candidiasis ; evaluate safety caspofungin prophylaxis invasive candidiasis summarize proportion subject discontinue study therapy drug-related adverse event proportion subject one drug-related adverse event ( ) ; evaluate all-cause mortality . The planned sample size 1200 subject , 1/3 control arm 2/3 active treatment arm base power least 0.8 need detect 50 % reduction incidence base rate 11 % 5.5 % . High-risk icu subject great equal 18 year age meeting eligibility criterion least 5 day anticipate ICU stay randomize receive either caspofungin 50 mg/day ( 70 mg/day subject rifampin ) placebo ( normal saline ) daily . Caspofungin placebo give intravenously single daily dose infuse approximately one hour . Subjects receive study drug placebo duration icu stay , maximum 28 day .</detailed_description>
