	<brief_summary>HIV infect pregnant woman may take single-dose nevirapine ( SD NVP ) prior give birth prevent mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV . However , SD NVP may cause NVP resistance mother , potentially rule treatment option future . The purpose study determine three anti-HIV drug regimen effectively reduce development maternal NVP resistance HIV infect pregnant woman . The effectiveness short-term ( 7 day therapy ) versus long-term ( 21-day therapy ) regimens also compare . The study hypotheses : 1 ) intrapartum SD NVP 21-day course antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) result less frequent selection NVP-resistant HIV-1 variant intrapartum SD NVP 7-day course ART , 2 ) 7- 21-day course lamivudine/zidovudine ( 3TC/ZDV ) , emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) , lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) follow SD NVP select nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) - protease inhibitor ( PI ) - resistant HIV-1 variant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A major disadvantage give SD NVP potential maternal development NVP resistance additional resistance nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) mother ; result , future treatment option may limit HIV infected woman . The purpose study determine three ART regimens effectively deters development maternal NVP resistance HIV infect pregnant woman postpartum . This study also compare effectiveness short-term versus long-term ART discouraging development maternal NVP resistance . Some mother study receive ZDV monotherapy prior SD NVP administration ; initiation ZDV monotherapy discretion site investigator provide study . Randomization stratify receipt ZDV monotherapy pregnancy . Prior labor , mother randomly assign receive SD NVP onset labor one three postpartum ART regimens : 3TC/ZDV , FTC/TDF , LPV/r . In addition , participant randomly assign receive 7 21 day assign postpartum treatment . Mothers follow 96 week follow delivery ; 11 study visit mother study . At onset labor , medical medication history , target physical exam , obstetrical exam occur . Additional physical exam occur Day 1 Weeks 1 3 . Blood collection occur 8 study visit Weeks 3 96 . Infants follow 96 week birth ; 8 study visit infant study . Infants ever breastfed study visit Weeks 16 , 24 , 48 , 96 , 1 2 year age . A physical exam , medication history , blood collection occur infant visit . Mothers infant could prescribe continue ART , ART provide study .</detailed_description>
