	<brief_summary>Women pregnant twin triplet high risk preterm birth , yet intervention approach serve reduce risk . A recently complete trial NICHD sponsor Maternal Fetal Medicine Units ( MFMU ) Network , first time , demonstrate treatment substantially reduce rate preterm birth woman high risk preterm delivery ( i.e . progesterone therapy ) . Preterm birth reduce 35 % among progesterone-treated woman singleton pregnancy compare woman receive placebo . The current trial compare weekly treatment injection progesterone placebo woman pregnant twin triplet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women multifetal gestation face numerous risk excess face woman singleton gestation . Preterm birth far common significant problem , yet intervention approach serve reduce risk . The prevalence preterm birth rise dramatically recent year , large part due Assisted Reproductive Technologies . Consequently , problem preterm birth assume even great role contribute perinatal morbidity mortality . The recently complete trial NICHD sponsor Maternal Fetal Medicine Units ( MFMU ) Network , first time , demonstrate treatment ( i.e . progesterone therapy ) substantially reduce rate preterm birth woman high risk preterm delivery prior spontaneous preterm birth . Preterm birth reduce 35 % among progesterone-treated woman compare woman receive placebo . Given dramatic benefit extremely high risk preterm birth woman multifetal gestation , trial evaluate benefit progesterone woman multifetal pregnancy appropriate timely . This protocol outline randomize , double-masked clinical trial compare weekly treatment injection 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17P ) placebo woman twin triplet gestation . In ancillary study , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics 17P multifetal gestation study . This trial aim enroll six hundred woman twin gestation one hundred twenty woman triplet gestation 16 week 0 day 20 week 6 day . At initial screen evaluation , sign informed consent form , patient receive injection placebo ( 1 ml inert castor oil ) . She ask return three day randomization . During compliance test period , ultrasound exam schedule , previously do . When patient return still meet inclusion criterion , randomize one two treatment : - 17 a-hydroxyprogesterone caproate : weekly 1 ml injection contain 250 mg 17P - Placebo : weekly injection 1 ml placebo inert castor oil Treatment give 34 week 6 day gestation delivery . At time consent main study , patient also ask participate ancillary study . If agrees , 30 cc blood draw 24-28 week 32-35 week gestation . A pelvic exam do two time collect vaginal specimen determine Bishop score .</detailed_description>
