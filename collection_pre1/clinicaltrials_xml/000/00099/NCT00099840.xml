	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Guided Antibiotic Use Acute Respiratory Tract Infections ( PARTI ) -Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute respiratory tract infection ( ARTI ) ( i.e . common cold , pharyngitis , tonsillitis , rhinosinusitis , tracheo-bronchitis , otitis medium , acute exacerbation asthma ( AEA ) chronic pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) , community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) ) , among frequent reason seek medical attention primary care . Although predominantly viral origin , ARTIs important condition prescription antibiotic ( AB ) , mainly due difficulty primary care differentiate viral bacterial etiology . Unnecessary AB use increase drug expenditure , side effect AB resistance . A novel approach guide AB use procalcitonin ( ProCT ) , since serum level elevate bacterial infection remain low viral infection inflammatory disease . Aim : To compare strategy base evidence-based guideline ProCT guide AB therapy ARTIs respect outcome ( day restriction ) AB use . Design : Randomized , control trial open intervention . Patients present ARTIs primary care physician intend treat AB base guideline include randomized 1:1 either standard management ProCT guide prescription AB . Setting : Primary care provider Northwest Switzerland canton without drug self dispensation ( Basel-Stadt Baselland ) . Patients : 18 year old , ARTI &gt; 1 &lt; 28 day duration need ABs base clinical judgment primary care physician . Excluded patient without informed consent , fluent German , AB pretreatment previous 28 day severe immune-suppression . Endpoints : Primary : Days restriction ARTI . Secondary : Rate AB prescription , day AB use , symptom ARTI , relapse rate ARTI within 28 day , day side effect ABs work . Endpoints assess baseline , day 1 3 physician . Structured phone interview day 14 28 do patient group . Intervention : All participate physician receive evidence-based guideline management patient ARTIs . Patients ARTI need ABs physician ’ clinical judgment inform consent randomize ProCT plus guideline ( `` ProCT group '' ) versus guideline guide AB treatment ( `` control group '' ) . In patient randomized ProCT group use antibiotic less discourage ( &lt; 0.1 &lt; 0.25 ug/L ) encourage ( &gt; 0.5 &gt; 0.25 ug/L ) , respectively . A re-evaluation patient ProCT ( &lt; 0.1 &lt; 0.25 ug/L ) 6 24 hour mandatory . All patient reassess day 3 recommend stop AB ProCT group describe . Blood specimens ProCT , take patient , ship courier central lab result report within 2 hour . Variables measurement : Physicians consecutively enroll patient ARTI consider AB treatment . Baseline data medical history clinical item , additional diagnostic test , co-morbidity final prescribed treatment collect . The study conduct 12 month period 2005 . Expected result : We assume noninferiority bad new procedure lead increase average one day restriction compare standard procedure reduce total AB use . Our null hypothesis : ProCT guide antibiotic management give average extra day restriction standard procedure . Alternative hypothesis : ProCT guide antibiotic management give average one day restriction standard procedure Analyses : Analysis do base intention-to-treat principle . Sample size type I error rate 5 % type II error rate 10 % ( i.e . 90 % power ) = 171 . With allowance loss followup 10 % required sample size 190 per treatment group . We intend gain 24 primary care physician recruit total 380 patient . Significance : Because high prevalence ARTIs , study offer potential improving management ARTIs primary care avoid unnecessary ABs patient ARTIs , along prevention AB resistance . For reason , high relevance Swiss health care system public health Switzerland .</detailed_description>
