	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV drug , especially protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , link lipid metabolism problem , include elevation low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c ) , triglyceride , total cholesterol . Ezetimibe lipid-controlling drug ; statins part another class lipid-lowering drug popularly prescribe people high cholesterol . The purpose study determine safety , effectiveness , tolerability ezetimibe combination statin therapy adult take anti-HIV drug high cholesterol . Study hypothesis : In HIV infect adult , ezetimibe combination statin therapy result significantly low LDL-c compare statin therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Effectiveness , Tolerability Ezetimibe Combined With Statins Treatment High Cholesterol HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipid metabolism abnormality common complication HIV therapy , particularly PIs . Statins lipid-lowering agent often prescribe control elevate cholesterol level HIV infect uninfected people . However , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) lipid-lowering drug may associate cardiovascular disease , clear need find lipid-lowering drug low toxicity . This study evaluate safety , efficacy , tolerability ezetimibe , lipid-controlling agent , combination ongoing statin therapy HIV infected people currently ART . This study last 28 week . All participant require continue current stable statin therapy ART duration study . Participants randomly assign one two arm . Arm 1 participant receive ezetimibe daily 12 week , treatment 4 week , placebo daily 12 week . Arm 2 participant receive placebo daily 12 week , treatment 4 week , ezetimibe daily 12 week . There 9 study visit ; occur study screen , study entry , every 4 week thereafter . Clinical assessment blood collection occur visit . Participants ask complete adherence questionnaire Weeks 4 , 12 , 20 , 28 , also encourage coenroll ACTG A5128 ( Consent Use Stored Patient Specimens Future Testing ) .</detailed_description>
