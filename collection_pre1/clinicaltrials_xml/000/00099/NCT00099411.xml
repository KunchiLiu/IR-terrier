	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease major health problem United States . It estimate 2003 , 600,000 Americans new heart attack , 400,000 experience recurrent heart attack . Up 40 % individual new recurrent heart attack show complete occlusion , block , IRA follow-up angiography . Many people occlude IRA post-heart attack risk progressive LV remodel heart , lead congestive heart failure . The NHLBI-funded OAT study test hypothesis opening occlude IRA 3 28 day follow heart attack reduce composite endpoint mortality , recurrent heart attack , New York Heart Association class IV heart failure three-year follow-up period . OAT enrol approximately 1,100 participant 240 center 24 country . Among mechanism propose explain benefit late revascularization , recovery LV function attenuation LV remodel due restoration blood flow viable myocardium , heart muscle , plausible . DESIGN NARRATIVE : An estimated 200 individual heart attack enrol study . The primary aim study follow : 1 ) test hypothesis participant demonstrate preservation viability within infarct zone less progressive remodeling compare participant exhibit predominant infarct , 2 ) test hypothesis preservation viability modify treatment effect randomization late revascularization participant occlude IRA 3 28 day heart attack . All participant rest gate Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT image baseline , 1 year later . Parameters baseline viability within infarct zone , serial measure LV volume change function centrally assess Cardiac Imaging Core Laboratory Tufts Medical Center . The major study endpoint address hypotheses serial change LV end-diastolic volume , base degree preservation viability within define infarct zone . Sample size calculation base data evaluate group similar number participant study similar number clinical site .</detailed_description>
