	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Phase I - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose lapatinib patient recurrent malignant glioblastoma multiforme take CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . Phase II - Determine efficacy drug , term objective tumor response rate , patient take EIAEDs take EIAEDs . - Correlate immunohistochemical measure cellular protein receptor tumor sample anti-tumor activity drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral lapatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos lapatinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive lapatinib phase I MTD . Patients follow 1 month periodically survival . Patients stable respond disease go therapy follow every 3 month one year periodically thereafter survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-24 patient accrued phase I portion study within 18 month . A total 15-30 patient accrue phase II portion study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
