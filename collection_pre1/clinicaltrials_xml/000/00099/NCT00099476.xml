	<brief_summary>This study examine whether dark chocolate affect way patient hypertension ( high blood pressure ) respond insulin , hormone secrete pancreas regulates blood glucose ( sugar ) level . In many people hypertension , insulin effective help body use glucose . This call insulin resistance . Insulin also increase blood flow muscle open inactive blood vessel . Laboratory study suggest eat dark chocolate may improve blood pressure . This study determine whether dark chocolate improve insulin resistance change blood vessel react insulin hypertensive people . People 21 65 year age high blood pressure pregnant may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants refrain eat food contain chocolate cocoa 1 week come clinic three separate occasion 3 week apart glucose clamp test contrast ultrasound , describe . At first glucose clamp test , subject randomly assign drink either cocoa drink high anti-oxidant content one low content anti-oxidant . Each drink take twice day 2 week . At end 2 week , return second glucose clamp test . At second test , stop take cocoa drink 1 week start another 2 week . For 2-week period , give high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink first 2 week take placebo , low anti-oxidant drink time , take placebo high anti-oxidant cocoa drink . After 2 week take cocoa drink placebo , take third last glucose clamp test . Glucose clamp test : This test measure body respond insulin . Subjects fast night test eat test , usually early afternoon . For test , subject lie bed reclines chair . A needle place vein arm - one collect blood sample infuse glucose , insulin , potassium solution . Blood glucose insulin level measure frequently test rate glucose infusion adjust keep blood glucose baseline ( fast ) level . Blood sample test blood count , electrolytes , liver function ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Dark Chocolate Insulin Sensitivity People With High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dark chocolate cocoa product contain antioxidant include polyphenol epicatechin beneficial effect vascular function . Oral consumption dark chocolate lower blood pressure elderly subject isolate systolic hypertension drink cocoa acutely improve flow-mediated vasodilation subject cardiovascular risk factor . Work lab elsewhere show regulation hemodynamic metabolic homeostasis couple subject essential hypertension also insulin resistant . Therefore , hypothesize cocoa consumption improve blood pressure insulin sensitivity subject essential hypertension . To test hypothesis , conduct randomize double-blind , crossover study subject essential hypertension evaluate effect cocoa versus placebo blood pressure , insulin sensitivity , insulin-mediated capillary recruitment skeletal muscle . After 7 day cocoa-free run-in period , subject randomize receive 15 consecutive daily dos either cocoa drink ( 150 ml twice day total 900 mg polyphenols 237 kcal ) polyphenol poor placebo drink ( 150 ml twice day total 36 mg polyphenols 234 kcal ) . After 15 day treatment period , subject enter 1 week cocoa-free washout period follow cross-over treatment . Subjects counsel maintain isocaloric diet study . Blood pressure , insulin sensitivity , insulin-mediated capillary recruitment assess subject run-in period , 15 day treatment , completion cross-over . Blood pressure also measure every Monday , Wednesday , Friday duration study . Insulin sensitivity measure use hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique . Insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment forearm skeletal muscle measure ultrasound `` microbubble '' contrast glucose clamp study . Peak trough plasma epicatechin level measure prior glucose clamp study use HPLC assay . This study determine short-term oral administration cocoa effective lower blood pressure , improve insulin sensitivity , restore vascular function subject essential hypertension . This highly relevant major public health problem diabetes , obesity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease insulin resistance vascular dysfunction important pathophysiological component .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Hypertensive subject age 21 65 year good general health except mild moderate hypertension ( blood pressure 140/95 170/110 medication ) , medication nutritional supplement except antihypertensive agent , anticholesterol drug birth control agent . Subjects take antihypertensive OTC supplement anticholesterol drug one week prior study duration study . Women birth control remain regime . During time subject receive antihypertensive therapy , blood pressure monitor least daily ( either home , clinic , another convenient facility ) . If subject 's blood pressure exceed 170/110 three determination period least 15 minute , subject withdrawn study appropriate antihypertensive therapy resume . In addition , subject 's blood pressure exceed 160/100 measurement three consecutive day , subject withdrawn study appropriate antihypertensive therapy resume . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects exclude diabetes , pregnancy , liver disease , pulmonary disease , renal insufficiency , coronary heart disease , heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathy , actively smoke tobacco within last two year , treatment form cancer , positive test HIV , hepatitis B C , take systemic corticosteroid . These condition know adversely influence insulin sensitivity . Subjects exclude history malignant hypertension , aortic aneurysm stroke . Subjects know hypersensitivity octafluoropropane know cardiac shunt also exclude participate potential adverse effect microbubble contrast agent . Subjects exclude unable give inform consent procedure . Children exclude study child typically hypertensive .</criteria>
