	<brief_summary>This study test whether experimental vaccine protect severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) safe , cause side effect , cause immune response . SARS affect respiratory system , usually start fever muscle ache . Patients may get dry cough difficulty breathe . Infection may mild , lead death . Vaccines contain substance infectious agent , virus , , inject person 's body , stimulate production antibody create resistance , immunity , agent . The vaccine study contain genetic material ( DNA ) cod protein find virus cause SARS . Injected muscle , instruct body make small amount SARS protein . The vaccine make one small part code one SARS protein ; person get SARS vaccine . Normal volunteer 18 50 year age general good health may eligible 32-week study . Candidates screen physical examination blood urine test . Participants nine clinic visit study . They receive three vaccine injection , give system call Bioinjector 2000Â® ( Registered Trademark ) , delivers vaccine skin without use needle . Following injection , participant take home diary card , record temperature vaccine side effect daily 5 day . Participants must immediately report symptom study physician , , necessary , go clinic examination . Participants follow test procedure : - Vaccine injection ( study day 0 , around week 4 , around week 8 , least 21 day injection ) - Medical history , need , physical examination ( study day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 32 ) - Check vital sign weight ( study day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 ) - Lymph node examination ( day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 ) - Blood draw ( study day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 ) - Pregnancy test woman ( day 0 week 4 , 8 32 ) - Urine sample ( day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Vaccine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response recombinant DNA vaccine , VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP . The hypothesis regimen safe human administration elicit immune response SARS coronavirus ( CoV ) spike ( S ) protein . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability humans investigational vaccine . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine . Product Description : VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP compose single close , circular DNA plasmid base S protein SARS-CoV . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( deltoid muscle ) use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer ( 18 50 year old ) enrol . Study Plan : Ten volunteer enrol receive 3 injection schedule show schema . The protocol require nine clinic visit three telephone follow-up contact . Study Duration : 32 week clinical follow-up participant . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety regimen ; secondary immunogenicity endpoint intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) assay SARS specific T cell response assay antibody-dependent enhancement virus uptake . The principal timepoints ICS Week 0 ( baseline ) Weeks 6 , 8 , 10 12 . ICS study timepoints , well immunogenicity assay Week 32 , complete exploratory evaluation .</detailed_description>
