	<brief_summary>This study use procedure call selective venous catheterization patient tumor-induced osteomalacia ( TIO ) oncogenic osteomalacia ( OOM ) try locate small tumor produce protein call phosphatonins . Too much phosphatonin blood cause kidney allow large amount phosphorus excrete urine , lead low blood level phosphorus , turn , osteomalacia ( condition soft bone ) . Osteomalacia cause bone fracture require many surgical procedure leave patient pain . Patients may also feel weak lose height massive bone loss . Selective venous catheterization way measure amount phosphatonin blood may use way locate phosphatonin-producing tumor find use standard image technique . Patients TIO OOM screen NIDR Protocol 01-D-0184 medical history , review medical record routine physical examination . Other procedure may include blood test , urine test , image test , x-ray , bone densitometry , bone scan , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This study include mostly patient whose tumor able locate imaging procedure , also patient whose tumor locate . All participant , regardless whether tumor locate , undergo selective venous catheterization . For procedure , radiologist insert catheter ( thin flexible tube ) body use fluoroscopy ( type x-ray ) guide tip catheter different place body collect small amount blood different area . After procedure , patient lie flat 2 hour avoids move leg side catheter place . The blood analyzed measure amount phosphatonin sample , amount compare average amount phosphatonin general blood circulation . If high level phosphatonin find one area location tumor unknown , patient undergoes image area . If tumor find area remove surgically , patient give option surgery . If tumor find image do first catheterization procedure , patient option second catheterization , take sample blood area phosphatonin find high sampling procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor elaborate phosphate lowering factor ( phosphatonins ) lead tumor induce osteomalacia/osteogenic osteomalacia ( TIO/OOM ) . Patients TIO/OOM suffer year significant morbidity debilitation unless tumor , notoriously difficult locate , remove . Selective venous catheterization use localize hormonally active neoplasm demonstrate gradient concentration hormone interest vessel immediately drain tumor site peripheral circulation . The primary objective protocol evaluate utility combine selective venous catheterization biochemical assay identify phosphatonins serum way identify phosphatonin gradient thereby localize phosphaturic tumor . Our study population consist TIO/OOM patient non-localized phosphaturic tumor well five patient whose lesion identify certainty conventional imaging technique . These individual undergo selective venous catheterization blood sample obtain process presence phosphatonins . The primary endpoint meet gradient indicate possible tumor find , focus clinical image appropriate anatomical sub-region identifies lesion , lesion confirm phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor upon surgical removal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must clinical diagnosis TIO/OOM consider enrollment study . The diagnosis base upon clinical history include : rickets ( child ) , pathological fracture , bone pain , muscle weakness , low serum phosphorus concomitant inappropriately high urine phosphorus , low inappropriately lownormal serum vitamin 1,25 ( OH ) ( 2 ) vitamin D3 , elevate FGF23 level absence family history phosphate waste syndrome . Along clinical symptom list , patient must undergo routine clinical imaging . Inclusion limit patient likely lesion localize imaging , plus five patient likely lesion identify image . Patients likely lesion identify serve positive control . Patients must able give informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients comorbidities would increase risk selective venous catheterization exclude study . This include limited medical condition : poorly control diabetes , renal insufficiency , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , anemia , hypertension , clot disorder , etc . Pregnancy contraindication venous catheterization procedure . A serum BetaHcg require eligible woman childbearing age unless documentation hysterectomy condition make pregnancy impossible provide . Inability unwillingness give inform consent exclude patient study . Female patient allow pregnancy test provide documentation indicate medical condition make pregnancy impossible eligible study .</criteria>
