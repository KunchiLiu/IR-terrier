	<brief_summary>Orthodontic treatment require application force system individual teeth group teeth , result cellular response periodontal ligament ( PDL ) alveolar bone remodeling . The force apply must sufficient magnitude duration exceed normal physiologic threshold associate daily oral function . Excessive force level result area tissue necrosis delay tooth movement increase risk root resorption . Although orthodontic tooth movement achieve large segment population , optimum force level define . The optimum force tooth movement depend individual root geometry well biologic characteristic surround tissue include bone density , periodontal thickness , fluid dynamic . Because experimental clinical technique generally limit know complex force system , biomechanical modeling become necessity . Such model must validate well-controlled clinical study evaluate orthodontic tooth movement extend distance . The ultimate goal would development computer simulation model predict tooth movement clinical setting . The primary objective study test control clinical data biomechanical model tooth support tissue distal movement human maxillary canine tooth ( know root geometry ) response various 3D force system produce different level stress support tissue . Secondary objective include evaluation rate bodily tooth canine movement two know compressive stress level ( 13 22 kPa ) , evaluation three different reference system measure rate tooth movement , evaluation implant place roof mouth ( palatal implant ) orthodontic anchorage adolescent patient . The rate translation ( bodily ) tooth movement maxillary canine tooth significantly great 22kPa compare 13kPa compressive stress apply periodontal ligament , difference predict appropriate mathematical/numerical model tooth support tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient draw recruited Graduate Orthodontic Graduate Program . Clinical academic staff examine approximately 500 patient seek orthodontic care . Patients categorized malocclusion type place patient pool case select treatment base program teach research need . Each year approximately 50 % patient seek care ultimately accept . Treatment provide fee approximately 60 % charge private practice . Patients meet selection criterion study randomly select University Alberta Graduate Orthodontic Graduate Clinic patient pool . Upper 1st premolar teeth extract full fix orthodontic appliance ( Ormco Orthos prescription ) place . After initial alignment leveling phase complete retraction phase begin . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent avoid ; extra strength Tylenol prescribe necessary momentary pain discomfort . Maximum posterior anchorage attain palatal implant ( Straumann ) accord protocol describe Papadakis . The implant also use three-dimensional movement reference point . Other reference system use include palatal ruggae occlusal templates . The cuspid retraction force delivery mechanisms consist customize activated stainless steel T-loops design generate require force bracket . Approximate compressive stress ( base approximate root surface area ) 13 kPa 22 kPa apply distal aspect cuspid . The design split-mouth study level stress apply patient . The side high low stress level apply randomize . This design allow inter intra-patient comparison since patient see stress level . After initial activation subject see day 1 , 3 , 17 thereafter 4-week interval space cuspid second bicuspid completely close . In initial activation session follow-up session , maxillary impression appliance adjustment apply desire force make . At clinical visit impression make activate T-loop teeth . The geometry T-loop measure impression allow apply force calculate use numerical method develop Raboud . The impression teeth use construct occlusal templates require measure tooth movement . Tooth mobility change orthodontic tooth movement monitor mean Periotest measure device . CT volumetric scan NewTom machine make placement implant ensure adequate palatal bone volume . Extra CT volumetric scan repeat middle retraction period ( base space close ) end space closure . The CT volumetric scan image also use determine alveolar bone density , change root geometry calculation root surface area center resistance . The CT volumetric scan also use determine alveolar bone density , change root geometry ( root resorption ) ass movement cuspid relation maxillary structure . The series model subject 3-axis measuring system ( MicroVal ) use measure tooth position change relative 3 reference system . At completion cuspid retraction , balance require orthodontic treatment continue . The palatal implant retrieve orthodontic retention deliver . Data gather patient study utilized validate biomechanical model . Biomechanical Modeling : There two separate biomechanical tooth model develop . The first parametric three dimensional model tooth support tissue allow variable biological property tooth , PDL alveolar bone . This model allow inputs patient specific force system apply individual biological parameter . The three dimensional force system apply tooth calculate use numerical method describe Raboud measure geometry T-loop . The Finite Element Model ( FEM ) tooth support tissue apply force system allow improve description stress field tissue , particular PDL . This improved stress field compare result bodily tooth movement . In order compare result biomechanical model clinical study important posterior segment move . The palatal implant ensure absolute anchorage require . As previously mention , accuracy FEM model dependant upon input parameter . Consequently , two dimensional dynamic model tooth response mechanical impact . This model instrument Periotest® design measure impact response . Since tooth response govern characteristic periodontal ligament , analysis raw signal obtain Periotest® allow mechanical property PDL evaluate retraction . Statistical Analysis : The final mean rate tooth movement two force level compare Independent Samples T Test . To evaluate significant change tooth movement distinctive time interval , repeat measure ANOVA use . If underlying assumption method satisfy , non-parametric alternative consider ( U Mann-Whitney Test ) .</detailed_description>
