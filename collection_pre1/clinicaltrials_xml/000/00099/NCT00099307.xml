	<brief_summary>This study determine whether magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detect damage certain part brain analyze thickness brain 's out surface patient multiple sclerosis . MRI diagnostic test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . It sometimes permit diagnosis even symptom develop . MS disease white matter , fatty cover around nerve brain spinal cord . The nerve call gray matter . Damage white matter impairs nerve function , lead variety symptom , weakness , vision problem , difficulty walking , paralysis , others . MRI detect change white matter , change may also appear gray matter may difficult find . This study use new MRI technique try identify gray matter damage patient MS . Healthy volunteer people MS clinically isolate syndrome ( early stage MS patient one problem MS cause ) 18 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history neurological examination , blood urine test . Within one month screen evaluation , participant undergo MRI scan standard 1.5 Tesla machine confirm health status . ( The power MRI scanner measure Tesla ; high Tesla , good visualization . ) For procedure , subject lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder magnetic field ) , wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . During procedure , contrast agent call Gadolinium inject blood stream brighten image . The test last 2 hour , time subject must lie still minute time . Within month first MRI , participant repeat test second time . The procedure identical first scan , except 3.0 Tesla machine use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Detection cortical lesion patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) challenge . Their identification might provide insight explain level disability patient MS. Primary aim present study identify cortical lesion patient MS use MRI . As secondary aim , correlation cortical lesion presence clinical disability score ( i.e . Expanded Disability Status Score EDSS scale ) analyze . Tertiary aim provide relationship presence cortical lesion reduction cortical thickness extent remote white matter disease pathology . Additionally , role white matter lesion cause remote pathology study . To good characterize damage , patient previous stroke , present single lesion pyramidal tract enrol diffusion-derived index white matter remote tract compute . STUDY POPULATION : Fifty patient definite MS single attack MRI suggestive MS ( i.e. , clinically isolated syndrome ) accord McDonald criterion , 55 healthy volunteer enrol . Fifteen patient previous ischemic stroke 15 age- gender-matched healthy volunteer also enrol . DESIGN : After clinical evaluation MRI 1.5 Tesla , individual image 3.0 Tesla scan . Clinical MRI within 15 minute contrast injection obtain patient 1.5 3 Tesla scan . In addition , 3 spoil gradient-echo sequence , diffusion tensor image double inversion recovery sequence acquire 3 Tesla MRI . Some healthy volunteer ( 15 ) patient ( 15 ) require imaged twice 3T magnet optimize sequence study . Additionally , 20 patient cortical lesion identify use above-mentioned technique 20 healthy volunteer undergo brain perfusion MRIs . This may represent third 3T MRI former instance . OUTCOME MEASURES : In MS patient , number cortical lesion compute . The EDSS score serve investigate relationship cortical lesion clinical disability . Effect cortical white matter lesion cause remote degeneration study use diffusion tensor magnetization transfer image patient stroke MS .</detailed_description>
