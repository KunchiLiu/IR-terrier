	<brief_title>Dose-Finding Study REN-1654 Patients With Post-Herpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-finding study . After screen baseline clinical assessment , subject randomly assign receive 30 100 mg REN-1654 mouth ( p.o . ) , match placebo , daily 3 week . After 3 week treatment , clinical assessment repeat . Subjects complete 3 week placebo-controlled segment may enter 3-week active-treatment extension segment , subject REN-1654 30 mg group remain dose , subject give placebo previous segment receive REN-1654 100 mg daily , subject receive REN 1654 100 mg first 3 week study segment discontinue dose . Double-blind condition maintain placebo-controlled active treatment period ( primary efficacy endpoint ) continue dose 3-week second active treatment period . The clinical assessment repeat end 6 week , subject discontinue treatment return 2 week later final clinical assessment .</detailed_description>
