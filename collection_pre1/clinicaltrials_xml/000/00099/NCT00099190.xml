	<brief_title>ARQ 501 Combination With Docetaxel Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARQ 501 demonstrate activity vitro wide range solid tumor include lung , colorectal , breast , prostate , pancreatic , ovarian , myeloma . To date , histological cancer type study appear inherently resistant treatment ARQ 501 . In animal xenograft model human tumor , ARQ 501 monotherapy effective treating ovarian , colon , prostate , breast cancer . When used combination taxane therapy , ARQ 501 demonstrate efficacy treat variety human cancer , include ovarian , breast , colon . This study design explore whether addition ARQ 501 every three week schedule docetaxel safe tolerable regimen . The study design collect safety pharmacokinetic data combination regimen measure antitumor activity observe patient .</detailed_description>
