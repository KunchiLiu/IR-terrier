	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer lead cause cancer death United States . Mortality remain high colorectal cancer detect regional distant spread , preclude curative surgical resection . With mind , screen strategy recommend asymptomatic individual hope reduce mortality colon cancer detect remove premalignant adenomatous polyp early malignant lesion . Screening asymptomatic individual age 50 sigmoidoscopy fecal occult blood test advocate American Cancer Society . However , current screen identify 50 % patient adenomatous polyp . More sensitive test polyp detection , like colonoscopy , costly , require extensive resource unlikely use screen large population . Ideal screen would identify patient high risk cancer target sensitive screening test population . The identification low cost , easily collectible risk factor use target patient sensitive screen test primary purpose study .

	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up Study Designed Evaluate Relative Risk Two Colonoscopy Schedules Patients With Small Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Risk factor determine large ( &gt; 1 cm ) adenoma , precursor lesion colorectal cancer . Secondary Hypothesis : Determine long-term rate development recurrence polyp ; determine sensitivity/specificity current colon cancer screen strategy ; determine relationship dietary factor biomarkers cell proliferation ; determine efficacy safety long-term ( 5 year ) repeat colonoscopy patient small polyp . Intervention : Phase I : All patient undergo full colonoscopy . Phase II : Randomization repeat colonoscopy 2-3 year 5 year baseline , , repeat colonoscopy 5 year . Phase III : Ten-year follow-up Phase I patient medical outcome . Repeat colonoscopy 10 year polyp-free patient ( Phase I ) age 50-64 . Primary Outcomes : Presence risk factor adenomatous polyp include prevalence , descriptive characteristic , long-term occurrence/recurrence rate . Study Abstract : Phase I cross-sectional study design identify risk factor large ( &gt; 1 cm ) adenomatous polyp . Approximately 3200 asymptomatic subject ( age 50-75 ) complete risk factor assessment , medical dietary history , undergone complete colonoscopy examination . This identify comparison purpose polyp-free control group first large prospective study include group . Data colonoscopy characterize prevalence , size distribution adenomatous polyp . This permit assessment sensitivity sigmoidoscopy population . In addition , tissue normal rectal mucosa analyze evidence cell proliferation activity . The primary focus Phase I risk factor analysis . A multivariate analysis perform determine relationship historical environmental factor well cell proliferation activity presence adenomatous polyp . A cohort consist subgroup polyp patient ( large small ) match polyp-free control track longitudinally determine polyp occurrence/recurrence rate . Phase II study long-term follow-up study design evaluate relative risk two repeat colonoscopy schedule patient small polyp identify Phase I study . Recruitment complete 615 patient eligible ( target 808 ) assign random either repeat colonoscopy 2-3 year 5 year , repeat colonoscopy 5 year . This phase also provide preliminary longitudinal risk factor information relate occurrence/recurrence polyp . Phase III 5-year extension follow-up period . All Phase I patient reconsented provide medical outcome data period 10 year baseline exam . Phase I patient polyp-free , age 50-64 offered repeat colonoscopy 10 year evaluate long-term risk . Results ( Phase I ) : 3121 patient complete colonoscopy reveal high rate neoplasia : 37.5 % one neoplastic lesion ; 10.5 % advanced neoplasia include 30 case invasive cancer ( 1 % ) . There 3.7 % patient lesion rectum sigmoid colon advance neoplasia elsewhere colon : 32 % patient advanced neoplasia would detect exam rectum sigmoid colon ( distal ) ; 62 % patient proximal advanced neoplasia would detect exam rectum sigmoid colon . There serious complication ( 0.3 % ) . The one-time fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) evaluate diagnostic test advance neoplasia . A positive FOBT indicate increase likelihood ( 3-4x ) advance neoplasia . However , one-time FOBT fail detect 75 % patient advanced neoplasia . The primary analysis risk factor ( Phase I ) find positive association ( advanced neoplasia ) history first degree relative colorectal cancer ( OR , 1.66 ; 95 % CI , 1.16-2.35 ) , current smoking ( OR , 1.85 ; 95 % CI , 1.33-2.58 ) , current moderate heavy alcohol use ( OR , 1.02 , 95 % CI , 1.01-1.03 ) . Inverse association find cereal fiber intake ( OR , 0.95 , 95 % CI , 0.91-0.99 ) , vitamin D intake ( OR , 0.94 , 95 % CI , 0.90-0.99 ) , use NSAIDs ( OR , 0.66 , 95 % CI , 0.48-0.91 ) . Results appear JAMA ( 2003 ; 290:2959-2967 ) . Phase III complete patient complete schedule follow-up . A major manuscript sensitivity/specificity digital rectal exam appear Annals Internal Medicine January , 2005 . The Phase II result manuscript appear Gastroenterology October 2007 .</detailed_description>
