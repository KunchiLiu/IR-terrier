	<detailed_description>Intervention : All patient undergo CT scan PET imaging . Primary Hypothesis : FDG-PET accurate exist anatomic modality ( chest x-ray CT scan ) distinguish benign malignant solitary pulmonary nodule ( SPN ) ? This expedite removal potentially surgically curable malignant lesion minimize number benign mass surgically incurable lung neoplasm unnecessary thoracotomy do . Secondary Hypothesis : What impact result FDG-PET diagnosis make treatment render refer physician ? What intra- inter-reader reliability FDG-PET ? What effect FDG-PET cost early management SPNs FDG-PET include management paradigm substitute CT ? Primary Outcomes : Benign malignant solitary pulmonary nodule , treatment . Study Abstract : All patient new , untreated solitary pulmonary nodule ( SPN ) 7 mm 3 cm diameter identify chest x-ray , approached participate study . Patients undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) computerize tomography ( CT ) . The PET CT scan interpret independently . The Primary Care Physician provide result baseline chest x-ray CT scan , ask management treatment decision . Then result PET provide Primary Care Physician ask management treatment decision base finding ( chest x-ray , CT , PET ) . Site reader perform overview CT PET interpretation provide diagnosis SPN . There Independent Research Readers Panel perform overview CT PET interpretation provide diagnosis SPN . These reading determine inter-reader reliability , Independent Research Readers Panel use primary diagnostic measure sensitivity specificity analysis . The CT PET diagnosis compare 'gold standard ' ( tissue diagnosis , either fine needle biopsy surgical pathology , two year follow-up change SPN chest x-ray ) construct Receiver Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) curve . There two substudies - one investigate economic analysis one investigating accuracy coincidence PET scanning .</detailed_description>
