	<brief_summary>This study determine whether glucosamine , chondroitin sulfate and/or combination glucosamine chondroitin sulfate effective placebo whether combination effective glucosamine chondroitin sulfate alone treatment knee pain associate osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee six month follow-up . These substance , market United States dietary supplement , widely tout lay press anecdotal personal experience effective treating OA . To date , however , small study publish worldwide literature . The study propose herein carefully construct definitively determine efficacy agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 24 week , placebo-controlled , parallel , double-blind , five-arm trial . The randomized treatment assignment stratify participate study center baseline pain score ( mild , moderate severe ) . In order establish study able detect significant treatment effect glucosamine , chondroitin sulfate combination two , celecoxib , already establish effective , also compare placebo . Patients receive rescue analgesic medication , acetaminophen , allow take severe pain throughout trial within 24 hour prior study visit . The visit include screen visit ( Visit 1.0 ) , randomization visit ( Visit 2.0 ) , follow-up visit 4 week ( Visit 3.0 ) , 8 week ( Visit 4.0 ) , 16 week ( Visit 5.0 ) completion visit 24 week ( Visit 6.0 ) randomization time patient discontinue study drug withdraw study . All patient require X-ray document presence disease patient must clinical X-ray evidence OA . X-rays read individual site forward central radiology center confirmatory reading . Patient evaluation consist ; 1 ) Western Ontario MacMaster ( WOMAC ) osteoarthritis index , 2 ) patient investigator global evaluation disease status response study medication , 3 ) evaluation index knee swell tenderness , 4 ) SF-36 , 5 ) Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , 6 ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , 7 ) clinical evaluation adverse reaction 8 ) reconciliation study medication rescue analgesia use . The percentage treatment responder primary outcome measure . A patient classified treatment responder 20 % reduction baseline end follow-up WOMAC pain subscale . Following method sample size target derive , analysis address primary hypothesis involve 3 primary comparison 1 ) glucosamine vs. placebo , 2 ) chondroitin vs. placebo , 3 ) glucosamine + chondroitin vs. placebo . A side comparison also do celecoxib placebo . Each comparison do use Fisher 's Exact Test , two-sided alpha 0.0125 . GAIT Ancillary Study Patients recruit select site extend opportunity participate trial administers blind study agent total 24 month . This study preliminary evaluation whether glucosamine , chondroitin sulfate and/or combination glucosamine chondroitin sulfate effective placebo whether combination effective glucosamine chondroitin sulfate alone alter radiographic progression patient osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee two year follow-up . Expected Total Enrollment : 791 ( *Indicates center participate ancillary study , site list ) Study start : April 2000 ; Study completion : March 2006 Primary Analysis The primary analysis base patient baseline follow-up xrays , include withdraw treatment . Inclusion patient baseline follow-up data reduce degree differential effectiveness bias treatment comparison . A second analysis base patient remain treatment . Following method sample size target derive , analysis address primary hypothesis involve 3 primary comparison 1 ) glucosamine vs. placebo , 2 ) chondroitin vs. placebo , 3 ) glucosamine + chondroitin vs. placebo . A side comparison also do celecoxib placebo . Each comparison do use t-test 2 independent sample , two-sided alpha 0.0125 . The primary outcome measure change joint space width baseline two year follow-up define Buckland-Wright MTP protocol . To evaluate long-term efficacy treatment , two-year treatment response rate ( define 20 % reduction baseline WOMAC pain score ) calculate . Paralleling main study protocol , Fisher 's exact test use compare active treatment arm placebo . Mixed-model analysis variance use generalize estimate equation use compare % treatment responder time across treatment group . Treatment miss data follow discuss previously mixed-model analysis change JSW . Safety evaluate comparing percentage people withdraw study medication due adverse event two-year follow-up period use Fisher 's exact test . Time withdrawal due adverse event evaluate use Kaplan-Meier life table estimate comparison treatment group use log-rank test .</detailed_description>
