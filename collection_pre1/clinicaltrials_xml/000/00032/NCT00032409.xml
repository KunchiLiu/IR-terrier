	<brief_title>The Effects Music Therapy-Based Stress Reduction Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The regimen-related toxicity associate bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) severe even life threaten . The overall goal randomize control pilot study BMT patient determine effect relaxation/stress reduction strategy : ( 1 ) frequency/severity toxic side effect marrow ablative chemotherapy , ( 2 ) timing immune reconstitution . Substantial literature indicate music therapy-based intervention effective induce relaxation also affect immune function modulate circulate salivary level agent cortisol , immunoglobulin A , interleukin-1 , natural killer cell , variety immune system-related substance . Over past two year , provide music therapy-based stress reduction/relaxation intervention convenience sample patient undergoing BMT . Preliminary finding pilot feasibility study demonstrate patient report significantly decrease pain ( p &lt; .004 ) sense nausea ( p &lt; .001 ) follow intervention . Average time-to-engraftment 13.5 ( +/- 2.85 ) day compare 15.5 ( +/- 4.40 ) day ( p &lt; .O1 ) group historical control match diagnosis , type transplant , condition regimen , date transplant , age , gender . Although highly promising , data limit lack randomization , appropriate control condition , measurement psychologic factor know influence outcome BMT , systematic monitoring early phase marker immune reconstitution could help explain phenomena observe . This proposal correct shortcoming especially highlight potential mediational effect cytokine release regimen-related toxicity time immune reconstitution .</detailed_description>
