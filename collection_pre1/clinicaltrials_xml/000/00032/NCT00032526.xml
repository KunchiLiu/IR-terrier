	<brief_summary>Most clinician care patient inflammatory airway disease allergic rhinitis asthma aware negative effect certain sight , sound smell precipitate clinical exacerbation certain susceptible patient . This thought due subconscious association observable stimulus pair actual exposure allergens induce clinical symptom . The severity duration symptom typically related level anxiety and/or depression affect patient . Classical condition immune response describe many animal human study association administration immunosuppressive drug . In successfully condition individual , subsequent exposure condition stimulus alone produce immunosuppressive change similar cause drug . Since disease exacerbate condition appear prevalent allergic patient , condition make excellent human model understand relationship classical conditioning , psychological stress ( particularly anxiety depression ) immune regulation . Thus proposal seek examine hypothesis antiinflammatory effect pharmacotherapeutic agent classically condition clinically effective due change immunoregulatory imbalance know occur patient allergic airway disease . The effectiveness therapeutic approach significantly affected level psychological stress individual suggestibility . This investigate follow Specific Aims : ( 1 ) . Determine relative effectiveness classical conditioning novel gustatory stimulus pair immunosuppressive dos corticosteroid vivo vitro immune response ( allergen - specific vs. general ) patient , classical conditioning correlate level clinical response ; ( 2 ) Determine role neuroendocrine mechanism ( particularly catecholamine ) inducibility duration condition immune response ; ( 3 ) Investigate influence psychological stress level ( include anxiety depression ) and/or suggestibility baseline immune change , success duration classical conditioning . These data help define parameter classical conditioning human , establish model investigate mechanism serve basis development future interventional protocol severe inflammatory disease involve classical conditioning .</brief_summary>
