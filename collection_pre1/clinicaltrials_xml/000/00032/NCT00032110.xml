	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy erlotinib , term response rate duration stable disease , patient recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Determine time progression response duration patient treat drug . IV . Determine relationships clinical , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic effect drug patient . V. Correlate baseline post-treatment level epidermal growth factor receptor , downstream signal component , marker angiogenesis , apoptosis tumor skin biopsy clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course CR confirm . Patients follow every 8 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 4-8 month .</detailed_description>
