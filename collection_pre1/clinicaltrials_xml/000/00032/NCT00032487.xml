	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Intensive glycemic control reduce major macrovascular morbidity mortality compare standard glycemic control type 2 diabetic fail simple therapy . Secondary Hypotheses : Intensive glycemic control , compare standard glycemic control , reduce macrovascular morbidity total mortality . Intervention : The intervention tight glycemic control , aim normalization HbA1c . This achieve stepped care therapy , use category tool available diabetologists . These category include : patient education diabetes control ( e.g . diet , exercise , etc . ) , oral diabetes medication , insulin . All drug use approve . Specific agent use within different class promote consistency across site . The comparison standard control , aim HbA1c 8 - 9 % . The agent use , reduced dos . The general approach step care treatment protocol treat group agent , different intensity ( dos ) ( take account intolerance/contraindications ) . The sequence step show . STEP 1 : Either Metformin ( obese ) Glimepiride ( lean ) combination Rosiglitazone STEP 2 : Insulin STEP 3 : Increase dose STEPS 1,2 Standard group . Since Intensive group already maximal dos oral agent , intensify insulin may add Acarbose/Miglitol . STEP 4 : For standard , proceed STEP 3 Intensive ; Intensives use multiple daily injection ( MDI ) insulin STEP 5 : `` Tool Box '' : Miscellaneous agent , tailor individual patient . Primary Outcomes : Time one follow major macrovascular event : myocardial infarction , stroke , new worsen congestive heart failure , amputation ischemic gangrene , invasive intervention coronary artery peripheral vascular disease , inoperable coronary artery disease , cardiovascular death . Secondary Outcomes : Angina , transient ischemic attack , intermittent claudication , critical limb ischemia , total mortality . Study Abstract : A quarter patient treat Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Health Administration type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . The cost care treatment patient type 2 DM extremely high , treatment expenditure metabolic disorder care end-organ complication . Although patient initially respond diet oral agent treatment , eventually need insulin near-normalize glucose level , disease characterized progressive loss insulin secretory capacity . After several clinical trial type 1 type 2 DM , reasonable certainty half incidence rate progression indicator microvascular complication ( retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy ) prevent delayed achieve maintain near-normalization glycemic level . Consequently , uniform trend recent guideline advise near-normalization glycemic level type 1 type 2 DM . Note , however , clinical consequence microvascular deterioration dependent glycemic level also duration disease . With early onset diabetes typical type 1 patient , sufficient time development clinical microvascular complication , prevention complication goal treatment type 1 diabetic . In contrast , prevalence hard clinical endpoint indicative microangiopathy , renal failure blindness , low patient disease diagnose 5th decade , great age prevalence patient type 2 DM country . Furthermore , microvascular complication minimize well-established benefit blood pressure lipid control , well therapeutic intervention ( photocoagulation , cataract extraction ) . Since cost effort necessary reach near-normal level glycemia high , need determine cost/benefit ratio expenditures population subject type 2 diabetes , namely patient 6th 8th decade life . In contrast late relatively infrequent appearance clinical endpoint microangiopathy , macrovascular complication ( i.e. , coronary heart disease peripheral vascular disease ) responsible overwhelming majority mortality , morbidity treatment cost American population type 2 diabetic , even old VA diabetic population . In recently conclude United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) type 2 DM , macrovascular mortality 70 time high microvascular mortality . Intervention study determine effect rigorous glycemic control macrovascular event inconclusive contradictory . Intensive treatment patient newly diagnose failed demonstrate beneficial effect tight control cardiovascular complication . The study conduct later stage disease ( i.e. , patient require insulin treatment , alone combination oral agent ) conflict indeterminate . The decision intensity treatment compromise current recommendation attenuate glycemic control goal , especially usage insulin require , patient common comorbidities overweight preexist cardiovascular disease , later decades life . These concern base fear intensive insulin treatment might associate weight gain , increase cardiovascular risk factor ( hypertriglyceridemia , dyslipidemia , hyperinsulinemia , insulin resistance ) , adverse effect recurrent hypoglycemic event . The prevalent level glycemic control insulin-treated type 2 diabetic relatively poor , likely due combination practical difficulty uncertainty safe effective glycemic goal . There long-term study currently do high-risk population typical patient population VA. Before Department Veterans Affairs devote considerable resource widespread intervention ( quarter patient ) may little value , might even counterproductive , trial determine value intervention mandate . It expect CSP # 465 provide scientific data VA base clinical treatment Type II diabetes . CSP # 465 prospective , 2-arm , randomize control trial determine whether glycemic control , achieve intensification treatment , effective prevent clinical macrovascular complication patient type 2 DM longer responsive oral agent alone . The study consist two-year accrual period five year follow-up ( 7 year total ) 1700 patient across 20 center . We power study detect 25 % reduction primary event rate . Additional study goal determine whether expenditure , discomfort , adverse effect associate intensive intervention justify term clinical benefit , consider macrovascular microvascular complication .
