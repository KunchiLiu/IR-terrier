	<brief_summary>Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) member human herpes virus family infect 95 percent U.S. population . Most infection occur childhood cause symptom ; adolescent adult , EBV often cause infectious mononucleosis . It also associate certain form cancer . Chronic Epstein-Barr virus ( CAEBV ) rare disease , primarily child young adult , lead life-threatening infection . This study seek identify genetic mutation responsible CAEBV . A secondary goal learn natural history CAEBV . The study examine blood tissue sample 50 patient ( age 2 ) CAEBV 150 relative ( age 2 ) . Autopsy sample may include study . Up 300 anonymous blood sample NIH Clinical Center Blood Transfusion Medicine also examine comparison . No 450 milligram ( 30 tablespoon ) blood per 8 week draw adult patient , 7 milliliter per kilogram blood per 8 week draw patient age 18 . Local health care provider refer patient study obtain sample . Some patient may also see NIH Clinical Center . Those patient full medical history physical examination , along chest X-ray , blood count , blood chemistry , EBV serology , viral load . Other test , CT scan MRI , may perform medically indicate . Patients ask undergo leukapheresis . In vitro test blood tissue sample include analysis protein gene involve immune response ; clone portion patient DNA ; transformation B cell EBV ; measurement ability patient blood cell kill EBV-infected cell ; determination lymphocyte subset ; determination antibody EBV herpes virus . If genetic cause CAEBV find , investigator available discuss result patient person telephone . Genetic indication risk disease also discuss patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients chronic active Epstein-Barr virus ( CAEBV ) ( ) illness begin primary infection EBV markedly elevate titer antibody EBV , ( b ) histological evidence organ disease , ( c ) elevate EBV DNA level blood EBV DNA proteins affected tissue . This primarily disease child young adult . Many patient develop hypogammaglobulinemia pancytopenia death frequently due opportunistic infection B T cell lymphoproliferative disease . The primary goal study identify genetic mutation responsible CAEBV . The secondary goal study learn natural history CAEBV . Blood sample available tissue ( e.g . previous biopsy autopsy material ) patient CAEBV relatives analyze identify disease gene mutate population . In addition , patient invite come evaluation NIH Clinical Center . At time medically indicated study disease progression perform . Serial virologic immunologic study perform . Eligible relative patient study compare gene ( ) associate CAEBV patient gene ( ) relatives . Knowledge gain study potential provide insight immunologic control EBV infection . In addition , identification molecular mechanism CAEBV may provide insight lead improved treatment disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CAEBV PATIENTS Study size : 150 patient Sex distribution : male female Age range : minimum maximum age Patients know suspected CAEBV relative recruit referral health care provider . The rarity disease markedly limit number patient available study . Patient recruitment irrespective racial ethnic group gender . NIAID investigator available answer question discuss general aspect CAEBV identify gene modifier gene participant provider . Eligibility criterion : To consider CAEBV , patient must : 1. severe progressive illness begin primary EBV infection , associate postive EBVspecific antibody titer ( IgGVCA , ; EA EBNA ) otherwise explain AND 2. evidence major organ involvement lymphadenitis , hemophagocytosis , meningoencephalitis , persistent hepatitis , splenomegaly , interstitial pneumonitis , bone marrow hypoplasia , uveitis AND 3. detection elevate level EBV DNA , RNA proteins affected tissue OR elevate level EBV DNA peripheral blood ( ) Any condition , opinion investigator , would make patient unsuitable enrollment could interfere patient participate study . RELATIVES OF CAEBV PATIENTS Study size : 150 relative CAEBV patient Age range : 2 year To determine genetic basis syndrome , evaluation blood , saliva and/or previously obtain tissue specimens healthy relative CAEBV patient serve control . No tissue biopsy perform healthy relative . We perform study list section V. sample normal relative . UNRELATED VOLUNTEERS Study size : 300 person Age range : 18 year Panels anonymous blood sample obtain NIH Clinical Center Blood Transfusion Medicine determine identify genetic change mutation polymorphism .</criteria>
