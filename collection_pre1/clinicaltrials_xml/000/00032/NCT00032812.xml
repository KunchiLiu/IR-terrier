	<brief_summary>This study examine compare happen brain patient Parkinson 's disease healthy normal subject train react fast possible appearance visual signal . Particularly , measure amount chemical dopamine release brain well electrical activity training . Indeed , patient Parkinson 's disease frequently complain slowness early fatigue movement . These symptom believe related decrease dopamine brain may associate abnormality cerebral electrical activity . Adult patient Parkinson 's disease right-handed , dementia , depress may eligible study . Healthy volunteer match patient age , gender , handedness , level education also study . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , memory test , mood evaluation , urine toxicology . All participant require stop take medication influence central nervous system abstain alcohol consumption 1 week screen examination study training period . Patients Parkinson 's disease also require stop use antiparkinsonian medication least 12 hour first visit train session . Participants several 1-hour training session . During session , sit face computer screen distance 32 inch ( 80 centimeter ) eye . Six permanent position marker display . A keyboard six spatially compatible response key within reach right hand . Participants respond quickly accurately possible appearance stimulus ( e.g. , white circle ) one marker press spatially correspond key . About second later , next stimulus display one marker , . Reaction time accuracy record . After 3 10 minute practice ( one block ) , rest period computer display information subject 's accuracy movement reaction time . Then , new block start . There 6 20 practice block per training session . The number training session vary 3 6 depend accuracy reaction time task . During train session , subject encephalographic ( EEG ) record measure electrical activity brain . In addition , one two positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan first training session , also one two PET scan last session . For PET scan , subject inject substance call raclopride , take brain . The raclopride tag radioactive substance detect PET camera . The amount raclopride detect brain provide indirect measure amount dopamine release training . Before one training session , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain anatomy . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The subject lie table space enclose metal cylinder ( scanner ) . The test take 45 60 minute , participant must lie still 10 15 minute time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Dopamine Motor Learning Healthy Subjects Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A dopaminergic system may play role form motor learning . At subcortical level , study animal human suggest striatum dopaminergic innervation participate acquisition retrieval program sequential movement . Moreover , activity mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron modulate reward predictability , nigrostriatal dopaminergic system propose participate reinforcement learning . At cortical level , suggest , human , dopaminergic system might modulate cortico-cortical connectivity volitional movement . The first purpose work investigate dynamic involvement striatal dopamine ( DA ) release different phase implicit motor sequence learn patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) compare healthy subject ( HS ) match age , gender , handedness , level education . Indeed , PD mainly know dopamine deficiency disorder-nigral projection motor striatum affected-and patient suffer PD usually difficulties learn execution sequential motor task . The second purpose study ass cortico-cortical connectivity implicit motor sequence learn HS PD patient . Implicit motor sequence learn study use probabilistic serial reaction time ( SRT ) task sequence presentation stimulus base finite-state grammar . Implicit motor sequence learn study use probabilistic serial reaction time ( SRT ) task sequence presentation stimulus base finite-state grammar . Learning assessed improvement reaction time . Striatal DA release assess vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) use DA D2 receptor radioligand : [ ( 11 ) C ] raclopride . Striatal [ ( 11 ) C ] raclpride bind potential ( BP ) measure HS PD 3 main condition : rest early advanced learning phase SRT task . At time , use EEG record test effect learn SRT task cortico-cortical coherence HS PD patient . This study provide new information ( path ) physiological role dopamine formation motor memory .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must confirm diagnosis PD . Patients ask stop use antiparkinsonian medication least 1218 hour prior examination ( 4 day cabergoline ) . Patients also ask stop medication influence central nervous system one week prior examination , also time period ask abstain alcohol . Patients early PD ( score Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale [ 257 ] less 2 ) . The PD cohort comprise nondemented , nondepressed , righthanded patient right upper limb involvement parkinsonian symptom sign primarily akinetorigid . If rest tremor present , patient mild moderate tremor ( UPDRS [ 256 ] tremor rating 1 2 right upper limb ) include study . The criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Human Motor Control Outpatient Clinic . Subjects may male female . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects familial history PD . Patients mark rest tremor ( score UPDRS scale 2 ) . Patients mild moderate motor impairment ( score Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale 2 ) . Patients progressive neurological disorder PD . Subjects cognitive impairment ( score BDI scale 10 ) . Subjects abnormal MRI finding visual inspection ( prominent normal variant mega cisterna cavum septum pellucidum , sign severe cortical subcortical atrophy , brain tumor , vascular disease , trauma AVMs ) . Subjects history significant medical disorder , require chronic treatment drug stop . Subjects prior exposure neuroleptic agent drug use . Subjects past present history hypertension , cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . Subjects severe orthopedic rheumatologic pathology right upper limb . Subjects past present neuropsychatric illness , head trauma loss consciousness , epilepsy , cerebrovascular disease , past present history alcohol substance abuse , include cigarette , medical condition may alter cerebral functioning . Subjects cancer . Subjects positive urine toxicology . Subjects pacemaker , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include heart valve cochlear implant ) shrapnel fragment . Subjects capable give informed consent . Subjects positive pregnancy test . Particpation child : Children exclude study follow reason : PD infrequent age 30 . Absorbed radiation dose per mCI relatively higher , pharmacodynamic effect great child compare adult . No direct benefit individual patient anticipate study .</criteria>
