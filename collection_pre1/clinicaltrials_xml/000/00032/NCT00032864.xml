	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Half 7,646 amputation perform VA 1996 veteran diabetes . Lower extremity ulcer precede 85 % diabetic amputation . Minor trauma , often footwear repetitive pressure relate , initiate majority ulcer . Persons diabetes unique footwear need . In 1997 , Gayle E. Reiber MPH , PhD , Douglas G. Smith , MD VA Puget Sound Health Care System initiate randomized clinical trial ( 1 ) determine extent study shoe study insert would reduce incidence re-ulceration diabetic individual prior foot ulcer history , ( 2 ) estimate cost ulcer prevention use strategy . A total 400 patient VA Puget Sound Health Care System ( n=189 ) Seattle-area Health Maintenance Organization , Group Health Cooperative ( n=211 ) , randomize one three study arm : Arm 1 ( n=120 ) study shoe customize cork insert ; Arm 2 ( n=119 ) study shoe generic polyurethane insert ; Arm 3 ( n=161 ) control wear footwear . Patients Arms 1 2 receive formal , leisure athletic shoe build study specification Cole-Haan men Lowell Shoe woman . Patients follow two year determine incidence cost foot re-ulceration . Study Abstract : A Seattle VA study indicate low extremity ulcer precede 84 % diabetic amputation . Nearly half event ban causal chain lead ulcer amputation initiate ill-fitting footwear . Other investigator report similar finding injurious footwear diabetic patient population . Yet , efficacy footwear prevent ulcers amputation high-risk diabetic population receive limited experimental investigation .
