	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine hormonal change occur stressful situation affect thought emotion . Results study may lead treatment alleviate psychological effect trauma . Levels cortisol norepinephrine increase response stress ; hormone also influence thought process . This study give hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine ( stimulator central norepinephrine ) healthy adult order model stress response well understand way people process information traumatic event . This study comprise two experiment stress response pharmacologically model . Participants study two study visit . During Visit 1 , participant undergo psychiatric assessment , complete neuropsychological task , IQ measure . During Visit 2 , participant give hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine . Blood collect . Participants perform two experiment . In one experiment , participant hear story emotional non-emotional segment ; second experiment , participant view emotional non-emotional stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Memories traumatic event fundamentally different typical memory . Individuals witness involve extremely stressful event , robbery violent act , retain highly accurate memory information directly relate trauma ( e.g. , gun verbal threat ) , surround detail poorly remember . This so-called weapon focus phenomenon find naturalistic laboratory study human . However , difficulty control naturalistic study approximate trauma lab limit validity finding . Neurophysiologically , cortisol norepinephrine principal mediator stress response , influence memory function . In particular , cortisol improves memory low level impair memory high dos . Similarly , evidence indicates norepinephrine also enhance memory low dose either impairs influence memory high dos . Much experimental work area conduct animal . Studies recently begin extend paradigms human . To good understand memory processing trauma , hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine ( stimulator central norepinephrine ) administer healthy adult two experiment order pharmacologically model stress response . Following infusion , participant hear story emotional nonemotional segment one experiment ( N = 80 ) emotional well nonemotional stimulus ( face scene ) another experiment ( N = 80 ) . It predict relative placebo , hydrocortisone impair memory emotional nonemotional information , yohimbine improve memory type information , combination hydrocortisone yohimbine enhance memory emotional aspect impair memory nonemotional segment story . Results study permit good understand emotionally charge memory encode potentially lead treatment mitigate psychological effect traumatic exposure .</detailed_description>
