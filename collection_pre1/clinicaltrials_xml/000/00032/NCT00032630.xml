	<brief_title>Outcomes Following Myocardial Revascularization : On Off Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypotheses : The study two primary hypothesis evaluate impact use off-pump versus on-pump surgical technique CABG procedure . One short term objective ass immediate impact two surgical technique second ass long-term impact two technique : 1 ) Short-Term Null Hypothesis : For patient CABG-only procedure perform , difference short-term composite clinical outcome ( 30 day death major morbidity ) patient randomize on-pump off-pump procedure , 2 ) Long-Term Null Hypothesis : For patient undergo CABG-only procedure , difference long-term clinical outcome measure one year mortality and/or acute myocardial infarction prior one year and/or subsequent revascularization procedure within one year patient randomize on-pump off-pump procedure . Secondary Hypotheses : Major secondary objective determine difference patient undergo CABG-only procedure use on-pump off-pump technique 1 ) long-term completeness revascularization , 2 ) one year graft patency stenosis rate determine angiography one year , 3 ) short-term completeness revascularization . Other secondary objective evaluate two surgical technique 1 ) change neuropsychological function , 2 ) traditional clinical outcome , 3 ) general disease specific quality life , 4 ) use system resource . Intervention : Patients require elective urgent CABG-only ( procedure do ) surgical procedure randomize either off-pump procedure on-pump procedure . Primary Outcomes : The short-term primary outcome measure composite measure death , repeat cardiac surgery , new technical support , cardiac arrest , coma , prolong stroke and/or renal failure require dialysis occur within 30 day surgery prior discharge , whichever late . The long-term primary outcome measure composite death , acute myocardial infarction , and/or subsequent revascularization procedure prior one year post-surgery . Study Abstract : Ischemic heart disease one frequent diagnose VA system . Moreover , 5,819 coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG-only ) procedures perform VA FY 1999 . Throughout VA non-VA cardiac surgery program nationwide , myocardial revascularization perform use two surgical technique . One technique perform cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) usually cardioplegic arrest ( `` on-pump '' ) without CPB beat heart ( `` off-pump '' ) . The overall purpose propose randomize , control , clinical trial rigorously evaluate impact use on-pump versus off-pump surgical technique coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG-only ) procedure ( perform traditional median sternotomy incision ) upon patient clinical outcome resource utilization .</detailed_description>
