	<brief_summary>Background : - Many risk factor breast cancer identify , include family history , endocrine background , change breast tissue , cancer one breast , radiation exposure , obesity others . There spectrum tissue change see cancerous pre-cancerous breast tissue . - A cell line collection cell grown laboratory original tissue specimen . Cell line develop high-risk breast tissue allow researcher perform metabolic molecular study breast cell time . Objective : To establish repository ( facility tissue sample preserve store many year ) cell line high-risk breast tissue allow researcher learn change breast cell may cause develop breast cancer . Eligibility : Women 20 80 year age : - Have increase risk breast cancer member high-risk breast ovarian cancer family . - Have breast cancer one breast . - Have radiation lymphoma age 30 . - Have mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene , whose family history know . - Are increase risk breast cancer . Design : - A small piece breast tissue obtain 10 woman without identify risk breast cancer 100 woman high risk develop breast cancer . - Cell line develop high-risk category . - The cell line tissue use establish repository high-risk breast cell line breast tissue use study cell develop breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch Multiple risk factor breast cancer identify , include family history , endocrine background , histologic change breast tissue , cancer one breast , radiation exposure , obesity , others . The histologic phenotype breast carcinogenesis include spectrum change , begin normal appear breast epithelium , progress hyperplasia , atypical hyperplasia , situ carcinoma , finally invasive carcinoma . Our present knowledge high risk breast tissue base study variety cellular sample type , include fine needle aspirate , nipple aspirate fluid , core needle biopsy , breast tissue mastectomy segmentectomy specimen . Valid preclinical model need utilize homogenous human cellular material study time large quantity . A model may ideally suit metabolic molecular study breast epithelial cell vitro cell line model develop high risk breast tissue . In study normal breast tissue acquire high risk site breast cancer breast . These tissue use develop breast epithelial cell line vitro study , establish high risk cell line tissue repository . Objectives : To acquire normal breast tissue high risk site breast cancer breast . To develop breast epithelial cell line normal high risk breast tissue major high risk site . To establish repository high risk breast epithelial cell line high risk normal breast tissue use resource pilot study NIH participate center characterize high risk breast epithelial cell Eligibility : Women age 20 - 80 year increase risk breast cancer member high risk breast ovarian cancer family . Women history ipselateral breast cancer , either invasive situ , normal contralateral breast mammography ( within past 12 month ) normal physical examination contralateral breast adjacent lymph node bear area , undergo prophylactic mastectomy . Women without breast cancer Gail model estimate 5-year risk breast cancer 1.67 percent high . Women bilateral breast cancer ( invasive situ ) receive whole breast irradiation breast . Women previous history mediastinal irradiation lymphoma age 30 great 5 year since complete radiation therapy . Normal woman increase risk breast cancer ( Gail model Index less 1.50 percent ) without abnormal finding breast physical examination mammography serve normal control tissue . Women mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene , whose family history know . Absence significant cardiac , hepatic renal disease , , opinion PI , likely cause metabolic change breast tissue . Design : A tissue acquisition Normal breast tissue collect woman high risk breast cancer NIH institution well . Centers collect tissue protocol must IRB approval study IRB approve Informed Consent . All breast tissue obtain surgical specimen acquire part plan surgical procedure . Short-term cell line develop tissue confirm cytologically expression cytokeratins . Multiple cell line high risk category develop . These cell line respective tissue use establish repository high risk breast epithelial cell line high risk breast tissue use define carinogenic pathway breast cancer . Early passage cell culture respective normal breast tissue store future study . 100 patient enrolled period 5 year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible , woman must one following : Women 2080 year age increase risk breast cancer member high risk breast ovarian cancer family . An Individual family history verify breast and/or ovarian cancer define include one following : 1 ) least four case breast cancer . 2 ) Three case breast cancer least one case ovarian cancer ( two case ovarian cancer first degree relative ) . 3 ) Two case ovarian cancer first degree relative . High risk family may also include least 4 case early onset ( age le 60 ) breast cancer ovarian cancer ( diagnosis age ) , family know segregate mutation BRCA1 another predispose gene ( i.e . BRCA2 ) . Women history ipsilateral breast cancer , either invasive situ , normal contralateral breast mammography ( within past 12 month ) normal physical examination contralateral breast adjacent lymph node bear area , undergo prophylactic mastectomy . Women without breast cancer Gail model estimate 5year risk breast cancer 1.67 percent high . Women bilateral breast cancer ( invasive situ ) receive whole breast irradiation breast . Women previous history mediastinal irradiation lymphoma age 30 great equal 5 year since complete radiation therapy . Normal woman increase risk breast cancer ( Gail model Index less 1.50 % ) without abnormal finding breast physical examination mammography serve normal control tissue . Women mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene , whose family history know . Absence significant cardiac , hepatic renal disease , , opinion PI , likely cause metabolic change breast tissue . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Chemotherapy within 3 week prior breast biopsy procedure . Pregnancy , White blood count less 2000 , platelet count less 50,000 . Concurrent infection . A history bilateral whole breast radiation therapy . A suspicious unbiopsied lesion physical examination mammography breast ( ) study .</criteria>
