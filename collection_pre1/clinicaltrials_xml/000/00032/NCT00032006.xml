	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs goserelin , leuprolide , flutamide , bicalutamide may stop adrenal gland produce androgen . Internal radiation use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Combining hormone therapy internal radiation may effective treat locally recurrent prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness hormone therapy follow internal radiation treat patient locally recurrent prostate cancer follow external-beam radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine nature , intensity , time course health-related quality life change patient locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma treat androgen suppression transperineal ultrasound-guided brachytherapy external beam radiotherapy . - Determine morbidity patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival , disease-free survival , disease-specific survival patient treat regimen . - Determine clinical pattern tumor recurrence ( i.e. , time local tumor progression distant failure ) time biochemical failure patient treat regimen . - Determine post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive androgen suppression comprise goserelin subcutaneously ( either 4 one-month depot injection 1 one-month depot injection 1 three-month depot injection ) OR leuprolide intramuscularly ( 4 one-month depot injection 1 one-month depot injection 1 three-month depot injection 1 four-month depot injection ) AND oral flutamide 3 time daily 112 day OR oral bicalutamide daily 112 day . Within 4 week completion androgen suppression , patient sequentially enrol 2 different cohort brachytherapy . - Cohort 1 : Patients undergo initial-dose transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy iodine I 125 palladium Pd 103 . - Cohort 2 : After minimum 1-year follow-up patient cohort 1 , tolerance acceptable , additional patient undergo higher-dose transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy iodine I 125 palladium Pd 103 . Quality life assess baseline , within 2 week prior brachytherapy , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 83-166 patient ( 83 per cohort ) accrue study within 1.5-3 year .</detailed_description>
