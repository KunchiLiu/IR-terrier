	<brief_title>Does Reduction Total Body Iron Storage ( TBIS ) Alter Mortality Population Patients With Advanced PVD ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The original JAMA abstract ( 2007 ) report overall effect iron reduction intervention phlebotomy . However , pre-planned analysis accord randomization variable entry , include age ferritin level , describe JAMA paper show improved outcome iron reduction young age quartile secondary endpoint ( p interaction =0.004 ) also suggest favorable effect smoker ( p interaction 0.006 ) . Age analyze continuous variable use Cox proportional hazard regression model log relative hazard plot reveal age interact nonlinearly treatment primary ( p=0.04 ) secondary ( p &lt; 0.001 ) outcomes . The Cox model show improved primary ( HR 0.47 , 95 % CI 0.24-0.90 , p=0.02 ) secondary ( HR 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.24-0.68 , p &lt; 0.001 ) outcomes young age quartile participant ( age 43 61 ) randomize iron reduction versus control . Thus , interaction age level body iron may mask beneficial effect iron reduction overall cohort . Detailed analysis effect age ferritin level publish American Heart Journal confirm iron reduction significantly improve primary secondary outcome young age quartile participant , describe , displayed Kaplan-Meier plot . Mean follow-up ferritin level ( MFFL ) decline increase entry age control . Older age ( p=0.026 ) high ferritin ( p &lt; 0.001 ) entry predict poor compliance phlebotomy rise MFFL iron reduction participant . Iron reduction intervention also produce great ferritin reduction young participant . Improved outcome low MFFL occur iron reduction patient primary ( HR 1.11 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.23 , p=0.028 ) secondary ( HR 1.10 , 95 % CI 1.0-1.20 , p=0.044 ) outcomes , entire cohort : primary outcome ( HR 1.11 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.23 , p=0.037 ) . Improved outcomes occurred MFFL versus median entire cohort mean : primary outcome HR 1.48 , 95 % CI 1.14-1.92 , p=0.003 ; secondary outcome HR 1.22 , 95 % CI 0.99-1.50 , p=0.067 . Thus , low iron burden predict improved outcome overall enhance iron reduction phlebotomy . Controlling iron burden may improve survival , prevent delay non-fatal myocardial infarction stroke . These finding warrant confirmation use study . A possible effect iron level risk cancer well vascular disease recognize trial inception . Participants visceral malignancy within precede five year exclude study . However , information collect prospectively occurrence new visceral malignancy cause-specific mortality include death due cancer . As report Journal National Cancer Institute , new visceral malignancy diagnose follow-up 60 control 38 iron reduction participant , 37 % ( HR 0.63 ; 95 % CI = 0.42 - 0.95 , p = 0.026 ) decrease risk iron reduction . Reduced cancer risk iron reduction confirm time-to-event analysis ( HR = 0.65 ; 95 % CI = 0.43 - 0.97 , p = 0.036 ) . Reduced risk observe several common tumor type . Iron reduction participant low cancer - specific mortality lower all-cause mortality participant diagnose cancer ( HR = 0.39 ; 95 % CI = 0.21 - 0.72 , p = 0.003 HR = 0.49 ; 95 % CI = 0.29 - 0.83 , p = 0.009 respectively ) , compare control participant . MFFL follow-up participant randomize iron reduction develop cancer comparable level control participant ( t93 = 0.8 , p = 0.428 ) . The MFFL participant randomize iron reduction develop cancer 127 ng/mL , 95 % CI = 71.2 - 183.0 . The MFFL significantly low participant develop cancer , 76.4 ng/mL , 95 % CI = 71.4 - 81.4 , p = 0.017 ) . Participants randomize iron reduction develop cancer appear relatively non-compliant intervention . Analysis data FeAST study continue delineate interaction iron status smoking , lipid level statin use , diabetes race . It show ferritin level range 70 79 ng/mL associate low mortality level inflammatory marker . Statin use , randomization variable , monitor show relate lower ferritin level .</detailed_description>
