	<brief_summary>This study examine blood tissue sample patient Fraser syndrome patient Fryns syndrome try identify gene responsible disease . Fraser syndrome characterize congenital abnormality include cryptophthalmos ( lack eyelid formation ) , syndactyly ( webbed finger toe ) abnormal genitalia . Patients may also abnormalities nose , ear larynx ( voice box ) , cleave lip palate , kidney agenesis . Fryns syndrome characterize hernia diaphragm , cloudy cornea , coarse facial feature , cleave lip palate , abnormal finger toe , heart , kidney brain malformation hydrocephalus ( accumulation fluid around brain ) . This protocol consist laboratory study ; involve patient care patient counseling . Patients Fraser syndrome Fryns syndrome eligible study . Parents healthy sibling patient also include genetic study , parent child undiagnosed multiple congenital anomaly syndrome include comparison study . Participants provide blood sample ( 8 10 teaspoon adult ; 1 3 teaspoon child ) sample skin cell collect swab inner surface cheek . Some patient may undergo skin biopsy , small skin sample ( 1/8-inch diameter ) surgically remove . The tissue sample use obtain DNA ( genetic material ) laboratory test . A permanent cell line-a collection cell grown laboratory original tissue specimen-will also establish enable additional testing future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We would like determine molecular genetic etiology two rare human malformation syndrome , Fraser syndrome ( OMIM 219000 ) Fryns syndrome ( OMIM 229850 ) . To date , unaware molecular genetic study perform either syndrome . We plan perform molecular genetic study DNA specimen affect individual ascertain outside NIH clinician and/or report medical literature . Should study prove fruitful , would plan expand work combine clinical molecular study fully delineate phenotype associate disorder . We plan collect DNA specimen affect patient unaffected sibling parent evaluate specimen laboratory linkage analysis , physical mapping , candidate gene characterization mutation screening . If causative gene ( ) either syndrome identify , mouse model disease may develop cell biologic study normal mutant protein may undertake . The cloning gene would enable good characterization human developmental process improve patient counsel individual family affect disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For Fraser syndrome , clinical criterion inclusion : Satisfying diagnostic criterion Fraser syndrome . These least two major criterion one minor criterion ( list ) one major criterion four minor criterion . Major criterion : Cryptophthalmos Syndactyly Abnormal genitalia Sib cryptophthalmos syndrome Minor criterion : Congenital malformation nose Congenital malformation ears Congenital malformation larynx Cleft lip and/or palate Skeletal defect Umbilical hernia Renal agenesis Mental retardation Cryptophthalmos additional anomaly consistent phenotypic spectrum Fraser syndrome without satisfy diagnotisic Fraser syndrome may also consider sufficient inclusion . For Fryns syndrome , formal diagnostic criterion publish . The clinical criterion inclusion : Diaphragmatic hernia least one additional anomaly find spectrum Fryns syndrome , include cleft lip palate , renal genital malformation , cerebral malformation hydrocephalus , corneal clouding , craniofacial dysmorphism brachydactyly nail hypoplasia , pulmonary agenesis microphthalmia . Patients four additional anomaly may include study . Parents unaffected sibling also include linkage analysis . Specimens DNA whole blood DNA extraction collect outside NIH may accept study obtain approve NIH protocol consent form .</criteria>
