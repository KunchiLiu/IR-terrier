	<brief_summary>The Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Diagnosis Treatment Trial project # 1 Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center focus upper extremity pain . It randomize trial compare surgical nonsurgical treatment patient early , mild moderate carpal tunnel syndrome . In addition study evaluate ability new magnetic resonance ( MR ) technique predict likely benefit carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While good evidence patient severe CTS benefit surgery , less evidence benefit patient mild moderate disease . However , mild moderate disease still account important disability . Electrodiagnostic study ( EDS ) show accurately predict outcome patient CTS . Recent advance MR permit high-resolution neurographic image median nerve , pilot data suggest wrist MRI might better predictor outcome EDS . Thus , wrist MRI potential playing major role treatment patient CTS . We test two main hypothesis : 1 ) select patient early , mild moderate CTS benefit early surgery conservative therapy ; , 2 ) wrist MRI accurately identify patient likely benefit surgery . We perform randomize , control treatment trial nest within prospective cohort study design .</detailed_description>
