	<brief_title>EQUIC-SM : Enhancing Quality Informed Consent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : Self-Monitoring Questionnaire ( questionnaire relate process IC self-administered study coordinator ) evaluation inform consent process use Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol ( BICEP ) develop EQUIC-DP phase . Primary Hypothesis : We hypothesize focus attention may become routinized process , quality IC encounter enhance . We evaluate success intervention patient-subject complete telephone questionnaire , BICEP ( Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol ) , IC process complete . Primary Outcomes : The quality inform consent process , measure BICEP ( Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol ) . The BICEP also offer method certify inform consent routine use . Study Abstract : Enhancing Quality Informed Consent Self-Monitoring ( EQUIC-SM ) one component VA Cooperative Studies Program-wide initiative inform consent ( EQUIC ) . Its objective field test iterative improvement one intervention inform consent ( IC ) process , self monitor . Self-monitoring involves person obtain IC complete Self-Monitoring Questionnaire , SMQ IC encounter patient-subject recruited participating study . We conceive SMQ activation device prompt person obtain IC monitor he/she conduct IC encounter . RESEARCH DESIGN : EQUIC-SM conducted conjunction participate clinical trial VA CSP multiple VAs throughout country . Patient-subjects recruit among participant parent study . Parent study randomize SM protocol control sit . METHODOLOGY : Patient-subjects inform EQUIC-SM time first present information parent study . The person obtain consent use script description EQUIC-SM . If subject agrees , verbal consent EQUIC-SM obtain . The parent study inform consent process use SM protocol control arm EQUIC-SM ; however SM protocol arm , person obtain consent complete SMQ IC process . In arm , patient-subjects ask complete BICEP interview parent study IC process complete . FINDINGS : Investigators use result EQUIC-SM assess value self-monitoring technique improve quality inform consent . The premise focus attention person obtain informed consent IC process enhance quality IC encounter , thus inform consent obtain . SIGNIFICANCE : Practitioners clinical trial responsibility ensure patient participation research inform voluntary . This responsibility imply strive continuously improve effectiveness method inform prospective research volunteer experimental study , thereby enhance protection interest . If self-monitoring technique test EQUIC-SM prof enhance quality inform consent , technique may adapt wide use conduct clinical trial , thus represent important step towards goal .</detailed_description>
