	<brief_title>The Home INR Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : Weekly patient self-testing ( PST ) prothrombin time international normalize ratio ( PT INR ) versus conventional monthly high quality anticoagulation management ( HQACM ) anticoagulation clinic minimum two year follow-up . Primary Hypothesis : Compared conventional monitoring clinic , PST anticoagulation intensity decrease number event thromboembolism ( stroke ) , bleed , cause death improve quality anticoagulation . Second Hypothesis : PST conventional monitoring comparable term health care utilization cost . Primary Outcomes : Event rate ( thromboembolism bleed episode ) , time first event , time within therapeutic range anticoagulation intensity , total health care cost ( include price PST monitor ) utilization . Study Abstract : Since home monitor prothrombin time ( PT ) may potentially improve safety , quality , convenience chronic anticoagulation management , likely demand provider , patient , manufacturer make home monitor available VA patient . The rationale PST would permit intense monitoring increase patient participation his/her care , result increase precision anticoagulation control thus few event . Original plan study 32 site total sample size 3,200 patient length three year ( one recruitment two year follow-up ) . Final status 28 site randomized 2922 patient 2.75 year recruitment minimum two year follow-up .</detailed_description>
