	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Bryostatin 1 Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient advance renal cell carcinoma treat interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) bryostatin 1 . II . Compare toxicity 3 different dos bryostatin 1 give combination fix dose IL-2 patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize one three dose level bryostatin 1 . ARM I : Patients receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously day 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 . For second subsequent course IL-2 , patient also receive low dose bryostatin 1 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive IL-2 arm I middle dose bryostatin 1 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive IL-2 arm I high dose bryostatin 1 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may receive 3 additional course therapy . An additional cohort patient receive treatment high dose evaluate toxicity . Patients follow 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-65 patient ( 8-16 per bryostatin 1 dose level ) accrue study within 14-27 month .</detailed_description>
