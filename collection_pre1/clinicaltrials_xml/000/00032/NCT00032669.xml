	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new treatment strategy call therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) HIV-infected child adolescent . TDM involve analyze virus , give drug virus sensitive , monitoring drug blood level make sure enough drug work virus , change drug dose low . HIV-infected child 0 21 year age may benefit treatment protease inhibitor benefit current antiretroviral drug treatment regimen may enrol 48-week study . Patients currently receive antiretroviral treatment , include patient never receive antiretroviral treatment , may enrol study . Participants blood drawn learn anti-HIV drug patient 's virus resistant to-that , drug longer effective virus . This determine analyze virus 's genotype ( detailed genetic structure ) phenotype ( response exposure anti-viral drug ) . Based test result patient 's prior medication history , drug regimen tailor individual patient prescribed . It may include one two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , zidovudine , didanosine , lamuvidine , zalcitabine , stavudine ) , non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine efavirenz , protease inhibitor amprenavir , nelfinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , Kaletra ( combination lopinavir ritonavir ) . After patient begin treatment , amount protease inhibitor blood measure . If enough drug find blood , dose drug increase amount drug blood check . In study , dose may increase three time . Patients see clinic 6 day treatment begin measure blood level medicine evaluate response virus . Treatment continue outpatient basis . Drug level measure periodically throughout study . The viral load also measure additional test determine whether resistance pattern patient ' virus change . In addition , patient undergo follow test procedures various time throughout study , frequently first month less often : - Blood test measure cell count viral load - Routine laboratory test measure kidney , liver , bone marrow , organ function - Eye neuropsychologic examination - Echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) - Electrocardiogram ( EKG - heart rhythm test ) - Chest X-ray - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan head - Skin test To make sure medicine work , must take directed . In addition , since high usual dos anti-HIV drug may give , important know whether patient take medicine prescribe . This study therefore also measure patient ' adherence medication regimen two way : 1 ) medicine package bottle electronic medicine bottle cap record bottle open , 2 ) patient parent interview phone person various time study adherence may ask fill form record number dose take . This allow doctor patient work together make sure medicine take properly . Patients parent also interview periodically understanding HIV disease , social support available , child 's emotional adjustment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single arm study determine whether novel dose adjustment strategy individualize protease inhibitor dose maintain drug concentration virologic-based threshold value ( TDM ) pediatric patient HIV able result potentially clinically useful proportion patient achieve target inhibitory quotient ( IQ ) . The study consist 34 child 0 21 year age ( minimum weight 10 kg ) . Patients viral resistance test perform baseline information , combine treatment history analysis drug tolerability issue use design combination antiretroviral regimen . After new regimen start , pharmacokinetic monitoring guide dose adjustment protease inhibitor . An algorithm follow make dose adjustment base upon viral phenotype drug level . The primary outcome measure fraction patient attain adequate protease inhibitor level target value . Secondary measure include virologic immunologic benefit evaluation toxicity tolerability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HIVinfected child age 0 21 year An indication treatment PI contain antiretroviral regimen define 2001 Guidelines Use Antiretroviral Agents Pediatric HIV Infection ( one follow ) : Clinical symptom associate HIV Infection ( i.e. , clinical category A , B , C ) Evidence immune suppression indicate CD4 Tlymphocyte count percentage ( i.e. , immune category 2 3 ) Age le 12 month regardless clinical , immunologic , virologic status High increase HIV RNA copy number Rapidly decline CD4 Tlymphocyte number percentage value approach indicative moderate immune suppression ( i.e. , immune category 2 ) Children fail current treatment define 2001 Guidelines Use Antiretroviral Agents Pediatric HIV Infection ( http : //www.hivatis.org/ ) ( one follow ) : Less 10fold decrease baseline viral load patient HAART regimen ( combination regimen include PI and/or NNRTI ) 812 week therapy . Less 5fold decrease viral load baseline patient nonHAART regimen ( e.g. , dual NRTI combination ) Viral load suppress undetectable level 46 month antiretroviral therapy Repeated detection HIV RNA patient initially respond antiretroviral therapy undetectable level . An increase viral load great 3fold . Change immunologic classification For child immunologic category 3 , decline five percentile CD4 cell percentage A great 30 percentage decline absolute CD4 cell count . Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration Growth failure Disease progression Intolerant show evidence toxicity antiretroviral treatment . HIV RNA great equal 5,000 copy per/ml within past 3 month ( may outside institution ) . Sexually active patient must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , study . Hematologic Function : Total WBC great 1,500/mm ( 3 ) , Absolute Neutrophil Count great 750/mm ( 3 ) , hemoglobin great 8.0 gm/dL platelet count great 75,000/mm ( 3 ) study entry Hepatic Function : Liver transaminases must less equal 3.0 time upper limit normal ; Lipase less 1.5 time upper limit normal ; Creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) less 2.5 time upper limit normal . Renal Function : Patients must ageadjusted normal serum creatinine OR creatinine clearance great equal 70mL/min/1.73 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History nonadherence opinion PI study chairperson make unlikely patient adhere protocol . Clinically significant , unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) judgement Principal Investigator Chairperson would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy likely interfere study procedure result Weight le 10 kg . Pregnant breast feeding female .</criteria>
