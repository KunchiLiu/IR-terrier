	<brief_title>Does Prophylactic Coronary Artery Revascularization High Risk Patients Reduce Long-term Risk Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Prophylactic coronary artery revascularization high risk patient schedule elective vascular surgery reduce long-term risk mortality . Secondary Hypotheses : Prophylactic coronary artery revascularization high risk patient schedule elective vascular surgery reduce long-term risk myocardial infarction improve cost-effectiveness treatment quality life patient . Intervention : 1 ) Medical therapy . This current , conservative practice . Each local investigator decide best medical treatment consistent give patient schedule elective vascular surgery . In patient coronary artery disease , long-term treatment would expect include combination antiplatelet agent , beta-blockers , calcium channel blocker , nitrate . Vascular surgery occur soon possible later three month randomization . 2 ) Coronary artery revascularization . Repair heart patient coronary artery disease may aid protection patient undergo vascular surgery . The surgeon free choose coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) . Coronary artery revascularization occur soon possible randomization . Vascular surgery occur one three month follow CABG three four day three month follow PTCA . Primary Outcomes : Long-term mortality , MI , quality life . Study Abstract : Cardiovascular disease account one million death per year major cause mortality among Americans . Studies show patient schedule elective vascular surgery , prevalence coronary artery disease exceed 50 % . It surprising , therefore , `` perioperative cardiac morbidity '' define occurrence MI , unstable angina , CHF , arrhythmia , cardiac death , lead cause perioperative complication . Although number sophisticated diagnostic test show helpful identifying patient high risk perioperative cardiac complication , study address important question : Should prophylactic coronary revascularization perform prior elective vascular surgery ? This study design answer question . STUDY DESIGN This proposal utilize prospective , randomized trial test whether prophylactic coronary revascularization reduces perioperative cardiac complication long term mortality patient undergo elective vascular surgery . All VA patient require elective vascular surgery screen enrollment . Patients exclude enrollment need urgent/emergent vascular surgery ; previous coronary artery revascularization current ischemia ; one serious medical condition COPD ( FEV1 &lt; 1.0 ) , renal dysfunction ( creatinine &gt; 3.5 mg/dl ) , liver failure , metastatic cancer , severe dementia , stroke , unstable angina . Eligibility study base result coronary angiography . Patients clinical risk factor ( include history MI , pathologic Q-waves , ventricular ectopy require antiarrhythmic therapy , diabetes , angina , CHF ) ; and/or positive stress test ; candidate coronary angiography . Specific angiographic criterion exclude individual subsequent randomization . These include normal coronary artery , severe LV dysfunction ( EF &lt; 20 % ) , aortic valve area &lt; 1 cm2 , leave main disease ( equivalent ) . Patients consider nonintervenable cardiologist cardiac surgeon also exclude . Enrolled patient meet exclusion criterion randomize either medical treatment prophylactic revascularization . The decision proceed either PTCA CABG base institutional experience . The study design compare PTCA versus CABG , rather test whether revascularization procedure prove beneficial . The stratification factor participate hospital type vascular procedure propose ( intraabdominal infrainguinal ) . The randomization scheme stratify type vascular surgery aortic procedure ( intraabdominal ) may carry risk peripheral procedure ( infrainguinal ) . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS For trial , sample size 560 randomized patient require . This provide 90 % power detect difference 3.5 year survival rate 85 % patient receive prophylactic coronary artery revascularization versus 75 % patient receive medical treatment . Allowing 10 % post randomization dropout rate , target sample size 620 patient . Assuming average intake one patient per hospital per month , 18 participate hospital require . STUDY PHASES The study originally fund one year pilot phase . The purpose phase determine feasibility randomize one patient per hospital per month . In order study enter main phase , five pilot hospital , range number vascular surgery case low high , achieve least 90 % patient accrual expectation ( 54 expect 60 patient randomize one year ) . After successful completion pilot phase , main study approve . During main phase , 18 participate hospital accrue patient four year continue postvascular surgery follow-up one year .</detailed_description>
