	<brief_title>Does Tension-Free Herniorrhaphy Laparoscopic Herniorrhaphy Achieve Equal Better Recurrence Rates Lower Costs While Achieving Equivalent Outcomes Hernia Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Open tension-free herniorrhaphy compare laparoscopic herniorrhaphy achieve equal good recurrence rate lower cost achieve equivalent outcome patient-centered measure . Secondary Hypotheses : Intervention : Patients randomize open repair undergo standardize tension-free herniorrhaphy prosthesis ( method Lichtenstein ) . Patients randomize laparoscopic herniorrhaphy undergo standardize preperitoneal repair prosthesis , use either transperitoneal extraperitoneal approach . During implementation period trial , preliminary laboratory session conduct site PIs standardize herniorrhaphy technique , reach consensus aspect perioperative patient management ( include postoperative patient instruction , follow-up schedule , definition recurrence complication ) , ensure site PI thoroughly familiar protocol . Each site visit one two expert surgeon ( Study Chair Co-PI surgeon ) observe operative procedure ensure participate surgeon adhere protocol respect . The first visit take place first 6 month study need thereafter , base routine examination operative record randomly select site ( 5 open 5 laparoscopic herniorrhaphies , , appropriate , view videotape laparoscopic procedure ) . Primary Outcomes : Hernia recurrence rate . Study Abstract : Background : Inguinal hernia one common worldwide affliction men . The presence inguinal hernia indication repair . Approximately 700,000 hernia repair perform U.S. year , procedure account 10 % general surgery procedure Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) ( 10,000 inguinal herniorrhaphies perform per year ) . There many different technique currently use repair inguinal hernia advent laparoscopy , yet another technique advocate . Laparoscopic repair report study superior open repair less pain earlier return work . However , laparoscopic repair require general regional anesthetic expensive equipment supply perform . There also evidence open tension-free mesh repair may result similar laparoscopic repair patient center outcome measure . The general acceptance procedure , especially VHA , uniform . Furthermore , randomize trial sufficient size power conclusive do set forth operative gold standard hernia repair . Objectives : To determine whether open tension-free herniorrhaphy compare laparoscopic herniorrhaphy achieve equal good recurrence rate lower cost achieve equivalent outcome patient-centered measure . Methods : This multi-center VA cooperative study enrol 2200 men inguinal hernia randomize one two operative technique : open tension-free ( Lichtenstein ) repair , laparoscopic preperitoneal repair . The primary outcome measure recurrence two year . Secondary outcome measure complication , pain , time return normal activity , health-related quality life , patient satisfaction , caregiver burden , cost . The role comorbidity outcome also determine . The sample size permit least 80 % power detect difference 3 % 2-year recurrence rate two surgical procedure . Fourteen VAMCs randomize 2200 patient 3-year accrual period . The study also 2-year follow-up period . All patient follow end study follow-up range 2-5 year ( average 3.5 year ) . On November 29 , 2001 , Hines Cooperative Studies Human Rights Committee Data Safety Monitoring Board meet review data CSP # 456 . Both committee determine sufficient data complete trial without enrol additional patient recommend enrollment stopped . There safety concern . Approximately 2,165 patient target 2,200 enrolled point . All site notify within 24 hour action . Main Manuscript :</detailed_description>
