	<detailed_description>* 1,000 Gulf War veteran , spouse , &amp; child 1,000 non-deployed Gulf War era veteran , spouse , &amp; child . Primary Hypothesis : Gulf War veteran equal prevalence mean level follow medical psychological condition frequently report literature compare control group nondeployed veteran : ( 1 ) chronic fatigue syndrome , ( 2 ) fibromyalgia , ( 3 ) post-traumatic stress disorder , ( 4 ) neurologic abnormality , include peripheral neuropathy cognitive dysfunction , ( 5 ) general health status . Secondary Hypotheses : ( 1 ) Medical condition report frequent among Gulf War veteran compare nondeployed veteran self-reported data Phase I equal prevalence two group upon objective clinical examination . These include arthritis , dermatitis , hypertension , bronchitis , asthma . ( 2 ) The prevalence medical condition primary hypothesis secondary hypothesis ( # 1 ) equal spouse Gulf War veteran nondeployed veteran . ( 3 ) The prevalence major birth defect find pediatric physical examination veteran ' biologic child conceive war Gulf War veteran nondeployed veteran equal ; prevalence medical condition child live veteran ' household , whether conceived war , Gulf War veteran nondeployed veteran equal . Intervention : This observational study . Primary outcomes variable : chronic fatigue syndrome ; post-traumatic stress disorder , fibromyalgia ; peripheral neuropathy ; cognitive dysfunction ; general health status : physical component mental component . Study Abstract : In response legislative mandate , VA initiate survey entitle A National Health Survey Persian Gulf Veterans Their Families . The survey design retrospective cohort study health population-based sample 15,000 troop deploy Persian Gulf area compare 15,000 troop deploy Persian Gulf area . The survey conduct three phase . In Phase I study , structure health questionnaire mail 30,000 Persian Gulf War-era veteran sample survey . Up four follow-up mailing send non-respondents increase response rate six-month period . In Phase II , telephone interview sample 8,000 non-respondents review select medical record sample 4,000 veteran respondent conduct . Through additional telephone interview non-respondents , potential non-participant bias evaluate . The medical record review help assess validity select self-reported health data ( clinic visit , hospitalization , pregnancy outcome , birth defect among child , infant death , etc. ) . The present protocol represent Phase III study -- clinical examination sample 1,000 Gulf War ( GW ) veterans spouse child 1,000 Gulf War era nondeployed veteran spouses child . Results Phase I indicate prevalence several self-reported health condition elevate GW veteran compare control group . The overall purpose Phase III study corroborate finding objective clinical examination . A sample pool Phase I Phase II Persian Gulf War veteran Persian Gulf era nondeployed veteran generate . Dr. Kang 's office provide 16 participate medical center names phone number veteran contact . Each medical center examine average 125 veteran , 95 spouse , 123 child period 30 month . The VA medical center strategically select VA medical center within drive distance majority family sample . Veterans contact first letter telephone site close home invite participate study . Exams schedule veteran spouse/children participate . Data exam send Hines CSPCC clean analysis . Travel arrangement expense provide participant reimbursed time . Characteristics Participants : Mean age deploy veteran examine 38.9 yr . compare 40.7 yr . non-deployed veteran examine ( p &lt; .0001 ) . Mean income $ 46,800 deploy $ 52,000 non-deployed participant ( p=.003 ) . Non-deployed participant likely white ( 81.0 % vs. 76.4 % , p=.03 ) , marry ( 72.3 % vs. 67.4 % , p=.02 ) , continue education past high school ( 42 % vs. 32.5 % , p &lt; .0001 ) . Results Veterans : Both physical mental component score derive SF-36 significantly low among deployed veteran examine . For physical component score , mean deploy group 48.2 ( s.d . 9.8 ) compare 50.8 ( s.d . 8.3 ) non-deployed group , p &lt; .0001 . The mental component score average 49.6 ( s.d . 10.2 ) deploy group 53.7 ( s.d . 7.9 ) non-deployed group , p &lt; .0001 . There weak trend high prevalence fibromyalgia deploy group ( 3.1 % ) non-deployed group ( 1.9 % ) , [ odds ratio 1.64 , 95 % confidence interval ( .94 , 2.87 ) , p=.09 ] . There high prevalence chronic fatigue syndrome among deploy ( 1.6 % ) non-deployed ( 0.4 % ) , [ odds ratio 4.58 , 95 % confidence interval ( 1.53 , 13.64 ) , p=.003 ] . Among seven cognitive dysfunction factor , trend towards high prevalence impair attention/working memory among deploy ( 6.6 % ) non-deployed ( 4.2 % ) , [ odds ratio 1.60 , 95 % confidence interval ( 1.10 , 2.35 ) , p=.02 ] . PTSD Gulf War prevalent among deploy ( 10.1 % ) non-deployed participant ( 3.2 % ) , [ odds ratio 3.41 , 95 % confidence interval ( 2.30 , 5.05 ) , p &lt; .0001 ] . No difference find peripheral neuropathy 6 7 factor define assess cognitive dysfunction . Among secondary outcome measure , several category skin condition find prevalent among deployed veteran . Results Spouses : The mean score mental component scale lower spouse deployed participant ( 50.3 ( s.d . 9.9 ) ) spouses non-deployed participant ( 52.6 ( s.d . 8.6 ) , p &lt; .0001 ) . No outcome measure spouse find related deployment status veteran . Birth Defects : No statistically significant relationship deployment status prevalence birth defect among first live bear offspring born Gulf War find . Summary : Although participation rate lower anticipate , find little evidence participation bias . Veterans deploy Gulf War high rate chronic fatigue syndrome post-Gulf War onset PTSD , poor health-related quality life . Attention/working memory deficit fibromyalgia may also relate deployment Gulf War . Additional Comments : Additional analytic work remain : ( ) result adjust covariates age , ( b ) certain subgroup oversampled result adjust study 's original sampling methodology , ( c ) analysis subgroup purport increase risk health impact due type service Gulf War do .</detailed_description>
