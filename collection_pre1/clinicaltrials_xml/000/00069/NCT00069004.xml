	<brief_title>A Study Physical Metabolic Abnormalities HIV Infected Uninfected Children Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance HIV care associate HAART , many patient HAART regimens develop physical metabolic problem , include change body fat distribution ( lipodystrophy ) , osteopenia osteoporosis , dyslipidemia , hyperlactatemia . Early study suggest protease inhibitor ( PIs ) directly responsible HIV Lipodystrophy Syndrome ( HLS ) skeletal complication HAART-treated patient . This study compare HIV infect , HAART-treated child youth uninfected counterpart make connection HAART , HLS , skeletal metabolic problem . The study first address prevalence risk assessment complication child , useful predict long-term prognosis HIV patient use used HAART . There three group study . Group 1 participant uninfected volunteer receive protocol-specific treatment intervention . Vertically infected HIV patient Groups 2 3 continue current HAART either non-PI-containing regimen ( Group 2 ) PI-containing regimen ( Group 3 ) . Screening evaluation conduct within 30 day prior study entry . Study evaluation may complete study entry course 3 study visit . All participant undergo whole body regional DEXA scan ( ass bone density ) , measurement determine sexual maturity , blood work .</detailed_description>
