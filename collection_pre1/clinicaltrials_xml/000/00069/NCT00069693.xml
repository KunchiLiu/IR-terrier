	<brief_summary>This study conduct test patient primary chronic orthostatic intolerance ( COI ) learn disorder autonomic nervous system . Healthy normal volunteer patient 18 year age old COI may eligible study . Participants undergo one follow test procedure : - Blood study , include arterial catheter insertion measure blood pressure collect arterial blood sample , blood flow study use sensor apply skin pressure cuff around limb , blood volume study use injection radioactively label human serum albumin gene study look genetic abnormality associate certain protein . - Imaging study , include CT scan adrenal gland , heart ultrasound , PET scan . - Electrocardiogram - Microdialysis measure level chemical body fluid certain tissue . A thin tube insert skin solution pass . Chemicals body tissue enter solution tube . The solution collect chemical level measure . - Neck suction . Neck suction apply test reflex brain use regulate blood pressure . - Perometry . Limb volume measure use infrared light move limb . - Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test evaluate aspect autonomic nervous system function . A small amount brain chemical ( acetylcholine ) apply skin tiny amount electricity , sweat nearby patch skin measure . - Skin electrical conduction test use sensor skin measure sweat production . - Skin core temperature measurement use sensor skin ear canal . - Tilt table test . The subject lie table , secure strap around chest leg . Sensors place arm chest monitor blood pressure , pulse rate , heart rhythm . A catheter place vein arm collect blood sample give drug . Another catheter place artery draw blood monitor blood pressure . The subject give infusion norepinephrine epinephrine , baseline measure blood sample take . The table tilt upright measurement blood sample take interval 30 minute . The table return horizontal position additional measurement sample may take . Drugs may administer test , include acetylcholine , epinephrine , norepinephrine , radioactive chemical use image study , drug affect blood vessel , heart rate , force heart contraction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Chronic Orthostatic Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol identify characterize distinct type chronic orthostatic intolerance ( COI ) . COI manifestation primary chronic autonomic failure , cover separate protocol . The present protocol concern patient COI rest condition intact sympathetic neurocirculatory function . COI reflect different pathophysiologic mechanism ; , study attempt distinguish mechanism individual patient . We hypothesize result clinical assessment physiologic , chemical , pharmacologic , image test reveal internally consistent pattern distinguish particular form COI . We wish determine relative frequency form referral population . The first phase test identify sympathetic neurocirculatory failure , baroreflex failure , secondary cause COI ( hypovolemia , excessive orthostatic venous pooling , excessive orthostatic extravasation ) . In subsequent inpatient phase , tilt table test do , concurrent hemodynamic chemical measurement , confirm subtypes postural tachycardia syndrome neurocardiogenic syncope . The result evaluation used stratification specific , pathophysiologically define diagnostic group therapeutic protocol . In off-site study , evaluate member large family COI seem transmit autosomal dominant trait .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject patient COI adult healthy volunteer similar age , gender , body mass . Participation protocol offer people 18 year old old , independently gender , race , age , ethnicity , religion , demographic sociopolitical classification . The subject second offsite study family member identify proband . Participation protocol offer people 18 year old old , independently gender , race , ethnicity , religion , demographic sociopolitical classification . In second offsite study , participation also offer subject 10 17 year old , provided appropriate inform consent/assent give subject his/her parent guardian . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Minors younger 18 year old exclude , except offsite study . Advanced age constitute exclusion criterion . For subject 55 year old , carotid Doppler study do , subject significant carotid disease ( stenosis atherosclerosis ) exclude . In offsite study , minor younger 10 year old exclude . For second offsite study , minor younger 10 year old exclude . Advanced age constitute exclusion criterion . Except second offsite study , people less 18 year old exclude . Risk : A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator Clinical Director , protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . This include risk associate air travel NIH . A candidate subject exclude , opinion Principal Investigator Clinical Director , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . Disqualifying Conditions : A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition hepatic renal failure , history tachyarrhythmias , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , refractory ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic coronary heart disease , diabetes mellitus , hyperthyroidism , allergy sensitivity iodinate contrast medium plan drug . A positive HIV rest result necessarily exclude patient participate . Medications : A candidate subject exclude clinical consideration require patient continue treatment drug likely interfere scientific result . Examples tricyclic antidepressant , anticoagulant , betaadrenoceptor blocker , phenothiazine , barbiturate , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , acetaminophen , alphaadrenoceptor agonist antagonist . Patients one drug exclude , drug taper discontinue undergoing clinical laboratory test . Patients discontinue medication patient patient 's doctor discuss Principal Investigator . If decided discontinuing medication would unsafe , patient exclude study . Patients know suspected allergy hypersensitivity test drug exclude . Patients unable discontinue nicotine alcohol 24 hour prior evaluation exclude . Patients chronic orthostatic intolerance often take several medication could interfere scientific result protocol . Temporary discontinuation medication outpatient , even approval refer physician , introduces risk . To maximize patient safety , may admit patient monitor inpatient medication taper stop . In second offsite study , subject test usual medication . Herbal Medicines Dietary Supplements : Certain herbal medicine dietary supplement know suspect interfere experimental result , herbal medicine dietary supplement must discontinue enrollment study . In case subject wish continue herbal medicine dietary supplement study , search available medical literature fail identify effect know expect interfere experimental result , subject may participate . Subjects offsite study may continue herbal medicine dietary supplement . Practical Limitations : Patients feel would difficult insert catheter vein exclude . Subjects expect clinically tolerate lying still procedures exclude . In second offsite study , i.v . place , subject refuse i.v . place DNA sample may obtain buccal smear obtain saliva . Pregnancy : Pregnant lactate woman exclude . In second offsite study , pregnancy exclusion criterion . The Investigators may also exclude subject participation , event know suspect falsification medical history information refusal undergo plan test procedure , without loss benefit subject previously entitle .</criteria>
