	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Currently , incidence prevalence chronic kidney disease lead end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) continue increase alarm rate United States . According United States Renal Data System , 2000 370,000 prevalent ESRD patient , expect grow 610,000 year 2010 . Furthermore , adjust death rate incident ESRD patient 19.8 per 100 patient year risk , cardiovascular disease account 50 percent mortality patient population . Recent analysis demonstrate least 10.9 million people United States chronic kidney disease , population , substantially increase cardiovascular risk , prompt Surgeon General include chronic kidney disease focus area improve nation 's health Healthy People 2010 . The metabolic derangement accompany progressive loss kidney function lead unique pattern oxidative injury specific uremic state . For patient chronic kidney disease , non-traditional risk factor cardiovascular disease increase oxidative stress inflammation may especially important . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The broad goal study develop enhanced understanding progressive loss kidney function lead increase oxidative stress , inflammation , accelerate development cardiovascular disease . The long-term objective proposal develop data critical subsequent large scale , multicenter , randomize , control trial design alleviate oxidative stress , reduce inflammation , reduce cardiovascular morbidity patient chronic kidney disease . The aim study determine prospective study extent oxidative stress risk factor cardiovascular event patient chronic kidney disease characterize inter-relationships oxidative stress inflammation . A aim determine longitudinal study progressive loss kidney function influence oxidative stress propensity inflammation cardiovascular disease . An additional aim determine effect antioxidant therapy biomarkers oxidative stress , marker inflammation endothelium-dependent vascular function patient chronic kidney disease . This study incorporate series observational interventional study measure extent cardiovascular disease extensive ex vivo measure biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation patient chronic kidney disease . Coordination clinical data ex vivo study emphasize achieve maximal understand pathophysiology uremic cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
