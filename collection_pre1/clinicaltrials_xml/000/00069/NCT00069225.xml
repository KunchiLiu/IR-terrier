	<brief_summary>This study , conduct University Pennsylvania National Institutes Health Bethesda , Maryland , examine deficit brain structure function people expose trauma develop post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) see deficit change treatment . It also investigate whether genetic susceptibility PTSD . Candidates 18 year age old follow category include study : 1 ) woman PTSD least 1 year 's duration follow sexual non-sexual assault ; 2 ) healthy woman ( control ) previously assault develop PTSD ; 3 ) healthy woman ( control ) never traumatize . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , psychiatric evaluation , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , routine blood urine test . Women PTSD assign receive either : 1 ) 12 week cognitive behavioral psychotherapy either immediately upon enrollment 3-month wait period ; 2 ) 10 week drug treatment paroxetine ( PaxilÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) . Patients evaluate treatment procedure outline . Control subject undergo procedure , also 10- 12-week interval evaluation . - Neuropsychological testing : Subjects take paper pencil computer test evaluate memory , learning , attention concentration , vocabulary naming . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : Subjects MRI scan brain examine brain structure blood flow perform two task . In first task , show series face asked press one button male face another button female face . In second task hear loud noise see colored square . During scan , subject lie bed slide narrow tunnel ( scanner ) . They wear headset block noise scanner receive instruction task . Heart rate skin conductance ( sweat ) measure scan evaluate physiologic change response task . - Eyeblink air puff test : Subjects hear tone light puff air deliver eye . Changes heart rate , sweat , eyeblink measure electrode tap skin two finger , side rib cage , one eye . - Potential air puff delivery : This experiment three part . During three part experiment , subject see colored light may may receive puff air neck . Before part told , , may receive air puff neck . Each part repeat several time . During test , electrode tap arm chest monitor skin conductance heart rate response . - Blood draw genetic evaluation : Subjects ' DNA examine try determine risk develop PTSD inherit . The DNA examine cortisol receptor gene evaluation , see form gene find often patient PTSD healthy control . The receptor cortisol determine activity stress hormone cortisol , genetic variation structure receptor may relate vulnerability PTSD . Patients take paroxetine offer 3 month additional drug therapy follow completion study offer participation NIH study evaluation treatment PTSD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Structure Function Before After Treatment Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) characterize intrusive recollection , avoidant behavior , anxiety exaggerate fear response . The pathophysiology PTSD largely unknown . Neurophysiological test PTSD reveals deficit memory attention . Neuroimaging study report increase amygdala decrease anterior cingulate activation reduce hippocampal volume . Clinical observation , psychophysiological measure animal study suggest facilitate fear conditioning , delayed extinction , inescapable shock , sensitization protract habituation may contribute onset persistence PTSD . We propose use fMRI psychophysiology lab examine effect treatment paroxetine cognitive behavioral therapy regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) brain region conceivably involved evolution maintenance PTSD : Amygdala , anterior cingulate hippocampus . We use emotional task elicit difference perfusion metabolism patient PTSD trauma expose healthy subject . Tasks perform fMRI include 'masked ' 'unmasked ' emotional face paradigms differential delay conditioning . Contextual fear provocation eyeblink trace condition do psychophysiology lab . This evaluation perform 10-week period treatment paroxetine 10-session course cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT ) . Study population comprise follow match group : Patients PTSD ; previously traumatize healthy subject suffer PTSD non-traumatized healthy subject . Subjects 1st group either treat paroxetine 10 week , undergo 10-week 'prolonged exposure ' ( PE ) CBT course , put 'waiting list ' . It assume variability outcome observe treatment mode , enable u seek treatment response predictor . It unknown whether cerebral abnormality PTSD state trait phenomenon . In depression OCD , functional imaging research show improvement malfunction brain region clinically effective psychopharmacological psychotherapeutic intervention administration placebo depression . An increase hippocampal volume find patient PTSD treatment paroxetine correction endocrine abnormality Cushing 's disorder . These finding support expectation least brain abnormality PTSD state relate , change abnormality demonstrable fMRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Men woman age 1865 , suffer PTSD , healthy trauma survivor never traumatize healthy subject . PTSD diagnosis determine use structure clinical interview DSM IV ( SCID ) ( 155 ) . Capable provide informed consent , obtain prior study procedure . Free psychotropic medication least 2 week , exclude shortterm hypnotic . Patients treat fluoxetine include medication free period least 8 week . Good physical health , confirm complete physical exam ( include normal vital sign ) , electrocardiogram , neurological exam , routine laboratory test blood urine . However , patient participate research study blood work primary MD within last 6 month , result use instead repeat blood draw inclusion study . Right hand , determine handedness questionnaire . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Past head trauma involve loss consciousness , amnesia great 24 hour . This magnitude head trauma could contribute psychopathology brain structure manner different PTSD thereby confound result . Substance abuse ( alcohol drug ) dependence within 3 month prior screen . The effect abuse/dependence phenomenology biology could mask exceed PTSD effect . All additional DSM IV Axis I comorbidity , exclude secondary diagnosis major depressive disorder ( MDD ) anxiety disorder ( AD ) . Given high comorbidity disorder PTSD , since exclude patient would provide full spectrum disorder , patient axis I diagnose MDD AD precede onset PTSD exclude . Mental retardation another pervasive developmental disorder . Risk homicide suicide . When trauma involve assault , continue intimate relationship perpetrator . Current intend pregnancy . If participant becomes pregnant course study , data remove analysis . Subjects well medication . Although recruit nonmedicated patient , decision stop medication take purely clinical ground . No subject take medication solely participate study . Deafness NOT exclude patient healthy control participation . Accomodations protocol adjustment ( e.g. , abbreviation neuropsychological battery eliminate test would subject know expected normalization violation ) make necessary population .</criteria>
