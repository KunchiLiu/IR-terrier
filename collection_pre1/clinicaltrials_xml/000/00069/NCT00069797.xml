	<brief_title>Epidemiology Coronary Heart Disease Men Aged 40 Over</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Substantial change toward Westernized lifestyle take place among young individual born World War II ( WWII ) non-Western country include Japan . Data national sample survey Japan clearly demonstrate risk factor profile coronary heart disease ( CHD ) similar United States ( US ) post WWII cohort . Men Japan considerably high prevalence cigarette smoke men US high prevalence obesity . CHD mortality among men Japan , however , still less half US . Careful review mortality statistic confirms . This difference remain unique among industrialized country . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study collaboration Dr. Akira Sekikawa University Pittsburgh Dr. J. David Curb Pacific Health Research Institute Honolulu , Hawaii . The study test null hypothesis difference extent atherosclerosis among Japanese men Japan , Japanese American men Hawaii , US white black men post WWII birth cohort . The project base recent ongoing successful Japan/US collaboration INTERMAP , INTERLIPID Honolulu Heart Program study include development first standardize US/Japan diet table . The investigator examine 300 white men 100 black men age 40-49 , randomly select Allegheny County , PA , 300 Japanese American men age 40-49 population-based sample recruit offspring member Honolulu Heart Program cohort , 300 Japanese men age 40-49 , randomly select Kusatsu City , Japan . The Japanese recruitment examination already support Japan . The extent atherosclerosis risk factor profile CHD evaluate compare , well relationship specific risk factor measure atherosclerosis . The measure subclinical disease propose include calcium score coronary artery aorta measure electron beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) carotid intima thickness measure ultrasound . Other proposed measure include dietary intake food frequency questionnaire , total cholesterol , LDLc , HDLc , lipids NMR spectroscopy , blood pressure , cigarette smoking , thiocyanate , omega-3 fatty acid , alcohol consumption , body mass index ( BMI ) , intra-abdominal fat , others .</detailed_description>
