	<brief_title>Study Acid Reflux Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Gastroesophageal reflux ( GERD ) frequent asthmatic poor asthma control , often occur without symptom , induce bronchoconstriction . Poorly control asthmatic often treat GERD drug suppress gastric acid , treatment expensive benefit treatment establish . Proton pump inhibitor relatively new class medication provide highly effective treatment GERD associate problem . This success lead many doctor begin PPI treatment asthma patient attempt achieve good asthma control . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The randomized , placebo-controlled trial enroll 400 asthmatic , age 18 older , poor asthma control inhaled steroid , define basis excessive bronchodilator use , nocturnal awakening , frequent exacerbation . Participants randomly assign treatment either proton pump inhibitor , esomeprazole ( Nexium ) 40 mg twice day , match placebo . The presence , severity , temporal relationship GERD asthma symptom document 24 hour ambulatory esophageal potential Hydrogen ( pH ) probe monitoring , participant enrol irrespective severity GERD . The primary outcome measure proportion participant exacerbation asthma within 6-month period define asthma diary interview . Secondary outcome measure include asthma symptom control score , asthma-specific generic health-related quality life , GERD symptom , health care use , pulmonary function , airways reactivity . Pre-specified subgroup analysis conduct determine clinical demographic characteristic predict benefit treatment GERD asthma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The general goal patient selection enroll patient asthma physician might prescribe GERD treatment , uncertainty whether might effective . Age 18 old Physician diagnose asthma If amount air expire first second forced expiratory maneuver ( FEV1 ) great equal 70 % predict normal prebronchodilator : demonstrate methacholine 20 % postdiluent baseline ( PC20 ) . PC20 le 16 mg/ml Visit 1 If FEV1 le 70 % great equal 50 % predict normal prebronchodilator : demonstrate 12 % reversibility Visit 1 within past 12 month Currently stable dose daily inhale steroid asthma control , i.e. , inhale corticosteroid equivalent 400 ug/day fluticasone44 great 8 week longer Poor asthma control : Either follow ; score 1.5 great Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire ; two episode asthma symptom past 12 month episode require least one following : emergency department visit , unscheduled physician visit , prednisone course , hospitalization Nonsmoker 6 month longer Less 10 pack/year smoke history Surgery : Previous antireflux peptic ulcer surgery Pulmonary function : FEV1 le 50 % predict normal prebronchodilator GERD Symptoms : Severe reflux constitute clinical indication treatment PPI H2 blocker , typically two episode per week heartburn require antacid Other major chronic illness ; condition judgment Study Physician would interfere participation study , e.g. , nonskin cancer , endocrine disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , stroke , severe hypertension , Type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , renal failure , liver disorder , immunodeficiency state , major neuropsychiatric disorder Medication use : Antireflux medication ( proton pump inhibitor H2 blocker ) within 1 month Theophylline , azoles , iron , anticoagulant , insulin ( Type I diabetes ) , digitalis , investigative drug within 1 month Drug allergy : Previous adverse effect proton pump inhibitor methacholine challenge Females childbearing potential : Pregnant lactating , unwilling practice adequate birth control method ( abstinence , combination barrier spermicide , hormonal ) Inability unwillingness provide consent Inability perform baseline measurement Completion less 10 last 14 day screen period diary entry Inability contact telephone Intention move area within 6 month</criteria>
