	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pixantrone , cytarabine , methylprednisolone , cisplatin , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy treat patient relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pixantrone , Cytarabine , Methylprednisolone , Cisplatin Treating Patients With Aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity pixantrone , cytarabine , methylprednisolone , cisplatin patient aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma first relapse . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine validity safety regimen mobilization regimen high-dose chemotherapy stem cell support patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . - Salvage therapy : Patients receive pixantrone IV 1 hour day 1 ; cisplatin IV 30 minute day 1-4 ; methylprednisolone IV 15-30 minute day 1-5 ; cytarabine IV 2 hour day 5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 2 course salvage therapy , patient re-evaluated treated follow : - Complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) : Patients CR PR suitable candidate autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) proceed mobilization therapy , high-dose chemotherapy , ASCT . Patients CR PR unsuitable candidate ASCT continue receive salvage therapy 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Stable disease : Patients stable disease continue receive salvage therapy 6 course . Patients CR PR 3-4 course salvage therapy suitable candidate ASCT proceed mobilization therapy , high-dose chemotherapy , ASCT study investigator 's discretion . - Mobilization therapy ( optional regimen ; regimen use mobilization investigator 's discretion ) : Patients receive rituximab* IV day 1 7 ; pixantrone IV 1 hour day 2 ; cisplatin IV 30 minute day 2-5 ; cytarabine IV 2 hour day 6 ; methylprednisolone IV 15-30 minute day 2-6 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin day 7 continue blood count recover . Patients receive 1 course mobilization therapy stem cell harvest . Patients proceed high-dose chemotherapy subsequent re-infusion harvest stem cell . NOTE : *If mobilization regimen use , patient T-cell lymphoma receive rituximab - High-dose chemotherapy ASCT : Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy ASCT per institutional standard practice . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 75 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
