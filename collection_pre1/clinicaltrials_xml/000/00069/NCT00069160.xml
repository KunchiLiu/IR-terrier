	<brief_summary>The purpose study three-fold : 1 ) examine ability experimental drug tariquidar improve chemotherapy result block protein ( P-glycoprotein ) cancer cell act pump cancer drug ; 2 ) examine tariquidar interact cancer drug docetaxel ; 3 ) evaluate effectiveness combination treatment tariquidar docetaxel treat patient lung , ovarian , cervical cancer . Patients 18 year age old recurrent metastatic ( spread ) lung , cervical , ovarian cancer benefit standard treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination ; review pathology slide ; blood urine test ; image test , include compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ; chest x-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ; possibly echocardiogram . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Blood draw . Blood drawn treatment begin establish baseline level future blood test . Blood count do twice weekly chemotherapy begin . Central venous catheter placement . A plastic tube put major vein chest . It use give study drug medication , include antibiotic blood transfusion , need , withdraw blood sample . The line usually place local anesthesia radiology department operate room . It stay body month remove treatment complete . Chemotherapy . Treatment cycle 21 day . Both drug give day 1 cycle . First , tariquidar give 30-minute infusion . One hour tariquidar infusion , docetaxel infuse 1 hour . ( For first cycle , docetaxel give divided dos one week apart tariquidar administer either day 1 day 8 . The order tariquidar administration randomize generate optimal pharmacokinetic data . Patients hospitalize several day cycle gather research data ) . The tariquidar dose remain throughout study . Docetaxel may increase decreased cycle cycle , base side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intrinsic acquire drug resistance remain major obstacle treatment cancer . Accumulating evidence indicate malignancy P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) confer resistance , reversal improve therapeutic outcome . Clinical trial investigate Pgp antagonist hamper occurrence unpredictable pharmacokinetic interaction , require dose reduction chemotherapeutic agent avert excessive toxicity . Tariquidar ( XR9576 ) new Pgp antagonist potent prolonged activity . Phase I trials paclitaxel , vinorelbine , docetaxel demonstrate tariquidar ( XR9576 ) minimal pharmacokinetic interaction surrogate study confirm vivo inhibition Pgp-mediated drug transport.This study seek determine pharmacokinetic interaction , docetaxel tariquidar evaluate potential activity lung , ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cervical cancer . Renal cell cancer add 3/1/06 amendment . The secondary goal evaluate impact tariquidar uptake ( 99m ) Tc-sestamibi recurrent metastatic tumor patient lung , ovarian , renal cervical cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must fulfill follow criterion eligible study admission : Age great equal 18 year . Histologic cytologic confirmation lung , cervical , ovarian cancer , follow least one standard treatment regimen , know standard therapy capable extend life expectancy . Female patient primary papillary carcinoma peritoneum fallopian tube cancer include latter group , disease entity closely associate epithelial ovarian carcinoma , difficult distinguish , similar epithelial origin , treat identical manner . Histologic cytologic confirmation renal cell carcinoma ( clear cell , type 1 type II papillary chromophobe , collect duct medullary ) . Patients receive either sunitinib sorafenib , unless deem ineligible treatment either agent . In addition , patient either : ( ) receive IL2 ; ( b ) evaluate therapy Interleukin2 ( IL 2 ) deem ineligible ; ( c ) evaluate therapy IL2 refuse treatment . Performance status : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 Life expectancy 3 month great . Suitable candidate receiving plan therapy evidence screen laboratory assessment hematologic , renal hepatic , metabolic function , platelet count great equal 90,000/mL , absolute granulocyte count ( AGC ) great equal 1,500/mL , serum creatinine great equal 1,500/mL , serum creatine less equal 1.5 mg/dl ) great 1.5 measure 24 hour creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) less equal 2.5 x normal limit ( NL ) bilirubin less equal 1.5 x NL ( patient clinical evidence Gilbert 's disease , less equal 3 x NL ) . Patients must great equal 4 week prior radiation chemotherapy , great 2 week hormonal therapy ; great 4 week prior experimental therapy ; great 6 week mitomycin C ; great 8 week prior UCN01 treatment . No serious intercurrent medical illness . Measurable disease radiographic mean physical examination . For ovarian cancer , assessable disease cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) measurement allow . Willingness sign write consent form , comply protocol . The following patient population eligible study . Pregnant nursing woman eligible ; woman childbearing age must agree use effective method contraception . Pregnant woman eligible teratogenic effect chemotherapy . The presence second malignancy receive primary treatment would complicate primary objective study . Patients poor medical risk active , uncontrolled infection nonmalignant systemic disease . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositive patient . Patients infected HIV virus exclude trial effect combination tariquidar docetaxel HIV replication and/or immune system unknown potentially harmful . Patients receive agent major interaction cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) drug metabolize system discontinue may include trial . Untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) due poor prognosis patient difficulty ascertain cause neurologic toxicity .</criteria>
