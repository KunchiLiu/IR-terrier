	<brief_summary>This study , conduct NIH Clinical Center University Wisconsin University , compare measurement obtain use old new model machine call optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) scanner . This instrument use beam light measure thickness retina , light-sensitive inner line back eye . OCT measurement do multicenter clinical trial new treatment disorder cause vision loss , macular edema . Because center study use old OCT model new one , necessary determine whether two model give comparable result . People 18 year age old follow category may eligible study : - People diabetes , without macular edema ; - People retinal disease , uveitis vein occlusion retina ; - People history eye disease normal retina . Participants follow test procedure : - Eye examination assess vision eye pressure evaluate retina . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Stereoscopic color fundus photography examine back eye . Eye drop use enlarge size pupil allow examination photograph eye use special camera flash bright light eye . - OCT measure retinal thickness . For procedure , subject sits front small screen look target center screen dim red light move across subject 's retina . This test do first one model OCT scanner , . Finally , test repeat eye whichever model use first . Patients treat macular edema repeat test 3-month visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) increase markedly recent year clinical research . It promise new method image retina , measure thickness , display feature structure . It useful assess several eye disease , include macular edema various cause abnormality vitreoretinal interface . There broad clinical consensus OCT superior stereoscopic color fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , clinical biomicroscopic examination measure retinal thickness capable document fairly small change thickness . OCT become important part clinical trial new treatment macular edema . A number model OCT device commercially available , model 1 , 2 , 3 . A number model OCT use clinical center involve clinical research . Comparisons model 2 3 well reproducibility measurement conduct . The main research question answer protocol following , patient normal retina , diabetic macular edema , macular edema cause , vitreoretinal abnormality : 1 . Is standard deviation difference sequential measurement retinal thickness normal retina use OCT 3 similar measure OCT 2 ? 2 . Are systematic difference thickness measurement use OCT 2 OCT 3 eye ? 3 . Are differences ability machine image abnormality within vitreoretinal interface ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patient must understand sign inform consent . 2 . Patient must least 18 year age . 3 . Pupillary dilation least 6 mm must possible . 4 . Ocular medium must sufficiently clear allow quality image . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Any condition corneal opacifiation precludes adequate slit lamp examination photography fundus .</criteria>
