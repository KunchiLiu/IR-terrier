	<brief_summary>This study evaluate brain change psychological characteristic people resilient trauma . It examine compare response three category subject : 1 ) people expose significant traumatic event suffer symptoms post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) severe enough interfere ability function ; 2 ) people expose significant traumatic event suffer PTSD symptom severe enough interfere ability function ; 3 ) people never expose significant traumatic event . Most people expose trauma recover well adversity . Some may even benefit , example , gain great self-confidence strengthen personal relationship . Others , however , develop PTSD may repeat thought , image , dream trauma ; feel upset remind traumatic event ; avoid place people remind trauma ; feel detached others ; difficulty sleep concentrate ; startle easily . People three category list may eligible study . Candidates screen medical psychiatric interview , evaluation emotional intelligence ( sensitivity feeling others ) , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . Participants undergo follow additional test procedure : - 24-hour urine collection three urine drug screen course study . - Saliva collection every 2 hour day urine collection . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain : Subjects three MRI scan session show brain structure change blood flow different region brain responsible emotion . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field may wear earplug muffle loud sound occur scan process . While scanner , subject show picture face , house , word performs task involve make decision picture Subjects also show pleasant , unpleasant , neutral picture ; ask play two game chance - one evaluate social cooperation ; evaluate decision-making . Heart rate , blood pressure respiration measure scan . - Neuropsychological testing : These test design evaluate memory , learning , attention concentration , name . - Aversive conditioning : This procedure examine body reacts unpleasant stimulus , mildly unpleasant electrical stimulation wrist loud sound , time . During test , heart rate , electrodermal activity ( sweat ) , respiration , finger pulse volume , eyeblink response measure . A small blood sample drawn every 5 minute evaluate plasma level various stress hormone , include cortisol , neuropeptide Y , norepinephrine , others . - Genetic biological testing : Patients agree genetic test blood sample drawn DNA study well understand biology pharmacology PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since majority research study posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) focus pathological consequence exposure trauma , paucity information psychobiology subject resilient severe stress . The propose study comprehensively evaluate neural circuit mediate fear , reward , social cooperation , memory , emotional regulation traumatize men woman without PTSD healthy subject . Subject group include prisoner war , active duty special operation force , return Iraqi veteran ( approval pending ) , men woman expose non-combat trauma include sexual physical abuse . Comparison group include men woman expose trauma without PTSD ( resilient subject ) , healthy men woman never expose trauma . Changes neural circuitry associate resilience evaluate use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Relationships interaction among neural circuit mediate fear , reward , social cooperation , memory , emotional regulation assess correlated clinical , neuroendocrine , neuropsychological finding . Identification biological psychosocial correlate resilience could help predict illness vulnerability follow exposure trauma could assist selection `` hardy '' subject high-risk profession .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Over 18 year age . Able give write informed consent prior participation study . NonCombat Veterans : Not currently medication PTSD medication would interfere cognitive function . Patients discontinue effective medication purpose study . Combat Veterans : Some OIF/OEF veteran may medication free time scan . However , meet criterion PTSD accord DSM IV meet severity score great equal 50 CAPS . All subject must good physical health confirm screen session ( screen protocol 01M0254 ) . If subject participate research study blood work primary MD within prior 6 month , result use instead repeat blood draw inclusion study . Subjects stable medical problem include . Resilient subject trauma control define subject meet criterion significant trauma accord `` A '' criterion PTSD ( DSMIV ) develop PTSD symptom . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Have clinically significant unstable medical disorder . Meet DSMIV criterion alcohol and/or substance abuse substance dependence within 6 month prior screen . Currently fluoxetine ( justification : washout fluoxetine could take six week ) . Currently high risk homicide suicide . A current past history Axis 1 disorder schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder . However , comorbid history Axis 1 disorder major depression , dysthymia , panic disorder include . ( Justification : approximately 70 % subject PTSD comorbid depression alcohol abuse ( Breslau 2001 ) . Restricting sample PTSD patient without depression would accurately reflect biology disorder ) . For WRMAC study : Have donate Red Cross unit blood within 60 day prior study participation .</criteria>
