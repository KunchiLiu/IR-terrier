	<brief_summary>This study compare side effect two laser treatment diabetic macular edema , common condition patient diabetes . In macular edema , blood vessel retina , thin layer tissue line back eye , become leaky retina swell . The macula , center part retina responsible fine vision , may also swell cause vision loss . Traditional laser treatment ( argon blue green , yellow ) macular swell , edema , cause scar expand possibly lead loss vision . A different laser technique , mild macular grid , use light laser burn macula may less damage eye , know . This study compare two technique information side effect use design large study whether one laser effective . Patients 18 year age old type 1 type 2 diabetes macular edema may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Blood test measure cholesterol level , hemoglobin A1C ( measure diabetes control ) , creatinine ( measure kidney function ) . - Eye photography help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Special photographs inside eye take use camera flash bright light eye . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Optical coherence tomography examine retinal thickness . The eye examine machine produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measurement repeat study determine whether retinal thicken get well , bad , stay . Participants randomly assign one two laser therapy eye macula edema . ( Patients macular edema eye receive treatments-one eye . ) For procedure , eye drop put eye numb surface , contact lens place eye laser beam application . Several visit may require additional laser treatment . The number treatment depend well working . Patients return follow-up visit 4 , 8 , 12 month first treatment , every year year 3 . During follow-up visit , response treatment evaluate repeat test several screen exam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Laser Photocoagulation Therapy Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCRnet ) form conduct clinical trial epidemiological study diabetic retinopathy . As part establishment network , necessary standardize data collection method , test procedure , treatment technique use anticipated multiple protocol conduct network . One treatment technique require standardization laser photocoagulation treatment diabetic macular edema . To accomplish goal , protocol develop enroll patient diabetic macular edema require laser treatment . Procedures conduct standardized protocol include refraction , visual acuity testing , fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) laser photocoagulation . One benefit structure protocol outcome data use standardized technique use sample size estimation future protocol . This particularly true OCT need develop standard method assess change group patient limited longitudinal data , especially group patient . The conduct study provide opportunity collect data standardize laser protocol commonly use current clinical practice also collect pilot data evaluate new laser technique . The 'current practice ' laser protocol , modify ETDRS treatment protocol , involve focal/grid photocoagulation area macular thicken leak MA , diffuse leakage nonperfusion ( modified-ETDRS technique ) . There extensive evidence support efficacy ETDRS laser photocoagulation technique treatment macular edema . The alternative technique , call mild macular grid ( MMG ) photocoagulation , provide mild grid treatment use small , widely separate burn retina 500 3000 micron ( 3500 micron temporally ) macular center . This technique may potentially fewer side effect , different edema resolution rate prevention future development macular edema discuss . The study use randomization assign patient receive one two treatment method . For protocol , participation open clinical site requisite equipment need study ophthalmologists meet criteria DRCR.net investigator . The sample size study dictate number participate site , site limited enrollment maximum four patient one patient per certify investigator , whichever great .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA SUBJECTLEVEL : 1 . Age great equal 18 year . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) . Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : 1 . Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes . 2 . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes . 3 . Documented diabetes ADA guideline . 3 . No history renal failure require dialysis renal transplant . 4 . No condition opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Patients poor glycemic control recently initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 3 month enrol . 5 . Ability willingness provide inform consent . 6 . No expectation subject move area clinical center area cover another clinical center next 12 month . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA STUDY EYE : At least one eye must meet following criterion : 1 . Best correct ETDRS visual acuity score great equal 19 letter ( approximately 20/400 good ) . 2 . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema base clinical exam within 500 micron macular center investigator believe laser photocoagulation indicate . 3 . A thickness 250 micron central subfield OR thickness 300 micron one four subfields directly adjacent central subfield OCT. 4 . No prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation macula . 5 . No prior medical treatment DME ( e.g. , intravitreal/peribulbar steroid ) . 6 . No panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within prior 4 month . 7 . No anticipated need PRP within next 4 month . 8 . No major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , intraocular surgery , scleral buckle , glaucoma filter , cornea transplant , etc . ) within prior 6 month . 9 . No Nd : YAG laser capsulotomy within prior 2 month . 10 . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An eye consider eligible ( 1 ) macular edema consider related cataract extraction ( 2 ) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface disease ( eg . vitreoretinal traction epriretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . 11 . Media clarity , papillary dilation , patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photo . 12 . No ocular condition ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity first 12 month study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome ) . Glaucoma per se exclusion . A patient may two `` study eye '' eligible time randomization . An eye become eligible randomization consider study eye purpose data analysis treatment decision although information gather eye .</criteria>
