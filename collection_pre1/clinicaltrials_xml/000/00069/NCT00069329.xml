	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness anakinra ( Kineret ) treat patient neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( NOMID ) , also know chronic infantile neurological , cutaneous arthropathy ( CINCA ) syndrome . This disease cause rash , joint deformity , brain inflammation , eye problem , learn difficulty . Immune suppress medicine commonly use treat pediatric rheumatologic disease suppress NOMID symptom , use long-term high dos , cause harmful side effect . Anakinra , approve The Food Drug Administration treat rheumatoid arthritis adult , block substance call IL-1 may important factor cause inflammation NOMID .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra Treat Patients With Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra treat child adult Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease ( NOMID ) , also know chronic infantile neurological , cutaneous arthropathy ( CINCA ) syndrome . NOMID/CINCA syndrome rare genetic systemic auto-inflammatory disease characterize triad symptom , include persistent urticaria-like skin rash , arthropathy associate patellar epiphyseal osseous overgrowth , neurological manifestation , include chronic aseptic meningitis , optic disc edema , high frequency hearing loss , mental retardation . Spontaneous genetic mutation NACHT domain CIAS1 , gene locate chromosome 1 recently identify half patient NOMID/CINCA syndrome . CIAS1 encode protein , cryopyrin associate up-regulation IL-1 production vitro , form rationale target IL-1 pathway child NOMID . During 3- week enrollment period initiate therapy , collect self/parent report daily diary data serological sample 3 occasion one week apart , determine baseline disease activity . These data may gather collaborating center . At end observation period , patient admit NIH standardize clinical evaluation initiation treatment anakinra administer 1 mg/kg/day regular daily subcutaneous injection . If patient fulfill improvement criterion 1 month , dose escalate 0.5 1 mg/kg/day increment obtain inflammatory remission . An initial withdrawal study subset 11 patient perform . The clinical improvement 3-4 month change serum amyloid A level ( SAA ) ( sensitive inflammatory marker ) treatment 3-4 month post treatment , drug safety primary clinical outcome study . To assess long-term safety efficacy , patient observe open end extension phase study . Clinical laboratory parameter use assess safety efficacy throughout trial . All patient see every 6 month annually ( calculated initiation anakinra treatment ) evaluate safety long term outcome . During open end extension phase study , patient residual clinical laboratory evidence active inflammation may dose increase 0.5 1 mg/kg/day increment maximum dose 10 mg/kg/per day achieve clinical remission . In addition , since data pharmacokinetics ( PK ) anakinra pediatric patient available dos exceed 2 mg/kg/day , plan determine PK anakinra dose escalation .</detailed_description>
