	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes mellitus define glucose intolerance variable severity onset first recognition pregnancy . The definition apply regardless insulin use treatment persistence condition pregnancy , exclude possibility unrecognized glucose intolerance overt diabetes may precede pregnancy . Pre-existing diabetes substantially contribute perinatal morbidity mortality . The association milder form gestational diabetes adverse pregnancy outcome , include morbidity macrosomia , birth trauma , neonatal hypoglycemia , remain questionable . While likely maternal glucose intolerance reflect continuum risk adverse outcome , know whether benefit identification subsequent treatment mild glucose intolerance pregnancy . This study determine whether dietary treatment ( insulin require ) mild GDM reduce frequency neonatal morbidity associate mild glucose intolerance . Participants study receive 50-gram glucose load test ( GLT ) 24 30 week ' gestation . Those positive GLT receive subsequent 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Based upon test result , woman assign 4 group . Women positive GLT abnormal OGTT randomly assign receive either nutritional counseling diet therapy ( Group 1 ) specific treatment ( Group 2a ) . Women positive GLT normal OGTT enrol Group 2b observation . Women negative GLT enrol Group 3 serve control group . Women Group 1 receive formal nutritional counseling instruct technique self blood glucose monitoring . Patients take daily blood glucose measurement see weekly study visit . The study evaluate birth outcome , include stillbirth , neonatal hypoglycemia , neonatal hyperinsulinemia , neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , birth trauma . The follow-up study examine blood sugar level treatment pregnancy influence health mother child several year later . The study also examine whether genetic link health mother child . The study visit include blood pressure , body size measurement , blood draw saliva collection , question relate mother child 's health environment .</detailed_description>
