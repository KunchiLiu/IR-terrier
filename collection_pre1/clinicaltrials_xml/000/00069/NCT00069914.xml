	<brief_summary>This study evaluate HIV infection , include CD4 cell count viral load , affect patient 's ability produce antibody response vaccination influenza ( flu ) vaccine . Earlier study show people HIV infection respond well healthy subject flu vaccine ; , n't make many antibody response vaccine . Before use current anti-HIV medication , antibody make flu vaccination HIV-positive individual relate CD4 cell count . This trial examine CD4 count amount virus blood affect much kind antibody body make flu vaccine . HIV-infected patient healthy normal volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Healthy subject serve control make sure flu vaccine work ( i.e. , stimulate production enough antibody protect flu ) , compare amount antibody make HIV-positive HIV-negative people . Candidates screen medical history blood test ( see ) . Women able child pregnancy test . Pregnant woman exclude study . Participants undergo follow procedure : 1 . Blood draw follow test : - Routine test ( complete blood count , kidney liver function , electrolyte level ) . - CD4 cell count . - HLA typing ( genetic marker immune system ) already do NIH . This test may use try identify factor associate rate progression HIV disease related condition . Determining HLA type necessary able perform certain research study . Some HLA type associate increase risk certain disease like arthritis rheumatologic problem . - Viral load ( HIV-infected patient ) . - Influenza antibody level . - B cell level . 2 . Flu vaccination 3 . Follow-up visit day , 7 , 28 , 54 vaccination following : - Review illnesses fever . - Review medication , change make . - Repeat blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol evaluate effect HIV viral load CD4 count generation influenza-specific antibody influenza-specific B cell responses HIV-infected adult . HIV-infected subject enrol receive influenza vaccine appropriate on-going USA influenza season ( Oct-March ) . Laboratory study ( include influenza titer , influenza-specific B cell frequency , CD4 count , HIV viral load ) obtain baseline ( day vaccination ) , day 7 , 28 , 54 post-vaccination . HIV-negative healthy volunteer serve control . Although risk influenza vaccine , CDC Advisory Committee Immunizations recommend influenza vaccination HIV-infected patient . The primary study risk phlebotomy inconvenience multiple visit . Subjects compensate participation study . Total enrollment study maximum 165 subject ( 132 HIV-infected individual 33 HIV-negative control ) .</detailed_description>
