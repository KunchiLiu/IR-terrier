	<brief_summary>This study determine whether dietary nitrate nitrite produce nitric oxide body dilate blood vessel patient coronary artery disease . Nitric oxide normally make endothelial cell line blood vessel . It play important role maintain normal function artery keep open prevent damage substance cholesterol blood stream . Coronary artery disease cause atherosclerosis ( harden artery build-up cholesterol scar tissue within wall artery ) . Once arteries become clogged , ability endothelium produce nitric oxide diminishes considerably may speed disease process , lead shortness breath , chest pain , increase risk heart attack stroke . Patients 21 year age old coronary artery disease may eligible study . Participants medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram ( record electrical activity heart ) , echocardiogram ( ultrasound test heart ) , treadmill exercise stress test ( see ) , meet dietitian . They hospitalize NIH Clinical Center two occasion . For 1 week admission , follow diet prescribed NIH nutritionist . The diet one admission high nitrate nitrite , diet admission low nitrate nitrite . Each admission last 4 day , participant undergo follow test : - Forearm blood flow study : Small tube place artery vein inside elbow dominant arm ( right- left-handed ) small tube place vein arm . The tube use infuse saline ( salt water ) draw blood sample . A pressure cuff place around upper part dominant arm , rubber band device call strain gauge also place around arm measure blood flow . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge rate proportional flow . Maximum grip-strength dominant arm measure dynamometer . Forearm blood flow measure blood sample draw follow time : 20 minute tubes place ; hand-grip exercise ; 4 minute exercise complete . - Brachial artery reactivity study : This test measure h ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Nitrate Nitrite Increase Nitric Oxide Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) soluable gas continuously synthesized endothelium contribute importantly vasodilator tone coronary systemic circulation activate guanylyl cyclase vascular smooth muscle , cause relaxation . Patients coronary artery disease , however , deficient synthesis increase degradation NO due endothelial damage dysfunction . Reduced NO could contribute symptom progression coronary artery disease vasoconstriction , platelet activation , inflammatory cell attachment arterial wall , increase growth cellular element vessel wall . We recently determine nitrite , form auto-oxidation NO , convert bioactive NO , part reaction deoxyheme protein exist red blood cell , also within vessel wall . An alternative source bioactive NO may via diet , nitrate reductase present oral bacteria . Nitrite may convert NO within acidic environment stomach absorb bloodstream , absorb directly convert NO bloodstream via reaction deoxyheme proteins . This study design determine contribution daily nitrate/nitrite NO adduct blood vascular dilator tone assess directly forearm indirectly treadmill exercise testing . Findings study may important clinical implication coronary artery disease , also condition associate regional endothelial dysfunction reduce endothelial NO bioactivity ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , estrogen deficiency ) , possibly account cardiovascular benefit diet rich vegetable show epidemiological survey study .</detailed_description>
