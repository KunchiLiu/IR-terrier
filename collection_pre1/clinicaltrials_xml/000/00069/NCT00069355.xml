	<brief_summary>This 10-week study examine whether propranolol , medication block activity stress hormone adrenaline noradrenaline , relieve acute stress disorder ( ASD ) symptoms persist long-term . ASD condition people develop soon exposure trauma . They may anxious , depress , trouble sleeping , startle easily , difficulty concentrate , feel though event happen . Propranolol use many year treat high blood pressure heart disease , find useful treat anxiety state social phobia migraine . Men woman 18 65 year age recently expose trauma ( 1 3 week evaluation study ) may eligible study . Candidates must diagnose ASD must mentally healthy traumatic event . They screen study medical psychiatric interview , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood urine test . Participants evaluate follow procedure : - Neuropsychological test use pen-and-paper computer test evaluate cognitive function , particularly memory , learning , attention concentration , vocabulary naming . - Emotion-related performance task determine study medication weaken emotionally arouse information block activity adrenaline noradrenaline . Subjects perform emotion-related neutral task , look picture neutral , pleasant , unpleasant content , treatment study medication ( see ) . - Traumatic script exposure : Subjects recount traumatic event cause develop ASD . The description summarize , record , play back subject . During playback , physiological response , heart rate skin conductance ( sweat ) , record use electrode tap hand chest . - Fear condition evaluate response unpleasant stimulus : Several mild electrical shock deliver wrist subject look color square . Heart rate skin conductance measure . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine brain structure . The subject lie table move MRI scanner ( narrow cylinder contain strong magnetic field ) must remain still actual scanning . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit use scan process . After evaluation , participant randomly assign receive either propranolol placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) 8 week During time see doctor week 4 week every week rest study . At end 8-week treatment period , participant undergo evaluation begin treatment ( see ) . The decision continue treatment decide base individual 's clinical condition whether receive propranolol placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effect exposure severe stress differ individual . Still , typical response pattern consist increase anxiety arousal , sleep difficulty , preoccupation re-experiencing traumatic event rule . In trauma survivor severity condition diminishes within day week . Still , case psychopathology persists , lead severe chronic PTSD . The diagnosis `` Acute Stress Disorder '' ( ASD ) introduce DSM-IV , address psychopathology 2 day 1 month exposure trauma . It show 60 % -80 % patient meet criterion ASD go suffer PTSD . Nevertheless , pharmacological trial PTSD perform , exception , chronic population . Chronic PTSD emerge treatment resistant condition , partial response treatment antidepressant anxiolytic agent . Therefore , potential benefit early treatment intervention condition could immeasurable . A principal model propose explain initiation perpetuation PTSD fear-conditioning model . It assume intrusive , involuntary , repetitive , vivid emotionally laden memory trauma pivotal development disorder . Although memory part early trauma response , healthy trauma survivor memory gradually lose intrusive quality much emotional charge , allow recovery . In PTSD process occur . The impediment recovery may result deep encode consolidation traumatic memory inhibit normal process extinction part healthy processing traumatic event . Animal human research conclusively show emotionally charge stimulation remember good less emotionally arouse information . Animal human data show catecholamine , particularly norepinephrine , augment consolidation emotional memory . Furthermore , administration catecholamine receptor blocker cancel enhance memory emotional , compare non-emotional , information . These data suggest administration catecholamine receptor blocker soon trauma may obstruct consolidation emotional memory , thereby prevent alleviate posttraumatic symptomatology . Treatment experience human limited administration propranolol single case description pilot prevention study sufficiently power allow definite inference . However , overall impression administration propranolol early time period trauma positive . In light neurophysiology preliminary data present , propose prospective , randomized placebo control study propranolol treatment ASD .</detailed_description>
