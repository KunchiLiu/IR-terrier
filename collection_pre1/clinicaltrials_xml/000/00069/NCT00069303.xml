	<brief_summary>This study examine West Nile virus ( WNV ) infection affect body . Some people infect WNV symptom . In others , symptom may vary fever headache polio-like syndrome paralysis , coma brain change like stroke . Many patient recover lasting effect , long-lasting neurological damage may die . This study collect clinical , laboratory , diagnostic , radiographic information people think WNV well understand disease . Patients 18 year age old diagnose suspect West Nile virus infection may eligible study . Patients hospitalize well enough go home undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination : A thorough history physical examination do first day study . Then , brief physical exam , include measure blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature , do day hospitalization every follow-up clinic visit ( 2 week 1 , 3 , 6 month ) . - Blood test : Blood sample collect first day study , day 7 , hospital discharge , follow-up visit determine virus remain blood affect body . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : MRI scan do within 72 hour begin study 1 month . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image brain might show abnormality brain patient WNV reveal whether abnormality predict individual recover . For procedure , patient lie table move narrow tunnel-like scanner . During procedure , contrast agent brightens image inject catheter place arm vein . - Neurological examination neurological function test : Participants test see West Nile virus affect think ability perform normal daily activity . These test do start study , day 3 7 ( also day 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 patient still hospital ) , discharge , follow-up visit . The test involve answer number question perform simple task , squeeze hand lift foot . - Patients develop weakness arm leg also follow study : 1 . Electromyography ( EMG ) study electrical activity muscle . For test , needle place muscle record electrical activity site . 2 . Nerve conduction study measure well nerve work . A small charge electricity deliver nerve affected limb , trigger muscle tighten bend . Small wire electrode attach skin measure time take nerve move electrical current one part limb another . 3 . Spinal MRI see virus affect spinal cord . Results test do patient 's local doctor ( lumbar puncture , electroencephalogram , x-rays , etc . ) request . If lumbar puncture do , small amount cerebrospinal fluid request test WNV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigation Natural History West Nile Virus Infection Patients Recently Acquired West Nile Fever Neuroinvasive Disease descriptive natural history study . Since first report WNV disease North America 1999 , geographic range expand , trend expect continue near future . There sequentially collect clinical , radiologic laboratory data patient WNV disease . Standardized data collection tool measure neurologic outcome develop . Prospectively collect data laboratory clinical event associate WNV infection need bridge gap current knowledge disease assist design well treatment . The objective study identify describe mortality morbidity , specifically neurologic functional outcome patient confirm WNV disease order characterize clinical course diverse manifestation , assess kinetics humoral immune response WNV infection , correlate response clinical outcome . Eligible patient fall two category : neuroinvasive disease cause WNV infection , WNV fever receive medical attention illness . All subject must illness onset within four month prior enrollment must laboratory confirmation diagnosis . There study visit Days 1 , 14 , 30 , 90 , 180 , 365 . Evaluations include serum cerebrospinal fluid determination WNV IgM/IgG level PCR WNV , urine PCR WNV , physical examination , serial neurologic examination , baseline MRI scan , four functional cognitive assessment validate neurologic illness adult : Barthel Index ( BI ) , Modified Rankin Scale ( MRS ) , Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS ) modify Mini-Mental Status Examination ( 3MS ) . The subset study participant develop motor weakness extremity ( y ) electromyograms , nerve conduction study spinal MRI perform . Results select clinically indicated test ( do study participant ' physician , mandate study ) record Case Record Forms ( CRFs ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients , regardless race gender , consent meet entry criterion enrol , accord follow criterion . Note : Due low case incidence lack validation neurologic score system child , enrollment restrict adult . Two cohort patient enrol : Neuroinvasive Disease West Nile Fever . Greater equal 18 year age . Documented WNV infection ( fever neuroinvasive disease ) begin within four month prior study entry . Illnesss onset define first visit medical care provider compatible symptom ( see cohort A B ) document . Local laboratory documentation WNV infection define positive IgM and/or PCR WNV serum CSF concurrent follow illness onset . Qualification Cohort A B : A. Neuroinvasive Disease Cohort : Fever ( temperature great 38 C ) document health care provider AND : least one following , document health care provider absence likely clinical explanation : Acutely alter mental status ( e.g. , disorientation , obtundation , stupor , coma ) , Other acute sign central peripheral neurologic dysfunction ( e.g. , paresis paralysis , nerve palsy , sensory deficit , abnormal reflex , generalized convulsion , abnormal movement ) , Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) pleocytosis ( white blood cell count great equal 4 per mm ( 3 ) correct red blood cell contamination CSF ) associate illness clinically compatible meningitis ( e.g. , headache stiff neck ) B . West Nile Fever Cohort : Temperature great 38 C document health care provider . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unable obtain valid informed consent . Alternate explanation ( determined investigator ) clinical finding ( structural brain lesion , cerebrovascular accident , infectious disease ) . Evidence microbial organism demonstrable gram fungal stain CSF within four month prior study entry . Investigator 's opinion patient would unable adhere protocol requirement .</criteria>
