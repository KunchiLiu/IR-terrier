	<brief_summary>Rett syndrome ( RTT ) disorder nervous system develop properly . RTT generally affect girl , boy diagnose RTT . Symptoms RTT include small brain size , poor language skill , repetitive hand movement , seizure . This study evaluate effectiveness two drug treat symptom RTT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Independent Studies Dextromethorphan Donepezil Hydrochloride Rett Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RTT neurodevelopmental disorder characterize apparently normal early development follow loss purposeful hand use , distinctive hand stereotypies , slow brain growth , loss language , respiratory irregularity , GI disturbance , gait abnormality , seizure , mental retardation . These symptom appear age 6 18 month ( stage 2 disease ) follow apparently normal development ( stage 1 ) . Subsequently , gradual stabilization severe mental retardation motor compromise ( stage 3 ) . The majority ( 70 % 80 % ) patient demonstrate mutation methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 ( MeCP2 ) gene , transcription repressor locate chromosome Xq28 . The disorder predominantly affect female , male mutation MeCP2 identify , even though many classic symptom recognize female . Recent study demonstrate increase brain N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor stag 2 3 disease . This age-specific increase glutamate level receptor contribute brain damage . This first study examine effectiveness dextromethorphan , NMDA receptor antagonist , ameliorate symptom . Participants randomize receive one three dos dextromethorphan . All participant admit hospital three day begin study . During hospitalization , participant undergo physical exam , Dexascan , MRI , EEG , behavioral assessment , laboratory testing , neuropsychological evaluation . Six month baseline assessment , participant rehospitalized 3 day similar assessment . Reduction choline acetyltransferase activity RTT patient may also contribute disturbed cortical development psychomotor retardation RTT . Therefore , second part study evaluate effect donepezil hydrochloride , inhibitor acetylcholine-esterase , acetylcholine level . This portion study begin pharmacokinetic data donepezil child available .</detailed_description>
