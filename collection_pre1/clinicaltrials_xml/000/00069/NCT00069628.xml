	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness continuous glucose monitor child Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Assess Effectiveness GlucoWatch Biographer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive control blood glucose level show substantially prevent delay complication T1DM adolescent adult . The major limitation implementation intensive glycemic control hypoglycemia . Younger child may increase risk hypoglycemia , risk/benefit ratio intensive glycemic control may less favorable population . The Diabetes Research Children Network ( DirecNet ) establish evaluate feasibility effectiveness intensive glycemic control child T1DM . This study design evaluate glycemic control , hypoglycemia , quality life use GlucoWatch G2TM Biographer ( GW2B ) versus standard care . Children study use GW2B home environment order ass GW2B help safely low blood sugar level ( measure glycosylated hemoglobin test ) , learn use GW2B affect daily live child diabetes , find drawback use GlucoWatch . As part study , participant intervention group also use second glucose monitoring device call Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) . The CGMS inserted baseline Months 3 6 ; wear three day visit . The CGMS use measure change biochemical hypoglycemia . Participants five participate center include total 200 child adolescent type 1 diabetes . Of 200 child , 100 randomize wear GW2B 100 randomize usual care without GW2B . Each patient provide personal computer weekly downloading data completion questionnaire regard hypoglycemia . Phone contact make patient Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , every 4 week review diabetes management . At Months 3 , 6 , 9 12 , follow-up visit perform measure HbA1c . The CGMS sensor insert assess hypoglycemia baseline Months 3 6 . At 6-month follow-up visit , psychosocial questionnaire also administer .</detailed_description>
