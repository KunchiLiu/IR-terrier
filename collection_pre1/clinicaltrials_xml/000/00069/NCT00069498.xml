	<brief_title>Effect Anti-Inflammatory Drug Gut Mucosa HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gastrointestinal tract body â€™ large lymphoid organ . Because contain significant number activate memory T lymphocytes , prime site HIV infection amplification . Mucosal T cell extremely vulnerable HIV infection due , part , mark increase CCR5 co-receptors . Understanding impact HIV gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) essential may provide insight profound drop mucosal lymphocytes early infection , persistence tissue viral replication set undetectable plasma viral activity , compartmentalization HIV . Pre-clinical study demonstrate mucosal compartment HIV uninfected individual characterize feature enhance vulnerability HIV infection compare blood . Once infected , mucosal response HIV inflammation . This study evaluate inflammatory response mucosal tissue HIV examine effect anti-inflammatory drug 5-aminosalicylic acid ( 5-ASA ) gut mucosa . Participants study randomly assign receive either 5-ASA placebo . Participants enrol study 8 week ; participant may elect continue 5-ASA additional 16 week . Participants four screen visit month prior begin study four study visit 8-week study . Assessments include medical interview physical exam , sigmoidoscopy mucosal biopsy , blood test .</detailed_description>
