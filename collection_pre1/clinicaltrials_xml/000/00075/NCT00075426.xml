	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety activity arsenic trioxide patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . Secondary - Determine response , term objective tumor response response duration , patient treat drug . - Determine pattern failure survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 1-2 hour day 1-5 week 1 day 1 5 week 2-8 ( course 1 ) . Beginning course 2 subsequent course , patient receive arsenic trioxide day 1 5 week 1-8 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 1 additional course therapy beyond CR . Patients achieve CR due local consolidative therapy ( surgery radiotherapy ) receive 2 additional course therapy beyond CR . Patients follow 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-30 patient accrue study within 9-18 month .</detailed_description>
