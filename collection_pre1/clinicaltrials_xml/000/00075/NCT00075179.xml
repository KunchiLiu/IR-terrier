	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn drug nesiritide ( Natrecor ) effective lowering pressure lung . The primary objective study establish Nesiritide ( Natrecor ) effective reduce pulmonary hypertension ( PHTN ) acutely measure 20 % reduction mean pulmonary arterial ( PA ) pressure . The secondary objective include : improvement pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , patient symptom , exercise tolerance , frequency toxicity , surgeon 's willingness proceed operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients high pressure lung often many symptom , shortness breath , low energy , fatigue . Decreasing pressure lung may help patient feel well . The drug nesiritide design help treat heart failure , however , may also help decrease pressure lung . Before treatment , ask question medical history medication currently take . You focus physical exam . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You ultrasound heart call echocardiogram measure pressure lungs ability breathe evaluate . With aid research nurse , 6-minute walk test able . You may stop sit time test . This test do evaluate energy level . You also ask complete questionnaire symptom . This questionnaire take long 10 minute complete . In order measure pressure lung , procedure call `` right heart catheterization '' . This procedure may do part standard care enrol study . For procedure , small tube place vein neck . A longer tube insert first tube feed vein heart . This tube use measure pressure heart lung . If pressure lung certain level , receive treatment nesiritide right heart catheterization procedure . Nesiritide give vein 30 minute . After treatment , pressure heart lung measure . You awake procedure lie flat back . An anesthetic use numb area neck tube place . The entire procedure ( include treatment ) take long 2 hour . When complete , tubes remove . Within 15 minute end procedure , 6-minute walk test ( able ) questionnaire symptom repeat breathe reassess . You also around 2 teaspoon blood collect special lab test . These test do check certain molecule blood . The blood leftover test may store freezer . Around 30 day procedure , follow-up visit schedule contact phone . At visit , complete physical exam do doctor , possibly blood work do require doctor part routine care . There additional blood work do study purpose . This investigational study . Nesiritide FDA approve commercially available treatment heart failure . However , use nesiritide study experimental . Around 20 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
