	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Allogeneic blood marrow transplant patient highly susceptible invasive fungal infection prior engraftment , due neutropenia mucosal injury . After engraftment , impairment cell mediate immunity graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) use aggressive immunosuppressive therapy , corticosteroid , leave patient vulnerable invasive fungal infection . Recipients alternate donor transplant especially susceptible due slow reconstitution cell mediate immunity . Fluconazole prophylaxis prospective randomize trial autologous allogeneic transplant recipient demonstrate reduce invasive fungal infection due yeast prior engraftment . A prolonged course fluconazole give first 75 day ( cover early post-engraftment period risk ) highly effective prevention early later yeast infection . This translated survival benefit . A recent analysis long-term outcome individual demonstrate continue benefit beyond course prophylaxis benefit survival . In another study various factor associate survival match unrelated donor transplant , fluconazole prophylaxis independent predictor overall survival multivariate analysis . Fluconazole prophylaxis find effective safe substantive drug interaction widely adopt transplant clinician . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter , prospective , comparative study fluconazole versus voriconazole prevention fungal infection allogeneic hematopoietic transplant recipient cord blood recipient child age 12 . Prior start pre-transplant conditioning regimen , participant give write informed consent screen eligibility . Participants meet entry criterion assign randomly voriconazole fluconazole within 72 hour Day 0 . Participants begin study drug Day 0 ( completion condition regimen ) . Day 0 define day infusion stem cell product complete . The study drug continue Day 100 follow transplant one criterion early withdrawal meet . Continuation study drug beyond Day 100 permit participant meet specific criterion . The development fungal infection prophylaxis classify accord definition list protocol .</detailed_description>
