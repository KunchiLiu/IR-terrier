	<brief_summary>This study examine brain depressed people function learn respond feedback . Participants perform `` probabilistic reversal learn task '' determine whether depressed people perform bad task non-depressed people sometimes receive mislead negative feedback . Right-handed healthy volunteer , people major depression currently depress previously depress people bipolar depression 18 50 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical psychiatric history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . They also interview evaluate mood , sleep , energy , work school performance , social relationship , ask answer question investigate whether history paranoia , panic attack , obsession , compulsion , suicidal thought , eat disturbance , alcohol drug abuse present . They complete rating scale depression , anxiety , negative thinking ; history alcohol tobacco use ; physical movement ; socioeconomic status ; overall level functioning ; depression type . Finally , undergo battery neuropsychological test assess general intelligence , handedness , specific cognitive ability , include memory concentration . Participants perform probabilistic reversal learn task either test room seat front computer lie undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ) . FMRI diagnostic test use strong magnet radio wave obtain picture brain structure function . For scan , subject lie narrow bed plastic-encased metal coil close head . The bed slide scanner - small tunnel 6 foot long . All subject , whether test room MRI scanner , undergo learn task follow : Two pattern present computer screen . One pattern designate `` correct '' `` incorrect . '' Subjects ask choose correct pattern try provide feedback whether response right wrong . Sometimes rule change , pattern correct wrong , vice versa , new correct pattern must choose . In addition , mislead feedback sometimes give intentionally , indicate subject chose wrong pattern fact response correct . Subjects change response sure rule change , incorrectly tell wrong . For patient undergo MRI , blood flow different area brain measure test . After test , outside scanner , participant undergo additional test attention , memory , concentration like administer screening procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FMRI Study Performance During Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When depressed subject perceive fail perform neuropsychological task performance subsequent trial becomes impaired . Elliott et al . show MDD subject far likely fail subsequent task failure one task control . This effect describe `` abnormal response ' negative feedback 'catastrophic response perceive failure . ' Murphy et al . investigate use probabilistic reversal learn task subject face occasional negative feedback actually false . On trial task subject choose one two stimulus screen , one consider correct incorrect , follow feedback . Instructions prior start task inform subject sometimes rule change previously correct stimulus incorrect , sometimes computer give incorrect feedback . They instruct switch respond sure rule actually change . MDD subject demonstrate intact acquisition reversal probabilistic learning impaired ability maintain response face mislead negative feedback . This profile impairment may relatively specific MDD , example , find subject neuropsychiatric condition . This 'abnormal response ' negative feedback may represent significant link negative affect cognitive impairment depression . During propose study functional magnetic resonance image acquire subject perform version probabilistic reversal learn task . Four group take part : MDD , bipolar depress , unmedicated MDD remission healthy control subject . These image use investigate difference neural activation four group , clarify whether specific profile behavioral response extend bipolar depressed subject assess mood state dependence effect . This would increase understand specific profile performance task neural basis abnormal response negative feedback contribute impairment cognitive performance depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject 18 50 year old . Male female subject include . All subject must able give write informed consent prior participation study . MDD Depressed Sample : Twenty five subject ( age 1850 ) male female select , primary MDD currently depress define DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD , current major depressive episode first degree relative MDD first degree relative mania , alcoholism , antisocial personality disorder . MDD Remission Sample : Twenty subject ( age 1850 ) male female select . Remission define period least three month subject take antidepressant agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 21item ; Hamilton 1960 ) score nondepressed range ( le 8 ) , one clinically significant depressive symptom . Bipolar Depressed Sample : Twenty five subject ( age 1850 ) male female select meet DSMIV criterion bipolar I II disorder currently depress phase . Healthy Control Sample : Thirty subject ( age 1850 ) male female meet criterion major psychiatric disorder select . From large sample control subject match depressed subject age , gender , handedness IQ . The control subject know first degree relative mood disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals major medical neurological disorder receive psychotropic drug medication likely influence cerebral blood flow metabolism within 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine [ Prozac ] ) , scan . Bipolar subject rapid cycle current psychosis exclude protocol . Effective treatment discontinue purpose protocol , subject identify never treat discontinue medication due lack efficacy , noncompliance , physician order reason prior study entry . Individuals meet DSMIV criterion alcohol and/or substance abuse within 1 year prior screen lifetime history substance dependence . Women childbearing potential know pregnant positive pregnancy test . Individuals experience serious suicidal ideation within past 2 month . General exclusion MRI imaging , cardiac pacemaker ferromagnetic object implant surgical intervention accident ( example : shrapnel ) .</criteria>
