	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness craniotomy stereotactic surgery ( SRS ) treatment metastatic brain tumor - tumor first develop elsewhere body travel brain . Craniotomy surgical removal tumor operation . SRS consist highly focused radiation dose tumor . Neither treatment experimental show benefit patient metastatic brain tumor . This study determine whether one treatment superior prolong patient survival . Patients 21 year age old one three metastatic brain tumor may eligible study . Participants medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , chest x-ray . They randomly assign undergo either surgery SRS . Before either procedure , patient magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . Patients schedule SRS compute tomography ( CT ) scan addition MRI . CT use X-rays obtain image brain . During CT , contrast agent inject IV tube place vein enhance CT image . For MRI CT test , patient lie table slide cylindrical scanner . The MRI usually last 45 90 minute , CT scan last 30 60 minute . Patients schedule surgery general anesthesia local anesthesia sedation . They intensive care surgery condition stable . Before discharged home , another MRI scan . The surgical suture staple remove 7 10 day surgery . Patients schedule SRS scalp numb medicine head place head frame . A CT scan do morning procedure plan treatment . Around noon , treatment , consist brief exposure radiation , administer patient position comfortably treatment couch . The treatment complete 1 2 hour , head frame remove . After brief period observation , patient discharge home . Patients return NIH follow-up visit within 4 week surgery SRS every 3 month medical history , physical examination , MRI scan , complete quality life questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Versus Radiosurgery Treat Metastatic Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Metastatic brain tumor occur frequently primary brain tumor occur approximately 25 % patient die cancer year . The main treatment goal patient brain metastasis relief neurological symptom long-term control tumor . Glucocorticoids external beam whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) comprise current standard care increase median survival one month three six month . Patients three less tumor ( great 70 % patient ) also commonly undergo surgery stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) goal lengthen survival . Two prospective randomize trial show significant survival benefit patient undergo surgical resection single tumor combination WBRT compare patient receive WBRT alone . Although prospective randomize study compare SRS WBRT WBRT alone , numerous large retrospective series reporting significant survival benefit SRS . To date , prospective randomize trial compare surgery SRS report . Despite lack rigorous data , proponent treatment modality . Those favor surgery cite ability achieve complete resection case , almost immediate relief symptom , low rate local recurrence . Those favor SRS cite equivalent degree local tumor control compare surgery , relative ease one day outpatient procedure , ability treat lesion deeper brain structure . Objectives : We plan determine prospective randomize manner surgery superior SRS prolong survival patient one three surgically accessible brain tumor . Study Population : Patients age twenty one year older one three brain metastasis assess enrollment study . Design : Patients meet eligibility criterion randomly assign undergo either surgery SRS tumor . Patients follow regularly schedule interval duration disease . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure time survival follow treatment . Among secondary outcome measure time tumor recurrence progression , neurologic sign symptom development , functional independence , steroid anticonvulsant use , overall quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must : 1. 21 year age old . 2. histologically confirm primary malignancy . 3. able undergo MRI scan brain . 4. one three intraparenchymal brain metastasis identify brain MRI scan intravenous contrast . 5. contrast enhance tumor ( ) well circumscribe less equal 4.0 cm dimension . 6. appropriate either procedure determine neurosurgeon radiation oncologist . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must : 1. tumor ( ) midbrain , pons , medulla patient undergoing surgical resection area highly likely develop significant neurological deficit death . 2. tumor within 10 millimeter optic apparatus ( nerve chiasm ) area postrema patient undergo SRS area significant risk develop permanent blindness intractable nausea . 3. poor operative candidate anesthetic point view secondary major medical illness risk undergo general anesthesia outweigh potential benefit undergoing surgical resection brain metastasis . 4. coagulopathy demonstrate abnormal prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count le 150,000 platelets/mm3 ) risk develop uncontrollable intraoperatively bleed outweighs potential benefit undergoing surgical resection brain metastasis . 5. radiographic cerebrospinal fluid specimen evidence widespread leptomeningeal metastasis neither surgery SRS useful treatment modality condition . 6. significant psychiatric impairment , opinion investigator , interfere proper administration completion protocol self explanatory . 7. acute untreated infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) patient active infection highly likely spread infection brain result craniotomy . 8. pregnant time randomize treatment general anesthesia surgery may subject fetus unacceptable risk . Also , NIH offer full obstetrical service event medical care mother and/or fetus require . Pregnant woman present brain metastasis refer facility offer OB/GYN service . 9. prisoner institutionalized individual individual risk susceptible undue influence participate research protocol free . 10. diagnosis germ cell tumor , lymphoma small cell lung cancer tumor highly radiosensitive therefore treated radiation . 11. follow : aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , implanted cardiac pacemaker auto defibrillator , cochlear implant , ocular foreign body implant [ e.g . metal shaving , retinal clip ] , insulin pump item would contraindications undergoing MRI scan . 12. allergy iodine shellfish previously allergic reaction iodinatedcontrast agent contraindication undergo contrast enhance CT brain contrast enhance CT brain require planning SRS .</criteria>
