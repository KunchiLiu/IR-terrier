	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well neoadjuvant adjuvant fenretinide work compare adjuvant fenretinide alone treat patient undergo surgical resection recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Chemotherapy drug , fenretinide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving chemotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It yet know whether neoadjuvant adjuvant fenretinide effective adjuvant fenretinide alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Adjuvant Fenretinide Compared With Adjuvant Fenretinide Alone Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgical Resection For Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare efficacy neoadjuvant adjuvant fenretinide v adjuvant fenretinide alone , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme undergo surgical resection II . Correlate serum glioma tissue pharmacology drug clinical response patient treat regimen . III . Determine whether drug induces apoptosis glioma tissue patient treat regimen . IV . Correlate apoptotic index tissue serum concentration clinical response patient treat regimen . V. Compare radiological response , overall survival , unexpected toxicity patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive neoadjuvant oral fenretinide twice daily 1 week undergo surgical resection . Arm II : Patients undergo surgical resection . Beginning two week surgery , patient receive adjuvant oral fenretinide twice daily week 1 4 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-46 patient ( 10-23 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 7-46 month .</detailed_description>
