	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy without sodium thiosulfate work prevent low platelet count treat patient malignant brain tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , cyclophosphamide , etoposide phosphate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Sodium thiosulfate may prevent low platelet count patient receive chemotherapy . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective without sodium thiosulfate prevent low platelet count treatment brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Sodium Thiosulfate Preventing Low Platelet Count While Treating Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect delay administration sodium thiosulfate rate platelet toxicity ( ie . platelet count le 20,000 ) , subject high-grade glioma undergo treatment carboplatin , cyclophosphamide etoposide/etoposide phosphate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess tumor response subject high-grade glioma undergo treatment carboplatin , cyclophosphamide etoposide/etoposide phosphate , without delayed sodium thiosulfate . II . Assess effect delay administration sodium thiosulfate granulocyte erythrocyte count , subject undergoing treatment carboplatin , cyclophosphamide etoposide/etoposide phosphate . III . Assess hearing change , , high frequency standard test range ( 4000 8000 Hertz [ Hz ] ) , high frequency standard test ( 9000 16000 Hz ) . IV . Assess quality life subject undergoing treatment carboplatin , cyclophosphamide etoposide phosphate . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) , etoposide phosphate IV , carboplatin intra-arterially ( IA ) 10 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV , etoposide phosphate IV , carboplatin IA Arm I . Patients also receive sodium thiosulfate IV 15 minute 4 8 hour carboplatin . In arm , treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
