	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine activity Gleevec^trademark ( TM ) ( imatinib mesylate ) measure progression-free survival six month . II . To determine frequency severity adverse effect Gleevec^TM cohort patient assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine distribution progression-free survival overall survival . II . To estimate objective response rate ( partial complete response define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) . III . To determine effect prognostic factor initial performance status histological grade . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine level expression v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( c-KIT ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 ( AKT2 ) , phosphorylated ( p ) -AKT2 archive , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded primary tumor collect prior initiation first-line chemotherapy OUTLINE : Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
