	<brief_title>3-AP Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Recurrent Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy 3-AP ( Triapine® ) , term objective response rate , patient previously untreated locally recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Secondary - Determine adverse event tolerability drug patient . - Determine time disease progression overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive 3-AP ( Triapine® ) IV 2 hour day 1-4 15-18 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course ( stable patient ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 1 additional course documentation CR . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) receive 2 additional course documentation stable PR . Patients follow every 4 week relapse every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
