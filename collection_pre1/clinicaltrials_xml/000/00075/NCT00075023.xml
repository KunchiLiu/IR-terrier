	<brief_summary>This study design conduct 2 part . The first part pilot study test effect topical thalidomide gel 20mg applied 3 oral ulcer patient develop oral chronic graft-versus-host-disease ( cGVHD ) -related ulcerative stomatitis follow allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . Chronic GVHD may relate increased level cytokine call TNF-alpha ( TNFa ) follow HSCT . Thalidomide 's anti-inflammatory effect may lower TNFa level , lead heal oral ulcer , decrease oral pain . If pilot study successful , second part study do . This test effect 0.1 % ( 20mg ) thalidomide mouthwash treat oral cGVHD-related stomatitis patient follow allogeneic HSCT . Applying thalidomide directly GVHD-related mouth ulcer gel form entire oral cavity mouthwash form rather take pill form may reduce amount drug enters blood stream cause less side effect . In pilot study , participant randomly assign receive thalidomide gel 20mg placebo ( identical gel thalidomide ) use 4 time day 4 week . In mouthwash study , participant randomly assign receive 0.1 % 20mg thalidomide mouthwash placebo ( identical mouth rinse thalidomide ) use 4 time day 4 week . Participants undergo follow procedure begin experimental treatment , week 4 week , approximately 8 week first visit : - Interview current medication use alcohol cigarette - Self-report mouth throat pain - Oral examination stomatitis rating , oral ulcer ( ) measurement - Quality life questionnaire ( repeat week 8 study ) - Mouth photography measure record oral ulcer response treatment - Saliva sample look proinflammatory cytokine ( small protein ) , include TNFa - Oral ulcer exudate collect filter paper obtain fluid measure TNFa level - Gentle swab oral ulcer culture virus , fungus , bacteria may present - Small punch biopsy area near ulcer affect area check presence TNFa ( repeat week 4 study ) - Blood sample monitor TNFa level - A urine pregnancy test woman able child ( repeat week 2 , 4 , 8 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Topical Thalidomide Treat Chronic Graft-Versus-Host-Disease Related Stomatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oncology patient undergo allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) frequently experience allo-immune condition term graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) . The pathogenesis GVHD derive immune attack mediate donor T-cells recognizing antigen express normal tissue patient . This condition occur HSCT rather autologous BMT disparity minor histocompatibility antigen donor recipient , inherit independently HLA gene ( Lazarus , Vogelsang , Rowe , 1997 ) . GVHD may conceptualize cytokine storm stem outpouring endogenous cytokine result many tissue effect ( Lazrarus et al , 1997 ) . Oral chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) present tissue atrophy erythema , lichenoid change ( hyperkeratotic stria , patch , plaque , papule ) pseudomembranous ulceration typically occur buccal labial mucosa lateral tongue , mucoceles due inflammation minor salivary gland , xerostomia ( Lloid , 1995 ) . The ulcerative phase often lead cascade negative sequela include oropharyngeal pain , critical treatment alteration cessation , diminish capacity food intake , decrease quality life . Optimal treatment strategy cGVHD-related ulcerative stomatitis relate oropharyngeal pain establish . Therefore , critical need examine pathogenesis evaluate intervention cGVHD-related ulcerative stomatitis relate acute oropharyngeal pain randomize controlled clinical trial set advance science cancer treatment-related oral complication improve patient care . We hypothesize mechanisms tissue injury occur mucosal level lead cGVHD-related stomatitis similar type stomatitis , cancer chemotherapy-related stomatitis aphthous stomatitis , therefore amenable treatment anti-inflammatory strategy . Therefore , purpose study elucidate role inflammation GVHD-related ulcerative stomatitis test efficacy topical thalidomide gel resolution cGVHD-related stomatitis relate oropharyngeal pain . The action thalidomide , include inhibition release tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFa ) resultant alteration inflammatory cascade , may provide insight role local mucosal inflammation cGVHD-related stomatitis . This study conduct two part . The first part pilot study test effect thalidomide gel 20mg patient developed oral cGVHD-related ulcerative stomatitis follow allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . Stomatitis inflammation line throat mouth may lead ulcer pain mouth throat . GVHD - condition donor cell see patient 's cell foreign mount immune response - may relate increased level substance call TNF-alpha ( TNFa ) follow HSCT . Thalidomide 's anti-inflammatory effect may lower TNFa level decrease cGVHD-related stomatitis oral pain patient . If pilot study successful , second part study conduct . The second part study test effect 0.1 % ( 20mg ) thalidomide mouthwash treat oral cGVHD-related stomatitis patient follow allogeneic HSCT . Applying thalidomide directly GVHD-related mouth ulcer gel form entire oral cavity mouthwash form rather take thalidomide pill form may reduce amount drug enters blood stream cause few side effect . Patients 18 80 year age receive HSCT develop oral cGVHD-related stomatitis confirm surgical biopsy may eligible study . The eligible female participant pilot study woman unable child . In pilot study , participant randomly assign receive thalidomide gel 20mg placebo ( gel thalidomide ) use four time day 4 week . In mouthwash study , participant randomly assign receive 0.1 % 20mg thalidomide mouthwash placebo ( mouth rinse thalidomide ) use four time day 4 week . Participants follow data collect undergo follow procedure begin experimental treatment , week 4 week , approximately 8 week first visit . - Interview current medication use alcohol cigarette . - Self-report mouth throat pain rating . - Oral examination stomatitis rating - Quality life questionnaire ( The questionnaire repeat week 8 study. ) . - Mouth photography measure record oral ulcer response treatment . - Saliva sample look proinflammatory cytokine ( small protein ) , include TNFa . - Oral ulcer exudate collect filter paper obtain fluid measure TNFa level . - Gentle swabbing oral ulcer culture virus , fungus , bacteria may present . - Small punch biopsy area near ulcer affect area check presence TNFa . ( The punch biopsy repeat week 4 study . ) - Blood sample monitor TNFa level . - A urine pregnancy test woman able child . ( The pregnancy test repeat week 2 , 4 , 8 . )</detailed_description>
