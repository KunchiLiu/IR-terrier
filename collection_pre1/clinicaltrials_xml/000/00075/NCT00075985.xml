	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective : ( 1 ) quantify absolute risk major hemorrhagic complication associate anticoagulation AF among octogenarian ; ( 2 ) determine risk severity major hemorrhagic complication increase octogenarian compare young patient maintain warfarin AF adjustment potential confounders ; ( 3 ) explore predictor major hemorrhagic complication among octogenarian maintain warfarin AF ; ( 4 ) determine effectiveness utilize VA Intranet collect manage patient data conduct longitudinal study . Research Plan : This prospective observational cohort study process enrol follow patient warfarin therapy utilize anticoagulation clinic VA hospital across US . There currently 14 site actively enrol patient study . For octogenarian enrol randomly select patient AF young 80 year age clinic receive warfarin approximately duration enrol . Methods : Baseline data collect prospective follow-up data capture every 3 month . Based duration previous warfarin therapy , octogenarians AF assemble either survivor inception cohort . For analysis , patient two week less prior warfarin exposure constitute inception cohort . The primary endpoint major hemorrhage define Consensus Recommendations publish American College Chest Physicians . Data collect allow verification fatal bleeds verification resultant morbidity non-fatal major bleeds . Endpoints adjudicate hemostasis expert blind age patient . Since observational study , report event death relate result study intervention . Data development new comorbidities , medication , average daily warfarin dose discontinuation degree anticoagulation measure International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) also collect . All aspect study conduct VA Intranet . Participating site utilize Intranet transmit baseline follow-up data form study patient , remove need detailed paper correspondence . Sites also opportunity view edit previously submit form , view study manual , download paper copy data collection form , utilize bulletin board post question comment study . Site Investigators Coordinators access Intranet terminal facility present unique study menu bulletin board . To prevent unauthorized access data , Site Investigators Coordinators assign Electronic Signature ( login name password ) order access data form Intranet . All data enter submit directly study database , obviate need subsequent transcription data reduce opportunity error . Additionally , electronic data collection design reject form predefined critical field complete value fall outside field parameter . Data verification do real-time site coordinator enter invalid value require either skip field re-enter correct data proceed . This greatly reduce time consume search patient record retrieve data enter incorrectly originally . Findings : Our goal enroll follow total 700 patient 5 year recruitment . To date , 16 site enrol total 502 patient study , 251 `` survivor '' cohort , 24 `` inception '' cohort , 227 `` control '' cohort . There 66 report death 54 hemorrhagic event , 23 confirm major bleeds adjudication committee . The cohort date accumulate total 824 person-years observation .</detailed_description>
