	<brief_summary>The main goal study assess pharmacodynamic effect different frequent dos Replagal compare standard dose regimen . Replagal genetically engineer form alpha-Galactosidase A , enzyme normally break fatty substance call globotriaosylceramide ( Gb ( 3 ) ) . In patient Fabry disease , GB ( 3 ) function properly therefore build cause problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . Male patient 18 year age old Fabry disease dialysis receive kidney transplant may eligible study . Participants randomly assign receive one follow five regimen Replagal infusion , give vein 20 80 minute : 0.1 mg/kg body weight every week 0.2 mg/kg body weight every week 0.2 mg/kg body weight every week 0.4 mg/kg body weight every week 0.4 mg/kg body wieght every week In US , infusion give NIH Clinical Center . Vital sign measure , immediately , 1 hour infusion . Baseline evaluations do inpatient outpatient basis . Baseline test include check vital sign ( temperature , respiratory rate , pulse rate , blood pressure ) ; physical examination ; laboratory test ; review treatment side effect . Evaluations also do every infusion visit , 1 week 1 month last infusion . Safety evaluations do periodically include vital sign measurement , physical examination , blood urine test , review drug side effect , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , Holder monitor ( 2 hour ECG ) , QSART ( NIH ) . The QSART ( quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test ) measure amount sweat particular area skin , mostly forearm . For test , cup partly fill liquid strap arm . A weak electric current turn , stimulate sweat gland , amount sweat produce measure . There tingle sensation current turn . Patients complete study offer opportunity receive Replagal 6 month extension study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Dosing Regimen Replagal Treat Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The goal study assess pharmacodynamic effect alternative weekly every two week dose regimen Replagal ( agalsidase alfa ) comparison current standard Replagal treatment regimen 0.2 mg/kg give intravenously every two week . STUDY POPULATION : Hemizygous male Fabry disease 18 year age old . DESIGN : This randomize , open-label study ass pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics five different dose regimen enzyme replacement therapy Replagal . The effect dose well dose frequency evaluate compare standard Replagal regimen . OUTCOME MEASURES : The pharmacodynamic parameter assess plasma globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) . The hypothesis test role frequency ( weekly ) and/or dose ( 0.1 0.4 mg/kg ) Replagal play pharmacodynamics measure reduction plasma Gb3 compare current dose frequency 0.2 mg/kg give every two week . Clinical parameter include sweating , heart rate variability , proteinuria , severity neuropathic pain , pain anti-diarrheal medication usage , frequency severity abdominal pain , frequency diarrhea also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject male hemizygote , age 18 year old , confirm diagnosis Fabry Disease . Diagnosis Fabry disease may confirm proof mutation alphaGalactosidase A gene compatible Fabry Disease and/or deficiency alphaGalactosidase A ( less 4.0 nmol/mL/hour plasma serum le 8 % average mean normal leukocyte ) . Subject must one clinical manifestation Fabry disease include neuropathic pain , angiokeratoma , corneal verticillata , cardiomyopathy , hypo anhydrosis , abdominal pain and/or diarrhea , serum creatinine great 1.0 mg/dl proteinuria great 300 mg/24 hour . Subject must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent form relevant aspect study explain discuss subject . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject previously treat Replagal enzyme replacement therapy Fabry Disease . If patient previously treat Replagal another enzyme replacement therapy must therapy least 30 day must Day14 antibody blood sample drawn test must negative antiagalsidase alfa IgG IgE antibody experience prior severe infusion reaction prior enzyme replacement therapy . Subject enrol another clinical investigative study past 30 day . Subject unable give inform consent deem unable comply aspect clinical trial . Subject plasma Gb ( 3 ) draw Day 14 less 4.0 nmol/mL . Subject undergoing dialysis receive renal transplant . Subjects tolerate study procedure unable unwilling travel study center require protocol . Subjects intercurrent medical condition would render unsuitable study ( e.g . HIV , diabetes ) confound assessment effect experimental therapy adverse event . Subjects opinion investigator ( whatever reason ) think unsuitable study .</criteria>
