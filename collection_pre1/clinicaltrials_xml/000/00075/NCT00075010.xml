	<brief_summary>Valproic acid medication currently use prevention seizure , bipolar disorder , migraine headache . Researchers hope may improve effect decitabine . Decitabine chemotherapy drug know activity leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Decitabine Valproic Acid Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study show synergy demethylating agent histone deacetylase inhibitor . It show DNA methylation histone deacetylation work together affect gene expression . Therefore , drug inhibit DNA methylation inhibit histone deacetylase reactivate silence gene combination well individually . Decitabine ( 5 aza-2'deoxycytidine ) , drug produce mark DNA hypomethylator , demonstrate antileukemic activity low dos . There several drug show histone acetylase activity . One valproic acid use safely many year anti-seizure medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . FOR PHASE I COMPONENT OF THE STUDY : Patients refractory relapse : acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) eligible . Patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) eligible fludarabine base therapy fail . Patients chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) eligible document hematologic resistance imatinib mesylate achieve lose cytogenetic response imatinib mesylate 12 month therapy . 2 . Untreated patient old 60 year age AML MDS refuse eligible frontline chemotherapy , eligible . 3 . Performance status =/ &lt; 2 ECOG scale . 4 . Signed informed consent indicate patient aware investigational nature study keep policy UTMDACC . 5 . Age &gt; 2 year . 6 . Patients must chemotherapy 2 week prior enter study recover toxic effect therapy , unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . Use hydroxyurea patient rapidly proliferative disease allow first two week therapy . Imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) anagrelide must also stop 2 week prior enter study . 7 . Adequate liver function ( bilirubin &lt; 2mg % , SGPT &lt; 3 x ULN ) renal function ( creatinine &lt; 2mg % ) . 8 . Women childbearing potential must practice contraception .

INCLUSION OF PHASE II PORTION OF THE STUDY : As phase I portion patient AML highrisk MDS ( blast &gt; = 10 % ) , include untreated patient older 60 year age AML MDS refuse eligible frontline chemotherapy , eligible portion study . 1 . Nursing pregnant female exclude . 2 . Patients active uncontrolled infection exclude . 3 . Patients know ornithine transcarbamylase disorder , history unexplained coma family history ornithine transcarbamylase disorder exclude study . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , pancreatitis , psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Patients history hepatitis B , C , alcoholic liver disease evidence hepatopathy exclude . 6 . Patients already receive valproic acid receive anticonvulsivants exclude . 7 . Untreated patient young 60 year candidate study .</criteria>
