	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6 month progression free survival rate patient progressive , advanced neuroendocrine tumor treat ZD1839 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective tumor response rate . II . Progression free survival time progression . III . Improvement circulate hormone level . IV . Overall survival V. We explore molecular characterization tumor attempt understand role EGFR expression inhibition ZD1839 neuroendocrine tumor . The measurement perform pretreatment post-treatment tumor biopsy possible : EGFR expression gene amplification ( IHC EGFR phosphorylated EGFR , ISH gene amplification ) ; Activation Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway ( IHC phosphorylated MAPK ) ; Cell proliferation ( Ki-67 staining ) ; Apoptosis ( TUNEL assay ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease type ( carcinoid v islet cell neuroendocrine tumor ) . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 2 year study entry .</detailed_description>
