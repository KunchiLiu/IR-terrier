	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give 3-AP together gemcitabine work treat patient unresectable metastatic bile duct gallbladder cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , 3-AP gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . 3-AP may help gemcitabine kill cancer cell make sensitive drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triapine Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Gallbladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate combination triapine gemcitabine patient primary tumor biliary duct gall bladder . II . To assess toxicity recovery toxicity patient biliary duct gall bladder tumor treat combination triapine gemcitabine . III . To determine survival progression free survival patient biliary gall bladder tumor treat combination triapine gemcitabine . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord bilirubin level ( normal v abnormal ) . Patients receive 3-AP ( Triapine ) IV 4 hour follow gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 1 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
