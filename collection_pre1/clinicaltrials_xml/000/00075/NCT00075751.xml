	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine bortezomib gemcitabine carboplatin treat patient advanced recurrent non-small cell lung cancer previously treat chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine carboplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Bortezomib may also help gemcitabine carboplatin kill tumor cell make cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine , Carboplatin , Bortezomib Advanced Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival chemo-naÏŠve patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat combination gemcitabine , carboplatin PS-341 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( confirm plus unconfirmed , complete plus partial ) , subset patient measurable disease , progression-free survival quantitative toxicity group patient treat regimen . II . To investigate exploratory manner , association level hypoxia-induced secreted protein tumor DNA plasma level apoptosis-associated protein tumor tissue , change level PS-341 modulate protein peripheral white blood cell patient response survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 , carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 , bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may continue receive bortezomib alone schedule 1 year discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 6 month 3 year registration . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 99 patient accrue study within 5 month .</detailed_description>
