	<brief_summary>The study design Phase III , multi-center trial tandem autologous transplant versus strategy autologous follow Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant . Study subject biologically assign appropriate arm depend availability HLA-matched sibling . There nested randomize phase III trial observation versus maintenance therapy follow second autologous transplant patient tandem autologous transplant arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , characterize malignant plasma cell proliferation , bone destruction , immunodeficiency , disease median age diagnosis approximately 65 year . It responsible 1 percent cancer-related death Western Countries . Conventional treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy non-curative improve quality life duration survival . Attempts cure myeloma high-dose therapy follow autografting allografting largely fail due combination relapse disease transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) . High-dose therapy autologous transplantation safe low TRM ( less 5 % ) , associate continue nearly universal risk disease progression relapse . Even , autologous transplantation superior continue conventional chemotherapy . Recent data indicate tandem autologous transplant superior single procedure . Even approach , patient remain risk relapse additional approach need . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall study design biologic assignment , base availability HLA-matched sibling , one two treatment strategy MM patient . Patients without HLA-matched sibling undergo tandem autologous transplant . Patients HLA-matched sibling undergo autologous transplant follow non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant . In addition , tandem autologous transplant recipient randomize either observation one year maintenance therapy begin follow second autologous transplant . The large number MM patient without HLA-matched sibling enables u evaluate role maintenance therapy follow tandem autologous transplant .</detailed_description>
