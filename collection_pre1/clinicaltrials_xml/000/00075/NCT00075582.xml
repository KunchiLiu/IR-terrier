	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study well combination chemotherapy radiation therapy work treat patient newly diagnose low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine , dactinomycin , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vincristine , Dactinomycin , Cyclophosphamide With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Low-Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine failure-free survival patient newly diagnose low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma treat vincristine ( V ) , dactinomycin ( A ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , radiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine local control rate patient treated regimen . II . Determine rate second-look surgery patient bulk residual tumor diagnosis ( clinical group III ) proportion second-look surgery render patient treated regimen tumor-free microscopic tumor evaluate pathologic significance residual tumor . III . Determine local control rate patient clinical group III disease treat response-adjusted radiotherapy dose second-look surgical resection . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment regimen accord disease stage clinical group . REGIMEN I ( subset 1 patient ) [ close accrual 08/13/2010 : Patients receive VAC chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV 1 minute day 1 week 1-9 dactinomycin IV 1 minute cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 ; VA chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV 1 minute day 1 week 13-21 dactinomycin* IV 1 minute day 1 week 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 ; radiotherapy** , 5 day week , begin week 13 continue 4-7 week , depend prescribe dose . REGIMEN II ( subset 2 patient ) [ close accrual 9/23/2011 ] : Patients receive VAC chemotherapy radiotherapy** regimen I VA chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV 1 minute day 1 week 13-21 , 25-33 , 37-45 dactinomycin* IV 1 minute day 1 week 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 34 , 37 , 40 , 43 , 46 . Patients clinical group III disease may undergo second-look surgery week 13 follow response-adjusted radiotherapy , continue VA* chemotherapy . In regimen , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *For regimen , dactinomycin omit radiotherapy . NOTE : **Clinical Group I tumors Clinical Group III uterine/cervix primary disease negative node undergone complete resection ( i.e . hysterectomy ) Week 13 receive radiotherapy Week 13 Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
