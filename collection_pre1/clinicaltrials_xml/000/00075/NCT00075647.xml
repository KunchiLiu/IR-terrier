	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival 6 month patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer treat CCI-779 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time progression , progression-free survival , overall survival , tumor response rate patient measurable disease treat drug . II . Correlate biomarkers response clinical response patient treated drug . III . Determine safety toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute weekly . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within 13 month .</detailed_description>
