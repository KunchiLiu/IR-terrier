	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study total-body irradiation ( TBI ) fludarabine phosphate see work compare TBI alone follow donor stem cell transplant treat patient hematologic cancer . Giving low dos chemotherapy , fludarabine phosphate , radiation therapy donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . The donated stem cell may replace patient 's immune system cell help destroy remain cancer cell ( graft-versus-tumor effect ) . Sometimes transplanted cell donor also make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happen . It yet know whether TBI follow donor stem cell transplant effective without fludarabine phosphate treat hematologic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total-Body Irradiation With Without Fludarabine Phosphate Followed By Donor Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival 3 year condition 200 cGy TBI alone vs. fludarabine ( fludarabine phosphate ) /200 cGy TBI heavily pretreated patient hematologic malignancy low/moderate risk graft rejection . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare non-relapse mortality 1-year conditioning patient receive TBI alone vs. fludarabine/TBI . II . To compare incidence graft rejection patient receive TBI alone vs. fludarabine/TBI . III . To compare incidence grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) chronic extensive GVHD . IV . To compare rate disease progression and/or relapse-related mortality . V. To compare immune reconstitution risk infection . OUTLINE : NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) day -4 -2 . Patients undergo low-dose TBI day 0 . ARM II : Patients undergo low-dose TBI day 0 . ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION ( PBSCT ) : After TBI , patient undergo PBSCT day 0 . IMMUNOSUPPRESSION : Patients receive cyclosporine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -3 56 absence GVHD . Patients evidence GVHD day 56 begin cyclosporine taper continue taper day 180 . Patients evidence disease progression evidence GVHD prior day 56 receive taper dos cyclosporine 2 week . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) PO BID day 0-28 absence GVHD . If treatment GVHD require day 28 , MMF continue steroid taper begin . Patients follow periodically 1.5 year annually 5 year post-transplantation .</detailed_description>
