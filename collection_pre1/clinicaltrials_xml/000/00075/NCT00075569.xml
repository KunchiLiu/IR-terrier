	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development cancer treat early cancer . SGN-00101 may effective preventing development cervical cancer patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well SGN-00101 immunotherapy work prevent cervical cancer patient grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGN-00101 Immunotherapy Treating Patients With Grade III Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine rate regression 4-7 month patient grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN III ) treat SGN-00101 immunotherapy . - Compare rate regression 4-7 month expect outcome patient immunized vaccine . - Determine toxic effect recovery possible toxic effect vaccine patient . Secondary - Determine induction cell-mediated immune response human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E7 peptide treatment patient immunized vaccine - Correlate regression disease enhance immunologic response patient immunized vaccine . - Correlate seropositivity HPV-16 virus-like particle ( VLP16 ) vaccine-induced regression CIN III patient immunized vaccine . - Determine efficacy vaccine patient whose CIN III associate HPV-16 infection v HPV type . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . All patient receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously monthly month 1-3 ( total 3 vaccination ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 1 : Four month first vaccination , patient undergo therapeutic diagnostic loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) core biopsy . - Group 2 : Six month first vaccination , patient undergo therapeutic diagnostic LEEP core biopsy . Patients group 1 follow 12 month patient group 2 follow 14 month first vaccination . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 66 patient ( 36 group 1 30 group 2 ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
