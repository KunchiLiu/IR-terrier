	<brief_title>Anti-HIV Drug Regimens With Without Protease Inhibitors Drug Level Monitoring HIV Infected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infect adolescent may significantly high capacity immune reconstitution follow highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , compare adult . Despite advantage , HIV infect adolescent often reluctant get proper medical care , follow doctor appointment , adhere medication schedule regimens necessary keep infection control . Lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , PI , efavirenz ( EFV ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , long half-lives make ideal drug adolescent population , forgive patient miss sleep dos . The availability once-daily dose LPV/r reduce pill burden offer flexibility medication scheduling , also help promote treatment adherence among age group . This study examine effectiveness two HAART regimen , one PI LPV/r two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , NNRTI EFV two NRTIs . The efficacy therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) subsequent dose adjustment also assess regimen . Patients enrol study 96 week randomly assign one two group . Group 1 receive LPV/r 2 NRTIs . Treatment naive patient Group 1 option receive either once-daily dosing twice-daily dose LPV/r . Treatment experience patient receive twice-daily dosing LPV/r . Patients once-daily dose LPV/r become intolerant regimen permit switch twice-daily dose . Group 2 receive EFV 2 NRTIs . All patient independently simultaneously randomly assign undergo either TDM subsequent dose adjustment necessary TDM . Patient medical history physical exam conduct screening , entry , Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , every 8 week Week 48 , every 12 week thereafter . Blood collection occur study visit . Self-reported pill count MEMS TrackCap reading ( LPV/r EFV bottle ) note visit . Patients ask complete adherence questionnaire select study visit . Patients enrol PACTG 390 ( Different Combination Regimens Treatment-Switching Guidelines HIV Infected Children 18 Years Age Younger ) encourage coenroll simultaneously study PACTG 219C ( Long-Term Effects HIV Exposure Infection Children ) .</detailed_description>
