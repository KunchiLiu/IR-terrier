	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate PS-341 ( bortezomib ) induction patient high risk , newly diagnose multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival . II . To explore response rate patient relapse progress maintenance return induction schedule . III . To explore duration second response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore possible differential response PS-341 previously describe adverse prognostic indicator . II . To explore specific gene expression profile ( GEP ) may predict response therapy agent combination agent use treatment newly diagnose myeloma . III . To explore specific post-treatment gene expression profile ( GEP ) patient receive 4 cycle therapy achieve minimal response well . IV . To develop relevant information immune system multiple myeloma patient treat PS-341 . OUTLINE : INDUCTION TREATMENT : Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE TREATMENT : Patients complete induction treatment without progressive disease receive bortezomib IV day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REINDUCTION TREATMENT : Patients progress maintenance treatment receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
