	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect Valeriana officinalis ( Valerian ) improve quality sleep patient cancer receive adjuvant therapy . Secondary - Determine safety therapy , term frequency severity adverse event , patient . - Determine effect therapy degree anxiety , fatigue , activity daily live patient . OUTLINE : This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type adjuvant treatment ( radiotherapy v parenteral chemotherapy vs oral therapy v combine modality ) , age ( 40 vs 41 55 v 56 70 v 70 ) , numerical analogue scale sleep difficulty ( mildly impair sleep quality [ 4-7 ] v moderate severely impaired sleep quality [ 8-10 ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral Valeriana officinalis ( Valerian ) daily 8 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily 8 week . After 8 week treatment , patient arm I may receive Valeriana officinalis ( Valerian ) additional 8 week patient arm II may cross arm I. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , functional outcome sleep , brief fatigue inventory , profile mood state questionnaire complete baseline week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 2 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 220 patient ( 110 per treatment arm ) accrue study within approximately 11-22 month .</detailed_description>
