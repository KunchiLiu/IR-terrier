	<brief_summary>This small , preliminary study examine whether multiple infusion infliximab ( RemicadeÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) control inflammation patient active scleritis . The sclera tough white outer coat enclose eyeball . Infliximab combination part human part mouse proteins block natural body protein call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . TNF appear involve scleritis , stop action may help reduce inflammation disease . The drug approve Food Drug Administration treat Crohn 's disease rheumatoid arthritis . Patients 18 year age old active non-infectious scleritis may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Eye examination , include vision test examination retina ( back part eye ) sclera blood vessel . - Questionnaire vision daily activity . - Tuberculin skin test . - Pregnancy test : Women child test pregnancy study week 0 , 14 , 30 , 38 , 46 . - Infliximab treatment : Infliximab infuse 2-hour period needle vein , usually arm . The patient 's vital sign check patient begin infusion start leave clinic . After first two infusion , disease remain quiet , scleritis medication attempt reduced half original dose 8 12 week possibly nothing patient continue well . Patients receive maximum 9 infusion 30-week period . - Blood draw : About 4 tablespoon blood drawn visit test number type cell blood check sign inflammation side effect study medicine . Patients see NEI clinic infusion check response therapy . This include 13 clinic visit 46 week , follow : every 2 week first 2 week , every 4 week thereafter total 30 week infusion , every 4 week 16 additional week . Patients may stop therapy scleritis control 10 week study period ; develop flare inflammation initial control active scleritis ; vision loss large ; medication increase medicine add control scleritis . Patients whose vision decrease minimally , stay , improves may remain study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose investigate possible efficacy multiple infliximab infusion control inflammation participant present active scleritis . This perform use open-label pilot study . Subjects receive 5mg/kg intravenous infusion infliximab 0 , 2 , 6 10 week . After initial infusion , participant may contine receive 5 mg/kg dose infusion may receive 8 mg/kg dose infusion depend treamtent response . Treatment response define decrease inflammation least 2 step scale grade 0-4 , decrease 0 assessed week 14 . A combination thse two dose infusion ( 5 mg/kg 8 mg/kg ) give remainder study accord set schedule . The primary outcome ability control active scleritis define least 2-step decrease sleral inflammation , scleritis within 14 week initiate infliximab therapy . Secondary outcome amount reduction concomitant immunosuppressive medication ( measure use grade scale Section 4.5.2 ) , change pain , redness ( measure use visual analogue scale ) , photophobia , change visual acuity ( change 10 letter baseline best-corrected visual acuity consider clinically significant ) , typical time flare , number flare time flare study .</detailed_description>
