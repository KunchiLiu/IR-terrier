	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sorafenib together gemcitabine work treat patient recurrent refractory ovarian cancer primary peritoneal cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving sorafenib gemcitabine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . Objective tumour response rate ( complete plus partial response define RECIST criterion ) woman recurrent refractory advance ovarian primary peritoneal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Median survival time . II . 6-month survival rate . III . Objective tumour stable disease rate . IV . Response duration . V. Toxicity . VI . Time disease progression . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Course 1 ( 56 day ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-56 gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 . Course 2 subsequent course ( 28 day ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete partial response receive least 2 additional course beyond document response . Patients stable respond disease receive least 6 course may discontinue gemcitabine continue sorafenib alone disease progression .</detailed_description>
