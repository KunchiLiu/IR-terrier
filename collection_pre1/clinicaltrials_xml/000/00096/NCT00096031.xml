	<brief_title>S0415 Cetuximab Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 6-month overall survival patient metastatic adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction treat cetuximab second-line therapy . - Determine response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) , time progression , time treatment failure patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Correlate , preliminarily , gene expression germline polymorphism enzymes gene involve epidermal growth factor receptor pathway , DNA repair , angiogenesis time progression , response , overall survival , toxic effect , time treatment failure patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year date study registration . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-55 patient accrue study within 6-14 month .</detailed_description>
