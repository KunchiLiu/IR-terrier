	<brief_summary>This study design Phase II/III , multi-center trial , compare two transplant strategy determine whether non-myeloablative allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT ) improve long-term progression-free survival compare autologous HSCT . Recipients biologically assign appropriate treatment arm depend availability Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) match sibling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Donor Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( BMT CTN 0202 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although patient follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) typically experience relatively indolent course , disease rarely curable conventional chemotherapy . Patients follicular NHL usually treat symptom require palliation bulky disease exist since survival advantage show compare administer conventional treatment initial diagnosis . While patient achieve remission initial chemotherapy , continuous pattern relapse occur , result progressively short remission duration . Additionally , increase response rate confer anthracycline-containing regimen translate improved survival thus median survival time 6 10 year significantly impact last decade . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall study design comparison two treatment arm determine biologic assignment , base availability HLA-matched sibling , patient diagnose relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients without HLA-matched sibling receive autologous HSCT . Patients HLA-matched sibling receive non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT . The overall study design biologic assignment , base availability HLA-matched sibling , one two strategy improve outcome follicular lymphoma patient chemosensitive disease . All patient undergo cytoreduction cyclophosphamide 4 gm/m^2 rituximab 375 mg/m^2 x 2 dos . Rituximab give two dos , approximately 1 week apart , cyclophosphamide administer day first dose rituximab . Patients assign autologous arm hematopoietic stem cell mobilize cytoreductive regimen . Patients HLA-matched sibling undergo non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT . Pre-transplant conditioning consist fludarabine 30 mg/m^2/day cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m^2/day x 3 day rituximab 375 mg/m^2/day Days -13 -6 pre-HSCT Days +1 +8 post-HSCT . The immunosuppressive regimen consist tacrolimus methotrexate ( MTX ) control graft-versus-host host-versus-graft reaction . Patients without HLA-matched sibling collect adequate autologous hematopoietic cell graft , define least 2.0 * 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg , receive preparative regimen total body irradiation ( TBI ) 1200 cGy Carmustine ( BCNU ) 15 mg/kg . In addition , VP-16 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg give autologous preparative regimen . Post-autologous HSCT therapy rituximab 375 mg/m^2 weekly x 4 dos commence Days 42-75 post-HSCT .</detailed_description>
