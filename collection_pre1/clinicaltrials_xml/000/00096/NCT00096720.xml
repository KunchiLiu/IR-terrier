	<detailed_description>Brain imaging conduct three time study . Study participant travel IND [ 123I ] ß-CIT SPECT imaging ( scan 1 ) . Subjects randomized treatment , treatment either levodopa , treatment Mirapex undergo treatment period 12 week . Subjects return IND [ 123I ] ß-CIT SPECT imaging ( scan 2 ) 12 week treatment withdraw medication follow scan . Eight 12 week medication withdrawal , final [ 123I ] ß-CIT SPECT imaging study ( scan 3 ) perform IND . The imaging outcome , striatal uptake [ 123I ] ß-CIT , scan 1 ( untreated ) scan 2 ( treat levodopa pramipexole ) compare determine significant change uptake marker may attribute levodopa pramipexole treatment . In addition , scan 3 compare scan 2 determine duration reversibility regulatory effect occur . The subject randomize , blind study drug assignment . The imaging technologist image analysis perform investigator blind study drug assignment .</detailed_description>
