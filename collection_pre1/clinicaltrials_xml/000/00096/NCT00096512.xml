	<brief_title>S0420 , Sorafenib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response probability ( confirm , complete partial response ) patient metastatic head neck cancer treat BAY 43-9006 . II . To evaluate median progression-free survival median overall survival . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen . IV . To investigate preliminary manner effect agent Ras signal transduction pathway tissue sample obtain prior treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 3.3-8 month .</detailed_description>
