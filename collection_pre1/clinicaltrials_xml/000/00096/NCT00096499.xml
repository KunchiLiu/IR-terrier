	<brief_title>SB-715992 Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Docetaxel Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine prostate-specific antigen response SB-715992 patient hormone-refractory , androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer fail prior taxane-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine median overall survival median progression-free survival patient treated drug . II . Determine objective response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient measurable disease treat drug . III . Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . IV . Determine , preliminarily , pharmacokinetics mechanism activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive SB-715992 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 1.3-2.7 month .</detailed_description>
