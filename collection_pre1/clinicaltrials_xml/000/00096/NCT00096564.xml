	<brief_summary>Objectives : The purpose study identify area brain activation urge yawn . Little known yawning suppress , yawn often occur response see another person yawn ( contagious yawning ) . Contagious yawn similar contagious motor program , great urge Tourette subject feel tic see repetitive movement subject ' tic , urge scratch discuss itch scratching , urge urinate hearing run water . Hypothetically , urge suppression urge modulate common cortical circuit implicate Tourette syndrome . We plan use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify pattern blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation brain normal volunteer feel urge yawn . Study Population : We intend study 25 normal , right-handed , healthy volunteer . Study Design : Using event-related design , scan subject , use 3T fMRI scanner , show video person yawning , gaping , cough , nothing . Each four action stimulus last four second , vary interstimulus interval . Each video set contain action display ten time pseudorandomly . Two data set collect subject separated brief rest period . Subjects instructed scan watch videotape person perform various behavior , without detail specific action . So influence natural response yawn stimulus , instruct keep head still . The variable interest activation urge-generation , contrast control stimulus . A survey administer informational purpose follow scan assess subject ' general impression susceptibility yawning , whether yawned scanner , whether suppress urge yawn , urge yawn increase decreased repetition yawn segment . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome study activation brain structure response view another person yawn . In particular , interested activation anterior cingulate cortex , parietal operculum , insula , supplementary motor area , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area implicate urge move response either internal ( Tourette syndrome ) external ( itch histamine injection ) state . Since urge yawn process interest , suppression yawn relevant fMRI analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study This study look perception observation various facial expression may affect way different area brain function . We hope gain great understand abnormal movement , tic , investigate facial expression affect brain . Background Information This study base prior research focus activity change different area brain depend people see others around . An example feeling empathy one might look sad face , anxiety fear look angry face . Who Study Population ? 20 healthy , right-handed men woman</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects age 18 old . Subjects willing abstain caffeine alcohol 48 hour prior fMRI scan . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects abnormal finding neurological exam . Subjects positive urine pregnancy test . Subjects pregnant . Subjects find MRI safety questionnaire prevents safely undergo MRI scan . Subjects history brain tumor , stroke , head trauma vascular malformation obtain history image study . Subjects history severe medical condition , cardiovascular disease , would prevent lie flat 60 minute . Subjects without capacity give inform consent . Subjects claustrophobia restriction prevent undergoing scan confine space 60 minute .</criteria>
