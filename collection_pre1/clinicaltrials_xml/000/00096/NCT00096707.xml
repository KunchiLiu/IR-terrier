	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose ( 2DG ) Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2DG ) synthetic glucose analog development Threshold Pharmaceuticals , Inc. exploit difference metabolism normal malignant cell . Malignant cell utilize glucose much high rate normal cell therefore dependent aerobic anaerobic glycolysis . If glycolysis could block preferentially malignant cell , 2DG would potential anti-tumor therapy . Hypoxic cell especially dependent anaerobic glycolysis generally resistant anti-tumor therapy chemotherapy radiotherapy . Therefore , combine 2DG chemotherapy may way simultaneously target hypoxic aerobic cell tumor . Four factor may play role preferential toxicity 2DG malignant cell : ( 1 ) increase uptake retention glucose analog malignant cell ; ( 2 ) relative hypoxia tumor cell relative normal cell ; ( 3 ) malignant cell may sensitive glucose deprivation normal cell ; ( 4 ) inhibition glycolysis may increase sensitivity cytotoxic agent . Preliminary data human tumor xenograft support hypothesis . Because 2DG likely effective combination chemotherapy , trial design evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 2DG alone combination chemotherapy . Docetaxel choose evidence human tumor xenograft delay tumor growth 2DG combination paclitaxel compare paclitaxel alone report taxanes may enhance uptake 2DG malignant cell . Patients advance solid tumor choose appropriate candidate Phase I clinical trial tumor likely area hypoxia .</detailed_description>
