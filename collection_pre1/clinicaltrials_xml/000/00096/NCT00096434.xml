	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tumor response rate patient metastatic breast cancer previously treat anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing regimen receive sorafenib . II . Assess toxicity profile drug patient . III . Determine time disease progression survival time patient treat drug . IV . Correlate pre-treatment level activate ERK1/2 tumor response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month disease progression every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
