	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy lenalidomide use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining lenalidomide rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lenalidomide without rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine best cytostatic response rate ( include complete response , partial response , stable disease ) patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia treat lenalidomide ( CC-5013 ) . Secondary - Determine cytostatic response rate patient progress CC-5013 treat CC-5013 rituximab . - Determine safety regimens patient . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , pilot study . Patients receive oral lenalidomide ( CC-5013 ) daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients disease progression receive oral CC-5013 daily day 1-21 rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 first treatment course day 1 15 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression . Patients achieve CR receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow 1 month every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45 patient accrue study within 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
