	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study give oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil together bevacizumab see well work compare oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil alone treat patient undergone surgery stage II stage III colon cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Giving chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether treatment oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil effective without bevacizumab treat patient undergone surgery colon cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare relative efficacy mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab mFOLFOX6 alone prolong disease-free survival ( DFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare relative efficacy mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab mFOLFOX6 alone prolong survival ( S ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess persistence proteinuria follow discontinuation bevacizumab . II . To correlate development proteinuria clinical sequela . III . To evaluate risk factor development proteinuria . IV . To determine effect discontinuation bevacizumab hypertension . V. To estimate incidence delay vascular event myocardia infarction , CNS ischemia , thrombosis patient receive chemotherapy + bevacizumab . VI . To assess effect bevacizumab ovarian function premenopausal woman . VII . To assess incidence rate immunogenicity examine post-treatment serum level bevacizumab patient receive bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprise concurrent oxaliplatin leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive adjuvant fluorouracil IV 2-4 minute day 1 follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive adjuvant oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil arm I . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion adjuvant chemotherapy , patient continue receive bevacizumab alone every 14 day 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
