	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain agent try prevent development cancer . The use folic acid may effective prevent colorectal cancer . Eating diet rich folic acid may prevent development colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study well folate-depleted diet work compare folate-supplemented diet prevent colorectal cancer patient high risk develop colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate-Depleted Diet Compared With Folate-Supplemented Diet Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients High Risk Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Analyze effect folate-depleted vs folate-supplemented diet folate-related DNA endpoint ( e.g. , genomic gene-specific DNA methylation DNA strand break ) rectal epithelial cell patient high risk colorectal neoplasia . - Analyze effect dietary intervention folate-related DNA endpoint ( e.g. , genomic gene-specific DNA methylation , DNA strand break , uracil incorporation DNA ) blood mononuclear cell patient . Secondary - Analyze effect dietary intervention pattern differential gene expression rectal epithelial cell blood mononuclear cell patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , single-blind study . - Run-in period : Patients placed average folate-containing diet 56 day . - Randomization : After completion run-in period , patient randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I ( folate deplete diet ) : Patients place low-folate diet 84 day . Patients receive oral folic acid supplementation daily day 57-84 . - Arm II ( folate supplement diet ) : Patients continue average folate-containing diet additional 56 day . Patients receive oral folic acid supplementation daily day 1-56 . Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient ( 10 per arm ) accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
