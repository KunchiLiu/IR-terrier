	<detailed_description>TB common resource-limited country , people infect HIV especially risk TB infection . The antituberculous drug RIF lower plasma concentration PIs increase activity enzymes responsible PI breakdown . RIF show reduce PI effectiveness , particular concern HIV infect patient also treat TB . RTV show delay plasma clearance ATV increase plasma half-life ATV . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interaction RTV-boosted ATV , take concurrently RIF HIV uninfected people . Medical medication history , complete physical exam , blood collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) occur screen . Participants enrol study 41 58 day ; 3 dosing period . From Days 1 8 , participant receive 600 mg RIF every 24 hour . From Days 9 19 , participant receive 300 mg ATV 100 mg RTV every 12 hour 600 mg RIF every 24 hour . From Days 20 27 , participant receive 400 mg ATV 100 mg RTV every 12 hour 600 mg RIF every 24 hour . Study visit occur entry ; Days 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 19 , 23 , 27 ; additional visit Days 41 48 . Blood urine collection occur visit . A targeted physical exam , ECG , blood collection PK analysis occur Days 8 , 19 , 27 .</detailed_description>
