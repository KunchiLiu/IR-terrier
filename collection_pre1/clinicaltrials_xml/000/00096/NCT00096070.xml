	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together oxaliplatin fluorouracil follow gemcitabine work treat patient locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Oxaliplatin may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Combined With Oxaliplatin Fluorouracil Followed By Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 1-year survival rate patient locally advance , unresectable adenocarcinoma pancreas treat concurrent external beam radiotherapy , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil follow gemcitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival , time disease progression , confirm response rate patient treat regimen . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5.5 week . Beginning concurrently radiotherapy , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 fluorouracil IV continuously 5.5 week . Beginning 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment gemcitabine repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
