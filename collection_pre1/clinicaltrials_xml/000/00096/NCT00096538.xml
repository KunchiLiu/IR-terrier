	<brief_title>Valganciclovir Treating Patients With Classic Non-HIV-Associated Kaposi 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity valganciclovir patient classic non-HIV-associated Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Secondary - Determine effect drug lytic latent human herpesvirus-8 gene expression KS lesions patient . - Determine effect drug marker angiogenesis KS lesion patient . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients receive oral valganciclovir twice daily 3 week daily 21 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient follow 1 month completion therapy . Patients respond disease follow monthly 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
