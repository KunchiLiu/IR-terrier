PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose give ixabepilone together ketoconazole see well work treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Ketoconazole Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect ketoconazole pharmacokinetics ixabepilone patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - Determine safety ixabepilone administer alone combination ketoconazole patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study ixabepilone . During course 1 , patient receive oral ketoconazole day 0-5 ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 . During course 2 subsequent course , patient receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts least 3 patient receive escalate dos ixabepilone course 1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 12 patient treated MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
