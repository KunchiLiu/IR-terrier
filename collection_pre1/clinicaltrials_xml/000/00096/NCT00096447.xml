	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma treat lapatinib . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient treat drug . II . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine effect prognostic factor , initial performance status tumor grade , patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-82 patient accrue study within 30-67 month .</detailed_description>
