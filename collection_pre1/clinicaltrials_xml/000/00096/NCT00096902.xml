	<brief_summary>This study examine whether certain procedure involve use medication reduce symptom neurocardiogenic syncope ( SIN-ku-pe ) , condition involve recurrent fainting . This condition also know vasovagal syncope neurally mediate hypotension . Neurocardiogenic syncope disorder autonomic nervous system , control automatic body function blood pressure , heart rate , sweat . That system affect medication , condition mind body , person 's surroundings . Researchers study wish learn whether hypnosis , hand exercise , education , diary keep affect autonomic nervous system improve symptom neurocardiogenic syncope . Patients age 18 old neurocardiogenic syncope may eligible study . Those medical illness make unsafe participate , discontinue certain medication , pregnant eligible . Patients undergo medical history physical examination , complete questionnaire , experience Valsalva tilt table test . These test take 5 hour 1 2 day . The Valsalva test evaluate reflexes autonomic nervous system . Patients lie flat pad table sensor place body , measure blood pressure , breathe rate , function . They blow sterile tube 12 second body 's response measure . The procedure may need repeat several time . During test , intravenous tube , guide needle , place patient 's arm . The tube use collect sample blood ( le 7 tablespoon ) measure chemical adrenaline . For tilt table test , patient lie pad , motorize table sensor place body . Velcro strap place around patient 's body help hold him/her table . Then table tilt patient flat position upright one 10 second . The patient stay upright 45 minute symptom monitor , measurement take , blood sample collect intravenous tube . Then table return flat position . If patient faint faint , unsafe heart rhythm 45 minute , test stop table return flat position . Symptoms treat need . Patients qualify study become familiar hypnosis evaluate natural ability experience . A professionally trained doctor guide patient hypnotic state , patient ask respond various suggestion . They videotape , activity require separate consent form . Following procedure , patient assign one four group study . Those hypnosis group weekly session 6 week , session last 1-1/2 hour . The education group meet study investigator learn syncope autonomic nervous system , session last 1-1/2 hour week 6 week . The hand exercise group teach certain hand exercise perform , home instruct , 6 week . The diary group receive instruction keep diary pertaining condition , home , 6 week . After 6 week , patient return evaluation include completion questionnaires another tilt table test blood collection intravenous tube . This entire study take 8 week . There may direct benefit participate study . The experimental procedure may help patient ' neurocardiogenic syncope . After complete study , patient offer experimental procedure test study upon request discretion principal investigator . For example , patient assign diary group may offer hypnosis , education , hand exercise instruction completion study .</brief_summary>
