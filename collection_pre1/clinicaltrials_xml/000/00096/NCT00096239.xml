	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy CP-547,632 , term clinical response benefit ( CA 125 response [ complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) ] stable disease ≥ 16 week ) , patient recurrent persistent small-volume ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal serous , fallopian tube cancer . Secondary - Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine CA 125 response ( CR PR ) rate patient treat drug . - Determine duration CA 125 response patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . - Correlate steady state plasma concentration drug efficacy toxicity patient . - Correlate clinical outcome angiogenic profile derive measurement serum vascular endothelial growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor , interleukin-8 patient treat drug . - Determine change Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral CP-547,632 daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-29 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
