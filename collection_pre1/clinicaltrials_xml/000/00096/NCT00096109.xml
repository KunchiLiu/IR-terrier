	<brief_title>Tanespimycin Treating Women With Refractory Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate 17-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) ( tanespimycin ) patient refractory/resistant metastatic breast cancer . II . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) patient refractory/resistant metastatic breast cancer treat 17-AAG . III . To correlate patient ' her2/neu status response 17-AAG treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive tanespimycin IV 1-6 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow day 30 , every 10-12 week disease progression , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
