	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial COL-3 Patients With HIV Related Kaposi 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor response rate response duration treatment Col-3 two different dose levels- 50 mg/day 100 mg/day subject HIV relate KS . II . To evaluate biologic activity Col-3 measuring percent apoptotic cell tumor biopsy pre- post-treatment . III . To evaluate effect Col-3 serum level MMP-2 MMP-9 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety toxicity Col-3 two different dose level HIV relate KS . II . To evaluate effect Col-3 overall quality life . III . To evaluate relationship clinical response quantitative measure KSHV/HHV-8 HIV viral load . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive low-dose oral COL-3 daily . Arm II : Patients receive high-dose oral COL-3 daily . Treatment arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess . Patients follow least 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 70 patient ( 35 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1.75 year .</detailed_description>
