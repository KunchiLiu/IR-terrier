	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make prostate cancer cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill prostate cancer cell . Androgens stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use nilutamide may fight prostate cancer reduce production androgen . It yet know treatment regimen effective treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness vaccine therapy plus sargramostim interleukin-2 nilutamide alone treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus Sargramostim Interleukin-2 Compared With Nilutamide Alone Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare difference time radiographic evidence disease progression 6 month patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat vaccine contain recombinant vaccinia-prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) admix rV-B7.1 plus recombinant fowlpox-PSA vaccine , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , interleukin-2 v nilutamide alone . - Evaluate vaccination therapy relation change T-cell precursor frequency rise serum PSA patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord HLA-A2 typing ( positive v negative ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive vaccine contain recombinant vaccinia-prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) rV-B7.1 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 . Beginning day 30 , patient receive recombinant fowlpox-PSA vaccine SC every 4 week 12 vaccination every 12 week thereafter . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC daily day 1-4 interleukin-2 SC daily day 8-12 vaccination . Patients without disease progression 12 course receive vaccine regimen every 12 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral nilutamide daily . Treatment continue arm least 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 6 month therapy , patient rise PSA radiographic evidence disease progression may receive therapy arm addition therapy randomize . Patients follow monthly 6 month every 2 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56-78 patient ( 28-39 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1.5-2 year .</detailed_description>
