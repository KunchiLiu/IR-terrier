	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cell stop blood flow tumor stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy interleukin-12 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine liposomal doxorubicin interleukin-12 treating patient AIDS-related Kaposi 's sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin Interleukin-12 Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate patient AIDS-associated Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) treat doxorubicin HCl liposome interleukin-12 . - Determine time response number complete response patient treat regimen . - Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Provide pilot information ability interleukin-12 maintain major response induce paclitaxel salvage therapy patient aggressive life-threatening KS treatment failure doxorubicin HCl liposome interleukin-12 . - Determine effect regimen CD4 count viral load patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome ( LipoDox ) IV 30 minute every 3 week total 6 dos . Beginning concurrently initiation LipoDox , patient also receive interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) subcutaneously twice weekly ( least 3 day apart ) 3 year . Patients refractory disease transfer paclitaxel salvage therapy regimen comprise paclitaxel IV continuously day 1-4 every 3 week major response achieve . Beginning concurrently initiation paclitaxel salvage therapy , patient also receive IL-12 3 year . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response may discontinue IL-12 administration . If necessary , IL-12 treatment may resume late time . Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-36 patient accrue study within 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
