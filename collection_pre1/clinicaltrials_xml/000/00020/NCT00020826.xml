	<brief_title>Assessing Quality Life Patients With Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine scale structure , reliability , validity tumor-specific questionnaire , QLQ-STO22 , assess quality life patient gastric cancer . - Determine questionnaire 's sensitivity change clinical health status patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord type treatment ( potentially curative v potentially palliative ) , disease stage ( local locoregional v metastatic ) , Karnofsky performance status ( le 80 % vs 80 % ) , initial weight gain ( none v le 10 % total body weight vs 10 % total body weight ) . - Curatively Treated Group : Quality life assess 4 week prior surgery 3 month surgery patient receive total partial gastrectomy curative intent ; 4 week prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy , 4 week prior surgery , 3 month surgery patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy follow total partial gastrectomy curative intent ; 4 week prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy 6 week completion therapy patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy follow total partial gastrectomy ; 4 week prior therapy 3 month completion therapy patient receive endoscopic mucosal resection laparoscopic wedge resection . - Palliatively Treated Group : Quality life assess 3 week prior palliative therapy 4 week begin palliative therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 220 patient ( 110 per group ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically confirm gastric adenocarcinoma Patients treat curative intent accord one follow criterion : Plan undergo total partial gastrectomy curative intent Plan receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy follow total partial gastrectomy curative intent Prior total partial gastrectomy curative intent currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy Prior endoscopic mucosal resection laparoscopic wedge resection early gastric cancer OR Patients initial diagnosis gastric cancer recurrent disease plan receive one follow therapy palliative intent : Total partial gastrectomy bypass procedure Endoscopic procedure ( e.g. , stent insertion ) Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy Supportive measure No concurrent enrollment quality life study would interfere study Not previously enrol study PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Age : Any age Performance status : Any performance status Life expectancy : At least 2 month patient treat curative intent At least 4 week patient treat palliative intent Hematopoietic : Not specify Hepatic : Not specify Renal : Not specify Other : No concurrent malignancies except basal cell carcinoma skin No mental impairment would preclude completion questionnaire No psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : Biologic therapy : Not specify Chemotherapy : See Disease Characteristics Endocrine therapy : Not specify Radiotherapy : See Disease Characteristics Surgery : See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
