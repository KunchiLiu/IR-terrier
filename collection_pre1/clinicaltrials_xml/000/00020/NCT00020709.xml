	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy without gefitinib treat unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth tumor . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy effective without gefitinib treat non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy With Without Gefitinib Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether maintenance therapy ZD1839 compare placebo follow induction cisplatin/etoposide/radiotherapy plus consolidation docetaxel improve overall survival progression-free survival patient unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . II . To describe toxicity profile long term administration ZD1839 . III . To obtain sample correlative study . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , stage ( stage IIIA v IIIB ) , measurability lesion ( measurable v nonmeasurable ) , histologic subtype ( squamous vs nonsquamous ) . Patients receive induction therapy comprise cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 29-33 . Beginning within 24 hour start chemotherapy , patient receive concurrent induction radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week boost radiotherapy 5 day week 1.5 week . Beginning approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient stable respond disease receive consolidation therapy comprise docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course . Patients stable respond disease randomize one two treatment arm maintenance therapy . Patients begin maintenance therapy approximately 4-7 week completion consolidation therapy . Arm I : Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , maintenance therapy continue maximum 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
