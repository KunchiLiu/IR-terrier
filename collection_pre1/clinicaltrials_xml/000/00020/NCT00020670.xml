	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility generate vaccine comprise CD40-activated autologous leukemic cell patient B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . - Determine feasibility regimen patient B-cell ALL . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Assess ALL-specific immunity patient treated regimen . - Assess generation immunity control antigens patient treated regimen . - Determine , preliminary manner , effect regimen tumor response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Autologous acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cell harvest , culture CD40 ligand , pulse keyhole limpet hemocyanin , irradiate . Beginning minimum 1 week tumor cell collection , patient receive vaccination autologous CD40-activated ALL cell subcutaneously intradermally week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 4 vaccination , patient aliquots vaccine available initial tumor cell collection may receive additional vaccination every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Vaccination may postpone maximum 1 year tumor cell collection patient receive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Patients follow approximately 2 month last vaccination . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
