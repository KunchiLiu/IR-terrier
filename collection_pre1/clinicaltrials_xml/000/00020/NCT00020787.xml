	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining vaccine therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy chemotherapy treat patient metastatic locally recurrent stomach cancer esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safe immunogenic combination G17DT cisplatin fluorouracil patient chemotherapy-naive metastatic locally recurrent gastric gastroesophageal cancer . II . Determine safety profile tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine tumor response rate , disease stabilization , best overall response , time progression , time treatment failure , overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Determine correlation immunological response clinical efficacy benefit patient treat regimen . V. Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign one four treatment regimen . Regimen A : Patients receive high-dose G17DT intramuscularly ( IM ) day 7 , 35 , 63 . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 1-3 hour day 1 follow fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If inadequate immune response see Regimen A , subsequent patient treat Regimen B . If unacceptable toxicity see Regimen A , subsequent patient treat Regimen C. If inadequate immune response unacceptable toxicity see Regimen A , unacceptable toxicity see Regimen B inadequate immune response see Regimen C , subsequent patient treat Regimen D. Regimen B : Patients receive high-dose G17DT IM day 1 , 28 , 56 . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 1-3 hour day 35 follow fluorouracil IV continuously day 35-39 every four week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Regimen C : Patients receive low-dose G17DT IM day 7 , 35 , 63 chemotherapy regimen A . Regimen D : Patients receive low-dose G17DT IM day 1 , 28 , 56 chemotherapy regimen B . Quality life assess baseline , day 7 , every 2 week 10 week , every 4 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-75 patient accrue study within 5-30 month .</detailed_description>
