	<brief_title>Assessing Results Lip Surgery Patients With Cleft Lip Palate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children bear clefting upper lip exhibit obvious disfigurement upper lip nose . As illustrated , primary lip surgery infant dramatically improve severe deformity perioral nasal region . It widely recognize , however , patient require additional lip surgery optimum esthetic result . Clinicians often disagree end point reach since decision additional lip revision base subjective clinical assessment . Facial morphology function major impact person perceive society know important component esthetic outcome cleft patient , particularly difficult incorporate measure lip function decision-making process . It likely different surgical procedure primary lip closure secondary lip revision could improve effect alternative surgical technique function well understood . The subject project consist two cleft lip palate patient group treat University North Carolina ( UNC ) Craniofacial Center : one cleft group patient candidate additional lip revision surgery ; cleave group patient judge need lip revision ; match non-cleft group present routine dental care UNC School Dentistry . The goal project objectively measure quantify functional facial impairment cleft patient , establish reliable , functionally relevant outcome criterion treatment plan evaluation individual . Our specific aim , therefore , 1 . In prospective non-randomized control clinical trial , evaluate efficacy lip revision surgery ) Examining longitudinal change function lip revision , b ) Examining whether change function lip revision differs change would observe due maturation match non-cleft 'normal ' group , change cleave non-lip revise group . 2. ) Estimate effect cleft lip palate function primary lip palate repair prior lip revision surgery compare patient schedule receive lip revision judge need lip revision , b ) Estimate impairment function cleave lip palate patient without lip revision relative match non-cleft subject . 3 . Compare assessment dynamic lip function provide objective measure subjective clinical judgments/ratings craniofacial plastic surgeon perform lip revision surgery , evaluate potential new method clinical application . 4 . Evaluate whether objective information add clinician 's subjective evaluation patient alters surgical treatment plan goal treatment subjective objective information incorporate decision-making treatment planning process . This specific aim useful adapt assess potential new objective method application clinical setting . 5 . To establish 'parameters care ' criterion secondary lip revision treatment decision-making base standardize , systematic subjective evaluation , objective measurement movement capacity function upper lip . 6 . Assess long-term effect maturation function follow lip revision continue data-collection beyond one-year post-revision patient recruit period initial grant long-term follow-up ( 18 30 month ) newly recruit lip revision patient , , evaluate efficacy cleft lip revision surgery . To address aim , identify group highly qualified individual widely recognize expertise application propose methodology , panel surgeon experience cleft care clinical evaluation outcomes . This expertise , availability appropriate patient resource , home institution 's 40-year history strong commitment care patient craniofacial research , favor success meeting goal project .</detailed_description>
