	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability people different ethnic background develop immune response Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . A common virus , EBV present 90 percent healthy people usually cause problem . Most people infect childhood , symptom , unaware infection . People infected adolescent adult may develop infectious mononucleosis , usually resolve completely . However , immune suppress people , like transplant , EBV cause fatal cancer . It also cause certain cancer Burkitt 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma people immune suppress . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma 100 time common people Asian origin ( particularly southern Chinese ) compare Caucasians . This difference may result genetic , rather environmental , factor . This study examine whether protein produce EBV cancer cell react differently people different ethnic background way could explain difference predisposition disease . Healthy normal volunteer 18 year age old Caucasian Chinese ancestry may eligible study . Candidates Chinese ancestry must bear China ( include Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , first generation offspring parent born place ) . Participants blood sample drawn undergo lymphapheresis - procedure collect large number white blood cell call lymphocyte . The blood sample test blood count HLA type , genetic marker immune system . HLA molecules help determine way body 's immune cell respond virus . HLA type similar blood typing . Usually do match stem cell organ transplant , HLA testing may also use try identify factor associate increase risk certain disease condition . HLA type strongly associate ethnic background . For lymphapheresis , blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood flow vein catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The white cell remove rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) return body needle arm . The procedure take 2 3 hour . The collected white cell use research study , include ability react EBV proteins , destroy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) induce immune compromise patient fatal lymphoproliferative lesion regress upon reversion immune suppression adoptive transfer EBV-specific CD8+ T cell . EBV also induce neoplastic lesion immune competent host include Burkitt 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) . EBV-specific CD8+ T cell response occur patient cancer qualitatively similar quantitatively diminished compare EBV-primed normal individual . Although cancer share several feature , characterize divergent pattern expression EBV proteins . In particular , NPC express preferentially latent membrane protein ( LMP ) 2 without expression LMP 1 intermediate expression Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen . Thus , interest develop LMP 2-directed immunization patient NPC hope enhancement insufficient natural immunity may lead tumor regression . Since , incidence NPC tightly associate ethnic background ( principally Southern Chinese ) Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) phenotype , diverse population may display distinct reactivity pattern toward EBV epitope may turn responsible respective predisposition acquire NPC . Although , several LMP 2 epitope describe , knowledge , systematic mapping across diverse ethnicity complement high-resolution HLA type ever do . We , therefore , propose map immune dominant epitopes LMP 2 EBV prim normal individual Caucasian Asian ( Chinese ) ethnicity measure interferon ( IFN ) -gamma transcript level circulate lymphocyte expose library overlap nonamer peptide encompass full sequence LMP 2 . High resolution , sequence-based HLA type complement study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal volunteer , age great equal 18 year Caucasian Chinese ancestry eligible study . Chinese ancestry define born China ( include Taiwan , Hong Kong Singapore ) first generation offspring parent bear China ( include Taiwan , Hong Kong Singapore ) . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Individuals must weigh least 110 pound . Potential participant must pass criterion blood donor establish American Association Blood Banks accord routine screening perform within Department Transfusion Medicine . Potential participant pass brief physical exam exclude potential cardiac problem . WBC 3000/mm ( 3 ) great . Platelet count 90,000 mm ( 3 ) great . Negative pregnancy test Antecubital vein compatible apheresis process . Apheresis center nurse assess antecubital vein subject prior enrollment . If vein judge small support intravenous catheter require procedure , exclude . If time apheresis procedure nurse unable obtain adequate antecubital vein access , subject exclude . Evidence previous exposure EBV infection represent inclusion criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Potential participant exclude : Who undergo undergone past 3 week form systemic therapy may affect immune function . Who active systemic infection , autoimmune disease know immunodeficiency disease . Who require systemic steroid therapy . Who pregnant . Who positive hepatitis B ( ) AG HIV antibody ( possible immune effect condition ) . HIV test perform prior enrollment . Who form active primary secondary immune deficiency .</criteria>
