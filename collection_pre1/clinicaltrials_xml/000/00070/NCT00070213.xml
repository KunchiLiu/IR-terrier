	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin , fluorouracil , capecitabine , oxaliplatin , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether leucovorin fluorouracil without oxaliplatin effective capecitabine without oxaliplatin treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study four different chemotherapy regimen compare well work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leucovorin Fluorouracil With Without Oxaliplatin Compared Capecitabine With Without Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival patient metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treat leucovorin calcium fluorouracil v without oxaliplatin capecitabine v without oxaliplatin . - Compare quality life patient treat fluorouracil-based vs capecitabine-based regimen . Secondary - Compare failure-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare toxic effect adverse event associate regimens patient . - Compare limit health assessment patient treat regimen . - Compare health economics associate regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm receive 12 week therapy . - Arm I ( MdG regimen ) : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression within 8 week completion regimen may cross receive second-line therapy arm II . - Arm II ( OxMdG regimen ) : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression within 8 week completion regimen may receive second-line therapy supportive care off-study . - Arm III ( Cap regimen ) : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression within 8 week completion regimen may cross receive second-line therapy arm IV . - Arm IV ( OxCap regimen ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression within 8 week completion regimen may receive second-line therapy supportive care off-study . All patient re-evaluated least every 6 week begin another 12 week therapy evidence ( e.g. , clinical , radiological , tumor marker ) disease progression . Patients chemo-sensitive disease may repeat alternate 12-week therapy session evaluation period indefinitely . Quality life assess baseline , 12-14 week , 24 week , every 3 month thereafter . Patients follow every 3 month . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 460 patient ( 115 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
