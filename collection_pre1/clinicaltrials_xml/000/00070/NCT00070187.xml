	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation may allow doctor give high dos chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell . Giving immunotherapy use cyclosporine , interferon gamma , interleukin-2 stem cell transplantation may help transplant cell make immune response kill remain cancer cell . It yet know whether high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation effective without immunotherapy . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study well high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation , cyclosporine , interferon gamma , interleukin-2 work compare high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation treat patient refractory relapse Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Cyclosporine , Interferon Gamma , Interleukin-2 After High-Dose Myeloablative Chemotherapy With Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Phase II - Determine feasibility toxicity immunotherapy comprise cyclosporine , interferon gamma , interleukin-2 high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) patient refractory relapsed Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Phase II part study complete proceeded Phase III ; however long delay occur due propose protocol change Phase III , long study get permanently close *********** - Phase III - Compare event-free overall survival patient treat v without immunotherapy regimen . Secondary - Determine event-free overall survival rate , toxic effect , response rate reinduction chemotherapy follow hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy , high-dose chemotherapy comprise carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan , ASCT patient . - Correlate tumor biologic characteristic response patient treat regimen . - Determine effectiveness immunotherapy regimen produce autologous graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) auto-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity patient . - Correlate great level autologous GVHD vitro cytolytic activity improve event-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine whether treatment immunotherapy overcome negative prognostic significance p53 mutation high serum level interleukin-10 interleukin-2 receptor patient . - Determine genotoxicity retrieval therapy incidence hypermutability longitudinal genotoxic biomonitoring patient . - Correlate HLA class II invariant peptide ( CLIP ) expression tumor cell improve event-free overall survival patient treat immunotherapy regimen . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter phase II study follow randomize , multicenter phase III study . Patients stratify accord study phase ( II v III ) . Patients receive 2 course salvage induction therapy COG-AHOD00P1 equivalent . Within 2-5 week completion salvage induction therapy , patient receive protocol therapy . - Phase II : All patient receive follow treatment : - Hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy : Patients complete prior salvage induction therapy receive full tissue tolerance prior radiotherapy may receive hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy twice daily 7 day . - High-dose preparative regimen : Beginning within 7 day radiotherapy , patient receive carmustine IV 3 hour day -6 ; etoposide IV 1 hour cytarabine IV 1 hour day -5 -2 ; melphalan IV 30 minute day -1 . - Autologous stem cell transplantation : Patients undergo autologous bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) IV begin day 1 continue blood count recover . - Immunotherapy : Patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily begin day 0 continue completion course interferon gamma interleukin-2 . When sufficiently recover , patient also receive interferon gamma SC every day 10 dos . Beginning 2 day start interferon gamma , patient also receive interleukin-2 SC daily 18 day . - Phase III : Patients respond prior salvage induction therapy randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients progressive disease 2 course prior salvage induction therapy assign arm I . - Arm I : Patients receive treatment phase II . - Arm II : Patients receive treatment phase II without immunotherapy . In phase , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 156 patient ( 25 phase II 131 phase III ) accrue study within 5.4 year .</detailed_description>
