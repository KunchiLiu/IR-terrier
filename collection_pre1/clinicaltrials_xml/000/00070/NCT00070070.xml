	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , BCG sargramostim , use different way stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . Combining vaccine therapy biological therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect give vaccine therapy together BCG sargramostim treat patient undergone cystectomy transitional cell cancer bladder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine , BCG , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) post-cystectomy patient transitional cell carcinoma bladder express NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1 antigen . - Determine immunological profile ( NY-ESO-1 antibody , CD8+ cell , delayed-type hypersensitivity ) induce regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine mixed BCG intradermally ( ID ) weekly week 1 2 . Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide mixed sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) ID weekly day 2 week 3-6 . Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone day 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 week 3-6 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 2 6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-28 patient ( 8 HLA-A2 positive prior intravesical BCG , 8 HLA-A2 positive without prior intravesical BCG , 4-6 HLA-A2 negative prior intravesical BCG , 4-6 HLA-A2 negative without prior intravesical BCG ) accrue study within 15 month .</detailed_description>
