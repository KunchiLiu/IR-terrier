	<brief_summary>This study examine age sex difference alcohol metabolism effect alcohol . Men woman differ ability metabolize alcohol , possibly due difference men woman lean body mass , liver size , activity enzyme act alcohol liver . Also , old men woman think sensitive alcohol , although reason clear . Healthy men woman 21 25 year age 55 65 year age social drinker may eligible study . Candidates screen questionnaire general mental health , alcohol use , family history alcohol use problem . They physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , routine blood test , urinalysis test drug abuse , blood test study gene responsible enzyme metabolize alcohol . Younger woman urine pregnancy test old woman test confirm post-menopausal status . Participants two study session NIH Clinical Center outpatient clinic . They come clinic taxi , upon arrival , take breathalyzer test measurable alcohol level . They give breakfast , two catheter ( plastic tube ) place , one vein arm . One tube use collect blood sample measure hormone level ; infuse alcohol . The infusion adjust breath alcohol level hold constant 3 hour moderate level . Baseline measurement take infusion begin . During infusion , participant fill questionnaires mood feeling . Breath alcohol level heart rate measurement monitor frequently . After test , participant remain clinic breath alcohol level drop 0.02 g/L ( generally 2 3 hour infusion stop ) . They give lunch send home taxi . Participants also undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan determine lean body mass magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen determine liver size . For DEXA scan , subject lie still table 30 minute whole body scan use small amount radiation . For MRI , subject lie narrow metal cylinder ( scanner ) 30 minute scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Age Sex Alcohol Metabolism Acute Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study , include study use alcohol clamp , show alcohol pharmacokinetics differ woman men . Some factor may contribute sex difference absorption , distribution metabolism include variation lean body mass ( total body water ) , liver size difference activity capacity alcohol metabolize enzyme stomach liver woman men . A fundamental difference men woman level sex hormone estrogen testosterone , influence several factor . Sex difference alcohol pharmacokinetics , estrogen , postulated determinant increase susceptibility woman alcohol-related liver disease . An additional area interest sex- age-related difference sensitivity effect alcohol . The elderly thought sensitive alcohol show great impairment young individual . However , clear change due pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic factor . The objective project ( I ) evaluate influence age sex alcohol elimination rate men woman , ( II ) determine influence age sex initial response acute adaptation alcohol measure subjective perception alcohol effect heart rate . This study conduct 24 young 24 old participant , equal number male female group . Comparison alcohol elimination rate across group correlation liver volume sex steroid level provide mean examine influence sex hormone , estrogen testosterone , age-related sex-related difference alcohol metabolism liver volume . This study examine age- sex- related difference response alcohol subjective measure intoxication mood , well heart-rate psychophysiological response emotional visual stimulus ( picture ) . This study also evaluate effect acute alcohol administration gene expression peripheral blood cell . Findings study provide important new data regard role sex steroid ( estrogen testosterone ) metabolism alcohol , good understand age- sex-related difference metabolic process may underlie medically important difference response individual alcohol .</detailed_description>
