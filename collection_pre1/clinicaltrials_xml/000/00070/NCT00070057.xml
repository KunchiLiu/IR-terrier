	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Postmenopausal Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether celecoxib suppresses aromatase activity postmenopausal woman invasive breast cancer plan undergo surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate celecoxib-mediated inhibition aromatase activity level cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 HER-2/neu estrogen receptor status patient . II . Determine effect drug histology , Ki67 , RNA expression profile microarray analysis , PI3-K , AKT ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity , PGE_2 level patient . III . Determine whether observed biological effect drug dose-dependent patient . IV . Identify collateral target ( COX-2-independent ) drug patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily 1-3 week ( accord duration biopsy surgery ) absence unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive high dose oral celecoxib arm I . Arm III : Patients receive treatment . All patient undergo definitive surgery . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 75 patient ( 25 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
