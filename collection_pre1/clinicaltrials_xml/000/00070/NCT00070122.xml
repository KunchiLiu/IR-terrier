	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , capecitabine , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen bevacizumab work well treat colorectal cancer . This randomized phase III trial study give two different combination chemotherapy regimens together bevacizumab compare well work treat patient locally advance , metastatic , recurrent colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Metastatic , Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall survival patient locally advance , metastatic , recurrent colorectal cancer treat fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab v capecitabine , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab . II . Compare progression-free survival time treatment failure patient treat regimen . III . Compare response patient measurable disease treat regimen . IV.Compare toxicity rate regimens patient . V. Compare patient-reported functional status convenience therapy patient treat regimen . VI . Correlate germline polymorphism DNA repair ( e.g. , ERCC-1 , XRCC1 , GST-P1 , XPD , ribonucleotide reductase ) , target enzyme ( e.g. , thymidylate synthase , dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , thymidine phosphorylase ) , angiogenesis ( e.g. , vascular endothelial growth factor ) , growth factor ( e.g. , epithelial growth factor receptor ) survival , progression-free survival , toxicity chemotherapy patient treat regimen . VII . Correlate tumor mRNA expression level similar DNA repair enzymes well enzymes involved angiogenesis survival progression-free survival patient treat regimens.Correlate tumor mRNA expression level similar target enzyme treatment survival , progression-free survival , toxicity patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Zubrod performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) prior adjuvant therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour begin day 1 . Patients randomize receive bevacizumab placebo* IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *As 11/15/04 , placebo longer part treatment plan ; patient receive bevacizumab . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine day 1-15 . Patients randomize receive bevacizumab placebo* arm I . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *As 11/15/04 , placebo longer part treatment plan ; patient receive bevacizumab . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . After disease progression , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 4 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,200 patient ( 1,100 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
