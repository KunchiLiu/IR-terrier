	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , leucovorin , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well different regimen induction chemotherapy follow chemoradiotherapy work treat patient locally advance adenocarcinoma rectum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility obtain pre-treatment determination intratumoral molecular marker ( TS , DPD , ERCC-1 ) use selection appropriate regimen induction cytotoxic combination chemotherapy patient cT3-4 rectal adenocarcinoma . - Determine response probability ( unconfirmed , complete partial ) patient treat targeted induction cytotoxic chemotherapy . - Determine toxicity target induction cytotoxic chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy patient . - Determine response probability patient treat chemoradiotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction chemotherapy : Patients assign 1 3 treatment group base molecular analysis pretreatment tumor specimen . - Group I ( low likelihood resistance fluorouracil-based regimen ) : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour begin day 1 . - Group II ( high likelihood resistance fluorouracil-based regimen ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 . - Group III ( high likelihood sensitivity oxaliplatin fluorouracil therapy ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 90 minute leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment group repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluate response approximately 2 week completion induction chemotherapy . Patients stable disease well receive chemoradiotherapy . - Chemoradiotherapy : Beginning approximately 3 week completion induction chemotherapy , patient receive oral capecitabine twice daily continuously 5 week concurrent radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5 week . After chemoradiotherapy , patient may undergo attempted surgical resection discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
