	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It estimate 50 percent adult age 65 old report sleep disruption , 20 percent suffer chronic insomnia . Obstructive sleep apnea , major cause daytime drowsiness , occurs estimate 20-60 percent old people , depend definition use specific population study . Despite high prevalence sleep disorder elderly , relatively study focus consequence . Most study limit cross-sectional design , small sample size , lack comprehensive objective assessment sleep . The study , Outcomes Sleep Disorders Older Men , take advantage establish cohort recruit Osteoporotic Fractures Men ( MrOS ) Study ( 5U01AR045647-Dr. Eric Orwoll , PI ) . MrOS , 7-year study begin July 1999 , multi-center prospective study approximately 6,000 men age 65 old . During MrOS baseline visit , broad variety measurement collect , include body composition body fat distribution dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) quantitative compute tomography , bone density , anthropometry , performance-based test strength balance , medical history , medication use , smoke alcohol use , parameter . Blood , urine , DNA specimens archive use future study importance health old men . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In subcohort 3,000 MrOS participant , comprehensive accurate assessment sleep add use in-home polysomnography , wrist actigraphy , questionnaires measure ; prospective adjudication cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event , extensive measure already perform plan MrOS cohort study . These new measure enable test several important hypothesis : 1 ) characterize association sleep disruption subsequent CVD event 3.5 year follow-up , 2 ) determine sleep disturbance associate increase risk total cause-specific mortality old men , 3 ) test whether sleep disturbance associate increase risk fall decrease physical function , 4 ) test whether sleep disturbance associate impaired cognitive function old men , 5 ) test whether sleep disorder associate bone density fracture risk old men . The bank MrOS specimens supplement allow test future hypothesis concern role sleep development age-related disease condition .</detailed_description>
