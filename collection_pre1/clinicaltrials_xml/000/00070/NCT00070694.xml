	<brief_summary>This study examine whether highly specific powerful 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A ( 5-HT2A ) antagonist , M100907 , combine escitalopram , responsible antidepressant effect . Major affective disorder common chronic life threatening . Yet many 50 75 percent patient get partial response use antidepressant . Some respond medication category serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) -or experience side effect sharply interfere daily life . This study determine extent M100907 improve sleep improves fatigue people treat , reduces cognitive impairment , , limitation awareness , depressive syndrome . It also look allele frequency covariates analysis collect data . Patients 18 65 year age meet criterion major depression , without psychotic feature , may eligible study . Women childbearing potential must use two medically accepted contraception method must agree ( Beta ) -HCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin , polypeptide hormone produce human placenta ) test screen several interval . In random group , participant receive treatment escitalopram either M100907 placebo . The timing escitalopram adjust manage side effect . If already take medication psychiatric purpose , participant taper medication monitor . Participants also undergo follow test procedure : - Test vital sign , lie stand - Physical exam - 12-lead electrocardiogram ( SCG ) - Psychiatric examination screen - Thyroid screen - Collection blood chemistry hematology - Hepatitis B C/HIV screen - Beta-HCG pregnancy test , applicable - Urine drug screen - Urinalysis - Tests use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Montgomery-Asburg Depression Rating Scale - Use Antidepressant Treatment History A sleep study conduct steady state period toward end double blind treatment period . Each study involve 2 consecutive night polysomnographic record do EEG technologist experience use technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Antidepressant Efficacy 5-HT2A Antagonist , M100907 , Combination With Citalopram Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Affective Disorders common often chronic life threaten illness . Furthermore significant fraction patient respond treatment serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI 's ) , partial response continue significant morbidity functional impairment , suffer drug induce side effect decrease individual ' quality life . Side effect SSRI 's include gastrointestinal symptom , anxiety , sleep disturbance , sexual dysfunction . Evidence recent clinical trial preclinical study suggest blockade 5-HT2 receptor may antidepressant effect combine reuptake blockade serotonin serotonin transporter . In order well determine whether 5-HT2A receptor responsible effect propose study highly specific potent 5-HT2A antagonist , M100907 , combination escitalopram SSRI resistant major depression . Subjects age 18-65 studied prospectively show treatment resistant SSRI escitalopram . Subjects randomize double-blind fashion receive continue open treatment escitalopram+M100907 continue escitalopram+placebo . Subjects weekly mood safety rating randomize period four week . At time subject initially randomize placebo ( non-responders ) switch active drug four week randomize treatment active group continue additional four week combination therapy . Those meeting remission criterion eligible extend therapy open treatment combination therapy additional period 6 month . Due potential M100907 improve sleep architecture general slow wave sleep particular , sleep study use polysomnographic method randomization . Sleep disturbance also well-known side effect SSRI 's , addition M100907 may improve sleep disturbance relate affective disorder iatrogenic SSRI effect sleep . Examination improvement sexual side effect , gastrointestinal side effect , headache frequency , anxiety also investigate comparison addition M100907 versus placebo escitalopram treat subject . DNA sample collect neurotransmitter-related genetic polymorphism covariance . Finally , 5-HT2A receptor cortical apical dendrite sit crucial location influence cognitive processing excitatory transmission . Since 5-HT2A antagonist lead down-regulation 5-HT2A receptor alter distribution , well increased prefrontal cortical monoamine level , neuropsychological test compare within subject treat M100907 placebo may increase understand importance serotonin receptor cognition depression . Subjects study neuropsychologically twice follow randomization . If M100907 enhance cognition depression would important advance give high rate impairment function residual cognitive difficulty observe patient depression .</detailed_description>
