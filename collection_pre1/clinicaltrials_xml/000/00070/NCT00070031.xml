	<brief_title>Edotecarin Treating Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity edotecarin woman anthracycline- taxane-refractory chemoresistant locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine time tumor response duration response patient treated drug . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine clinical benefit drug patient . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive edotecarin IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 31-65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
