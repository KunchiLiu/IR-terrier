	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Dasatinib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare molecular response rate , measure decrease breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 ( BCR-ABL ) transcripts 12 month treatment , patient previously untreated chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) chronic phase treat either dasatinib 100 mg/day imatinib ( STI571 , Gleevec ) ( imatinib mesylate ) 400 mg/day . II . To test whether increase dose imatinib ( STI571 , GleevecÂ® ) 400 mg/day 800 mg/day increase rate molecular response , measure decrease BCR-ABL transcripts 12 month treatment , patient previously untreated CML chronic phase . III . To estimate rate cytogenetic hematologic response imatinib 400 mg/day , imatinib 800 mg/day , dasatinib 100 mg/day . IV . To evaluate preliminary manner prognostic effect derivative ( der ) ( 9 ) der ( 22 ) chromosomal deletion response CML patient treat imatinib dasatinib . V. To investigate preliminary manner change gene expression relapse progression compare pre-treatment . VI . To estimate frequency severity toxicity three treatment regimen . VII . To evaluate , preliminary manner , overall survival relapse-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment repeat every 4 week 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive imatinib mesylate PO twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive dasatinib PO BID . Treatment repeat every 4 week 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 15 year .</detailed_description>
