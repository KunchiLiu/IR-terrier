	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness treat uveitis , eye inflammation , monoclonal antibody call daclizumab . Monoclonal antibody genetically engineer protein make large quantity direct specific target body . Daclizumab design prevent specific chemical interaction need immune cell call lymphocyte produce inflammation . In ongoing NIH study 10 adult uveitis , 8 patient able decrease corticosteroid immunosuppressive medicine take receive daclizumab month even year . Seven patient continue take drug . Patients 18 year age old active non-infectious intermediate posterior uveitis eye require treatment disease may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Eye examination measure visual acuity eye pressure , examine lens , retina , pupils eye movement . - Blood test measure number type blood cell . - Fluorescein angiography check abnormality eye blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take special camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible abnormality . Participants come NIH Clinical Center treatment follow-up visit . The first daclizumab treatment give 90-minute infusion vein . A second IV infusion give 7 day later . If treatment successfully reduce eye inflammation 2 week , subsequent treatment give injection skin month 1 year . Patients whose eye disease improve 2 week stop study treatment receive alternative therapy . Follow-up visit schedule 7 , 14 , 21 day enrollment treatment visit evaluate response treatment drug side effect . During visit , patient repeat exams do screening . Extra blood sample take certain visit measure blood level daclizumab perform clinical laboratory immunology test . Fluorescein angiography do enrollment 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daclizumab Treat Non-Infectious Sight-Threatening Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication use uveitis cause significant toxic side effect , especially prolong use . Consequently , effective treatment safer side effect profile highly desirable . Daclizumab humanize monoclonal antibody direct high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 Tac subunit . The IL-2 receptor system play central role mediate immune response . Blocking system impedes immune response inhibit local inflammatory response , include uveitis . Pilot study use intravenous subcutaneous daclizumab treatment suggest daclizumab treatment 1 mg/kg every 2-4 week quiescent uveitis may effectively replace immunosuppressive medication majority case . Because little experience use daclizumab active uveitis , feasibility study enroll five study participant would normally treat systemic , high-dose corticosteroid cytotoxic , systemic immunosuppressive medication . Since daclizumab indication tolerate repeated dose 8-10 mg/kg , administer daclizumab reach high serum level pair dose 8 mg/kg 4 mg/kg two week apart . The primary objective study collect preliminary information utility acute daclizumab therapy active ocular inflammation . The primary outcome resolution active disease define reduction vitreous haze least 2 step ( 2+ Trace , 1+ none ) assess 21 day initial daclizumab injection . Secondary outcome include fluorescein retinal vascular leakage , CME , anterior chamber cell , visual acuity . In addition adverse event collect regardless possible relation daclizumab . Participants show 2 step reduction vitreous haze day 21 permit continue SC daclizumab maintenance treatment begin Day 28 2 mg/kg every 4 week year . At time followup period , participant lose great 3 line visual acuity baseline study treatment discontinue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers consider eligible participant study provide meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Participant diagnosis active , noninfectious intermediate posterior uveitis , may include restricted following condition know cause intermediate posterior uveitis : panuveitis , intermediate uveitis par planitis subtype , sarcoidosis , VogtKoyanagiHarada ( VKH ) syndrome , birdshot retinochoroidopathy , retinal vasculitis sympathetic ophthalmia ; 2 . Participant active uveitis great equal Grade 1 ( 1+ ) vitreous haze least one eye include evidence retinal vascular leakage use fluorescein angiography presence cystoid macular edema ( CME ) enrollment ; 3 . Participant 's uveitis currently treat untreated time enrollment ; 4 . Participant bestcorrected distance visual acuity ( BCVA ) bad eye 20/400 better ( ETDRS logMAR less 1.34 ) ; 5 . Participant plan undergo elective ocular surgery ( e.g. , cataract extraction ) study period ; 6 . Participant , male female , reproductive potential sexually active agrees use doublebarrier contraception method throughout course study ( minimum 52 week ) 6 additional week completion protocol treatment period . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A volunteer permit enroll meet one follow exclusion criterion : 1 . Participant 18 year age ; 2 . Participant receive previous treatment IL2 IL2R direct therapy within past 90 day ; 3 . Participant lens opacity obscure anterior ocular medium upon enrollment reliable evaluation grade posterior segment perform ( except anterior chamber cell due inflammation exclusion ) ; 4 . Participant history active herpes zoster varicella infection within 6 week enrollment , chicken pox exposure within 21 day enrollment . 5 . Participant known history HIV infection ; 6 . Participant currently enrol another investigational interventional therapeutic trial , use therapy nonuveitis condition would likely affect immune response interfere trial logistics , receive investigational therapy within 30 day prior enrollment ; 7 . Participant history diagnosis Behcet 's disease ( since subsequent taper withdrawal concomitant immunosuppressive medication standardofcare Behcet 's patient ) primary diagnosis anterior uveitis ( e.g. , HLAB27 associate uveitis , ocular condition usually treat local systemic medication ) ; 8 . Participant significant local systemic infection require medical treatment time enrollment ; 9 . Participant currently pregnant lactate ; 10 . Participant history cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer ) diagnose within past 5 year ; 11 . Participant nonocular , medically significant comorbid condition impairs normal activity , require immunosuppression , condition prognosis indicate significant risk disability death condition continue exacerbate study period , medical condition would likely impact participant 's ability comply visit schedule . Such condition may include , example , recent heart attack , significant COPD , brittle diabetes , kidney disease , severe emphysema , organ transplant ( require corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication ) , hepatitis liver disease , uncontrolled psychiatric illness .</criteria>
