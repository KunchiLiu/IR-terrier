	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Esophagus Gastroesophageal Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate duration response patient advance adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction treat arsenic trioxide . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive load dose arsenic trioxide IV 2 hour day 1-5 week 1 . Beginning week 2 , patient receive maintenance dose arsenic trioxide IV twice weekly thereafter . Courses repeat every 4 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue receive therapy least 6 month beyond CR . Patients follow every 3 month 6 month disease progression .</detailed_description>
