	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness Alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) treat patient adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) . ATL cause virus call human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 ( HTLV-1 ) infect lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) call T-cells . Cancerous cell find blood , also skin , lung , lymph node , liver , bone , bone marrow , spleen , meninges ( tissue cover brain ) . There four category ATL , base aggressiveness disease-smoldering , chronic , lymphoma , acute . Campath-1H monoclonal antibody attache kill normal cancerous lymphocyte , include T cell . Although Campath-1H experimental drug treat ATL , approve Food Drug Administration treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Patients 18 year age old type ATL except smolder may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , photos skin lesion , measurement lesion lymph node skin nodule , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ultrasound abdomen , skin biopsy , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , skin test , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . Participants undergo treatment two phase , follow : - Dose escalation phase : Patients receive infusion Campath-1H daily three day . The initial dose low increase daily long side effect , mild reaction , patient receive maximum dose 30 milligram per day . - Stable dose phase : Patients receive infusion Campath-1H 30 mg three time week 12 week . In addition treatment , patient evaluate follow test procedure : - History physical examination every 4 week . - Blood test every 4 week . - CT scan measure size tumor every 4 week . - Skin biopsy ( skin disease present ) lymph note aspirate : Up five biopsy five aspirate may take help diagnose disease evaluate effect Campath-1H cancer . - Bone marrow biopsy : This procedure may do document monitor disease progress . Patients receive treatment 12 week . Treatment may stop early patient achieves complete response end 12 week . Patients complete study follow periodically history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor evaluation , skin biopsy skin test . They see monthly first 3-month interval first year ; every 4 month second year , every 6 month third fifth year , yearly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Campath-1H Treating Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder cause infection human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 ( HTLV-1 ) . ATL characterize rapidly rise peripheral blood leukemia cell count , lymphadenopathy , lytic bone lesion , hepatosplenomegaly , skin solid organ involvement tumor . Chemotherapy show modest activity treatment ATL remain largely undefined survival ATL patient poor . The CD52 surface glycoantigen overexpressed ATL cell . Alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) humanize rat monoclonal antibody bind CD52 cytotoxic . In preclinical model , Campath-1H inhibit tumor growth improve survival Non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) /severe combine immune deficiency ( SCID ) mouse inject human MET-1 ATL cell . Objectives : To determine efficacy Campath-1H treatment ATL . To define time course Campath-1H saturation patient ATL . To define toxicity Campath-1H patient ATL . Eligibility : Patients HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia . More 10 % malignant cell must express CD52 CD25 . Patients must measurable disease . The patient must granulocyte count least 1000/mm ( 3 ) platelet count great equal 50,000/mm ( 3 ) . Design : A single institution non-randomized open-label Phase II trial . This trial recruit maximum 30 eligible patient . Patients receive antimicrobial antiviral prophylaxis on-study due know immunosuppressive effect Campath-1H . Patients receive I.V . Campath-1H 3 mg day 1 , 10 mg day 2 , 30 mg day 3 follow maintenance Campath-1H 30 mg I.V . three time per week . Patients evaluated response continuation Campath-1H therapy week 4 8 maintenance treatment . Patients eligible receive maximum 12 week maintenance Campath-1H treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must serum antibody direct Human Tlymphotropic Virus Type 1 ( HTLV1 ) . All patient must histologically confirm diagnosis adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma 10 % malignant cell must express CD52 CD25 . All stage Tacexpressing adult Tcell leukemia except smolder eligible : patient chronic , lymphoma acute Acute Tcell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) eligible . Patients must measurable disease . All patient great 10 % abnormal ( i.e . Tac homogeneous strongly express ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) peripheral blood deem measurable disease . The patient must granulocyte count least 100/mm ( 3 ) platelet count great equal 50,000/mm ( 3 ) . Patients must creatinine less 3.0 mg/dl . Omission cytotoxic chemotherapy ATL 3 week prior entry trial require . However patient receive stable dose corticosteroid least three four week without evidence tumor response eligible . Patients must life expectancy great 2 month . Eligible patient must great equal 18 year old . There upper age limit . Patients must serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) value less equal 2.5fold great upper limit normal bilirubin less equal 3.0/dl . If liver function test judged elevate due underlie ATL , parameter consider unevaluable parameter toxicity determination . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent form . All patient must use adequate contraception participation trial three month complete therapy . Patients symptomatic leukemic meningitis exclude . However patient ATL another HTLV1associated disease , tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) include . Pregnant nursing patient eligible study . Because effect CAMPATH1H develop fetus unknown pregnant woman exclude . Breastfeeding patient HTLV1 infection contraindicate risk transmission virus child . In addition , CAMPATH1H may present breast milk produce adverse event breastfeed child . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient exclude study . CAMPATH1H may produce different pattern toxicity patient HIV infection addition depletion T cell produce CAMPATH1H may adverse effect HIV positive individual . Patients smolder ATL exclude . Patients previously receive Campath1GH ineligible .</criteria>
