Utilizing variety experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI , investigate hypothesis regard role dorsolateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex social cognition emotional processing . We ascertain relationship so-called cold cognition event knowledge `` hot '' social cognition attitude formation specific brain region within prefrontal cortex . We also attempt determine relationship non-frontal neural structure involve emotional expression , amygdala , frontal neural structure involve executive function may modulate emotion . The data collect protocol value ( 1 ) identifying set neural region distribute network mediate form knowledge representation store prefrontal cortex ( 2 ) develop functional MRI screening measure subject at-risk develop neurological disorder . We also use data obtain study healthy adult volunteer constrain theory frontal lobe function base study patient focal diffuse frontal lobe lesion provide convergent evidence role specific frontal cortex sector specific cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The purpose protocol localize neural region system mediate form knowledge representation hypothesize principal investigator store human prefrontal cortex . We suspect political attitude also view type store knowledge . Religious attitudinal event knowledge also expect similarly represent store . Utilizing variety experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI , investigate hypothesis regard role dorsolateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex social cognition emotional processing . We ascertain relationship so-called `` cold '' cognition event knowledge `` hot '' social cognition attitude formation specific brain region within prefrontal cortex . Study Population Normal adult volunteer participate experiment deal process event knowledge , general attitude , political stereotype attitude , religious attitude , use fMRI . Design All experiment employ within-subject event-related fMRI design determine whether activation different cortical area correspond different kind store knowledge . Outcome Measures The data collect protocol consist fMRI activation image correspond vary neuropsychological task . The value ( 1 ) identifying set neural region distribute network mediate form knowledge representation store prefrontal cortex ( 2 ) develop functional MRI screening measure subject at-risk develop neurological disorder .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The healthy normal control recruit study determine Section staff phone inperson interview free psychiatric , neurological , medical disorder would constrain interpretation performance functional neuroimaging study . In addition , normal volunteer must undergo neuroexam perform medically responsible investigator , NINDS physician , year undergo MRI scanning . The neurological exam do neurology outpatient clinic . All subject native Englishspeakers righthanded , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory , due association language lateralization handedness . In addition , subject Study 3 ( address political stereotype ) American screen political affiliation use several measure prior participation study . Political affiliation assess obtain ( 1 ) selfreported political orientation subject scale 1 7 ( 1 extremely liberal 7 extremely conservative , Wyer et al. , 1991 ) , ( 2 ) political party preference subject scale 1 7 ( 1 strongly Democratic 7 strongly Republican , Wyer et al. , 1991 ) , ( 3 ) score ConservatismLiberalism Scale ( Mehrabian , 1996 ) . Subjects rating orientation preference ( measure 1 2 ) 3 low 5 high also score high 20 low 20 ( maximum score plus minus 28 ) ConservatismLiberalism Scale include study . American citizenship political screening necessary enable classification condition stereotypecongruent incongruent ( determined status 'Democrat ' 'Republican ' ) . Subjects Study 4 ( address political psychological structure ) screen American citizen prior participate study . Party affiliation , political orientation adjunctive demographical data collect end fMRI scan eventually consider potential source variability statistical analysis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals neurological psychiatric history medical condition would compromise interpretation fMRI result exclude . Exclusion criterion : medical contraindication MRI procedure ( e.g . pacemaker , cochlear device , surgical clip ) ; technical contraindication MRI procedure ( e.g . brace ) ; CNS active medication ; claustrophobia . Pregnant woman also exclude participation due unknown effect high magnetic field develop fetus ; ensure compliance criterion , woman undergo pregnancy test within 24 hour prior scan . The result pregnancy test must negative order woman scan .</criteria>
