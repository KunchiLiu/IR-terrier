	<detailed_description>This study part large project investigate biological educational constraint operate child learn disability , focus treatment link assessment treatment . The project evaluate prevention treatment read write disability , genetic contribution subtypes dyslexia , relationship brain variable dyslexia , brain 's response treatment dyslexia . Genetic brain imaging study occur throughout project . During Year 1 , at-risk reader first grade target intervention map spoken word onto write word . These student compare control group . During Year 2 , fast responder ( reach grade level ) slow responder ( yet grade level ) Year 1 compare . Slower responder receive additional treatment comparison make end year . The additional treatment also study Spanish-speaking student first grade . During Year 3 , another group at-risk , poor reader second grade randomize either word decoding treatment , comprehension treatment , combine word decode comprehension treatment , control treatment . During Year 4 , reader risk fail state standard reading ( decode ) participate extended day program provide comprehensive reading instruction . The student compare control group . During Year 5 , student grade 4 9 take battery morphological , reading , write test . The testing administer throughout entire school system . During Year 6 , old student dyslexia randomly assign phonological morphological reading training . Students compare pre- post-test behavioral measure brain activation result . During Year 7 , student dyslexia randomly assign orthographic morphological treatment spell . Students underwent brain image intervention . Behavioral brain activation measure also assess . During Year 8 , student dyslexia underwent attention fluency train write training without attentional bridge . Only behavioral measure collect . Recruitment family family genetics study ongoing . Recruitment brain imaging-treatment study begin 2004 installation new brain imaging equipment complete .</detailed_description>
