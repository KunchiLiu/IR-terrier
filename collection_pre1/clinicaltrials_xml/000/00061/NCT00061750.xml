	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy ICL670 vs. Deferoxamine Beta-thalassemia Patients With Iron Overload Due Blood Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients require repeat blood transfusion live accumulate iron body blood cell contain iron natural body mechanism eliminate . After iron level get high enough toxic body . The current therapy choice deferoxamine , good job remove excess iron , difficult administer . Deferoxamine require subcutaneous ( skin ) infusions 4 8 hour nightly 3 7 night per week . In addition need wear infusion pump nightly , adverse reaction around site injection frequent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Betathalassemia patient already treat suitable treatment deferoxamine 20 40 mg/kg/day Liver iron content great 2 mg iron/g dw measure liver biopsy Need regular transfusion 8 time per year Nontransfusional iron overload transfusiondependent anemia betathalassemia . Documented toxicity deferoxamine Elevated liver enzyme year preceeding enrollment Active hepatitis B hepatitis C HIV seropositivity Elevated serum creatinine significant proteinuria History nephrotic syndrome Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Fever signs/symptoms infection within 10 day prior start study Presence clinically relevant cataract previous history clinically relevant ocular toxicity relate iron chelation Second third degree AV block , clinically relevant QT interval prolongation , patient require digoxin drug prolong QT interval Diseases ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would prevent patient undergoing treatment option Psychiatric additive disorder would prevent patient give informed consent History drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior study Pregnant breast feeding patient Patients treated systemic investigational drug within 4 week topical investigational drug within 7 day start study Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug , gastrointestinal disease major surgery , renal disease , difficulty void urinary obstruction , impaired pancreatic function . Noncompliant unreliable patient . Patients unable undergo study procedure hear eye test , liver echocardiography . Inability undergo liver biopsy . Patients would need dose ICL670 le 125 mg per day .</criteria>
