	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect oral iron chelator Deferasirox liver iron content one year treatment patient iron overload repeat blood transfusion . Beta-thalassemia patient unable treated deferoxamine patient rare chronic anemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome , Fanconi 's Syndrome , Blackfan-Diamond Syndrome , Pure Red Blood Cell Anemia eligible study . Liver iron content measure liver biopsy begin study one year treatment . However , patient live San Francisco/Oakland area may SQUID place liver biopsy biopsy medically possible . The SQUID non-invasive magnetic mean measure liver iron content .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Betathalassemia patient document noncompliance deferoxamine , define take less 50 % prescribed dose year prior study , liver iron content least 14 mg iron/gm dry weight liver tissue Betathalassemia patient unable take deferoxamine document side effect contraindication , document poor response despite proper compliance , liver iron content least 2 mg iron/gm dry weight liver tissue Patients chronic anemia liver iron content least 2 mg/gm dry weight liver tissue . Betathalassemia chronic anemia patient previously take deferiprone , provide stop deferiprone least 28 day study liver iron content least 2 mg/gm dry weight liver tissue . All patient : Regular transfusion indicate requirement least 8 blood transfusion per year . Life expectancy least one year . Betathalassemia able treated deferoxamine , Sickle Cell Disease nontransfusional iron overload Elevated liver enzymes year precede enrollment Active Hepatitis B Hepatitis C HIV seropositivity Elevated serum creatinine significant proteinuria History nephrotic syndrome Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Fever signs/symptoms infection within 10 day prior start study . Presence clinically relevant cataract previous history clinically relevant ocular toxicity relate iron chelation . Second third degree AV block , clinically relevant QT interval prolongation , patient require digoxin drug prolong QT interval . Diseases ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would prevent patient undergoing treatment option . Psychiatric additive disorder would prevent patient give informed consent . History drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior study . Pregnant breast feeding patient . Patients treat systemic investigational drug within 4 week topical investigational drug within 7 day start teh study . Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug , gastrointestinal disease major surgery , renal disease , difficulty void urinary obstruction , impaired pancreatic function . Noncompliant unreliable patient Patients unable undergo study procedure hear eye test , liver echocardiography . Patients would need dose Deferasirox le 125 mg per day .</criteria>
