	<brief_summary>This research study design determine effectiveness drug , topotecan , give intravenously ( vein ) together drug gemcitabine patient recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian , fallopian primary peritoneal cancer , well tumor mixed mullerian origin . Additional purpose determine long term outcome side effect combination treatment . Since topotecan gemcitabine different mechanism action , combination 2 drug may provide good result either drug alone . Prior study suggest combination topotecan gemcitabine improve effect tumor also appear well tolerate .</brief_summary>
