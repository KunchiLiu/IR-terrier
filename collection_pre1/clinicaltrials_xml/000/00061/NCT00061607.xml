	<brief_summary>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) disorder affect motor neuron . SMA cause mutation part DNA call survival motor neuron ( SMN1 ) gene , normally produce protein call SMN . Because gene mutation , people SMA make less SMN protein , result loss motor neuron . SMA symptom may improve increase level SMN protein . The purpose study determine whether drug call histone deacetylase inhibitor increase SMN level . After undergo general medical neurological evaluation , study participant donate blood sample . Researchers use sample measure SMN level . They also isolate cell blood treat cell various drug may increase SMN level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Levels SMN Blood Samples SMA Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) currently untreatable , autosomal recessive motor neuron disease cause deficiency full-length survival motor neuron ( SMN ) protein . One promising therapeutic approach SMA pharmacologically increase full-length SMN protein level . Several compound show increase SMN level immortalize cell line derive SMA patient . The objective study determine baseline SMN level primary peripheral blood cell SMA patient heterozygous carrier compare unaffected control investigate effect vitro pharmacological compound expect increase SMN level . It anticipate study provide evidence support use one compound clinical trial SMA patient . The study population include patient genetically prove type I , II , III SMA family member . Blood sample anonymous , unaffected control patient obtain department transfusion medicine ( 99-CC-0168 ) . This investigative study involve blood draw . No new therapy provide except standard care .</detailed_description>
