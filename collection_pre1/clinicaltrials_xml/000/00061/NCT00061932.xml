	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bortezomib without irinotecan work treat patient gastroesophageal junction stomach cancer remove surgery . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy irinotecan use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bortezomib irinotecan may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With Without Irinotecan Treating Patients With Cancer Gastroesophageal Junction Stomach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate combination irinotecan PS 341 patient previously untreated adenocarcinoma stomach GEJ . II . To determine response rate PS341 patient previously treat adenocarcinoma stomach GEJ . III . To determine toxicity recovery toxicity patient receive PS 341 alone combination irinotecan IV . To perform GeneChip analysis biopsy specimens prior subsequent treatment PS341 determine change pattern gene expression OUTLINE : Patients stratify ( stratum 2 close accrual 9/19/2006 ) accord prior chemotherapy advance disease ( yes v ) . STRATUM 1 ( Previously untreated patient ) : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 . STRATUM 2 ( Previously treat patient ) ( close accrual 9/19/2006 ) : Patients receive bortezomib stratum 1 . In stratum , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
