	<brief_title>Soblidotin Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective tumor response rate duration response patient progressive locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treat soblidotin second-line therapy receive prior platinum-based chemotherapy . - Determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - Determine median survival time 12-month survival rate patient treat drug . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive soblidotin IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Plasma sample pharmacokinetics do day 1 course 1 . Patients follow survival every 3 month discontinue study treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
