	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify brain region involve perform certain task , especially involve emotion . MRI diagnostic tool use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image structural chemical change brain . The study also examine MRI technique best use scan brain area involve different emotion . Healthy normal volunteer 18 40 year age right-handed native English speaker may eligible study . Individuals history neurological disease , post-traumatic stress disorder psychiatric disorder , history physical sexual abuse may participate . Candidates screen write questionnaire medical history , include psychiatric neurological information . Participants perform task involve emotion undergo MRI scanning . For procedure , subject lie table narrow metal cylinder ( scanner ) contain magnetic field . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . The subject ask lie still 10 minute time . During scan , subject performs simple task involve view picture screen . Other task involve view picture respond press button . Some picture violent pornographic , others pleasant view . Of total 162 picture , 30 percent categorize graphic possibly disturb .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Emotional Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol localize neural region system mediate form knowledge representation hypothesize principal investigator store human prefrontal cortex . Utilizing experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI healthy adult volunteer , investigate hypothesis regard role ventromedial prefrontal cortex social cognition emotional processing oppose dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , involve nonsocial-events ( planning , problem solving , economic exchange reason ) . We also attempt determine relationship non-frontal neural structure involve emotional expression , amygdala , frontal neural structure involve executive function may modulate emotion . Another goal study test different fMRI sequence determine one give u best quality signal amygdala orbitofrontal cortex ( affected signal drop-out due magnetic susceptibility artifact ) . The data collect protocol value ( 1 ) identifying set neural region distribute network mediate form knowledge representation store prefrontal cortex , ( 2 ) contribute optimization functional imaging amygdala orbitofrontal cortex high field strength ( 3 Tesla ) . We also use data obtain study constrain theory frontal lobe function provide evidence role specific frontal cortex sector specific cognitive function .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study population consist young healthy volunteer . Age range : 18 40 Righthandedness ( lefthanded subject may recruit preliminary behavioral study ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals neurological psychiatric history medical condition would compromise interpretation fMRI result exclude . Individuals current past history posttraumatic stress disorder psychiatric disorder individual history physical sexual abuse exclude may disturb view graphic picture . Subjects contraindication exposure high magnetic field .</criteria>
