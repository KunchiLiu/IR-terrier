	<brief_summary>Dr. Frederick Millard , MD , Associate Clinical Professor UCSD Cancer Center , conduct 12-week study advance prostate cancer patient . The study hold UCSD Medical Center test experimental investigational gene therapy vaccine design make patient 's immune system react telomerase , enzyme express prostate cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Transgenic Lymphocyte Immunization Vaccine Subjects With Prostate Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine safety , feasibility , tolerability transgenic lymphocyte immunization ( TLI ) . In process patient 's lymphocyte render transgenic gene cod select portion telomerase enzyme express vast majority cancer cell . Transgenic cell return patient produce immune response target cancer cell express telomerase . The Phase 1 trial evaluate TLI patient advance , androgen-independent prostate cancer metastasis confine lymph node bone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age old , able understand sign inform consent form . HLAA2 positive . Expected survival ≥ 6 month . Histological evidence adenocarcinoma prostate . ( ECOG ) Performance status 0 , 1 2 . The following category subject androgenindependent prostate cancer eligible : Progression bidimensionally measurable disease assess within 84 day ( 12 week ) prior enrollment . Progression evaluable measurable disease ( i.e. , bone scan ) assess within 112 day ( 16 week ) prior enrollment . Rising PSA Rising PSA define least two consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( measure 2 ) must take least 7 day reference value . A third confirmatory PSA measure require ( 2nd beyond reference level ) great second measure , must obtain least 7 day 2nd measure . If case , fourth PSA require take great second measure . The subject must PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml addition increase PSA eligible . No minimum PSA require subject measurable disease nonPSA evaluable disease . All subject must CT scan abdomen pelvis within 84 day ( 12 week ) prior enrollment . All subject must also bone scan within 112 day ( 16 week ) prior enrollment . Subjects must surgically medically castrate . If method castration LHRH agonist ( leuprolide goserelin ) , subject willing continue use LHRH agonist . Castration use LHRH agonist interrupt subject stop treatment willing restart . If subject treat nonsteroidal antiandrogens ( flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ketoconazole ) , must stop least 28 day prior enrollment flutamide ketoconazole least 42 day prior enrollment bicalutamide nilutamide subject must demonstrate progression . Subjects may receive prior surgery . However , least 21 day must elapse since completion surgery subject must recover side effect . All subject must prestudy PSA within 28 day enrollment . Subjects must meet following initial laboratory criterion : granulocyte ≥ 1500/ul platelet count ≥ 100,000/ul hemoglobin ≥ 10 gms/dl bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Testosterone &lt; 50ng/ml bilateral orchiectomy PSA ≥ 5ng/ml measurable disease</criteria>
