	<brief_title>Treadmill Training With Body Weight Support Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gait rehabilitation specific component physical rehabilitation person sub-acute chronic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . One novel method gait rehabilitation involve use overhead support point harness . The BWS strategy combine treadmill-based gait training recent study dramatic result . It believe form training may enhance output ‘ central pattern generator ' stepping movement circuitry intrinsic patient 's spinal cord . However , limited attention pay role training-induced physical conditioning might play mediate functional improvement . This study evaluate whether BWS gait train effective conventional rehabilitation therapy improve functional gait patient neurologically incomplete spinal cord injury . The study also compare treadmill-based training overground-based training . Treadmill-based training inherent advantage provide highly rhythmic input subject 's leg ; overground-based training inherent advantage allow use assistive device thereby replicate ‘ natural ' training condition . Patients chronic SCI ( great 1 year post-injury ) patient sub-acute SCI ( 2 8 month post-injury ) evaluate . Patients chronic SCI randomly assign one 3 group : body weight support treadmill-based training , body weight support overground training , conventional rehabilitation therapy . Patients sub-acute injury randomize receive either BWS treadmill train conventional rehabilitation . Training session typically 1 hour long , 3 session per week 13 week . All patient evaluate battery functional , metabolic , neurophysiologic measure prior onset train week training complete . The primary outcome measure average maximum overground walk velocity without body weight support use passive assistive device . Secondary measure concentrate function ( balance , mobility ) , fitness ( work capacity , strength , gait efficiency ) , spinal cord neurophysiology ( motor conduction , reflex excitability ) .</detailed_description>
