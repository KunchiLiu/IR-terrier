	<brief_summary>Pediatric Constraint-Induced ( CI ) Movement therapy rehabilitation program design improve motor function child partial paralysis . Children cerebral palsy may one arm significantly great function ( good arm ) ( bad arm ) . Restricting use good arm may improve use bad arm . In pediatric CI therapy , good arm put sling force increase use bad arm . The bad arm also train day several week . This study test ability pediatric CI therapy improve motor function child cerebral palsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Constraint-Based Therapy Improve Motor Function Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy afflicts least two 1,000 child United States approximately 2,000,000 child worldwide . Behavioral technique impact plasticity nervous system need incorporate practical , evidence-based therapeutic intervention condition . CI therapy derive basic research animal human subject . Randomized , control study indicate substantially reduce motor deficit adult patient mild moderately severe chronic stroke increase independence period year . CI therapy involve motor restriction less affected upper extremity period 2 3 week concurrently train affect upper limb . This give rise concentrate , repetitive use affect extremity . In adult , CI therapy lead large increase use-dependent cortical reorganization involve recruitment substantial new region brain innervation affect extremity movement . The study evaluate CI therapy pediatric population . The study test whether pediatric CI therapy promote new improve motor behavior young child hemiparesis associate cerebral palsy . Pediatric CI therapy involve total restraint unaffected upper extremity simultaneous repetitive use affect extremity 6 hours/day 21 consecutive day . Fifty-two child age 2 6 year old hemiparetic cerebral palsy randomly assign either pediatric CI therapy group control group . The control group receive standard rehabilitation therapy . All child complete medical evaluation emphasis motor function prior treatment initiation . Children undergo follow-up test 1 , 6 , 12 month post-treatment . The primary study assessment tool Pediatric Developmental Motor Scales - II ( PDMS-II ) , DASI â€“ II , Bayley Developmental Skills Test , Pediatric Motor Activity Log ( PMAL ) , Child Arm Use Test ( CAUT ) , Emerging Behavior Scale ( EBS ) .</detailed_description>
