	<brief_summary>Alendronate drug use treat osteoporosis . The purpose study examine whether alendronate combination calcium vitamin D safe effective treat bone loss people HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Alendronate , Calcium , Vitamin D Bone Mineral Density HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreased bone mineral density ( BMD ) identify 50 % HIV infect men , severe osteoporosis 21 % men . The mechanisms underlie bone abnormality remain unclear . Bisphosphonates potent bone resorption inhibitor show effective treating osteoporosis . While several bisphosphonates approve treatment osteoporosis woman , alendronate bisphosphonate approve treatment men . This study hypothesize alendronate able reverse decrease BMD secondary inhibition bone resorption HIV infect patient treated potent antiretroviral therapy , patient able tolerate alendronate without significant toxicity . The study also examine efficacy once-weekly alendronate daily calcium vitamin D men woman HIV . Patients participate study 48 week . Patients randomly assign receive either alendronate placebo . All patient receive calcium vitamin D. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan use evaluate bone density visit . After study entry , patient visit Weeks 2 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . During visit , blood drawn pregnancy test may perform . Patients must fast least 8 hour prior entry visit visit Weeks 2 , 12 , 24 , 48 .</detailed_description>
