	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy celecoxib , term progression-free survival , patient progressive metastatic differentiate thyroid carcinoma . - Correlate cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 protein expression tumor biopsy immunohistochemistry clinical response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily begin day 1 . Treatment continue 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 3 additional month therapy beyond documentation CR . Patients follow 4-8 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study within approximately 6 month .</detailed_description>
