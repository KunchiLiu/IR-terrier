	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Polyvalent HIV-1 Vaccine HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike virus effective vaccine develop , HIV-1 evolve mechanism evade immune control virus replication . These mechanism include extraordinary genetic diversity virus , viral latency , target immune system . Evolutional variation envelope gene result development different group ( M , N , O ) subgroup ( clade ) diverse geographic region world , also significant genomic variation within clade . These clade variant HIV require novel vaccine approach elicit population-based protective immunity . Viral latency ability virus remain dormant long period integrate viral DNA host genome . Viral latency require vaccine produce immune response robust enough kill virus maintain extend period time produce last immunity . Finally , HIV-1 target CD4 cell thus compromise immune surveillance mechanism critical maintain cellular humoral immunity HIV-1 . Therefore , effective vaccine HIV-1 must bolster development broadly reactive neutralize antibody genetic variant HIV-1 , well induce effective HIV-specific CTL response eliminate virus-infected cell . The ideal vaccine approach produce long-term response within arm host immunity . This study design evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity novel prophylactic vaccine consist DNA priming follow protein boost . The first vaccine component administer study DNA vaccination ; second component recombinant protein vaccination . This combination use determine whether vaccine strategy induce balance humoral cell mediate immune response HIV-1 . Two HIV antigen , Gag Env , include study 's vaccine formulation . Studies show HIV-1 Gag potent inducer cell mediate immune response , Env target neutralize antibody response . The vaccine use study contain 5-valent Env design ( Env derive one 5 clade HIV ) order examine polyvalent Env formulation may expand breadth neutralize antibody response induce human volunteer . For DNA prim protein boosting , set Env antigens clades A , B , C , E HIV-1 M group produce ( 2 Env antigen clade B 1 Env three clade ) . All 5 Env antigen select primary HIV-1 viral isolates hope produce broad antibody response primary virus circulate worldwide human population . Thirty-six healthy volunteer randomize one five group . Groups 1 , 2 , 3 receive different dos vaccine determine optimal dose . Groups 4 5 receive vaccine either intradermal intramuscular administration . Each group receive 3 dos DNA vaccination week 0 , 4 , 12 , 2 dos protein vaccination week 20 28 . Blood sample throughout duration study provide assessment safety immunogenicity vaccine healthy volunteer . It expect volunteer enrol study 1 year .</detailed_description>
