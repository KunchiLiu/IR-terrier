	<brief_summary>This research study patient condition know necrotizing pancreatitis . This inflammation pancreas ( intestinal organ assist digestion ) result damage death pancreatic tissue . This damage pancreatic tissue may develop bacterial infection , cause -sometimes serious- health problem . It may possible prevent delay infection give 'prophylactic ' antibiotic ( - provide protection infection start ) . However , certain antibiotic therapy successful . This study carry see whether antibiotic 'Meropenem ' ( also know MERREM I.V . ) provide protection develop pancreatic infection . This do comparing progress patient receive meropenem receive non-active placebo solution ( solution contain active medication ) . Meropenem placebo would give addition standard treatment receive pancreatitis . It know meropenem help prevent infection associate necrotizing pancreatitis . Approximately 240 patient take part study . Study participation carry 6 week , patient receive study treatment maximum 21 day .</brief_summary>
