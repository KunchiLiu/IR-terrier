	<brief_summary>Biliary atresia idiopathic neonatal hepatitis common cause jaundice hyperbilirubinemia continue beyond newborn period . The long term goal Biliary Atresia Research Consortium ( BARC ) establish database clinical information serum tissue sample child biliary atresia ( BA ) idiopathic neonatal hepatitis ( INH ) facilitate research perform clinical , epidemiological therapeutic trial two important pediatric liver disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biliary Atresia Research Consortium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center project establish prospective database clinical information repository blood tissue sample child diagnose neonatal liver disease , biliary atresia neonatal hepatitis , order perform research important liver problem . Children screen enrolled presentation participate pediatric liver site . Subjects diagnose biliary atresia follow intensively first year , 18 month age , annually 15 year age . Other subject diagnose cholestasis follow schedule ; complete ( clinical biochemical ) resolution underlie liver disease therapy , one follow visit within one year ( preferably schedule time next plan follow visit 12 month age , whichever later ) data collection obtain blood sample . The development serum tissue bank specimens child various neonatal cholestatic disorder invaluable tool current future investigation etiology pathogenesis hepatobiliary injury infant . Detailed clinical data , laboratory investigation , liver biopsy specimen , long-term follow-up outcome part normal standard care respect diagnosis treatment subject liver problem . This research involve collection diagnostic , clinical outcome data concern subject , keep without identification ( cod ) national research database infants liver disease . Samples blood urine obtain later research analysis , whenever possible , time clinically indicate blood draw IV access clinical procedure . When liver biopsy specimen obtain diagnostic purpose , liver biopsy specimen excess need diagnostic use send tissue repository . When portoenterostomy liver transplant occur , section liver , biliary remnant bile specimen , remove course surgery excess need diagnostic use , send repository . These specimen use investigation mechanisms cause liver damage occur subject 's condition . As part standard care , study follow-up record progress liver problem routine clinical examination laboratory test 15 year . All data study keep secure research database data coordinate center .</detailed_description>
