	<brief_summary>To effectively treat prostate cancer , doctor need accurate view ( via X-rays ) prostate gland radiation therapy . To help improve view , doctor may insert gold marker call fiducials prostate place hollow gold needle rectum move fiducial needle . The purpose study determine whether MRI scan help doctor improve placement needle . Fifteen men participate study . Patients take antibiotic levofloxacin two day prior placement fiducials , small enema another dose antibiotic morning procedure . After anesthetized , patient antenna-like tube place rectum MRI image take area . The doctor use scan place four fiducials prostate . The procedure require approximately 45 minute . Patients allow go home day procedure , follow seven-week course standard radiation therapy . Prior participation study , patient undergo follow evaluation : physical exam , blood work , urine test , , appropriate , MRI bone scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Fiducial Markers Aid Prostate Cancer Radiation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective image-guided prostate therapy require excellent visualization prostate surround anatomy , cancerous tissue treat avoid nearby neural vascular structure . As , Magnetic Resonance Imaging well suit image-guidance excellent soft tissue contrast , multiplanar capability , potential yield spectral/biological tumor mapping . Despite potential MRI-guided prostate therapy , currently techniques allow precise trans-rectal intraprostatic needle placement patient . In pilot study seek validate accuracy tolerability new system technique allow accurate placement needle within prostate base upon MR image . The method similar transrectal ultrasound guide biopsy prostate , except applicable within closed high-field MRI scanner . Four gold fiducial marker place within prostate needle guidance series patient localized prostate cancer external beam radiotherapy . Fifteen patient enrol onto study sample size determine obtain reasonably precise estimate mean placement accuracy . The accrual period expect less year . While placement fiducial marker direct therapeutic benefit patient , intraprostatic radiopaque fiducial marker ( place ultrasound ) show value assess daily setup error off-line organ motion external beam radiation therapy prostate cancer . Therefore , secondary objective gain experience use intraprostatic fiducial marker daily assessment adjustment external radiation beam target . These marker also utilized aid CT-MRI fusion result well target delineation treatment planning . In way , prostate cancer patient receive external-beam radiation therapy may benefit participation .</detailed_description>
