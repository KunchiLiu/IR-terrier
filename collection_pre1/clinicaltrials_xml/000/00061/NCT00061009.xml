	<brief_summary>This study investigate relationship susceptibility hypnosis regulation autonomic nervous system ( nerve control involuntary body function , heart rate sweating ) . Hypnosis state mind individual highly focused , relatively unaware surroundings , possibly able accept use therapeutic suggestion . People vary responsiveness , susceptibility , hypnosis . People certain condition , chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , chronic pain , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) alter hypnotic susceptibility . Patients chronic orthostatic intolerance ( COI ) often symptoms similar individual CFS , chronic pain , PTSD , GAD , study examine patient COI respond hypnosis compare healthy normal volunteer . COI group disorder characterize intolerance prolong standing . Among neurocardiogenic syncope ( NCS ) , patient recurrent episode sudden loss consciousness , postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) , patient sustain increase heart rate standing . In addition comparison COI normal volunteer response hypnosis , study examine hypnotic susceptibility relate ability control autonomic function blood pressure , heart rate , sweat . The autonomic nervous system activate body stress , physical stimulus cold temperature , also mental stimulus , see rattlesnake close . Hypnosis may , therefore , useful tool understand mind control autonomic nervous system . Healthy normal volunteer patient NCS POTS 18 year age old may eligible two-part study . In part 1 , participant complete questionnaire test hypnotic susceptibility . For test , professionally trained physician guide subject procedure achieve hypnotic state . The subject ask perform several simple task guide back normal state . In part 2 , subject undergoes hypnosis , physician offer various suggestion monitor activity subject 's autonomic nervous system . The subject connect various sensor continuously monitor blood pressure , heart rate , blood flow , sweat response , skin electrical conduction , brain wave activity . An intravenous catheter insert arm vein collect blood sample . At end , subject guide back normal state . The hypnosis session part 1 videotaped order : 1 ) permit review scientist unaware subject 's condition whose judgment , therefore , bias ; 2 ) record experimental data . Only qualified investigator view videotape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol describe study investigate relationship susceptibility hypnosis regulation autonomic nervous system . Several study demonstrate individual particular condition chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , chronic pain , generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , alter hypnotic susceptibility . Patients chronic orthostatic intolerance ( COI ) , general category autonomic dysfunction include neurocardiogenic syncope ( NCS ) postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) , often present symptom similar see CFS , PTSD , chronic pain , GAD . These observation lead hypothesis test protocol patient COI may also alter hypnotic susceptibility . We also hypothesize increased hypnotic susceptibility correlate increase ability modulate autonomic function appropriately response suggestion hypnosis . The study population include normal volunteer patient NCS POTS . The design blind correlative . Primary outcome measure hypnotic susceptibility measure standardized scale ; self-report inventory score psychobehavioral variable ; physiologic parameter hemodynamics , sweat , skin electrical conductance , body temperature , respiratory rate , bispectral analysis ; plasma catechol level . The result study may lead novel therapeutic strategy use hypnosis COI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects patient COI ( POTS NCS ) identify exist diagnostic protocol Clinical Neurocardiology Section ( CNCS ) age gendermatched healthy volunteer . Patients COI must evaluate first diagnostic protocol prior offer enrollment protocol . Participation protocol offer subject independently gender , race , ethnicity , religion , creed . The study protocol perform outpatient basis . Inpatients may also participate long participation interfere protocol ( ) admit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude base : age le 18 year , unwillingness hypnotize videotape ; religious belief would prevent engagement hypnosis ; psychosis psychotic depression ; nonfluency speak English ; inability participate adequately tasks hypnotic susceptibility scale . In addition , patient exclude treat , discontinue , drug likely interfere scientific result . An example would treatment betaadrenoceptor blocker . Patients unable discontinue nicotine alcohol temporarily exclude . Patients discontinue medication patient patient 's doctor discuss Principal Investigator , Research Nurse . If decided discontinuing medication would unsafe , patient exclude study . Finally , subject exclude technical limitation place i.v . monitoring device .</criteria>
