	<brief_summary>This Phase I clinical trial first step test gene therapy . This study call `` Safety/Toxicity '' study Food Drug Administration , primarily aim determine whether experimental protocol safe human . It determine whether study procedure cause side effect human , may also give u preliminary sense whether effective combat Alzheimer 's disease human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although precise pathogenesis AD unknown , certain pathological feature accompany disease . These pathological feature include abnormal accumulation extracellular amyloid , formation intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangle , synapse loss , cellular degeneration . Cellular degeneration occur several neuronal population central nervous system . Among neuronal population degenerate AD , loss basal forebrain cholinergic neuron particularly severe . Loss cholinergic neuron AD correlate best severity dementia , density amyloid plaque brain , amount synapse . To date , FDA-approved therapy Alzheimer 's Disease focus augment function degenerate cholinergic neuron . The present trial move beyond compensate cholinergic neuronal degeneration attempt 1 ) protect cholinergic neuron degeneration , 2 ) augment function remain cholinergic neuron directly elevate choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) function neuron . These two therapeutic intervention bring delivery human NGF brain . NGF show prevent lesion-induced spontaneous , age-related degeneration basal forebrain cholinergic neuron . Further , NGF infusion reverse lesion-induced memory loss spontaneous , age-related memory loss rodent . Based finding , NGF administration offer significant potential neuroprotective strategy Alzheimer 's disease . Grafts primary fibroblast transduce express human nerve growth factor show sustain NGF vivo gene expression least eighteen month rodent central nervous system . In addition , graft sustain NGF messenger RNA production least 14 month vivo . In primate system , ex vivo NGF gene therapy demonstrate sustain NGF protein production brain rhesus money least one year . Thus , available data suggest ex vivo NGF gene therapy effective mean prevent loss basal forebrain cholinergic neuron augment cholinergic function primate brain . In animal , procedure safe well tolerate . Based data , clinical trial ex vivo NGF gene therapy Alzheimer 's disease begin . This 18 month , open label , prospective Phase I clinical trial Ex Vivo Gene Therapy Alzheimer 's disease 8 patient mild degree cognitive impairment . Patients screen diagnosis Probable Alzheimer 's disease mild severity . After obtain informed consent , three skin biopsy obtain generate culture primary , autologous fibroblast . These cell culture , genetically modify produce secrete human nerve growth factor ( NGF ) molecule . If fibroblast deem acceptable base NGF production rate standard cell culture sterility test , patient receive intracerebral injection primary fibroblast region basal forebrain cholinergic neuron brain , neuron undergo atrophy result Alzheimer 's disease .</detailed_description>
