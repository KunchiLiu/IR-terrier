Valganciclovir ganciclovir prodrug , administer orally , rapidly convert active compound ganciclovir first-pass process , majority hydrolysis occur pre-systemically . Studies show valganciclovir tablet allow systemic exposure ganciclovir comparable achieve recommended dos intravenous ganciclovir . Patients undergo ophthalmologic exam ophthalmologist safety laboratory test establish eligibility . No specific visit request drug usage plan follow enrollment ; however , patient see safety and/or clinical assessment medication dispensation periodic visit , consistent standard care . An ophthalmologic exam perform Week 3 ( later Week 4 ) , end induction treatment phase consistent standard care order ensure adequate response therapy .
