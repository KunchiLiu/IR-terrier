	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness single dose anti-interleukin-5 antibody ( SCH 55700 ) reduce number eosinophil ( type white blood cell ) patient hypereosinophilic syndrome . Patients disease many eosinophil blood body tissue , cause damage affect organs-most commonly heart , nerve skin . SCH 55700 antibody interleukin 5-a hormone-like substance produce white blood cell play significant role eosinophilia . SCH 55700 lower eosinophilia blood count patient asthma reduce number cell tissues animal asthma . Patients hypereosinophilic syndrome 18 year age old respond standard therapy steroid , interferon hydroxyurea take drug may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination , blood test . Depending patient 's symptom , diagnostic test may do , include study eye , lung , skin , nerve heart . Skin biopsy bronchoalveolar lavage may include diagnostic evaluation . For skin biopsy , small area 1/3 inch diameter numb small core skin surgically remove study microscope . Bronchoalveolar lavage involve insert catheter ( flexible tube ) lung instill saline ( salt water ) obtain tissue sample . This test do clinically necessary . Those enrol study admit NIH Clinical Center single dose SCH 55700 , inject arm vein . They monitor hospital least 72 hour change eosinophil count side effect injection . After discharge , laboratory test do weekly first month , either Clinical Center patient 's local physician . Follow-up visit schedule monthly 1 year patient 's eosinophil count return pre-treatment level 2 consecutive month . Follow-up visit include history , physical examination blood test , include study immune cell substance blood activate stimulate eosinophilia . A chest X-ray , electrocardiogram pulmonary function test do 1 , 3 , 6 12 month evaluate organ damage . Other test may do medically indicate . Bone marrow biopsy aspiration do receive SCH 55700 one month injection evaluate effect SCH 55700 eosinophil production bone marrow . For test , area skin bone numb sharp needle use withdraw sample bone marrow . Leukapheresis also do 1 month SCH 55700 treatment obtain cell study effect SCH 55700 eosinophil activation , function survival . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove , rest blood return body , either needle use draw blood second needle place arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate efficacy humanize monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody , SCH 55700 reduce peripheral blood eosinophilia patient either hypereosinophilic syndrome eosinophilic gastroenteritis . Patients hypereosinophilic syndrome refractory intolerant therapy conventional therapy ( steroid , hydroxyurea interferon alpha ) admit protocol . Additionally , subject eosinophilic gastroenteritis refractory intolerant conventional therapy ( systemic glucocorticoid ) admit protocol . A thorough clinical evaluation perform emphasis potential sequela eosinophil-mediated tissue damage . A baseline bone marrow obtain exclude neoplasia ass degree nature eosinophilipoiesis . Blood cell and/or serum also collect provide reagent ( DNA , RNA , specific antibody ) use laboratory address issue relate immunologic basis FHES GE well pathogenesis treatment . Following intravenous administration single 1 mg/kg dose humanize monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody , SCH 55700 , patient follow inpatient set minimum 72 hour monitor adverse effect secondary infusion . Followup visit schedule monthly 1 year peripheral eosinophil count return baseline . Patients show reduction eosinophilia evidence clinical improvement eligible receive 5 additional dos 1 mg/kg SCH 55700 monthly interval .</detailed_description>
