	<brief_summary>The Neuromuscular Diseases Section ( NDS ) conduct research certain inherited myopathy neuropathy , disorder lead disability sometimes death . NDS , along group , identify disease-causing gene . The National Institutes Health Clinical Center propose new research identify additional hereditary neuromuscular disease conduct genetic study order localize , clone , characterize disease . An expected 50 patient know suspected inherited myopathy neuropathy family recruit study . If travel Clinical Center impossible , investigator may come test . Ten twenty cubic centimeter blood draw DNA extraction genotyping . Some abnormal movement muscle atrophy document videotaping . If necessary , diagnostic laboratory radiographic study do confirm diagnosis . Because disease hereditary , blood may also draw family member . The family counsel participant invite back annually investigate progression disease . Each participant evaluate history initial neurological exam . Up another 20 mL blood drawn routine blood study . Other medical care procedure may include chest x-ray , EKG echocardiogram , CT ( compute tomography ) MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan , pulmonary function test , physical therapy assessment . Possible research procedure may include MR spectroscopy , nerve conduction study , electromyography , muscle nerve biopsy , lumbar puncture . The researcher decide inform family nonpaternity adoption discover DNA genotyping . Also , carrier disease gene may necessarily develop disease , family member inform carrier .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal protocol identify family inherit neuromuscular disorder , evaluate disease manifestation establish accurate clinical diagnosis use new technological advance investigate underlying molecular mechanism . Studies inherit myopathy large family good genealogical record especially valuable . Patients diseases known molecular basis genotyped conduct analysis phenotype/genotype correlation . Patients diseases unknown incomplete genetic characterization study hope contribute identification specific disease-causing gene genetic mechanism responsible specific disorder .</detailed_description>
