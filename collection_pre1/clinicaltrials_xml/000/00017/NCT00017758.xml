	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether certain anti-HIV drug ( efavirenz [ EFV ] nelfinavir [ NFV ] ) affect amount certain fat-lowering drug ( atorvastatin , pravastatin , simvastatin ) blood . Protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , type anti-HIV drug , know cause increase lipid ( fat ) blood HIV-infected patient . EFV also known increase blood fat . HIV-infected patient take PIs and/or EFV may need take fat-lowering drug correct problem . So important look possible drug interaction drug take together . This study see take EFV NFV , protease inhibitor , affect blood level simvastatin , atorvastatin , pravastatin ( fat-lowering drug ) . To obtain result quickly , study population healthy HIV-negative volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abnormalities lipid metabolism recognize side effect protease inhibitor ( PI ) therapy HIV-infected patient . EFV also known increase plasma cholesterol . In attempt normalize serum lipid HIV-infected patient PIs and/or EFV , Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor ( also know statin ) may prescribe . Therefore , important study PIs EFV affect PK concurrently-administered statin . Many statin utilize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 enzyme metabolism . In addition , atorvastatin simvastatin active metabolite , generate via CYP3A4 , contribute drug ' lipid-lowering activity probably toxicity . Pravastatin metabolize CYP3A4 inactivated conjugation , non-CYP3A4-induced hydroxylation , renal excretion . NFV , commonly use PI , inhibitor CYP3A4 inducer CYPs conjugative pathway . EFV mixed CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer . This study examine effect NFV PK pravastatin effect EFV PK simvastatin , atorvastatin , pravastatin . As EFV pravastatin expect common drug combination treatment HIV infection , explore , even though drug interaction expect . To expedite study , study population comprise healthy control volunteer . Volunteers assign 1 4 group . Volunteers Groups A , B , C take statin ( simvastatin , atorvastatin , pravastatin , respectively ) Days 0 3 . After Day 3 , statin stop EFV begin . Volunteers take EFV Day 14 statin EFV together Days 15 18 . Volunteers Group D take pravastatin Days 0 3 , NFV Days 4 12 , pravastatin NFV together Days 13 16 . Fasting lipid profile perform Days 0 , 4 , 15 , 19 Groups A , B , C , Days 0 , 3 , 13 , 16 Group D. PK sample perform Days 3 , 14 , 18 Groups A , B , C ( require overnight stay ) , Days 3 16 Group D. Volunteers receive monetary compensation participation study .</detailed_description>
