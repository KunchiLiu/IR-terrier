	<brief_title>Ecteinascidin 743 Treating Patients With Unresectable Advanced Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate clinical benefit , term incidence objective partial complete response , stable disease , minor response 3 month duration , patient previously treat , unresectable advanced metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treat ecteinascidin 743 . II . Determine progression-free survival , overall survival , response duration patient treat drug . III . Determine toxicity profile drug patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number prior cytotoxic therapy advance disease ( 1-2 v 2 ) . Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36-76 patient ( 18-38 per stratum ) accrue study within 13 month .</detailed_description>
