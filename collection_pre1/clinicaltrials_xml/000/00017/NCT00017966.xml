	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation examine brain control movement send message spinal cord muscle go wrong process disease . Normal healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible participate . In transcranial magnetic stimulation , insulated wire coil place subject 's scalp skin . Brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , participant ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The electrical activity muscle record computer electrode apply skin muscle . In case , study last le 3 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Excitability During Self-Paced Voluntary Movements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate influence volitional movement excitability ipsilateral well contralateral motor cortical neuron control homologous surround muscle . Transcallosal surround inhibition well know phenomenon suppress unwanted movement voluntary action , often disturb various movement disorder . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use investigate inhibitory mechanism , inhibitory influence voluntary movement well elucidate yet . In normal volunteer , plan determine voluntary movement one finger influence cortical excitability responsible surround well contralateral homologous muscle , use voluntary movement-triggered TMS . The primary outcome measure would change motor evoked potential ( MEP ) size intracortical inhibition ( ICI ) parameter .</detailed_description>
