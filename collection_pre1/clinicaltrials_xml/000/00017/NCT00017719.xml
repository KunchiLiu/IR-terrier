	<brief_summary>The best anti-HIV treatment regimen pregnant woman know . Protease inhibitor ( PIs ) often use , side effect may harmful pregnant woman . It known treatment regimen include PIs effective pregnant woman include PIs . This trial compare two anti-HIV treatment plan , one one without PIs , woman start HIV treatment pregnancy .

	<detailed_description>The optimal treatment strategy woman initiate antiretroviral therapy pregnancy know . Although PI-based antiretroviral regimen prescribe increase frequency among pregnant woman , efficacy safety approach unknown . Pregnant woman increase risk glucose intolerance insulin resistance ; PIs associate glucose intolerance . Physiologic difference pregnant woman nonpregnant adult may alter pharmacokinetics antiretroviral regimen . Fetal safety consideration effect perinatal HIV transmission must also consider select antiretroviral regimen pregnant woman . This trial compare PI-based PI-sparing antiretroviral regimen woman initiate antiretroviral therapy pregnancy . Women stratify basis viral load ( 50,000 less copies/ml great 50,000 copies/ml ) gestational age entry ( 20 less week great 20 week ) randomize one two treatment group . Group A receive PI nelfinavir ( NFV ) zidovudine ( ZDV ) lamivudine ( d4T ) ; Group B receive nevirapine ( NVP ) ZDV d4T . Women clinic visit physical obstetrical examination 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week entry every 4 week delivery . After delivery , infant group may receive ZDV 6 week old . Infants evaluate safety test infant 's blood HIV-1 birth Weeks 2 , 8 , 16 , 24 . Women continue assigned antiretroviral therapy postpartum 11 postpartum clinic visit period 2 year . Blood sample woman evaluate safety virologic , pharmacokinetic , metabolic study . The first 12 woman randomize Group A undergo 4-hour pharmacokinetic profile 32 36 week gestation 8 week postpartum determine timing nelfinavir trough . The first 20 woman randomize Group B undergo 8-hour pharmacokinetic profile either 16 24 week 32 36 week gestation 8 week postpartum characterize pharmacokinetics nevirapine steady state pregnancy postpartum period .</detailed_description>
