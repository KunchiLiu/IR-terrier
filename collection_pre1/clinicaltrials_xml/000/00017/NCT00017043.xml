	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Treating Patients With Metastatic Stomach Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical activity BMS-247550 , term response rate , patient previously treat metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma . - Determine safety drug patient . - Assess response duration , time progression , survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2-18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course confirmation CR . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-58 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
