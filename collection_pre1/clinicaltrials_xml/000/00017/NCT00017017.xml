	<brief_title>CT-2103 Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Fallopian Tube Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate time treatment failure patient recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma treat CT-2103 . - Determine tolerability safety previously establish dose schedule CT-2103 patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive CT-2103 IV 10 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If 1 first 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity , remain patient receive high dose CT-2103 . Patients follow 1-3 month every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
