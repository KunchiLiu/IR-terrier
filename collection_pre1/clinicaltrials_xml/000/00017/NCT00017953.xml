The primary hypothesis incidence rate first post-randomization occurrence composite outcome , include cardiovascular death ( include fatal myocardial infarction stroke ) , non-fatal myocardial infarction , hospitalize angina , non-fatal stroke , plan follow-up period 13.5 year reduce among participant assign Lifestyle Intervention compare assign control condition , Diabetes Support Education . Look AHEAD also test reduction incidence three secondary composite outcome examine effect intervention cardiovascular disease risk factor , diabetes control complication , general health , quality life , psychological outcome . The cost cost-effectiveness Lifestyle Intervention relative Diabetes Support Education assess . The Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention end September , 2012 .
