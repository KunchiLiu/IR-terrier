	<brief_title>Mechanisms Linking Depression Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Multiple study demonstrate high risk cardiovascular disease bad cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) prognosis associate depression appear synergistically significantly adversely impact health . Because initial study observational , much work remain understand area . If condition mechanistically inter-related , identification condition subject may provide mean enhance risk stratification appropriately target therapy . If interaction condition causal simply associative , appropriate therapy intervention design test . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The project design clarify role depression CVD risk use co-twin study design . The study examine twin pair Vietnam Era Twin Registry ( VET ) . Twin pair invite participate meet two criterion : ( 1 ) neither history CVD 1990 ( 2 ) one twin diagnose depression 1992 . The study investigate effect depression two indicator `` early '' CVD : coronary flow reserve , assess mean Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) myocardial infusion imaging ; heart rate variability ( HRV ) assess ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring . It hypothesize within pair , twin clinical depression exhibit lower coronary vascular reserve lower heart rate variability compare co-twins without history depression . Moreover , compare size intra-pair difference parameter depression discordant monozygotic dizygotic twin estimate relative contribution gene environmental factor ascertain . In addition PET HRV assessment , subject complete Statistical Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV SCID ) document history depression , psychometric battery include Early Trauma Inventory Hamilton Depression Scale , risk factor cigarette smoking , physical activity , blood pressure blood lipid , glucose insulin , index inflammation thrombogenicity include level reactive protein C , fibrinogen , P-selectin , neurohormone adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol , dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate .</detailed_description>
