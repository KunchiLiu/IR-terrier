	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With Without Epoetin Alfa Treating Patients With Cervical Cancer Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Assess efficacy raise maintain hemoglobin ( Hgb ) level 12.0 g/dL epoetin alfa v maintain Hgb level 10.0 g/dL without epoetin alfa progression-free survival , overall survival , local control anemic patient cervical cancer receive concurrent radiotherapy cisplatin . Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord stage ( IIB vs IIIB v IVA ) , method brachytherapy ( low-dose v high-dose ) , surgical stag para-aortic node ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy comprise pelvic external beam radiotherapy daily five day week 5 week , follow either 1 2 implant low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy 5 fraction high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy , follow 3-5 day parametrial boost radiotherapy . Patients receive cisplatin IV concurrently pelvic external beam radiotherapy day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , week parametrial boost radiotherapy . Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy chemotherapy arm I. Additionally , patient receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously weekly concurrently radiotherapy chemotherapy . Quality life assess baseline , week 3 6 , within 1 week last brachytherapy , every 3 month 2 year . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 460 patient accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
