	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study well monoclonal antibody therapy peripheral stem cell transplant work treat patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Peripheral stem cell transplant may allow doctor give high dos monoclonal antibody kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose IDEC-Y2B8 administer rituximab vivo purge autologous stem cell rescue . II . To obtain correlative laboratory data vivo purge rituximab patient 0-35 % marrow involvement . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ( IDEC-Y2B8 ) . PART I : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 25 . Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day 26 continue autologous peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) harvest . PART II : Beginning 4-6 week completion fourth rituximab infusion , patient receive indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute day 1 follow dosimetry image day 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 . Patients receive IDEC-Y2B8 IV 10 minute day 8-15 . The initial 3 patient receive dose IDEC-Y2B8 subsequent cohort 3-5 patient receive escalate dos IDEC-Y2B8 maximum tolerate dose determine . PART III : All patient undergo PBSC transplantation ( PBSCT ) begin residual bone marrow radioactivity resolve . G-CSF administer SC begin 1 day PBSCT continue blood count recover . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
