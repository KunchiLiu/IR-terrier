	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness bevacizumab combine vinorelbine treat patient stage IV breast cancer . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining monoclonal antibody chemotherapy may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Plus Vinorelbine Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete partial response rate patient stage IV breast cancer treat concurrent bevacizumab vinorelbine . II . Determine side effect regimen patient . III . Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . IV . Determine time study ( reflection time progression , treatment-related side effect , patient preference ) patient treat regimen . V. Assess urine protein/creatinine ratio serum complement level screen measure renal injury patient treat bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every week vinorelbine IV 6-10 minute weekly 8 week . Treatment repeat every 8 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete partial response stable disease completion fourth course may receive additional course concurrent bevacizumab vinorelbine administer every week may continue therapy schedule . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
