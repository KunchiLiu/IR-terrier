	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine arsenic trioxide dexamethasone treat patient recurrent refractory stage II stage III multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Stage II Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient recurrent refractory stage II III multiple myeloma treat arsenic trioxide dexamethasone . - Determine rate overall relapse-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety profile treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV daily 5 day first week 2 day week thereafter . Patients also receive IV oral dexamethasone day 1-4 every 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Disease assessment conduct every 4 week . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course therapy initial determination CR . Final assessment conduct 4 week last study treatment annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
