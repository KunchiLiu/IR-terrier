	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Immunosuppressive therapy may improve bone marrow abnormality may effective treatment myelodysplastic syndrome . It yet know whether immunosuppressive therapy effective supportive care treat myelodysplastic syndrome . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness antithymocyte globulin supportive care treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antithymocyte Globulin Compared With Supportive Care Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare clinical response rate patient early myelodysplastic syndrome treat rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin v standard supportive care . - Evaluate safety anti-thymocyte globulin patient . - Compare time duration clinical response , rate partial response therapy failure , rate disease progression patient treat regimen . - Compare ECOG performance score , number transfusion and/or growth factor use , maximum time transfusion patient treat regimen . - Compare infection risk , use medical resource , quality clinical response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) subtype ( refractory anemia ( RA ) v RA excess blast hypocellular MDS ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) IV least 8-12 hour day 1-4 . - Arm II : Patients receive standard supportive therapy 6 month . At end 6 month , patient may receive ATG arm I . Patients follow 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 72 patient ( 48 arm I 24 arm II ) accrue within minimum 6 month .</detailed_description>
