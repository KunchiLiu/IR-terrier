	<brief_summary>The purpose measure effectiveness recombinant human interleukin-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) treat asthma . Asthma cause allergic response breathe certain irritant . Interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) , naturally produce body , play major role allergic response . Doctors feel IL-4 activity may stop give IL-4R , product bind IL-4 , thereby decrease problem asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human IL-4 Receptor Used Treatment Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major factor pathogenesis asthma development allergic inflammatory response inhale antigen . Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) play key role response . Binding inactivate IL-4 molecule IL-4R may diminish allergic asthmatic response inhibit activity IL-4 . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment group , within group , stratify baseline FEV1 cohort . Patients receive either dose level 1 IL-4R , dose level 2 IL-4R , placebo , aerosol drug delivery device , week 12 week . There frequent clinic visit several follow-up visit . Physical exam spirometry do regularly ; immunization administer Day 28 ; skin test panel give Day 84 . Blood sample collect study visit treatment follow-up test immunology/serology parameter , chemistry profile , asthma-related DNA polymorphism . Patients provide peak flow meter must demonstrate proper use peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) diary symptom diary maintain . Selected site measure exhale nitric oxide collect induce sputum sample . Assessments adverse event conduct 16 40 week follow first study drug treatment .</detailed_description>
