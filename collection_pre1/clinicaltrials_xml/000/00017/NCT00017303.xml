	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . IM-862 may kill tumor cell stop blood flow tumor stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy IM-862 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy IM-862 treat patient resect stage III ovarian cancer primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus IM-862 Treating Patients With Resected Stage III Ovarian Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete pathologic response rate second-look surgery patient optimally resect stage III ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer treat adjuvant paclitaxel , carboplatin , IM-862 . II . Determine safety profile regimen patient population . III . Determine incidence infectious hematologic complication patient treat regimen . IV . Determine progression-free survival patient disease minimal disease burden initial therapy , treat IM-862 consolidation therapy . V. Correlate angiogenesis marker immunologic parameter response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center . Patients randomize one three IM-862 dos . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment IM-862 begin within 10 day chemotherapy initiation continue clinical evidence disease progression 3 day second-look surgery . Arm I : Patients receive low-dose IM-862 2 placebo dos intranasally daily . Arm II : Patients receive medium-dose IM-862 2 placebo dos arm I . Arm III : Patients receive higher-dose IM-862 intranasally three time daily . Patients undergo second-look surgery within 4-8 week completion last course chemotherapy . Patients complete pathologic response microscopically detectable residual disease receive consolidation therapy IM-862 , accord original treatment arm . Consolidation therapy begin within 3-14 day second-look surgery continue 24 week absence disease progression . Patients follow 6 12 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 180 patient ( 60 per arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
