	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen may increase effectiveness dexamethasone make cancer cell sensitive drug . It yet know dexamethasone effective without oblimersen treat multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness dexamethasone without oblimersen treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone With Without Oblimersen Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare time disease progression patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat dexamethasone without oblimersen . - Compare duration response objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare proportion patient without disease progression 6 month proportion patient discontinue treatment 6 month two patient group . - Compare safety regimens patient . - Compare survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior therapy ( relapse vs refractory ) , prior autologous stem cell transplantation ( yes v ) , number prior therapy regimen ( 1-2 v 3-6 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I - Induction : Patients receive oblimersen ( G3139 ) IV continuously day 1-7 15-21 oral dexamethasone daily day 4-7 , 11-14 , 18-21 . - Maintenance : One week completion induction therapy , patient stable responsive disease receive G3139 IV continuously day 1-7 oral dexamethasone daily day 4-7 . Courses repeat every 3 week maximum 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II - Induction : Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily 4 day week 1-3 . - Maintenance : One week completion induction therapy , patient stable responsive disease receive oral dexamethasone daily 4 day . Courses repeat every 3 week maximum 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 200 patient ( 100 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
