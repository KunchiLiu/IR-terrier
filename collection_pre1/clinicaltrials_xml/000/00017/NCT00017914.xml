Myositis inflammatory muscle disease damage muscle organ , result significant disability . Children adult polymyositis dermatomyositis relate condition may evaluate study . Healthy child adult also enrol `` control , '' comparison test result . All patient undergo complete history ( include complete questionnaire ) physical examination , review medical record , blood urine test . Patients may choose participate additional 1- 5-day evaluation , include follow diagnostic , treatment research procedure : 1 . Standardized muscle strength testing , range motion joint walk ( gait ) analysis physiotherapist ; completion questionnaire regard ability perform daily task 2 . Skin assessment , possibly include photograph lesion skin biopsy ( removal small skin sample local anesthetic ) 3 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( scan use magnetic field visualize tissue ) leg muscle 4 . Swallowing study , include physical examination questionnaire swallow ability , study tongue strength , ultrasound image swallowing , possibly , modify barium swallow 5 . Voice speech assessment , possibly include computerized voice analysis laryngoscopy-analysis larynx ( voice box ) use small rigid scope camera place mouth view record vocal cord function 6 . Pulmonary function test ( measurement air move lung , use breathe machine ) evaluate lung function , possibly , chest X-ray 7 .
