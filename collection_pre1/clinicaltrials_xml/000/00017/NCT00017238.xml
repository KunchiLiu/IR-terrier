	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish MTD identify DLTs investigational agent KRN5500 administer 72-hr continuous i.v . infusion patient solid tumor fail standard therapy standard therapy exist . II . To establish assess safety appropriate dose phase II study . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics KRN5500 patient administer 72 hr continuous IV infusion . IV . To characterize response KRN5500 FLT-PET scan MTD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe preliminary evidence antitumor activity . II . Establish pharmacodynamic relationship pharmacological effect drug upon surrogate marker activity host toxicity . III . To compare toxicity profile 1 hr i.v . infusion 72 hr continuous i.v . infusion administration schedule . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive KRN5500 IV 24-72 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-3 patient receive KRN5500 start dose escalate infusion duration . After long duration infusion time safely reach , cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos KRN5500 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient accrue receive treatment KRN5500 recommend phase II dose . Patients follow every 4 week resolution toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 9-12 month .</detailed_description>
