	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development cancer . It yet know whether fenretinide give surgery effective prevent ovarian cancer surgery alone . PURPOSE : Randomized clinical trial compare effectiveness fenretinide follow surgery surgery alone prevent ovarian cancer patient increase risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fenretinide Followed Surgery Compared With Surgery Alone Preventing Ovarian Cancer Patients Increased Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare frequency histopathology marker precursor lesion ovary , include surface papillomatosis , invagination , pseudostratification , inclusion cyst , remove patient increase risk ovarian cancer receive fenretinide v undergo immediate oophorectomy . - Determine relative abundance marker cell proliferation apoptosis cancer-prone ovary patient treat fenretinide . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo prophylactic oophorectomy . - Arm II : Patients receive oral fenretinide daily 27 day every 30 day 6-8 week . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity diagnosis malignancy . After completion fenretinide , patient undergo prophylactic oophorectomy . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 71 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
