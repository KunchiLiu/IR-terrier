	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Stomach Cancer That Has Been Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical activity BMS-247550 term response rate patient recurrent metastatic gastric cancer previously treat fluoropyrimidine platinum regimen . II . Determine safety drug patient population . III . Determine duration response , time progression , survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course CR . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-58 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
