	<detailed_description>Neurological complication HIV infection common significant source mortality morbidity . The associated risk factor clearly define . Several study patient suit analysis peripheral neuropathy address important clinical question subject asymptomatic neuropathy risk progress painful neuropathy . Some patient population advance HIV disease likely asymptomatic peripheral neuropathy baseline , present excellent opportunity prospective study . Detailed quantitative assessment carry determine incidence course peripheral neuropathy population . Risk factor development new peripheral neuropathy , worsen exist neuropathy , progression symptomatic peripheral neuropathy , CD4+ cell count , HIV-1 viral load , prior nucleoside analogue use , evaluate . The potential additive neurotoxic effect hydroxyurea exposure population also analyze . HIV-infected patient characterize presence absence neuropathy [ AS PER AMENDMENT 03/05/02 : screening ] , baseline , Week 24 , Week 48 . Entry variable analyze determine predictor progression asymptomatic symptomatic neuropathy worsen symptomatic neuropathy . HIV-uninfected control volunteer 1 visit [ AS PER AMENDMENT 03/05/02 : 2 visit ] nerve conduction Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) evaluation demonstrate proficiency test method prior enrollment HIV-infected patient . HIV-infected patient evaluate component Total Neuropathy Score ( TNS ) include sign ( motor function , sensory function , reflex ) , symptom ( motor symptom sensory symptom ) , QST ( CASE IV - vibratory , cooling , heat pain threshold ) , nerve conduction study ( sural nerve peroneal nerve ) . Other evaluation include Gracely Pain Scale Visual Analog Scale pain diary , pair skin biopsy right thigh distal leg ( total 2 ) , peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis quantitation mitochondrial DNA content entry final study visit .</detailed_description>
