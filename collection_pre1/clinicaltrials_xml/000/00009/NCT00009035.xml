	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation patient brain spinal cord tumor . Its purpose threefold : 1 ) allow physician NIH Neuro-Oncology Branch increase knowledge course central nervous system tumor identify area need research ; 2 ) inform participant new study National Cancer Institute center develop ; 3 ) provide patient consultation possible treatment option . Children ( least 1 year old ) adult primary malignant brain spinal cord tumor may eligible study . Participants medical history , physical neurological examination routine blood test . They may also undergo one follow procedure : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) MRI diagnostic tool use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays show detailed change brain structure chemistry . For procedure , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . A contrast material call gadolinium may use ( injected vein ) enhance image . The procedure take hour , patient speak staff member via intercom system time . - Computed axial tomography ( CAT CT ) CT specialized form X-ray imaging produce 3-dimensional image brain section . The scanner ring device surround patient contains moveable X-ray source . The scan take 30 minute may do without use contrast dye . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET diagnostic test base difference cell take use glucose ( sugar ) , one body main fuel . The patient give injection radioactive glucose . A special camera surround patient detects radiation emit radioactive material produce image show much glucose use various tissue . Fast-growing cell , tumor , take use glucose normal cell , therefore , scan might indicate overall activity aggressiveness tumor . The procedure take hour . When test complete , physician discus result potential treatment option patient . Follow-up vary accord individual . Some patient may end study one visit NIH , others may follow NIH regularly , conjunction local physician . Patients aggressive tumor may see every 3 4 month , less active tumor may see every 6 12 month . Permission may request telephone follow-up ( patient physician ) patient see regularly NIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : This protocol design evaluate patient tumor central nervous system ( CNS ) appear probable candidate future protocol entry disease manifestation unique scientific interest , importance , and/or educational value . Objective : To evaluate patient tumors central nervous system ( CNS ) probable future candidate NCI Phase I II protocol . To follow patient tumor CNS representative important scientific and/or clinical principle . To allow steady flow patient tumor CNS NIH purpose educate nurse , medical student , resident , clinical fellow , physician management care specialize subgroup cancer patient . Eligibility : All patient great 12 month age tumor CNS interest NOB , may candidate another NOB trial point future . Patients tumor CNS particular interest member NOB pose important clinical and/or scientific question and/or shed light important aspect disease . Patients tumor CNS offer important educational benefit neuro-oncology trainee staff . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Availability parent legal guardian give inform consent child . Design : All patient undergo initial evaluation Clinical Center member NOB past medical oncologic history obtain well relevant data neuroimaging pathology review . A total 3,000 patient accrue study . Patients may see NIH Clinical Center vary interval depend clinical situation data related natural history disease course outcome collect least every six month .</detailed_description>
