	<brief_title>Fenretinide Treating Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy fenretinide , term complete partial response rate , duration response , survival , patient recurrent small cell lung cancer . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Correlate induction apoptosis expression molecular mediator apoptosis tumor cell response rate , response duration , survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily day 1-7 . Treatment continue every 21 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
