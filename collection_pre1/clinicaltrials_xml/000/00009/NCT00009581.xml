	<brief_summary>Nitric oxide important regulating blood vessel dilation , consequently , blood flow . This gas continuously produce cell line blood vessel . It also transport lung hemoglobin red blood cell . This study examine gas regulate blood vessel blood flow people sickle cell anemia . It also look possible benefit use certain genetic information compare white blood cell people sickle cell anemia without disease . Patients sickle cell anemia healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , cardiovascular physical examination , electrocardiogram routine blood test . Participation volunteer without sickle cell anemia limit single blood draw genetic study . Sickle cell disease patient undergo follow procedure : Patients lie recline chair study . After administration local anesthetic , small tube insert needle artery vein patient 's forearm . These used measure blood pressure draw blood sample study . Forearm blood flow measure use pressure cuff place wrist upper arm , strain gauge ( rubber band device ) place around forearm . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge , flow measurement record . A small lamp position hand . Light reflect back hand provide information nitric oxide hemoglobin blood skin . A squeezing device call dynamometer use measure handgrip strength . Baseline blood flow , nitric oxide , hemoglobin , handgrip measure infusion glucose ( sugar ) water . These measurement repeat various time , administration small dos follow drug : - Sodium nitroprusside - cause blood vessel dilate increase blood flow heart - Acetylcholine - cause blood vessel dilate slows heart rate - LNMMA - decrease blood flow block production nitric oxide There 20- 30-minute rest period injection different drug . When test complete , patient breathe mixture room air nitric oxide 1 hour facemask place face , forearm blood flow light reflect hand measure . Then patient handgrip exercise 5 minute , blood flow hand lamp measurement take . After 20-minute rest period ( continued breathing room air/nitric oxide ) , L-NMMA infuse . The handgrip exercise , blood flow hand lamp measurement repeat . The face mask remove , tube remove 20 minute later . Blood sample collect various time 5- 6-hour study tube arm . Some blood use look gene make protein involve cell-to-cell communication , inflammation , make red white blood cell stick line blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anemia autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 % African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 % sickle cell trait . Acute pain crisis acute chest syndrome common complication sickle cell anemia . Inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) propose possible therapy acute chest syndrome . Anecdotally , NO describe rapidly improve hypoxemia clinical course acute chest syndrome . Furthermore , number recent study suggest NO may favorable impact sickle red cell molecular level could improve abnormal microvascular perfusion characteristic sickle cell anemia . This clinical trial design test hypotheses 1 ) individual sickle cell anemia endothelial dysfunction reduce local synthesis release NO , may reduce regional perfusion rest impair vasodilator response stress , 2 ) NO inhalation , delivery NO bound hemoglobin enhance improve abnormality regional vascular perfusion . Studies perform untreated sickle cell anemia patient patient manage chronic hydroxyurea therapy . Demonstration improve regional perfusion NO therapy could significant implication patient management acute pain crisis acute chest syndrome .</detailed_description>
