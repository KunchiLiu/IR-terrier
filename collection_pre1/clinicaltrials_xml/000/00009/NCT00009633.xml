	<detailed_description>The NICHD Neonatal Research Network 's Follow-Up study multi-center cohort study survive extremely low birth-weight infant undergo neurodevelopmental , neurosensory functional assessment 22-26 month correct age ( Infants bear prior July 1 , 2012 see 18-22 month correct age ) . The goal study identify potential maternal neonatal risk factor may affect infant neurodevelopment , include : - Evaluating development motor skill , cognitive skill , language behavior - Determining mortality prevalence specific medical condition - Assessing relationship growth neurodevelopmental outcome - Assessing relationship socioeconomic status developmental outcome - Identifying significant family stress population compliance medical developmental care - Assessing use special support service early intervention program population - Evaluating need follow-up school age . The scheduled evaluation collect : demographic information ; socioeconomic status ; medical history ; medication ; medical equipment require ; growth data ; detail neurologic examination ; Bayley Scales Infant Development ( mental , motor , infant behavior ) ; Child Behavior Checklist . A sub-study ass reference group comprise limited number healthy term infant bear Network center meet following three aim : 1 ) avoid potential ascertainment bias due examiner expectation extremely preterm high-risk infant assess 2 ) absence well-developed norm Bayley Scales , define threshold impairment base data representative sample healthy child born term center concurrently assess examiner high-risk infant ; 3 ) help identify address `` drift '' occurs time conduct score Bayley assessment .</detailed_description>
