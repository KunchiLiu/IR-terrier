	<brief_title>SU5416 Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical activity SU5416 patient progressive metastatic renal cancer fail prior biologic therapy fluorouracil-containing regimen . II . Determine change tumor perfusion patient treat regimen . III . Determine time progression survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive SU5416 IV 1 hour twice weekly . Treatment continue every 6 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive additional 6 month therapy achieve CR . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
