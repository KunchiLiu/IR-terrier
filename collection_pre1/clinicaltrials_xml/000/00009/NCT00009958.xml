	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity profile novel CEA-based vaccine , rF-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM ( recombinant fowlpox-CEA ( 6D ) -B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3 ) , either alone combination second vaccine , rV-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM ( recombinant vaccinia-CEA ( 6D ) -B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3 ) patient advance CEA-bearing cancer . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity profile novel CEA-based vaccine rV-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM give combination maximum tolerate dose rF-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM , patient advance CEA-bearing cancer . III . To determine safety impact colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) immunologic response , give conjunction combination rV-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM ( MTD ) rF-CEA ( 6D ) -TRICOM ( MTD ) vaccine , patient advance CEA-bearing cancer . IV . To determine change CAP-1 directed T cell patient treat vaccine use ELISPOT assay analysis . V. To perform pilot analysis impact vaccine therapy quantity circulate CEA-positive cell patient treat study order develop eventually validate practical , intermediate bio-marker immunologic response vaccine . VI . To document objective anti-tumor response occur . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM ( fCEA-TRI ) vaccine vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM ( vCEA-TRI ) vaccine . STAGE I : Patients receive fCEA-TRI vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1 , 29 , 57 , 85 . Cohorts 3-10 patient receive escalate dos fCEA-TRI vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . STAGE II : Patients receive vCEA-TRI vaccine intradermally day 1 fCEA-TRI vaccine SC MTD determine stage I daily day 29 , 57 , 85 . Cohorts 3-10 patient receive escalate dos vCEA-TRI vaccine MTD determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience DLT . STAGE III : A single cohort 6-10 patient receive vaccine stage II , MTDs determine stage I II , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC daily day 1-4 , 29-32 , 57-60 , 85-88 . Patients stage study respond disease may receive additional dos fCEA-TRI vaccine monthly 2 month every 3 month thereafter . Patients objective evidence response ( include mixed response ) and/or fall elevate serum CEA level sixth vaccine subsequently develop disease progression extend every 3-month treatment schedule potentially well treatment alternative available may continue treatment per monthly vaccination schedule 2 additional month . Patients stable respond disease two monthly vaccine may continue monthly vaccine discretion principal investigator . Patients follow 4 week monthly 3 month .</detailed_description>
