	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine HIV examine whether cause immune response HIV virus protein . A vaccine give try create resistance immunity disease infection . The vaccine study make DNA ( genetic material ) two HIV protein call `` gag '' `` pol . '' Injected human , viral DNA instruct body make small amount HIV proteins . This study see body create immune response protein . Study participant catch HIV AIDS DNA vaccine protein may make . Healthy normal volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Candidates provide medical history , include information sexual activity drug use . They physical examination , blood test , urine test chest X-ray . All candidate enrol study must use barrier method contraception sexual intercourse start study 3 month last vaccination . Participants assign one two treatment group : one receive experimental vaccine ; receive control substance ( inactive salt solution ) . The first five people assigned vaccine group receive low study dose vaccine . If dose safe , increase three time next group five eight time last group five . Each group total seven people - five receive vaccine two get salt solution . Before first injection , possibly second third , catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place vein treatment give quickly reaction vaccine . Participants receive three injection upper arm muscle-one injection month three months-with needle-less device call Biojector . For injection , volunteer - observe least 1 hour immunization - record temperature symptom , include effect injection site , 2 day report clinic staff - immediately report side effect study physician nurse . Volunteers physical examination laboratory test certain time receive vaccine period afterwards . These procedure require 14 clinic visit 1 2 hour , 6 hour vaccination day . Blood drawn visit . Some blood use genetic test , stored future test immune system body 's response study vaccine . The study last 12 month date first injection . After complete , clinic staff may contact volunteer twice year least 3 year follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I randomize , control , double-blinded dose escalation study examine toxicity , dose immune response HIV plasmid DNA vaccine . The vector use study optimize improved safety , expression immunogenicity . We hypothesize vaccine elicit immune response HIV . All work conduct National Institutes Health . Healthy , HIV-negative volunteer recruit pre-screened confirm meet eligibility requirement participation . Educational material DNA vaccine review provided participant enrollment study . There 3 group 7 volunteer . Each group receive constant dose vaccine pGag ( del f ) Pol delta PR delta RT delta IN/h ( 5 people ) phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) control ( 2 people ) intramuscular inoculation . Once safety establish , successive group receive high dose . Study group receive three immunization contain either 0.5 mg ( Group 1 ) , 1.5 mg ( Group 2 ) , 4.0 mg ( Group 3 ) DNA vaccine . Dose escalation initiate 5 week last volunteer previous dose group receive first inoculation , provide significant toxicity . Vaccine-related adverse reaction evaluate schedule study visit study participant report . Immune response evaluate described Appendix II . Specimens evaluate immunogenicity take baseline , time point indicate Appendix VIII . Unless contraindicate , subsequent inoculation use repeat plasmid vaccination give 28 56 day first vaccination . The estimated duration volunteer complete immunization follow-up 12 month .</detailed_description>

Individuals history cancer unless surgical excision follow sufficient observation period give reasonable assurance cure Medical psychiatric condition preclude subject compliance protocol . Evidence active drug alcohol abuse Tested positive HIV time . Live attenuate vaccine ( include limit measles , mumps , rubella BCG ) within 60 day study ( note : medically indicate subunit kill vaccine ( e.g. , influenza , pneumococcal ) exclusionary , give least 2 week away HIV immunization ) Use experimental agent within 30 day prior study Receipt blood product immunoglobulin past 6 month Any history anaphylaxis history serious adverse reaction vaccine Prior receipt HIV1 vaccine Pregnant lactate woman Acute infectious illness within 1 month prior initiation immunization History splenectomy Seizure disorder . A participant remote history ( 3 year ) seizure receive medication 3 year eligible : 1. seizure febrile seizure age 2 ; 2. secondary alcohol withdrawal ; 3. singular seizure . Treatment immunomodulators , except NSAIDS , within 14 day prior enrollment Skin disease ( e.g. , eczema , psoriasis ) affect area immunization precludes immunization</criteria>
