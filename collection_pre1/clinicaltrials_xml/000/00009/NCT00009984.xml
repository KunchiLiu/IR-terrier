	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study thalidomide fludarabine see well work compare thalidomide alone treat patient hematologic cancer respond previous treatment fludarabine . Thalidomide may stop growth hematologic cancer stop blood flow cancer . Combining thalidomide fludarabine may increase effectiveness chemotherapy make cancer cell sensitive drug . It yet know whether thalidomide effective without fludarabine hematologic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide With Without Fludarabine Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare safety tolerability thalidomide without fludarabine patient fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . II . Compare incidence complete partial remission patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients stratify accord time relapse last fludarabine treatment ( le 6 month vs 6 month ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive thalidomide arm I fludarabine IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment fludarabine repeat every 28 day 6 course . Once fludarabine complete , patient continue receive thalidomide alone arm I . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-70 patient ( 12-35 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
