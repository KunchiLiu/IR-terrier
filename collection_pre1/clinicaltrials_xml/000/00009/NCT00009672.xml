Nortriptyline inert placebo-Patients take nortriptyline dos range 25 mg. 100 mg. inert placebo morphine . ( An inert placebo dummy pill ; look like test drug active ingredient . ) 2 . MS Contin ( morphine ) inert placebo-Patients take MS Contin dose range 30 mg. 90 mg. inert placebo nortriptyline . 3 . Nortriptyline MS Contin-Patients take MS Contin nortriptyline dose range drug alone . 4 . Active placebo inactive placebo-Patients take active placebo-in case benztropine-and inert placebo . An active placebo drug work problem study whose side effect like test drug-in case , slight sleepiness dry mouth . Benztropine give one-third recommended dosage .
