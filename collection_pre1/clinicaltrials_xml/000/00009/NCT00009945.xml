	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Clodronate may effective prevent spread cancer bone part body . It yet know whether clodronate effective alone combine chemotherapy /or hormonal therapy prevent metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial determine effectiveness clodronate without chemotherapy /or hormonal therapy prevent metastasis woman stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clodronate With Without Chemotherapy and/or Hormonal Therapy Treating Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether clodronate administer alone addition adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy improve disease-free survival woman early stage breast cancer . - Determine whether clodronate reduces incidence skeletal metastases non-skeletal metastasis patient . - Determine whether clodronate improves overall relapse-free survival patient . - Determine whether clodronate reduces incidence skeletal morbidity ( e.g. , skeletal fracture , hypercalcemia , skeletal pain , need radiotherapy , spinal cord compression ) patient . - Investigate relevance serum marker bone turnover prognostic factor development bone metastasis patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratified age ( 50 vs 50 ) , number positive lymph node ( 0 vs 1-3 v 4 ) , hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] progesterone receptor [ PR ] negative v ER and/or PR positive ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Patients arms commence treatment within 2 week randomization continue treatment 3 year absence bone metastasis unacceptable toxicity . Study medication must continue case document visceral soft tissue metastasis event without skeletal metastasis . Patients arm may also receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen discretion protocol investigator . Patients receive hormonal therapy begin hormonal therapy within 3-12 week last dose chemotherapy continue minimum 5 year . Patients undergone prior lumpectomy receive adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy . Patients undergone prior mastectomy may receive radiotherapy investigator 's discretion . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3,323 patient accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Patients must undergo either total mastectomy lumpectomy either axillary dissection sentinel node biopsy . If sentinel node histologically positive H &amp; E , histologically suspicious H &amp; E confirm positive immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , patient must completion axillary dissection . The tumor must invasive adenocarcinoma histologic examination clinical assessment T13 , N01 , M0 . Patients must participate clinical trial systemic therapy earlystage breast cancer . Patients may participate follow radiation therapy trial : Nodepositive patient may participate National Cancer Institute Canada Clinical Trials Group protocol MA.20 , provide requirement B34 protocol continue meet . ( Nodenegative B34 patient may participate MA.20 . ) Nodepositive mastectomy patient may participate Southwest Oncology Group protocol S9927 , provide requirement B34 protocol continue meet . Patients must analysis estrogen progesterone receptor primary tumor perform prior randomization . Tumors define ER progesterone receptor ( PgR ) positive : 1 ) Dextrancoated charcoal sucrosedensity gradient method show great equal 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein , 2 ) use individual laboratory criterion show positive enzyme immunoassay method ( EIA ) immunocytochemical assay . `` Marginal borderline , '' result ( i.e. , definitively negative ) also consider positive . At time randomization , patient must follow within past 3 month : history physical exam , bone scan , thoracic lumbar spine xrays , chest xray . Within past 12 month patient must gynecologic exam ( woman uterus take tamoxifen ) bilateral mammogram . At time randomization : postoperative absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1500/mm3 ( less 1500/mm3 , opinion investigator , represent ethnic racial variation normal ) ; postoperative platelet count must great equal 100,000 ; must postoperative evidence adequate hepatic function , i.e. , total bilirubin upper limit normal ( ULN ) laboratory ; alkaline phosphatase le 2.5 x ULN ; serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGOT ) / aspartate transaminase ( AST ) less 1.5 x ULN ; must postoperative evidence adequate renal function ( serum creatinine within less laboratory 's normal range ) . Serum albumin serum calcium must within normal limit . A patient skeletal pain eligible inclusion study bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails disclose metastatic disease . Suspicious finding must confirm benign xray , MRI , biopsy . Patients prior nonbreast malignancy eligible disease free great equal 5 year randomization deem low risk recurrence treat physician . Patients squamous basal cell carcinoma skin effectively treat , carcinoma situ cervix treat surgery , lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) ipsilateral contralateral breast treat hormone therapy and/or surgery eligible , even diagnose within 5 year randomization . Patients must Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Special condition eligibility lumpectomy patient : Irradiation surgery . Patients treat lumpectomy axillary node dissection ( axillary dissection sentinel node biopsy negative ) follow breast radiation therapy must meet eligibility criterion addition following : Generally , lumpectomy reserved tumor le 5 cm . However , investigator 's discretion , patient treat lumpectomy tumor great equal 5 cm eligible . The margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . For patient pathologic examination demonstrate tumor present line resection , additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin . This permissible even axillary dissection perform . Patients tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) must undergo total mastectomy eligible . Ineligibility . Significant nonmalignant bone disease likely interfere interpretation bone xrays . Ulceration , erythema , infiltration skin underlie chest wall ( complete fixation ) , peau d'orange , skin edema magnitude . ( Tethering dimple skin nipple inversion interpret skin infiltration . Patients condition eligible . ) Ipsilateral lymph node clinical examination find fixed one another structure ( cN2 disease ) . Suspicious palpable node contralateral axilla palpable supraclavicular infraclavicular node , unless biopsy evidence involve tumor . Prior therapy breast cancer , include irradiation , chemotherapy , biotherapy , and/or hormonal therapy , exception tamoxifen . Tamoxifen may give adjuvant therapy study entry , start within 28 day randomization . Patients start tamoxifen within 28 day randomization consider chemotherapy must tamoxifen stop start chemotherapy . Prior history breast cancer , except LCIS . Any sex hormonal therapy , e.g. , birth control pill , ovarian hormonal replacement therapy , etc . ( These patient eligible therapy discontinue prior randomization . ) Exceptions : patient may use lowdose estrogen vaginal cream Estring® symptomatic vaginal dryness , raloxifene ( selective estrogen receptor modulators [ SERMs ] ) prevention osteoporosis , luteinizinghormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonists/antagonists purpose medical ovarian ablation component adjuvant therapy breast cancer . Patients currently take alendronate ( Fosamax® ) bisphosphonates calcitonin treat prevent osteoporosis eligible . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient subject treatment option would prevent prolonged followup . Psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . This protocol exclude pregnant lactate woman effect clodronate woman study fully . Bilateral malignancy mass mammographic abnormality opposite breast suspicious malignancy unless biopsy proof mass malignant . Special condition ineligibility lumpectomy patient : Irradiation surgery . The following patient also ineligible : Patients diffuse tumor ( demonstrated mammography ) would consider surgically amenable lumpectomy . Patients treat lumpectomy another clinically dominant mass mammographically suspicious abnormality within ipsilateral breast remnant . Such mass must biopsied demonstrate histologically benign prior randomization , malignant , must surgically remove clear margin . Patients margin resect specimen involve invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . Additional surgical resection obtain free margin allow . Patients tumor still present additional resection ( ) must undergo mastectomy eligible .</criteria>
