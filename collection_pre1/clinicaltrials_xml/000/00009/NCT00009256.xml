	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain knowledge drug therapy sometimes stop work people infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . This occur 30 40 % patient treat powerful antiretroviral drug . The study examine virus become resistant drug treatment mutation ( change ) different mutation produce new variant resistant one drug . HIV-infected patient 18 year older treat antiretroviral medication relatively stable amount virus blood ( viral load ) may eligible study . Pregnant breastfeed woman may participate . Candidates screen blood test determine viral load study genetics virus . Participants hospitalize NIH Clinical Center 10 day daily blood sampling . ( In exceptional circumstance , sample may do outpatient basis . ) After discharge , patient follow weekly visit blood test total 120 day . When antiretroviral treatment begin , patient may one following : 1 . Continue study antiretroviral treatment . Therapy consist D4T , 3TC , efavirenz . Other drug may substitute tolerate . HIV protease inhibitor include regimen . 2 . Complete participation study , eligible , enroll another NIH protocol ( AVBIO ) . 3 . Begin standard antiretroviral therapy private physician . Patients treatment yet recommend choose treat may continue monitor blood test total 18 month . ( Patients leave study time may re-join decide start treatment . ) Participants may also undergo follow optional procedure study genetic variation HIV : lymph node biopsy , spinal tap , semen donation female genital wash collect secretion sample . Sexual partner needle-sharing partner study patient invite enroll study provide blood sample time patient enrolls two interval needle share unsafe sex event may report NIH . Partners may also donate genital secretion semen , lymph node spinal fluid sample . Information study may help development new drug treatment effective control HIV infection treatment longer work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis HIV Genetic Variation Patients Before Beginning Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) result progressive immune destruction death . Current therapy HIV ( highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART ) infection utilizes combination drug , optimum condition , inhibit HIV replication , halt progressive immunodeficiency , permit measure immunological reconstitution . In present form , however , HAART inadequate . HAART cure HIV infection , significant adverse side effect , may require drug discontinuation . One challenge limitation HAART development drug resistance , may occur 30-40 % treated patient . The precise mechanism responsible drug resistance remain uncertain , explanation include emergence HIV variant encode genetic mutation confer resistance antiretroviral drug . Such drug resistant mutation may occur present low frequency prior drug therapy . Understanding mutation arise remain circulating population HIV uncertain . The purpose present protocol derive comprehensive description HIV population genetics longitudinal , observational study HIV-infected patient prior initiate antiretroviral therapy . We plan utilize frequent blood sample extensive sequencing strategy investigate parameter HIV population genetics , include : ) genotypic phenotypic analyse HIV drug resistance mutation , b ) determination rate mutation arise , become fix , lose , undergo recombination , c ) linkage analysis , ) estimate size effective virus population . We plan apply information develop model HIV evolution , predict genetic behavior HIV population , include emergence resistant genome . We expect information regard HIV population genetics may assist design appropriate drug regimens salvage control HIV virus replication initial regimen fail .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HIV infection document ELISA/WB . Viral load document clinic great equal 1000 copy RNA/ml plasma one occasion . At least 18 year age . For woman childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test require within 14 day prior enrollment . Able provide write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Absence HIV infection within 8 week prior entry , document negative HIV ELISA WB within 8 week screen positive ELISA WB . Use immunosuppressants cytotoxic agent , exception corticosteroid . Presence active AIDS defining opportunistic infection malignancy require cytotoxic chemotherapy . Malignancies require systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , low grade nonprogressive KS , skin cancer treat excision exclusion criterion . Prior antiretroviral therapy nucleoside nonnucleoside RT inhibitor protease inhibitor define : therapy last 5 year ; 4 day protease inhibitor NNRTIs ever take ; 2 week NRTIs ever take . Psychiatric illness opinion PI might interfere study compliance . Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety . Refusal practice safer sex practice use precaution prevent pregnancy ( effective barrier birth control abstinence ) .</criteria>
