	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Doses STI571 Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall progression-free survival patient CD117-expressing metastatic unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor treat two different dos imatinib mesylate . II . Compare confirm , unconfirmed , complete , partial response rate patient treat regimen . III . Compare toxic effect regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily . Arm II : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm I progressive disease may cross arm II receive treatment absence disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 600 patient accrue study within 24 month .</detailed_description>
