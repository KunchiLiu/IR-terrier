	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness renal ( kidney ) transplantation HIV-infected patient end-stage renal disease ( kidney failure ) . Although kidney transplant best treatment cause kidney failure , people infect HIV offer procedure immunosuppressive drug ( drug suppress immune function ) require prevent organ rejection could impair patient 's already weaken immune system . This study use regimen immunosuppressant design complement treatment patient take highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HIV-infected patient 18 60 year age renal failure opportunistic infection 5 year may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Before transplant procedure , participant undergo additional test procedure , include blood study , 24-hour urine collection , infectious disease consultation , tuberculin skin test , PAP smear woman , chest X-ray , brain hip MRI study DEXA-scan evaluate bone density . In addition , patient may undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell study . For procedure , whole blood drawn needle arm vein pass cell separator machine . The white cell collect removal , rest blood return body needle another needle arm . When donor organ becomes available transplant , patient receive three anti-rejection drugs-cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil prednisone-to prevent organ rejection . Immediately surgery , HAART drug stop 7 day stable level immune suppressant achieve . Then , HAART re-started medication adjust achieve adequate blood level . Patients must stay local area 60 day discharge hospital monitoring . Frequent blood sample take monitor kidney function , viral load CD4+ T cell count . Follow-up visit schedule monthly first 6 month transplant , every month 1 year . Kidney biopsies do end first month , 6 month , yearly 5 year . For biopsy , special needle use remove small piece kidney tissue microscopic examination . The biopsy blood test do evaluate immune response transplant organ study HAART interact immune suppress drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal allotransplantation treatment choice cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . However , successful transplantation dependent use potent immunosuppressive drug prevent immune mediate rejection transplant organ . Patients become infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) underlie immune deficit result primarily virus 's affect CD4+ T lymphocytes . Many individual also develop ESRD . However , patient HIV infection exclude allotransplantation . This base premise immune suppression require transplantation would adversely affect already compromise immune system . Recently , treatment HIV infection improve dramatically , particularly advent protease inhibitor ( PI ) inclusion highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) protocols . Additionally , immunosuppressant drug actually show limit replication spread HIV vitro . Thus , treatment HIV associate ESRD allotransplantation may feasible . This protocol pilot trial investigate potential utility renal transplantation treat ESRD patient infect HIV . Ten patient control HIV infection receive renal allograft immunosuppressive regimen design complement HAART protocol . Immune system monitoring perform specifically evaluate effect immunosuppressive drug T cell function viral burden allograft recipient . The allograft periodically evaluate assess prevalence disease recurrence rejection . Pharmacokinetic evaluation perform define interaction HAART immunosuppressive drug regimen . Long-term outcome assess 1 5 year compare contemporaneous outcome non-infected patient receive standard care . It hop protocol suggest way provide HIV infected patient renal replacement therapy without jeopardize control viral infection .</detailed_description>

Patients renal failure define creatinine clearance 24 hour urine collection less 20 . Patients must age 1860 . Patients must willingness legal ability give inform consent , permission legal guardian . Patients must willingness travel Clinical Center protocol specific sample take , case , ability send sample via overnight mail . Patients must current CD4+ Tcell count great equal 300/mm ( 3 ) 9 month longer . Patients must CD4 nadir course infection le 200/mm ( 3 ) . Patients must current HIV1 RNA less equal 50 RNA copies/ml 9 month longer . ( Intermittent elevation less equal 500 copies/ml , persistent two sequential measure follow undetectable level , permit ) . Patients must stable HAART regimen great equal 3 month prior entry . The HAART regimen must consist least 3 drug include least 2 class drug . Individuals sustain viral suppression regimen abacavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor eligible discretion investigator . The use hydroxyurea permit . Patients must willingness comply study medication . Patients must willingness disclose HIV status live donor prior transplant living donor source kidney . Patients must provide adequate medical history documentation allow accurate determination severity one 's prior HIV disease status . Patients must history AIDS defining opportunistic infection within 5 year enrollment . Patients must history malignant neoplasm except situ anogenital carcinoma , adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , solid tumor treat curative therapy disease free least 5 year . Patients must infection quasispecies HIV , base review clinical data , antiretroviral treatment history , available viral genotypes/phenotypes , leaf limit option successful suppression viral replication patient 's current regimen fail . Patients must ability willingness comply immunosuppression protocol , antiretroviral therapy , and/or HIV monitoring therapy indicate . Patients must concomitant condition , judgement investigator , would preclude transplantation immunosuppression . Patients must condition precludes serial followup . Patients must significant coagulopathy requirement anticoagulation therapy would contraindicate protocol allograft biopsy . Donors EBV positive recipient EBV negative exclude . Donors CMV positive recipient CMV negative exclude . Patients must history active infection hepatitis B hepatitis C virus first 5 patient . After 5 patient without concomitant hepatitis enrol follow 6 month , patient hepatitis infection without significant fibrosis liver biopsy consider enrollment . Subjects positive donor T cell crossmatch ( current historical ) exclude . No peak panel reactive antibody great 20 percent result antiHLA antibody . DONORS : In addition abovementioned criterion , donor must HIV , HCV , HBV negative . EBV CMV mismatch donor ( positive negative combination ) also exclude .</criteria>
