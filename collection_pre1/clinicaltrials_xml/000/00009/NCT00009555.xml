	<brief_title>Testosterone HIV-Positive Men With Reduced Serum Testosterone Levels Abdominal Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reports suggest many HIV-infected patient antiretroviral therapy experience increase abdominal fat . The mechanisms abdominal fat accumulation HIV-infected patient know . Studies show : treatment testosterone gel reduces total body fat young , androgen-deficient men ; testosterone replacement middle-aged men mid-segment obesity decrease visceral fat ; replacement dose testosterone decrease fat mass augment lean body mass HIV-infected men androgen deficiency . Therefore , strong rationale evaluate effectiveness testosterone replacement HIV-infected men visceral obesity low testosterone level . Patients stratify base viral load . Patients receive either testosterone gel placebo apply skin daily 24 week . Patients remain current antiretroviral regimen , supply study . Patients receive testosterone first 24 week eligible receive additional 24 week . Patients placebo follow additional 24 week . Clinical laboratory evaluation visceral fat change perform throughout study .</detailed_description>
