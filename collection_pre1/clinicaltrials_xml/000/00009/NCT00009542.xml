	<brief_summary>This study examine kava-a widely use herbal remedy-may affect body 's elimination medicine . Many people take kava reduce anxiety cause sedation . Since product consider food supplement drug , subject rigorous pre-market testing require prescription over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug . As result , information collect possible interaction kava medication . This study look kava affect elimination caffeine-a compound commonly find chocolate , coffee , tea soft drinks-and dextromethorphan-an OTC cough suppressant . Normal healthy volunteer 21 year age old may eligible 30-day study . Candidates provide medical history undergo physical examination routine blood test . Women childbearing age urine pregnancy test . Study participant drink alcoholic beverage take medication ( except give study ) 2 week prior study throughout duration . In addition , abstain caffeine , grapefruit grapefruit juice charbroiled food least 72 hour throughout study day urine collect . On day 1 study , study subject take one dose caffeine dextromethorphan 4:00 P.M.. They empty bladder dose collect urine dose rest day include next morning first urine . They bring urine sample Clinical Center collection complete . This procedure repeat 1 week later ( study day 8 ) . After second urine collection complete , subject take 200 milligram kava 3 time day 21 day . On study day 29 ( 21 day kava ) , subject repeat dextromethorphan caffeine dose urine collection describe , continue take kava . Subjects electroencephalograph ( EEG ) do start kava end kava ( study day 30 ) . For procedure , several electrode ( metal cup attach wire ) secure scalp glue-like substance . A conductive gel fill space electrode scalp ensure good contact . The electrode remain place 2 hour remove . The subject lie quietly bed EEG record . Participation study end another physical examination blood test follow second EEG urine collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kava ( piper methysticum ) complementary alternative medication use purport anxiolytic sedative effect . Despite widespread use data regard potential drug interaction effect electroencephalogram . The purpose study determine effect administration kava 3 week activity cytochrome p450 , 1A2 , 2D6 , 3A4 ; NAT2 , XO . Additionally , effect kava EEG measure beta amplitude evaluate . Fifteen healthy volunteer undergo enzyme activity phenotyping ingest 2 mg/kg caffeine 30 mg dextromethorphan follow overnight urine collection . Following completion two separate baseline evaluation , separate 1 week , subject take 1 capsule contain 60 mg kavalactones three time daily 3 week . Following 3 week therapy subject undergo repeat enzyme activity phenotyping describe previously . Enzyme activity follow 3 week kava compare pre-treatment value characterize magnitude inhibition and/or induction CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 , NAT2 , XO activity . Additionally , subject EEG test perform evaluate effect kava beta amplitude . EEG 's performed day first baseline phenotyping procedure follow three week kava ( day final phenotyping procedure ) . Beta amplitude follow three week kava compare pre-treatment value evaluate magnitude pharmacodynamic effect . The result study used facilitate development protocol evaluate magnitude interaction clinically relevant traditional medication kava well study compare pharmacologic effect kava effect benzodiazepine .</detailed_description>
