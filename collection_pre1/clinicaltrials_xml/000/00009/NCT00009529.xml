	<brief_title>The Contact Lens Myopia Progression ( CLAMP ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rigid gas permeable ( RGP ) contact lenses provide clear , comfortable vision relatively ocular health risk standard management option correct nearsightedness . While RGP contact lens use correct myopic refractive error , may also slow progression myopia . A definitive study could provide guidance regard effect rigid gas permeable contact lenses myopia ( nearsightedness ) progression may define standard care slow progression myopia young child . An eye care practitioner first report hard contact lens may slow stop progression nearsightedness 1956 . Other anecdotal clinical report similar result soon follow . Previous review paper suggest rigid contact lenses slow progression myopia child , several study attempt prove . Two study past twenty year show rigid gas permeable contact lenses slow progression nearsightedness child , however study fail provide proper attention many important variable . While early work produce intriguing result scientist clinician , contain many problem challenge significance study finding . The fault previous study summarize four category : 1 ) high loss follow-up , 2 ) inadequate control group , 3 ) incomplete ocular component measurement , 4 ) inadequate poorly select entry criterion . Positive result previous study also fail exclude alternate possibility may explain rigid gas permeable contact lens may slow progression myopia . For example , study find rigid contact lenses slow progression myopia corneal flatten account treatment effect , none study able definitively answer mechanism may slow myopia advancement . A need control study rigid contact lenses measure component may affect myopia progression still exist . The CLAMP Study examine component address problem encounter previous study . The CLAMP Study use run-in period enroll child able adapt rigid contact lens wear study . This decrease number child drop-out study adapt rigid contact lens wear . Once child show able wear rigid contact lens , enrol study randomly assign wear rigid gas permeable contact lenses soft contact lens . Both group examine year three year determine group progress nearsightedness . Annual examination include assessment child 's ability focus eye , eye glass prescription , length eye , detail map shape thickness cornea ( clear window front eye ) , shape eye , curvature lens inside eye . Their eye glass prescription determine child 's eye dilate . We examine 222 child eligibility . Out 222 child , 148 eligible participate run-in period . Of 148 eligible child , 116 ( 78.5 % ) able adapt rigid gas permeable contact lens wear . All child examine The Ohio State University College Optometry .</detailed_description>
