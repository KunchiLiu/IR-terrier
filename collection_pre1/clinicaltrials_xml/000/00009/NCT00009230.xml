	<brief_summary>This project design study whether anti-inflammatory drug , celecoxib , may delay age-related mental decline . We also look genetic risk brain structure potential predictor mental decline . We believe people age-associated memory impairment take celecoxib show less evidence mental decline receive placebo ( inactive pill ) 18 month . We expect brain structure start study , memory performance indicate test , age additional predictor mental decline . We also predict cognitive decline ( i.e. , decline think memory ) treatment response vary accord genetic factor may correlate age dementia begin . We believe variable prior educational achievement , memory capability outset study , gender may influence mental decline treatment response . We study people age-associated memory impairment ( mild memory complaint , decrease performance select memory test ) , 40 90 year age . The subject randomly ( i.e. , process similar flip coin ) assign treatment group . The subject receive either inactive substance ( placebo ) celecoxib ( 400 mg/day ) . The subject receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , FDG PET scan , routine laboratory blood test , electrocardiogram cognitive test . They follow approximately 18 month ask return specific interval follow-up testing . Measures brain structure derive baseline MRI scan metabolic activity PET scan , blood drawn test determine form ( genotype ) certain genetically determine cellular component patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Inflammatory Treatment Age-Associated Memory Impairment : A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several observational epidemiological study indicate anti-inflammatory treatment attenuate prevent symptom one common mental disorder late life , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Neuropathological study also support inflammatory immune mechanism AD , include finding reactive microglia within near AD lesion . Such evidence , however , circumstantial , control , randomize drug trial need determine efficacy . This project design determine commonly use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , celecoxib , efficacious delay progression cognitive symptom people age-related cognitive loss risk develop AD . A total 135 subject age-associated memory impairment ( AAMI ) risk cognitive decline ( age 40 90 year ) randomize ( double-blind design ) one two treatment group : celecoxib ( 400 mg/d ) placebo , follow 18 month . All randomized subject receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , FDG PET scan , selective genotyping ( apolipoprotein E [ APOE ] genetic risk AD onset ( e.g. , APOE-4 ) . Subjects receive celecoxib expect show less evidence cognitive decline receive placebo . The propose project build upon group 's prior work early detection AD use brain imaging , genetic risk , neuropsychological assessment . This project also logical follow-up recent observational study promise early intervention represent one first control , anti-inflammatory treatment trial person high risk age-related cognitive decline eventual development AD . Subjects follow closely ensure medication safely use , without side effect ( e.g. , gastrointestinal , renal , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
