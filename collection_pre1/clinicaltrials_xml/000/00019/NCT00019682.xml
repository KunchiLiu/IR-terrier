	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study aldesleukin vaccine therapy see well work compare aldesleukin alone treat patient melanoma spread start nearby tissue lymph node place body . Aldesleukin may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill melanoma cell . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether combine aldesleukin vaccine therapy effective aldesleukin alone treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify whether addition peptide vaccine high dose interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) result clinical response rate may superior find similar patient treat high dose IL-2 alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile patient treated trial , accord regimen receive . II . To compare disease free/progression free survival patient treat arm study . III . To determine immunologic response experience patient receive peptide vaccination , measure change T-cell precursor treatment . IV . To evaluate quality life patient high-dose IL-2 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive aldesleukin intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute every 8 hour 12 dos . ARM II : Patients receive gp100 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Patients also receive aldesleukin Arm I begin day 2 . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease 3 week complete 2 course may receive maximum 12 additional course . Patients complete response may receive maximum 2 additional course . After completion treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
