	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Lobradimil may increase effectiveness chemotherapy drug make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness carboplatin lobradimil treat child brain tumor respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lobradimil Carboplatin Treating Children With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate patient recurrent refractory childhood brain tumor treat lobradimil carboplatin . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Assess toxicity regimen patient population . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( high-grade glioma v low-grade glioma v brainstem visual pathway glioma v medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor v ependymoma ) . ( Brainstem glioma stratum close accrual 12/21/2000 . ) ( High-grade glioma stratum close accrual 01/08/2002 . ) Patients receive carboplatin IV 15 minute lobradimil IV 10 minute day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion course 12 , patient may receive additional course discretion institutional investigator . Quality life assess baseline every 3 course . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year evidence disease progression initiation new therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 146 patient accrue study within 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
