	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill cancer cell . Combining vaccine therapy interleukin-2 may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy without interleukin-2 treating patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine frequency immunologic response patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer treat ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine without interleukin-2 . - Determine tumor response survival time patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat vaccine plus interleukin-2 . - Determine time progression patient locally advanced colorectal cancer treat adjuvant vaccine . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord extent disease . Patients prior locally advanced disease assign treatment group A , metastatic disease assign treatment group B . - Group A : Patients vaccinate influenza day -6 . Patients undergo collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) day -4 . The PBMC culture sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-4 5 day CD40 ligand 24 hour pulse 2 hour appropriate peptide form vaccine . Patients receive ra peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine IV 5 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 . - Group B : Patients undergo collection PBMC receive vaccination group A . Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously day 2-6 9-13 . Treatment group repeat every 2 week 5 vaccination absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow day 75 , 90 , 120 , 365 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 500 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
