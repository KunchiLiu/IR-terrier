	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy without interleukin-2 treating patient metastatic melanoma respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy recombinant fowlpox vaccinia virus encode tyrosinase antigen , administer without low-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , term response , patient metastatic melanoma . - Compare response rate patient vaccination administer high-dose IL-2 similar patient previous trial treat high-dose IL-2 alone . - Determine immunological response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize one three treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive recombinant fowlpox vaccine IM day 1 follow 4 week later recombinant vaccinia vaccine IM . Treatment repeat minimum 4 vaccination . - Arm II : Patients receive vaccination arm I plus low-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously daily day 2-13 vaccination . - Arm III : Patients receive vaccination arm I plus high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 2-5 vaccination . Patients stable disease minor , mixed , partial response four immunization ( 1 course ) may receive second course regimen begin 4-6 week first course . After second course , patient tumor regression may continue receive treatment absence unacceptable toxicity best response achieve . Patients follow 4-6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 73 patient ( 13-20 arm I , 13-20 arm II , 19-33 arm III ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
