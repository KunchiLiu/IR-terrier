	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Combining vaccine therapy interleukin-2 may effective treatment metastatic melanoma . PURPOSE : Phase II trial compare effectiveness vaccine therapy without interleukin-2 treating patient metastatic melanoma respond previous therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide administer without high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) patient metastatic melanoma HLA-A0201 positive . - Determine efficacy peptide patient receive IL-2 . - Compare efficacy IL-2 without peptide patient need immediate treatment IL-2 . - Determine efficacy MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide patient receive prior gp100 antigen . - Compare immunologic response experience patient receive peptide , without IL-2 , measure change T-cell precursor treatment . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . OUTLINE : This partially randomize study . Patients assign 1 4 treatment group base disease status prior therapy . - Group A ( eligible receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) immediate need ; prior immunization gp100 MART-1 antigen ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gp100 MART-1 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 ( ISA-51 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . ( Arm I close 10/30/02 ) . - Arm II : Patients receive peptide arm I day 1 high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 2-5 ( 12 dos ) . ( Arm II close 10/30/02 ) . - Group B ( ineligible receive IL-2 due debilitate disease ) : Patients receive treatment group A , arm I . - Group C ( need immediate IL-2 therapy due extensive rapid progression disease ) : Patients receive treatment group A , arm II . ( Group C close 10/30/02 ) . - Group D ( prior immunization gp100 antigen ) : Patients receive modify MART-1:26-35 ( 27L ) peptide emulsify ISA-51 SC day 1 . Treatment group repeat every 3 week 4 course . Patients achieve minor , mixed , partial response may receive 12 additional course . Patients achieve complete response receive 2 additional course . Patients follow 4-6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 103 patient ( 15-25 group A , arm I ; 19-33 group A , arm II ; 15 group B , C , D ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
