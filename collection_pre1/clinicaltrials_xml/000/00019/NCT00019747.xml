	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Thalidomide may stop growth colorectal cancer stop blood flow tumor . Giving thalidomide surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study surgery thalidomide see well work compare surgery alone treat patient recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare disease-free survival probability patient previously resect recurrent metastatic colorectal carcinoma treat adjuvant thalidomide v placebo . - Compare time recurrence patient treat regimen . - Determine whether serum/plasma level vascular endothelial growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor preresection postresection correlate tumor recurrence determine level , well carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) measurement , aid predicting time recurrence patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics toxicity long-term thalidomide therapy patient . - Determine whether patient receive thalidomide develop measurable antiangiogenic activity . - Measure presence circulate tumor cell preresection postresection determine type analysis use predict recurrence patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord site recent lesion resection render evidence disease ( lung v liver 3 lesion vs liver 3 lesion vs lung liver v site [ include site resect ablated ] ) . Patients without evidence residual disease randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . Treatment continue arm 2 year absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 94 patient ( 47 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
