	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether reinfused activated cell alone conjunction high subcutaneous dose interleukin-2 may result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma previously fail therapy protocol involve immunization gp100 molecule . - Determine survival infuse cell antitumor activity patient . OUTLINE : This salvage regimen . Patients undergo leukopheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor biopsy obtain tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) . Cells incubated presence gp209-2M peptide harvest clone . Patients receive 30-minute IV infusion vitro sensitized cell . Treatment repeat every 2 week 2 course . An additional cohort 8 patient receive gp209-2M peptide Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously 2 different site follow 2 day later adoptive transfer clone lymphocyte . At 4 6 week treatment course , patient stable regress disease may retreat . Patients disease progression 2 course may receive 2 additional course cell infusion follow interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) one two schedule . One cohort patient receive IL-2 intravenous bolus 15 minute every 8 hour begin day cell infusion continue 5 day treatment course . Another cohort receive IL-2 daily subcutaneous injection day 1-12 course therapy . If 12-16 patient treat cloned cell alone initially responses inadequate , subsequent patient enter study randomize receive cell infusion follow IL-2 one two described schedule . Patients follow 4-6 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 91 patient accrue study 2 year .</detailed_description>
