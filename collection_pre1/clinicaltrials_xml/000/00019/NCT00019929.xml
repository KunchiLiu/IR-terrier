	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall survival patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer immunize adjuvant mutant p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cell standard therapy . - Assess safety immunological efficacy regimen term induce boost mutant p53-specific immune response patient population . OUTLINE : Patients undergo p53 gene mutation analysis . Patients without suitable gene mutation receive vaccination . Patients suitable p53 gene mutation receive mutant p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cell IV 1-2 minute weekly 5 week . Patients achieve immune response evidence progressive disease may receive additional vaccination every 2 month maximum 10 immunization . Patients follow 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 120 patient ( 40 vaccination arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
