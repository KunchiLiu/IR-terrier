	<brief_summary>Transplant rejection occur patient 's body recognize new organ attack . Patients kidney transplant must take drug prevent transplant rejection . Alemtuzumab man-made antibody use treat certain blood disorder . The purpose study test safety effectiveness use alemtuzumab combination two drug , sirolimus tacrolimus , prevent organ rejection kidney transplantation . This study also test whether combination medication allow patient eventually stop take antirejection medication entirely . Study hypothesis : A new strategy immunosuppression use alemtuzumab , tacrolimus , sirolimus human renal transplantation permit step-wise withdrawal immunosuppressive drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Immunosuppressive Therapy Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drugs suppress immune system , sirolimus tacrolimus , contribute increased success transplantation . However , prevent organ rejection , transplant recipient need take immunosuppressive drug rest life , drug make patient susceptible infection , endanger health survival . Regimens less toxic eventually withdraw transplant recipient need . Alemtuzumab monoclonal antibody bind deplete excess T cell bone marrow leukemia patient . This study determine effect intravenous alemtuzumab oral sirolimus tacrolimus kidney transplantation . The study also evaluate regimen 's potential allow eventual discontinuation component long-term immunosuppressive therapy . This study last 4 year . Participants undergo kidney transplantation Day 0 receive intravenous dos alemtuzumab , acetaminophen , diphenhydramine Days 0 , 1 , 2 , well methylprednisolone Day 0 . After transplant , patient receive 10 day valganciclovir acyclovir . Participants take tacrolimus daily mouth least 60 day transplant sirolimus daily mouth least 12 month transplant . As part opportunistic infection ( OI ) prophylaxis , participant also take sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim mouth 3 time week , valganciclovir acyclovir 10 day post-transplant , clotrimazole nystatin mouth least 3 month post-transplant . There minimum 62 study visit spread 4 year transplant . Vital sign measurement , adverse event OI reporting , medication history , physical exam , blood collection occur select visit . Sirolimus withdrawal begin participant meet certain study criterion . The withdrawal process occur minimum 3 month approximate rate 33 % pre-withdrawal dose per month . Participants eligible sirolimus withdrawal undergo several kidney biopsy , include one 2 week prior start withdrawal , 6 12 month completion withdrawal , 1 year study enrollment , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
