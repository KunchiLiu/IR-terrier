	<brief_summary>This study evaluate usefulness new procedure evaluate asthma child . The method measure pH ( measure acidity alkalinity ) exhale breath condensate ( water vapor create lung ) . The condensate contain product lung may associate lung inflammation . Investigators determine pH exhale breath condensate correlate well know asthma indicator , number hospitalization , school absenteeism , use rescue medication , others . Test result compare finding healthy normal volunteer . No experimental treatment medicine use study . Patients require treatment asthma receive standard care medicine approve Food Drug Administration use widely United States . Children asthma healthy normal volunteer 6 17 year age may eligible study . You must complete study 18th birthday . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . Children asthma undergo follow test procedure six clinic visit , include initial visit follow-up visit 4-8 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month : - Blood draw child 6 year age . Medications available decrease pain associate blood drawing . ( initial visit ) - Allergen skin testing : Drops 16 allergen place arm . The skin drop scratch area observe allergic reaction . ( 4- 8-week follow-up visit ) - Expired nitric oxide test : The child breathes balloon collect portion gas exhale form lung . This test measure amount nitric oxide , correlate bronchial inflammation . ( visit ) - Exhaled breath condensate : The child breathe plastic tube surround cold metal sleeve 10 15 minute . The water vapor create lung ( vapor form breathe outside cold day ) collect pH measure . ( visit ) - Pulmonary ( lung ) function test : The child blow hard tube attach machine measure airflow child 's lung . This test measure airflow lung . ( visit ) The child give small plastic device call peak flow meter - device use measure lung function - use home . Children whose lung function le 80 % predict value age may give medicine see lung function improve . - Review patient 's symptom , sick day , medicine action take get illness ; review peak flow report ; review action plan . ( 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month visit ) Healthy control expired nitric oxide test , exhale breath condensate test , pulmonary function test visit initial two additional visit schedule 6 month apart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exhaled Breath Condensate Measure Airway Inflammation Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The onset asthma often childhood , child atopic , likely persist adulthood . Diseases asthma high prevalence childhood ; management alters morbidity allergic disease child may impact disease outcomes future year . Asthma prevalent chronic disease childhood account high rate hospitalization age 0-4 year . Unfortunately , noninvasive objective measurement pulmonary health child . Current technique include determination peak flow , spirometry , measurement nitric oxide ( NO ) . Bronchial inflammation central feature asthma anti-inflammatory therapy mainstay treatment . Expired NO ( eNO ) show correlate bronchial inflammation . However , collection NO available research setting due limitation collection analysis . In contrast , exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) easily obtain pH analysis technically simple . Determination pH EBC novel , non-invasive technique clinical study mean evaluate severity pulmonary inflammation . In protocol describe , evaluate utility EBC measurement airway disease 60 child asthma compare 30 healthy cohort age range . We determine EBC pH reflective degree morbidity child correlate measurement know parameter disease include : 1 ) number hospitalization , 2 ) absenteeism school , 3 ) number asthma exacerbation , 4 ) loss work day ( applicable ) , 5 ) extent rescue medication usage , 6 ) spirometry evaluate obstruction , 7 ) NO measurement inflammation . Subjects evaluate categorize base National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guideline . We measure pH EBC child age 6 less 18 year age compare finding clinical data , spirometry , expire NO . In way , determine EBC potentially useful non-invasive measurement airway disease . It hop measurement EBC helpful identify child addition anti-inflammatory medication appropriate . We also attempt measure inflammatory mediator determine use assess inflammation . This method may also useful detect airway inflammation due infectious agent systemic reaction ( fever , respiratory distress , cough ) apparent child various immunodeficiency diseases chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , recurrent respiratory infection without define host defect ( RIND ) , Job 's syndrome . We recruit 30 healthy control child age range compare EBC pH value child without allergic chronic pulmonary disease . In addition , recruit 30 child ( 10 group ) CGD , RIND , Job 's compare exhale breath condensate pH exhale nitric oxide value child allergic airway inflammation determine method useful early diagnosis infectious airway inflammation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ASTHMA : Children age 5 less 18 year time expect complete protocol asthma . One follow criterion qualify inclusion : Doctor diagnose asthma . Chronic cough , bad particularly night great one month . Recurrent wheeze past 6 month . Symptoms difficulty breathe occur concurrently worsen , exercise , infection , animal , smoke , pollen strong emotional expression . Medical care treatment respiratory symptom consistent asthma . Reversible ( great equal 12 % ) airflow obstruction inhale shortacting beta2agonist . HEALTHY CONTROL : Children age 5 less 18 year time expect complete protocol . Subject ( asthma healthy control ) nonNIH physician provide routine emergency care . When available , permission access medical record pharmacy record obtain subject asthma . SUBJECT WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY : Children age 5 less 18 time expect complete protocol . Doctor diagnose immunodeficiency ( CGD , Job 's , RIND ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unacceptably poor compliance , opinion investigator , would interfere one 's ability study provide medical care subject . Any major illness condition , opinion principal investigator , may interfere subject 's ability comply condition participation study : Latex allergy Current tobacco use . URI symptoms 4 week prior EBC collection . Any condition , opinion primary physician , would affect child 's participation study . HIV negative history . HEALTHY CONTROL : Asthma allergic rhinitis . Chronic pulmonary disease . URI symptoms 4 week prior EBC collection . Chronic corticosteroid therapy ( daily every day dose great 14 day ) . Current tobacco use . HIV negative history . History latex allergy . PATIENTS WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY : Chronic prophylactic antibiotic . Diagnosis asthma . Must antibiotic 2 day .</criteria>
