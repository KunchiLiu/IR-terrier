	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study represent collaborative effort among investigator Cardiovascular Health Research Unit , Department Genome Sciences University Washington ( UW ) , multi-center Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) , include CHS Blood Laboratory University Vermont . The study link advance thrombosis inflammation biology , large-scale human genomics , population statistical genetics , unique resource CHS , large , bi-racial cohort old adult . In old men woman without clinically apparent vascular disease , carotid intimal-medial thickness IMT ( measure subclinical atherosclerosis ) , C-reactive protein ( sensitive marker inflammation ) , D-dimer ( global marker activation hemostatic system ) predict subsequent clinical event myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke . While therapeutic benefit thrombolytic therapy aspirin suggest major role clot inflammation etiology coronary disease stroke , genetic determinant risk factor , also influence traditional lifestyle risk factor smoke obesity , remain largely unexplored old adult . The setting study Cardiovascular Health Study , cohort study 5888 old adult design assess risk factor stroke coronary disease . Data traditional risk factor , measure subclinical disease , cardiovascular event available ancillary study . By integrate recent clinical experimental data age-related vascular bed-specific regulation blood coagulation , incorporate complete human genomic DNA sequence variation data NHLBI-funded UW Program Genomic Applications , investigator evaluate thoroughly association thrombosis inflammation gene ( 1 ) carotid IMT , CRP , D-dimer level measure baseline ( 2 ) incident MI stroke adult &gt; 65 year old follow 12 year .</detailed_description>
