	<brief_summary>This study multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . The primary objective study examine safety , tolerability , efficacy intravenous MCC-135 limit final infarct size , measure single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , patient require percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) first-documented ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MCC-135 Adjunct Therapy Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ST-Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients male female age 18 year old present emergency room ( ER ) &lt; 6 hour onset AMI symptom . The AMI must confirm 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) document least 2 lead . Each potential patient must candidate primary PCI thrombolytic therapy plan . To eligible , patient must prior history ST-segment elevation MI . Patients randomize 1:1:1 ratio 1 3 treatment group : A , B , C. Group A receive MCC-135 4.5 mg/kg/48 hour ; Group B receive MCC-135 9.0 mg/kg/48 hour ; Group C receive placebo/48 hour . Three hundred thirty patient TIMI flow grade 0/1 required complete study . Because patient enrol receive study medication prior assessment TIMI flow , expect least 414 patient may need randomized order obtain required 330 qualified patient . All randomized patient receive 48 hour study medication , ongoing assessment period , follow-up assessment Days 3 , 4 , 5 , 30 , 180 described , regardless preoperative TIMI flow grade . Following initial physical examination , vital sign , establishment separate dedicate IV access , baseline blood sampling , confirmation study eligibility requirement , patient randomize begin receive study drug adjunct standard therapy . Patients begin study drug infusion soon possible , &lt; 6 hour follow onset AMI symptom ( i.e. , symptom myocardial ischemia ) . Examples ischemic symptom include chest , arm , and/or jaw pain , shortness breath , nausea , diaphoresis , symptom investigator considers ischemic origin . A negative result urine pregnancy test must obtain female childbearing potential prior start study drug infusion .</detailed_description>
