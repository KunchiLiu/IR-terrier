	<brief_summary>This study evaluate patient methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA ) learn genetic cause various type inherit metabolic disorder medical complication associate . People MMA may problem learn development kidney malfunction . They become seriously ill , sometimes little warning . There cure MMA , special diet vitamin therapy use treatment . Patients 2 70 year age MMA may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 4-5 day year 5-10 year follow test procedure : - Medical history , physical examination , eye examination - Consultations dentists specialist nervous system , digestive tract , endocrine , kidney , need . - 24-hour urine collection examine methylmalonic acid , acid , sugar , proteins measure kidney function . - Blood test ass liver thyroid function , blood count blood chemistry , methylmalonic acid level , genetic test basic research study . - Blood test measure growth hormone production . For test , small amount blood collect overnight ( every 20-30 minute 8:00 PM 8:00 AM ) intravenous catheter ( plastic tube place vein ) . The total amount blood drawn approximately 1 tablespoon . Patients stop grow whose weight permit collection 1 tablespoon blood undergo procedure . - Frequent blood pressure measurement , include overnight monitoring - Skin biopsy cell culture ( cell grow laboratory future test ) . For procedure , area skin numb anesthetic lidocaine . A 4-mm diameter circular area remove use sharp punch scissors . The wound dress usually heals within week . - Photographs face body ( wear underwear ) help track growth appearance . - Ultrasound kidney - Hand x-ray determine bone age - Dual energy x-ray absorptionometry ( DEXA ) scan ass bone density . For DEXA scan , patient lie still table spine hip scan use small amount radiation . Any patient becomes seriously ill evaluation may care NIH transfer another hospital deem advisable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA ) , one common inborn error organic acid metabolism , heterogeneous etiology clinical manifestation . Affected patient cblA , cblB mut class MMA medically fragile suffer complication metabolic stroke infarction basal ganglion , pancreatitis , end stage renal failure , growth impairment , osteoporosis , developmental delay . The frequency complication precipitant remain undefined . Furthermore , current treatment protocol outcome continue demonstrate substantial morbidity mortality patient population . Rarely , solid organ transplantation ( liver , and/or kidney ) use treat patient . Disordered intracellular metabolism vitamin B12 produce another group disorder feature methylmalonic acidemia well ( hyper ) homocysteinemia . These condition name correspond cellular complementation class cobalamin C ( cblC ) , D F also heterogenous , clinically biochemically . The genetic disorder underlie cblE cblG feature isolate impairment activity methionine synthase , critical enzyme involve conversion homocysteine methionine . Lastly , group patient increase methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine blood cause mutation ( ) unknown gene exist . In protocol , clinically evaluate patient methymalonic acidemia cobalamin metabolic defect . Routine inpatient admission last 4-5 day involve urine collection , blood drawing , ophthalmological examination , radiological procedure , MRI/MRS , skin biopsy , developmental testing . In subset patient receive renal , hepato- hepato-renal transplant unusual variant clinical course MMA , lumbar puncture examine CSF metabolites perform . In small group patient , CSF metabolite monitoring may use adjust therapy . The study objective delineate spectrum phenotype associate enzymopathies , query genotype/enzymatic/phenotype correlation search new gene rare family evidence unknown class methylmalonic acidemia and/or homocysteinemia . The population consist patient previously evaluate NIH , physician referral , family direct study clinicaltrials.gov well Organic Acidemia Association . Most patient evaluate NIH Clinical Center . However , NIH team decide patient age 2 year candidate subject research protocol , patient may enroll Children National Medical Center ( CNMC ) site , pending approval Dr Chapman , Principal Investigator CNMC location . Outcome measure largely descriptive encompass correlation clinical , biochemical molecular parameter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients gender , ethnicity , age eligible enroll protocol . Affected individual age 2 year may clinically evaluate Children National Medical Center ( CNMC ) part evolve agreement Translational Program Pediatrics , deem eligible participation . Patients diagnose base determination MMA homocysteine level plasma urine . Most complementation class know pending . Some patient yet laboratory test admit protocol base upon metabolic parameter clinical history . This latter category patient might include individual suspect genetic unknown class MMA . We also obtain specimens patient 2 year old suspect diagnosis combine malonic methylmalonic aciduria ( CMAMMA ) ACSF3 genetic test NIH center offer CLIA certify molecular diagnosis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude travel NIH CNMC medical condition . The PI may decline enroll patient reason . Other criterion may lead exclusion include , example , reside hospital , suboptimal metabolic control determine Dr. Venditti review laboratory data , patient require dialysis more/week weigh &lt; 40 kg , patient treat intercurrent infection antibiotic evidence acute infection metabolic symptom , patient regular/local metabolic , genetic endocrine physician and/or family physician , pediatrician , internist , patient may metabolically unstable acutely ill. Each family may contact Dr. Venditti staff member work one week prior pending inpatient admission confirm patient metabolically stable ready visit NIH state relative health , adequate supply special formula , medication , supplement , need , medical equipment feed pump replacement part feed tube .</criteria>
