	<brief_title>Anastrozole Preventing Breast Cancer Postmenopausal Women Increased Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effectiveness anastrozole prevent breast cancer postmenopausal woman increase risk disease . Secondary - Determine role drug prevent estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer participant . - Determine effect drug breast cancer mortality participant . - Determine effect drug cancer , cardiovascular disease , fracture rate , non-breast cancer death participant . - Determine tolerability acceptability side effect drug participant . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Participants stratify accord participate center . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral anastrozole daily 5 year . - Arm II : Participants receive oral placebo daily 5 year . In arm , treatment continue absence development breast cancer ( include ductal carcinoma situ ) , drop T-score minus 4 , occurrence new fragility fracture . Participants follow 5 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK ACCRUAL : A total 3,864 participant recruit study 10 year .</detailed_description>
