	<brief_summary>This study evaluate system develop grade severity age-related cataract , common cause vision loss older adult . Cataract research require method simply accurately determine type severity cataracts order develop new , possibly non-surgical , treatment . Patients 50 year age old one three major age-related cataract type ( nuclear , cortical , posterior subcapsular ) may eligible study . Participants recruit among patient enrol National Eye Institute protocol . Participants eye examine independently two ophthalmologist biomicroscope , magnify device routinely use eye examination . The doctor use new grade system record cataract present , , severe . The examination include measurement visual acuity ( vision chart test ) examination lens , retina , pupils eye movement . Photographs eye take use special camera flash bright light eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) Clinical Lens Grading System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standardized lens photography centralize grading photograph use clinical trial epidemiologic study cataract . While photographic grade system show reliable , expensive complex use many study . For large study , especially many center lens change secondary concern , would useful simple clinical lens grade system reliable use minimal training examiner . Several clinical lens grade system develop find reliable hand dedicate lens researcher , system difficult ophthalmologist use reliably . The Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDA ) develop simplified clinical cataract grade system assess severity nuclear , cortical posterior subcapsular cataract , 3 main type age-related cataract . The system design require minimal examiner train person already proficient use slit lamp . A total 150 participant cataract vary severity , already participate NEI protocol , recruit evaluate reliability system . After dilate , participant lens grade perform independently 2 examiner . To provide information validity clinical grading , lens photograph take grade use detail AREDS system grade photograph . The data allow u evaluate ( 1 ) agreement AREDS clinical lens grade system AREDS photographic system grade lens opacity , ( 2 ) agreement assessment cataract severity among opthalmologists ( vary subspecialty ) use AREDS clinical lens grade method .</detailed_description>
