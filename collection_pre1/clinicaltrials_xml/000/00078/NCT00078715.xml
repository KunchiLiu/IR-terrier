	<brief_summary>This study examine Yohimbine , give sleep cycle , improve symptom depression within matter hour . Purpose : This study examine whether drug yohimbine , give specific time sleep cycle , produce chemical change brain similar occur sleep deprivation . It also see yohimbine induce rapid ( next day ) antidepressant effect patient major depression . Total sleep deprivation 36 hour improves mood patient major depression matter hour , response usually short-lived . Understanding chemical change occur body sleep deprivation may help development rapidly act antidepressant.Patients major depressive disorder 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical psychiatric history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Participants hospitalize NIH Clinical Center study , follow : Drug-free period : Patients taper anti-depression medication remain drug-free 1 week begin study phase 1 . Study phase 1 : Patients undergo sleep deprivation 36 hour . Those whose depression improve sleep deprivation initially worsen continue phase 2 . The day sleep deprivation , patient undergo lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . For test , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . Study phase 2 : Patients spend 1 night sleep lab . A catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm-one give yohimbine draw blood sample . A small monitor cuff place finger measure patient 's blood pressure blood oxygen level night . While asleep , patient receives dose yohimbine placebo , give 3 minute . A lumbar puncture do follow morning . Patients receive medication 6 day , sleep lab procedure repeat . Patients receive yohimbine previous experiment switch placebo , give placebo switch yohimbine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep deprivation one intervention consistently demonstrate produce rapid antidepressant effect . The mechanisms sleep deprivation bring rapid antidepressant effect remain elucidated . It noteworthy , however , recent genomic proteomic study show acute sleep deprivation rapidly bring upregulation several mediator neuronal plasticity , notably CREB BDNF . Intriguingly , molecule upregulated chronic antidepressant , believe underlie delay therapeutic effect antidepressant . Additional investigation regulation CREB BDNF sleep deprivation reveal change critically dependent upon activation noradrenergic system . This particularly noteworthy , since locus coeruleus ( LC ) noradrenergic projection quiescent rapid eye movement sleep ( REM ) , target tissue display great sensitivity ; indeed , temporal dissociation fire LC noradrenergic neuron , sensitivity postsynaptic target cortex may considerable relevance antidepressant effect sleep deprivation . In context , biological rhythm capacity temporally dissociate biochemical process , impose temporal coincidence normally dissociate event strike unexpected effect . Thus , hypothesis activate normally quiescent noradrenergic system REM sleep ( i.e . postsynaptic target system display great sensitivity ) robustly upregulate CREB BDNF , thereby bring rapid antidepressant effect . We propose activate noradrenergic system REM sleep infuse alpha ( 2 ) antagonist , yohimbine . Since hypothesis activate noradrenergic system REM sleep bring antidepressant effect similar mechanism sleep deprivation , `` enrich '' sample sleep deprivation responder pilot study . Patients , age 18 65 diagnosis major depressive disorder , currently depress without psychotic feature recruit study . This experimental proof-of-concept study two Study Phases . Study Phase I consist total sleep deprivation . Responders total sleep deprivation subsequently relapse enter Study Phase II . Study Phase II double-blind crossover administration either intravenous yohimbine saline solution REM sleep . The specific aim study ass efficacy single dose intravenous yohimbine hydrochloride ( 0.125 mg/kg give 3 minute ) compare placebo improve overall depressive symptomatology administer REM sleep . Our primary hypothesis intravenous use alpha ( 2 ) antagonist patient major depression REM sleep activate LC thus increase noradrenergic activity time LC normally quiescent- namely REM sleep . If hypothesis timing activation noradrenergic system crucial antidepressant effect sleep deprivation correct acute antidepressant effect observe patient despite minimal disruption sleep . Assuming 10 % drop study , minimum 25 patient necessary order obtain minimum 8 patient major depression complete double-blind crossover phase study .</detailed_description>
