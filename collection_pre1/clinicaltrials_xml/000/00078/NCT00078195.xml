	<brief_title>Omalizumab ( Xolair ) Allergy Shots For Treatment Seasonal Allergies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis affect 20 40 million Americans annually . Allergy symptom , range mild seriously debilitate , may affect quality life .

Proteins blood call IgE antibody treat harmless particle invader trigger immune system response . The immune response result harmful inflammation healthy tissue . In ragweed allergy , inflammation occur airways cause familiar allergy symptom like sneeze , cough , general discomfort . Omalizumab investigational drug show block effect IgE antibody . The block effect omalizumab temporary , give drug people regular allergy shot may make shot effective . Participants study randomly assign receive injection omalizumab placebo accelerate course allergy shot ( give 12 week ) . The participant return follow-up one year , may many 27 study visit .</detailed_description>
