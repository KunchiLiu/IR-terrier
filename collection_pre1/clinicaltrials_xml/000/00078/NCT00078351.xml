	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness inject hylan ( Synvisc ) treat pain associate osteoarthritis temporomandibular joint ( jaw joint ) improve function joint . Hylan synthetic product similar component normal healthy joint fluid ( synovial fluid ) , present much low quantity abnormal osteoarthritis . Hylan injections beneficial treat osteoarthritis knee . Patients temporomandibular ( TMJ ) joint pain least 3 month duration mouth open limitation moderate severe joint pain make bad joint movement may eligible study . Patients must TMJ growth disturbance must TMJ surgery 6 month enter study . Candidates screen questionnaire , medical history , physical examination TMJs , include x-rays magnetic resonance imaging . Participants randomly assign receive three injection , week apart , either Synvisc placebo ( salt-water solution ) affect joint . Before first injection , sample synovial fluid collect joint needle aspiration laboratory analysis . Patients return follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 12 month last treatment clinical examination jaw joint review jaw joint symptom . A second aspiration request 3-month visit , mandatory . All injection aspiration do anesthetize overlie skin joint capsule minimize pain discomfort . Participants record daily use pain relief medication throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial evaluate effect high molecular weight hylan ( Synvisc ) injection comparison control treatment ( saline injection ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) affect temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) . Patients TMJ OA least three-month duration respond conservative treatment include . Patients randomly assign either high molecular hylan injection control . At baseline follow visit , clinical outcome measure assess pain range motion . Positive finding clinical outcome measure provide evidence clinical utility Synvisc patient painful TMJ OA . In addition clinical outcome measure , sample synovial fluid affect joint obtain baseline visit 12 week follow , level tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) Tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase ( TIMP ) analyze . By study synovial fluid level TNF alpha , MMP TIMP , assess effect viscosupplementation Synvisc local inflammatory process proteolytic activity TMJ OA comparison control treatment . Positive finding clinical symptom synovial fluid analysis also provide implication clinical utility Synvisc patient painful TMJ OA . Furthermore , analysis synovial fluid may identify biomarkers associate OA affect TMJ .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We recruit patient TMJ OA define Research Diagnostic Criteria . Patients require chronic preauricular pain 3 month , even though receive palliative treatment ( NSAIDs and/or stabilization splint therapy ) . Radiological imaging indicated addition clinical evaluation confirm diagnosis TMJ OA . Radiographic evidence OA include flattening condyle , increase opacity cortical bone condyle , osteophyte formation . Prior admit study , patient screen standard temporomandibular joint radiological imaging , include panoramic , tomographic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study . Radiological imaging repeat end study unless medically indicate . The patient require mouth opening limitation ( less normal ) moderate severe joint pain aggravate jaw movement . Patients undergone TMJ surgery within precede 6 month exclude , well take analgesic , antiinflammatory , steroid narcotic medication last 15 day . Further exclusion criterion patient TMJ growth disturbance . Patients red , hot , swollen , tender TMJ , history consist infectious arthritis , crystal induce arthropathy , musculoskeletal disorder also exclude . Patients rheumatic disease also exclude , determine baseline blood test ( CBC , chem . 7 , ESR , Rheumatoid factor ) . Patients screen positive history liver kidney dysfunction . Any patient medical history diabetes , congestive heart failure , chronic infection also exclude . Subjects primary psychiatric disease score average comparison normative score Symptom Checklist ( SCL90R ) able participate . Pregnant woman include study , determine pregnancy test , subject require use 2 form contraception first 3 week study ( cover synvisc injection ) . It standard practice chronic pain study include patient involve litigation . Patients sepsis know hypersensitivity hyaluronan component exclude study .</criteria>
