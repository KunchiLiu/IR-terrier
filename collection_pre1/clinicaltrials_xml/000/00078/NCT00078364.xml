	<brief_summary>This study evaluate brain pathway involve feel pain pain relief follow administration pain medication . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use measure brain activity sit become active following oral surgery see activity change pain medication administer . MRI combine powerful magnet advance computer system radio wave produce detailed picture organ tissue . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . Healthy dental patient recruit NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program may enroll study . Participants undergo follow test procedure two clinic visit : Visit 1 - Sensitivity Testing Participants test sensitivity warm hot temperature . A probe apply skin ( usually forearm ) heat temperature range room temperature hot cup coffee . Participants rate temperature use scale range `` pain '' `` bad pain imaginable '' rate unpleasantness heat use similar scale . The probe apply 30 time , use random heat intensity . Participants also ask compare heat intensity varying level sound rate magnitude different sensation experience past , brightness sun loudness jet plane . A blood sample 2 ounce also collect visit DNA analysis look gene relate pain . Visit 2 - Oral Surgery Under local anesthetic , participant undergo extraction low right wisdom tooth . After surgery , patient move MRI scanner brain image 1-2 hour local anesthetic wear . Patients may request postoperative pain drug ( Toradol ) procedure , need . When scan complete , patient dismiss clinic additional pain medication ( flurbiprofen ) use home direct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Functional neuroimaging provide powerful tool understand brain may involve perception pain . It make possible identify area brain involve perception experimental pain study evaluate site brain activate clinical pain effect analgesic drug . The propose study use surgical removal impact third molar model acute clinical pain identify site activate follow offset local anesthesia examine effect NSAID analgesic ketorolac attenuate site activate pain relieve . Scans perform non-pain baseline condition , immediately follow surgery local anesthetic wear , clinical pain occurs , follow administration NSAID ketorolac . Differences among subject amount pain report brain activation compare subject ' prior rating experimental pain presence genetic polymorphism relate pain perception , inflammation , know pain pathway , psychological factor relate pain . The finding research may help reveal pain appreciated central nervous system , pharmacologically modify NSAID analgesic differs among individual due genetic factor .</detailed_description>
