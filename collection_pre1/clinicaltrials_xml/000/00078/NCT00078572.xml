	<criteria>Signed informed consent Patients must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer stage IIIb , stage IIIc T4 lesion , stage IV disease Documentation ErbB2 overexpression ( immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) 3+ IHC 2+ fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) confirmation ) require base local laboratory initial diagnostic result . Where test feasible , central laboratory test utilized Subjects must document progressive advanced metastatic breast cancer . Progression entry define appearance new lesion previously identify increase 25 % existent lesion must document Subjects must refractory breast cancer define progression locally advance metastatic setting relapse within 6 month complete adjuvant therapy . Prior therapy must include , limited : Taxane contain regimen least 4 cycle 2 cycle provide disease progression occur taxane Anthracycline contain regimen least 4 cycle 2 cycle provide disease progression occur anthracycline Subjects relapse &gt; 6 month completion adjuvant anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy , anthracycline indicate , consider meet anthracycline prior exposure requirement Taxanes Anthracyclines may administer concurrently separately Prior treatment capecitabine permit Prior treatment must contain trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) alone combination chemotherapy least 6 week standard dos locally advance metastatic setting . Trastuzumab administer adjuvant setting exclusionary , eligibility trastuzumab must also administer locally advanced metastatic setting . Subjects hormone receptor positive tumor must disease progression follow hormonal therapy unless intolerant hormonal therapy hormonal therapy consider clinically appropriate Subjects stable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ( asymptomatic systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 3 month ) eligible Female subject must be≥18 year age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Subjects must archive tumor tissue available reevaluate intratumoral expression level ErbB1 ErbB2 IHC FISH test perform study central laboratory . Central laboratory result use determine subject eligibility study , unless test use require documentation ErbB2 overexpression . Life expectancy ≥12 week Subjects must recover clinically significant side effect associate prior radiotherapy chemotherapy Measurable lesion may field prior irradiation . However , must least 4week period last radiation treatment baseline scan document disease status lesion measurable Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram ( multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan may perform ECHO available ) Able swallow retain oral medication Subjects must complete screen assessment outline protocol Adequate renal function define Creatinine Clearance ≥50mL/min , determine calculated creatinine clearance use Cockcroft Gault Method normalize Body Surface Area ( BSA ) Adequate hematologic hepatic function define Table 1 : Table 1 ( Body System Adequate Function Definitions ) SYSTEM ( LABORATORY VALUES ) Hematologic : ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L Hepatic : Albumin ≥2.5 g/dL Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 2.5 x ULN patient Gilbert 's syndrome aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤3 x ULN without liver metastasis 5 x ULN document liver metastasis Pregnant lactate female anytime study Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . In addition , subject ulcerative colitis also exclude History malignancy . Subjects diseasefree 5 year subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety Unresolved unstable serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug Active uncontrolled infection Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia congestive heart failure No prior antiErbB1/ErbB2 inhibitor breast cancer trastuzumab Known history clinical evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) capecitabine Bisphosphonates treatment bone metastasis initiate follow first dose randomized therapy . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease permit , except prevention osteoporosis Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial Use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose study medication Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate GW572016 excipients GW572016 Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically related capecitabine , fluorouracil excipients Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency</criteria>
