	<brief_summary>This Phase II , non-randomized , open label study ILX651 patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . Approximately 60 patient enrol study expect last 18 month . All patient treat ILX651 administer intravenously ( IV ) daily 5 consecutive day every 21 day . The primary objective study determine overall response rate . The secondary objective determine progression free survival , duration response , time tumor progression , survival , safety/tolerability ILX651 , evaluate pharmacokinetic profile .</brief_summary>
