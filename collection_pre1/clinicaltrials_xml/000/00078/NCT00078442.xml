	<brief_summary>Recombinant interferon ( IFN ) may useful treatment HIV . However , high dos IFN necessary keep HIV control limit use due toxic side effect . The purpose study test safety tolerability weekly recombinant pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) alfa-2a HIV infected people currently antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) interruption start take anti-HIV drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Pegylated Interferon ( PEG-IFN ) Alfa-2a HIV Infected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IFN immune response enhancer produce body response viral infection . PEG-IFN may less harmful side effect non-pegylated IFN . Recombinant PEG-IFN alfa-2a synthetic version IFN use hepatitis C virus treatment . PEG-IFN alfa-2a demonstrate potentially useful antiviral property HIV treatment ; however , due high dos must administer maintain viral suppression , toxicity ( especially blood ) concern . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , antiretroviral activity PEG-IFN alfa-2a HIV infect patient receive ART past currently ART ART naive . The study last 18 week . Participants receive weekly injection 180 mcg PEG-IFN alfa-2a clinic 12 week . After Week 12 , participant follow off-treatment Week 18 . Physical exam perform weekly . Blood collection monitor viral load , PEG-IFN alfa-2a serum level , CD4 CD8 count conduct selected week study . Filgrastim give patient exhibit neutropenic toxicity .</detailed_description>
