	<brief_summary>This study patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . This research study aim determine safety dosage special cell may make patient immune system fight cancer . To , put special gene cancer cell take patient body . This do laboratory . This gene make cell produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , natural substance may help immune system kill cancer cell . Additionally , stimulate cancer cell another natural protein call CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) , experiment animal human cell vitro demonstrate help IL-2 perform well . Some cell put back patient 's body . Studies cancer animal cancer cell grown laboratory suggest combine substance like IL-2 CD40L help body kill cancer cell . An experimental treatment similar already used child similar experimental treatment use adult cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients eligible administration vaccine present BCLL ( Richters transformation ) ( group A ) without ( group B ) ( Inclusion BCLL ) measurable disease . Untreated complete remission patient enrol vaccine administration therapeutic ( i.e. , chemotherapy ) window three month . If three month ( necessary complete vaccine study ) , patient present rapid clinical progression , exclude current study receive treatment accord standard institutional guideline . IMPORTANT NOTE : vaccine production complete remission patient achieve tumor cell collect BEFORE enter complete remission . Patients must life expectancy least 10 week . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 : 0 = , restriction , 1 = Ambulatory , strenuous activity , 2 = Ambulatory , capable selfcare appropriate age .

This include total abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , contraceptive implant skin , contraceptive injection ( DepoProvera ) . Contraceptive foam condom allow . The male partner use condom . Patients must suffer autoimmune disease ( include active graftversushost diseaseGvHD , refractory immune thrombocytopeniaITP refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemiaAIHA ) receive immunosuppressive drug .
