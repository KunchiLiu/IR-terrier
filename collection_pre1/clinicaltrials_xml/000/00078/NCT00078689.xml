	<brief_summary>This study examine whether combination drug daclizumab sirolimus effectively treat adult uveitis , eye inflammation . Daclizumab monoclonal antibody design prevent specific chemical interaction need immune cell call lymphocyte produce inflammation . Sirolimus immune-suppressing drug also control lymphocyte activity market prevent organ rejection kidney transplant . Patients 18 year age old non-infectious uveitis one eye treat daclizumab relapse disease flare 6 month enter trial may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , complete eye examination , pregnancy test woman child . Women child-bearing potential enroll study pregnancy test every 12 week . After enrollment , participant follow additional exam : - Fluorescein angiography : This test do check abnormality eye blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take special camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible abnormality . This test do enrollment 1 year , unless additional test need medical management . - Pelvic ultrasound urine test : These test do enrollment 1 year check kidney , lymph node , pelvic area . - Blood test : Blood test do enrollment every 3 6 month laboratory immunology study Patients receive daclizumab subcutaneously ( skin ) infusion regularly schedule visit 52 week . At treatment , blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature monitor . After first 52 week , patient whose disease remain quiet increase time injection 6 week 8 week . Patients well time may stop daclizumab . One 2 day first daclizumab treatment , patient receive 6 mg sirolimus mouth . Their blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature monitor least 60 minute . Two day first dose , patient begin 2-mg maintenance dos every day 2 week . If intolerable side effect , dose increase 2 mg daily next 2 week . Patients intolerable side effect dose continue medication another 4 week . Patients experience intolerable side effect may decrease medication every day withdraw study . After week 78 study , daclizumab treatment stop , sirolimus dose reduce within 8 week may eventually discontinue patient continue well . Patients experience follow leave study : - Inflammation flare require concomitant treatment additional systemic immunosuppressive medication , prednisone cyclosporine - Disease flare twice first year - Any disease flare second year</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose investigate possible efficacy combination daclizumab sirolimus therapy induce peripheral immune tolerance participant present non-infectious intermediate posterior uveitis . This perform use Phase I/II pilot study . Subjects daclizumab monotherapy receive 6 mg load dose oral sirolimus week 0 , follow 2 mg dose every day 2 week . If tolerate , subject increase 2 mg daily dose . After one year combination therapy , subject taper daclizumab first sirolimus . The primary outcome ability participant successfully taper daclizumab sirolimus disease remain quiet ( vitreous haze less equal Trace ) 24 week systemic immunosuppressive medication ( approximately week 134 ) .</detailed_description>
