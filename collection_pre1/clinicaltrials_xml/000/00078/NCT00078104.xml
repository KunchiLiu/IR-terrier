	<brief_summary>This study evaluate well different medication work relieve pain follow third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction . Scientists believe hormone-like substance call prostanoids contribute pain follow oral surgery . Prostanoids produce cyclooxygenase ( COX ) enzymes . This study examine different medicine inhibit COX enzymes reduce amount prostanoids , thus amount inflammation pain . The study also look genetic factor involve production prostanoids response pain medication . ( Only bottom two wisdom teeth extract study . Patients whose top wisdom teeth also need remove teeth extract , also free charge , least 2 week first surgery . ) Healthy normal volunteer 16 35 year age general good health require third molar extraction may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history oral examination , include dental x-ray need confirm need third molar removal . On morning surgery , patient blood draw obtain DNA genetic study . Women childbearing age urine pregnancy test . One hour surgery , patient receive dose rofecoxib ( Vioxx® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , acetaminophen ( Tylenol® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , placebo ( pill active ingredient ) . A half-hour surgery , receive either standard painkiller call keterolac ( Toradol® ( Registered Trademark ) ) ) placebo arm vein . All patient also receive sedative midazolam ( Versed® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , also arm vein , induce drowsiness local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) numb mouth . After mouth numb , wisdom teeth extract , biopsy ( removal small piece tissue ) conduct area cheek next wisdom tooth . After surgery , small piece tubing place extraction site . Every 20 minute next 3 hour , inflammatory fluid collect tubing measure chemical believe cause pain swell . Patients complete questionnaire every 20 minute rate pain . Those still pain hour surgery may request receive `` rescue drug '' call tramadol ( Ultram® ( Registered Trademark ) ) pain relief . Patients remain clinic 3 6 hour monitor effect study drug anesthetic wear . After surgery second biopsy do measure change chemical produce response surgery . For biopsy , patient assign one two group - one group second biopsy within 3 hour surgery , take rescue drug , group return clinic next morning biopsy 24 hour surgery . Patients second group leave clinic surgery two pain medication ( tramadol study drug ) form record pain rating home . They permit take pain medication provide certain time . At end participation study , patient give pain medication flurbiprofen ( Ocufen® ( Registered Trademark ) ) take home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostanoid Levels After Medication Prevent Pain Following Third Molar ( Wisdom Tooth ) Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two cyclooxygenase isozymes , COX-1 -2 , know catalyze rate-limiting step prostaglandin synthesis target nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug . Recently , presence variant COX-1 , name COX-3 , demonstrate especially sensitive acetaminophen strongly express brain tissue . The propose study examine prostanoid suppression periphery inhibition COX-1 , -2 , -3 , evaluate time course expression COX isoenzymes term level mRNA protein . Subjects ( N equal 88 ) healthy volunteer schedule surgical removal impact third molar . Using double-blinded , randomize , parallel study design , subject allocate one four treatment group administer dose blind medication placebo . One hour prior oral surgery , rofecoxib 50 mg , acetaminophen 1000 mg placebo two group administer orally . Half hour prior surgery , ketorolac 30 mg placebo , administer intravenously . Microdialysis perform sample collection concurrent pain report immediate postoperative period three hour , collect transudate analyze ELISA evaluate prostanoid ( prostaglandin E2 , thromboxane B2 ) production . Subjects within group randomize biopsy collect baseline prior surgery either time subject ask rescue drug within 3 hour 24 hour follow surgery . The biopsy freeze liquid nitrogen assay later RT-PCR level COX-1 , COX-2 , COX-3 mRNA , microarray evaluation change overall mRNA expression . A portion biopsy sample immunostained reveal tissue-specific pattern COX isoenzymes expression within inflammatory tissue , another part biopsy sample analyze Western blot quantify amount protein . Fifty ml blood collect subject , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene regulate inflammatory response COX-1 , COX-2 , PGE receptor ( EPs ) , microsomal PGE synthase ( mPGES ) gene , analyze investigate role genetic factor individual difference drug response . The analgesic effect drug assess clinic every 20 minute first three hour extraction , next morning take medication use two pain intensity assessment instrument : category scale , visual analog scale ( VAS ) . We anticipate non-selective COX inhibitor , selective COX-2 inhibitor , selective COX-3 inhibitor differentially alter prostanoid production time course evaluate , primary sensory neuron innervate inflammatory tissue may differentially express COX isoenzymes differ sensitivity prototypic NSAIDs , coxibs , acetaminophen . We also anticipate several SNPs contribute individual difference COX expression drug response , implication individual variation pain , analgesic response , neuronal plasticity .</detailed_description>
