	<brief_title>Sensory Re-Training Following Facial Surgery Correction Facial Skeletal Disharmony</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal facial sensation negative impact patient ' oral behavior may adversely affect patient 's quality life alter sensation persists . Many patient abnormal sensation retain sensory function develop chronic pain , individual currently evidence-based noninvasive therapy . The goal project evaluate sensory re-training , rehabilitative therapy offer significant potential patient experience impaired sensory function regardless cause . This behavioral therapy approach use substantial clinical success hand injury patient since 1970s . Re-training appear enhance central reorganization impulse injure sensory nerve cerebral cortex alter sensory signal interpret translate functionally meaningful motor function . Sensory re-training compare placebo jaw-opening exercise single blind , randomize two-arm parallel group stratify block clinical trial , use orthognathic surgery patient subject . Orthognathic surgery patient offer uncompromised model evaluation new rehabilitative therapy . These healthy individual , treat correct dentofacial deformity , present surgery neurosensory impairment , yet routinely experience substantial alteration facial sensation follow surgical procedure . The effect sensory re-training evaluate use three type outcome : patient-centered measure assess magnitude negative effect alter sensation surgery recovery time need reach little negative effect ; neurosensory behavior measure assess patient 's ability learn alternate cue touch perception discrimination ; conventional neurosensory contact threshold measure ass actual deficit . Our primary focus patient 's perception negative impact alter sensation daily life .</detailed_description>
