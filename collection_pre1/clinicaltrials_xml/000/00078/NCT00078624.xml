	<brief_summary>People knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) frequently complain knee instability . This study test whether certain exercise improve knee stability , reduce pain , improve physical function people knee OA . Study hypotheses : 1 ) Participants stability train group demonstrate less pain high level physical function , base self-report measure pain function ( WOMAC , Lower Extremity Function Scale ) , less time complete Get Up Go test , physical performance measure function . 2 ) During walk step task , participant stability train group demonstrate great knee motion weight bearing , great vertical ground reaction force load rate , reduced ratio co-contraction quadriceps/hamsting tibialis anterior/gastrocnemius muscle pair compare standard group . Participants stability group also demonstrate great step length , single limb support time , average walk velocity compare standard group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traditional exercise therapy knee OA primarily focus low limb strength joint motion deficit . Recent evidence suggest change low limb biomechanical factor weight bear activity may substantial impact physical function disease progression individual knee OA . The effectiveness exercise therapy program might improve incorporate balance agility training technique ( knee stability training ) . The aim trial test effectiveness supplement traditional exercise therapy knee stability train technique tailor individual knee OA . Participants randomly assign one two group . The first group participate standard rehabilitation program traditional exercise therapy knee OA . The second group participate standard rehabilitation program supplement knee stability program . Study visit occur study entry , 2 month , 6 month , 1 year . At study visit , change pain , physical function , biomechanical factor assess . This study last one year .</detailed_description>
