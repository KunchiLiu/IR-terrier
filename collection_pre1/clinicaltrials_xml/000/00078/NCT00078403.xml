	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Maintenance Therapy Liver Disease Progression People Infected With Both HIV Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid progression liver disease liver failure observe people coinfected HIV HCV . This observation appear directly related increase rate fibrotic progression liver compare people infected HCV alone . PEG-IFN ribavirin use standard treatment HCV . This study test effectiveness use PEG-IFN reduce rate liver fibrosis progression participant coinfected HIV HCV could lower HCV viral load undetectable could maintain HCV viral load undetectable PEG-IFN ribavirin treatment . Participants enter Step 1 ( initial run-in period ) receive 12 week 180 mcg PEG-IFN subcutaneously weekly plus 1 1.2 g/day ribavirin base body weight . At week 12 , HCV RNA test perform . Participants early virologic response ( EVR ) , define &gt; =2 log10 drop HCV RNA baseline undetectable HCV RNA ( &lt; 600 IU/ml quantitative assay use Step 1 ) Week 12 , tolerate Step 1 treatment , enter Step 3 continue receive Step 1 treatment total 72 week ( Arm C ) . Participants meet criterion entry Step 3 discontinue study . In Step 3 , participant follow additional 24 week treatment discontinuation determine sustain virologic response ( SVR ) . Initially , Step 3 participant detectable HCV viral load ( &gt; =60 IU/ml qualitative assay use Step 3 ) Week 36 eligible enroll Step 2 . After early closure Step 2 , participant remain Step 3 study completion . Participants &lt; 2 log10 drop HCV RNA baseline detectable HCV RNA Week 12 ( non-EVR ) discontinue Step 1 treatment . Non-EVRs meet Step 2 eligibility criterion , enrol Step 2 randomize receive 180 mcg PEG-IFN subcutaneously weekly 72 week ( Arm A ) observation 72 week ( Arm B ) . Participants meet criterion entry Step 2 discontinue study . Step 2 study close prematurely May 2007 due low expect progression rate among participant observation arm primary objective could reach . There safety concern . Liver biopsy conduct study screening , Step 2 entry exit early closure Step 2 . Medical history assessment , physical exam , blood collection conduct every 4-12 week participant Steps 1 , 2 , 3 . Participants follow 18 week Step 1 , follow total 72 Step 2 total 84 week Step 3 .</detailed_description>
