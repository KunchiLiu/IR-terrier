	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness side effect experimental vaccine prevent recurrence nasopharyngeal cancer . The likelihood cancer return high patient whose original lesion large , whose cancer spread adjacent lymph node , surgery metastatic disease ( cancer spread beyond primary site ) . Nasopharyngeal tumor cause common virus call Epstein-Barr virus , produce protein call LMP-2 . Vaccination specific piece , peptide , LMP-2 protein may boost immune system 's fight cancer . The vaccine injection mixed oil-based substance call Montanide ISA-51 , intend increase immune response peptide . Patients 18 year age old whose nasopharyngeal cancer control standard treatment surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy currently free disease may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination blood urine test . x-ray image study also do patient test recently . All candidate test HLA tissue type . Only patient type HLA-A*1101 HLA-A*2402 - type two vaccine study base - receive vaccine therapy ; others offer standard medical treatment observation . Participants randomly assign receive injection one two different vaccine ( LMP-2:340-349 LMP-2:419-427 ) determine peptide may offer best immunity . Each treatment course consist weekly immunization 8 consecutive week . The injection give skin thigh . After every treatment course ( every 3 month ) , patient undergo series x-ray scan look tumor . The immunization give NIH Clinical Center . Patients monitor 1 hour injection blood test physical examination look treatment side effect . Immunizations may continue 12 month long cancer return . Patients follow blood test every 12 week monitor body function . They also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure collect white blood cells-before start treatment 3 4 week fourth vaccine evaluate vaccine affect action immune system cell . For procedure , blood drawn needle arm , similar donate blood . The blood process machine separate remove lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) , rest blood return needle arm . Patients receive vaccine also undergo leukapheresis assess natural response LMP-2 . Some patient may biopsy-surgical removal small piece tissue local anesthetic-of normal skin tumor lymph node tissue examine vaccine 's effect tumor immune cell . Patients show evidence immunization LMP-2 protein two course vaccine treatment subsequently follow observation alone . Those respond vaccine offer two additional course treatment strengthen response follow observation alone . Patients whose disease recur complete first two treatment course take study refer back local physician another study , appropriate one available .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . HLAA*1101 HLAA*2402 patient , great 18 year age , advance local disease ( T3T4N01M0 ) , nodal disease ( T1T2N23M0 ) locoregional disease ( T3T4N23M0 ) onset presently control standard therapy ( combination chemotherapy radiotherapy ) completely resect metastatic disease , 3 month completion primary treatment consider . All subject judge disease free base physical examination , ENT endoscopy , CT scan abdomen , chest , neck nasal sinuses MRI head . All subject must receive standard surgical , chemotherapy radiation therapy appropriate stage disease . Currently , standard treatment locally advance NPC U.S. consist concomitant cisplatin radiation follow 3 course cisplatin 5fluorouracil . This , comparable standard therapy consider part standard therapy patient consider accrual three month completion . Patients must demonstrate evidence local control histological radiological evidence recurrent disease three month end standard therapy , otherwise , clinically disease free time protocol entry document radiological study within 6 week patient entry . Physical histological evidence disease recurrence time patient ' screen follow perform supervision Dr. Carter Van Waes patient evaluation . Similar enrollment criterion use patient bear HLAA*1101 HLAA*2402 . However , patient follow observation . 2 . Pathologic confirmation nasopharyngeal carcinoma NCI Laboratory Pathology ( NPC ) . 3. serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dl less , 4 . Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl less , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 5 . WBC 3000/mm ( 3 ) great , 6. platelet count 90,000 mm ( 3 ) great , 7. serum AST/ALT le three time normal , 8 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 9 . Patients gender must willing practice effective birth control trial potential teratogenic effect unknown . 10 . Patients may prior adjuvant treatment may treatment metastatic disease evidence disease , include chemotherapy biotherapy , long 1 month elapse since prior systemic therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude : 1. Who undergo undergone past 3 week systemic therapy except surgery cancer , must recover adverse effect treatment prior entry , clinical implication , e.g . alopecia . In case patient receive surgical intervention ; least one month pas enrollment study . All toxicity previous therapy must resolve less equal Grade 1 NCICTC v 3.0 enrollment . 2. Who active systemic infection , autoimmune disease know immunodeficiency disease . d. Who require systemic steroid therapy . e. Who pregnant ( possible side effect fetus ) breastfeeding ( unknown effect develop child ) . f. Who know positive hepatitis BsAG HIV antibody ( possible immune effect condition ) . Patients may screen history positive hepatitis C may enrol transaminase level within limit specify inclusion criterion . g. Who form active primary secondary immunodeficiency recover immune competence chemotherapy radiation therapy . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Active secondary immunodeficiency judge base patient past medical history normality circulate T B cell count ( Normal range 6502 , 108 49 424 respectively , Department Laboratory Medicine , CC ) . In similar fashion recovery chemotherapy radiation therapy evaluate . Previous experience patient melanoma renal cell carcinoma underwent chemotherapy local radiation demonstrate immune response common T cell epitopes Flu Cytomegalovirus rapidly restore within first month treatment ( unpublished observation ) . h. Who know hypersensitivity agent use study .</criteria>
