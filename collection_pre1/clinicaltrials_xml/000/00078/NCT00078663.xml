	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether program systematic oral care help prevent hospital-acquired respiratory infection patient intensive care unit . Such infection occur five time often critically ill patient compare patient general hospital ward result long hospital stay increase risk death . The rate respiratory infection among critically ill patient correlate strongly presence disease-causing bacteria mucosal area mouth , gum , teeth , indicate assiduous oral care especially important patient population . This study compare program meticulous oral care use oral assessment taught dentist dental hygienist standard care typically give intensive care unit . Critically ill patient 18 year age old hospitalize intensive care unit 3 day whose oral hygiene dependent hospital care provider may eligible study . Patients recruit intensive care unit four Washington , D.C. , area hospital - Suburban Hospital , Washington Hospital Center , Inova Fairfax Hospital , Winchester Medical Center . Participants lip , mouth , gum , teeth , saliva examine several time day determine optimum oral care . They receive standard care , flossing , brushing , rinse mouthwash , possibly use antiseptic spray prevents bacteria cling teeth . Small sample saliva ( less one-fourth teaspoon ) dental plaque collect day patient admit intensive care unit day 3 5 stay unit . The saliva sample collect small suction tube place corner mouth ; plaque specimen collect glide tiny piece paper surface front tooth . The sample examine bacteria normally find saliva .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient , especially require endotracheal intubation , great risk hospitalize patient acquire nosocomial pneumonia . Nosocomial pneumonia , population , produce substantial increase mortality morbidity . The literature suggest causative pathway aspiration oropharyngeal pathogens find dental plaque . The build-up dental plaque significantly associate subsequent nosocomial respiratory infection . Thus , prevention pathogen colonization oropharyngeal cavity could effective infection control measure . Dental plaque reach critical thickness , act reservoir aerobic anaerobic pathogen . Failure remove plaque begin complex cascade biological activity pathogen adhere mucosal tooth surface pathogen overgrowth ensues . Additionally , neglect insufficient mouth care foremost predispose factor oral condition gingivitis , mucositis , stomatitis supply additional port entry pathogen . There handful study compare frequency type oral hygiene require prevent decrease oropharyngeal colonization . A recent pilot study , 01-CC-0207 , compare oral care provision two intensive care unit ( ICU ) Clinical Center . The test ICU offer meticulous oral hygiene system regular oral assessment taught dentist dental hygienist . The score assessment determine type frequency oral care . The control ICU give standard care typical ICU community . Plaque saliva assay collect enrolled patient . Significantly low Beck score low colony form organism specimens achieved test ICU day 3 , p le 0.03 p less 0.001 respectively . This protocol expand pilot prospective randomize assigned trial conduct four hospital Washington D.C. area . These hospital ICUs representative ICU 's nation-wide . This study test effectiveness comprehensive systematic oral care program reduce oral assessment score , mucosal plaque score , amount pathogen inoculum present saliva plaque . Intubated non-intubated patient compare well meticulous care without addition oral antiseptic , chlorhexidine . Consistency practice performance also evaluate nursing staff dentist/hygienist instruction monitor versus traditional nurse instruction .</detailed_description>
