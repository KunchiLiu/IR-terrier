	<brief_summary>This study evaluate patient rare inherited condition call Bardet-Biedl syndrome . The purpose study learn genetics clinical characteristic disorder . Patients may follow problem : polydactyly ( extra finger toe ) ; retinal dystrophy ( change retina may lead vision problem , include blindness ) ; obesity diabetes ( overweight high blood sugar due failure body organs respond insulin ) ; cognitive dysfunction ( difficulty learn understanding ) ; hypogenitalism ( decreased functioning ovary woman testis men ) ; kidney anomaly ( change structure function kidney ) ; heart disease ; hepatic fibrosis ( liver disease ) . Patients Bardet-Biedl syndrome may eligible study . First-degree relative also enrol certain test procedure . Candidates screen review medical record , laboratory test , x-ray . Patients study undergo follow test procedure : - Medical family history physical examination , include body measurement . - Blood test evaluation kidney , liver , heart , hormonal function , genetic study research purpose . - Dual emission x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure amount total body fat . For test , subject lie table scan low-dose X-rays . - Computed tomography ( adult ) abdomen measure abdominal fat . CT use small amount radiation obtain image internal body structure . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( child ) abdomen measure abdominal fat . MRI use magnetic field radio wave obtain image internal body structure . - Oral glucose tolerance test measure blood glucose insulin level . For test , patient drink glucose ( sugar ) solution . Blood sample draw IV catheter test begin 1 , 2 , 3 hour drink solution . - Complete eye examination look retinal change assess vision , , medically need , examination ear , nose , throat check hear breathe abnormality . - Tests learn ability patient 5 year age . For young patient , parent ask child 's development . - Ultrasound study ovary uterus female testis male . - Photographs face , hand , foot , body , genitalia , patient agrees . - Meeting investigator genetic counselor review test finding study complete . Relatives patient complete medical family history physical examination . Blood drawn assessment kidney , liver , heart , hormonal function genetic study research purpose . Relatives 5 year age may test learn ability cognition . For young patient , parent ask child 's development . Relatives meet investigator genetic counselor review test finding study complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS : severe obesity , polydactyly , learn disability , retinopathy , renal disease cardiac malformation ) describe 80 year ago , past year extensive data natural history molecular pathogenesis complex disorder report . We know BBS cause mutation least 12 , gene , although typically inherit autosomal recessive pattern , BBS may occasionally exhibit complex inheritance . In study , define physical ( body mass , percent distribution body fat ) metabolic ( hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , serum level lipids adipokines ) characteristic glucose fat metabolism cohort adult pediatric patient BBS . We also characterize hypogenitalism BBS , attempt determine relationship , , incidence obesity BBS . In addition , study retinal dystrophy , renal dysfunction , nature report mental retardation/learning disability find many patient . We plan correlate phenotypic manifestation subject result mutation analysis study . Our objective learn genetic alteration may underlie obesity associate organ dysfunction characterize BBS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We use previously publish clinical diagnostic criterion BBS ( 21 ) determine study eligibility probands . As outlined report , include patient present four five primary feature three primary feature two secondary feature . Parents also enrol genetic study . We enrol unaffected sibling recruit control subject , instead , result test compare previously publish data obtain appropriate nonBBS control subject . The initial determination eligibility make review prior clinical record . Some patient characterize sufficient detail know person meet clinical criterion , yet may suspect diagnosis . In case , subject bring NIH undergo clinically appropriate test make diagnosis . If clinical test confirm diagnosis , patient parent give appropriate clinical counseling return care personal physician . If feature later develop allow diagnosis make , may reenroll undergo evaluation . Our study population include patient age ethnic group , gender . The inclusion child essential research study correlate genotype phenotype , attempt early identification metabolic abnormality may best treat early age . Many agedependent manifestation BBS develop childhood average age diagnosis 9.2 year . Pregnant woman child age 5 yr undergo invasive research procedure ( i.e . phlebotomy ) procedures involve ionize radiation ( i.e . Xrays DEXA scan ) unless procedure would perform part standard medical care . Because cognitive dysfunction know component BBS , patient impaired cognition understanding may evaluate protocol . If investigator believe adult patient may competent give informed consent participate , understand consent document procedure study , patient may exclude participation . We may request patient accompany caregiver also interview independent ethic panel confirm competent give consent participate team feel would useful . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Neither healthy volunteer unrelated affect patient lab personnel enrol . We make effort obtain consent parents/guardians minor subject ( i.e . would allow single parent consent child parent parental right ) . If single parent guardian sole custody/legal responsibility child ( e.g. , divorce full custody one parent one parent decease ) , accept consent one parent . Both mother father child BBS ( also typically enrol protocol , describe ) eligible participate interview portion study . We hypothesize mother father , group , slightly different experience cop courtesy stigma , although couple may convergent belief , cop mechanism , experience . As , predict initially conduct interview parent proband ( assume parent interested participate ) , although may target either mother father follow interim analysis interview transcript .</criteria>
