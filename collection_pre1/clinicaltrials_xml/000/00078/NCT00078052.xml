	<brief_title>Genetic Markers Coronary Heart Disease Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , lead cause death United States , significant public health concern . Despite knowledge atherosclerosis underlie cause CHD , recognition genetic environmental factor contribute occurrence disease , identification large number genetic environmental factor find associated disease risk , etiology atherosclerosis later development CHD continue well understood . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The nested case-control study determine whether variability 20 gene belong endothelial inflammatory dysfunction pathway relate risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) among men woman diagnose type 2 diabetes two large ongoing prospective study , Nurses ' Health Study ( NHS ) Health Professionals ' Follow-up Study ( HPFS ) . This accomplished combine two complementary approach make possible recent advance knowledge human genome high-throughput genotyping technology . The investigator directly target functional variant cod region candidate gene also investigate association CHD ancestral haplotype locus . The specific aim : 1 . To identify novel variant 10 candidate gene inflammatory , endothelial dysfunction pathway systematically screen polymorphism target resequencing ; 2 . To assess relationship functional variant 20 candidate gene inflammatory endothelial dysfunction pathway risk CHD among subject diabetes NHS HPFS cohorts ; 3 . To identify subset polymorphism best capture overall genetic variability locus ( haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) htSNPs ) investigate association CHD risk haplotype define htSNPs ; 4 . To examine individual SNPs well haplotypes relation biochemical marker inflammation endothelial activation CRP , ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , E-selectin , TNF-a diabetic individual ; 5 . To examine gene-environment interaction relation CHD risk diabetic subject . By 2006 , estimate 820 case CHD confirm among diabetic men woman blood cohort . The large size , prospective design , high follow-up rate , detailed reliable long-term lifestyle outcome information , availability blood specimen make cohort valuable unique resource study genetic determinant accelerate atherosclerosis diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
