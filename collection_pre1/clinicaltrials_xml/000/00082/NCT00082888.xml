	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess tumor response R115777 ( tipifarnib ) patient relapse aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . ( Permanently close accrual 6/28/06 ) II . To assess tumor response R115777 patient relapse indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . ( Permanently close accrual 9/26/07 ) III . To assess tumor response R115777 patient uncommon non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . IV . To evaluate toxicity associate regimen patient relapse non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate know unknown molecular marker may predict response R115777 lymphoma tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive tipifarnib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
