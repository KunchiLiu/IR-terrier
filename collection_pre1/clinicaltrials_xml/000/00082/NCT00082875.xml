	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical efficacy EMD 121974 two different dos patient metastatic melanoma determine progression-free survival rate 8 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate EMD 121974 patient metastatic melanoma . II . To determine overall survival patient receive EMD 121974 . III . To determine safety toxicity EMD 121974 patient metastatic melanoma . IV . To determine population pharmacokinetics EMD 121974 . V. To determine biological activity EMD 121974 melanoma cell patient treated drug . VI . To evaluate use optical image functional dynamic imaging scan assess biological activity EMD 121974 . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind study . Patients stratify accord prior systemic treatment ( yes v ) , visceral metastasis ( yes v ) , serum lactic dehydrogenase level ( normal v abnormal ) , tumor integrin α_vβ_3 overexpression ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cilengitide IV 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11* , 15 , 18 , 22 , 25 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *For first course , treatment omit day 11 . ARM II : Patients receive cilengitide arm I high dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
