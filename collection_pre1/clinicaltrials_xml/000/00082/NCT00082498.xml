	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Oral HIV Entry Inhibitor Vicriviroc HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vicriviroc oral HIV-1 entry inhibitor target CCR5 receptor T cell . Vicriviroc show safe , well-tolerated , active Phase I clinical trial treatment-naive HIV infect patient . The goal study evaluate antiretroviral activity three dose level vicriviroc HIV infect , treatment-experienced patient fail current ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The study last least 48 week , 5 year . There 3 step study . Patients randomly assign one 4 group . Group 1 receive placebo ; Group 2 receive 5 mg vicriviroc daily ; Group 3 receive 10 mg vicriviroc daily ; Group 4 receive 15 mg vicriviroc daily . If Week 16 participant 's viral load meet certain criterion , dose increase vicriviroc may occur participant enter Step 2 . As 10/12/05 , patient Group 2 patient enter Step 2 follow virologic failure Step 1 unblinded offer either 15 mg vicriviroc daily study option seek alternative treatment . All patient continue current ART ( provide study ) . After two week , patient receive ART optimize result genotypic/phenotypic test perform study screen . All participant receive receive vicriviroc enter Step 3 follow additional 4 year . Participants complete study may eligible receive vicriviroc rollover study sponsor Schering-Plough , drug 's manufacturer . Physical exam blood collection occur study entry , Day 4 , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Additionally , blood drawn twice , least 2 hour apart , Weeks 2 8 vicriviroc pharmacokinetic analysis . Patients undergo electrocardiogram ( EKG ) Weeks 2 , 8 , 24 , 48 . Patients assessed peripheral neuropathy study entry Weeks 24 48 , ask complete adherence questionnaire entry Weeks 2 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . For Step 3 participant undergoing follow-up , physical exam blood work occur every 6 month 4 year . Five participant currently enrol four site longer receive funding transfer redirect site within proximity subject follow change . There long follow-up visit per schedule event describe protocol . Instead , participant follow-up limited self-report telephone interview ascertain vital status , occurrence malignancy ( ) , collection information HIV-1 RNA CD4 cell count . For participant , HIV-1 RNA CD4 cell count do part participant 's clinical care pay study . The follow-up telephone interview conduct six-month interval use script provide study team .</detailed_description>
