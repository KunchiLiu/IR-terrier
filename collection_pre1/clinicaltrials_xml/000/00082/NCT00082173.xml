Appropriate treatment person active TB important limit transmission M. tuberculosis prevent TB-related mortality . Current therapy require 6 month four-drug regimen isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampin ( RIF ) , pyrazinamide ( PZA ) , EMB . The development alternative regimen priority , new class antituberculosis agent need provide treatment option patient drug-resistant disease . This study evaluate effectiveness replace EMB MOX multi-drug regimen initial phase treatment smear-positive pulmonary TB patient without HIV infection . Participants study randomly assign receive either MOX-containing drug regimen standard EMB-containing drug regimen 8 week . Participants study visit weekly 8 week .
