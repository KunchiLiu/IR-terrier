	<brief_summary>Background : - Tc-94m sestamibi radioactive imaging drug approve Food Drug Administration help photograph study bodily function . - Tc-94m sestamibi accumulate tumor cell eliminate much way chemotherapy drug eliminate cancer cell patient drug resistance . - P-glycoprotein protein find surface cancer cell . The protein cause cell pump , reject , type chemotherapy drug . P-glycoprotein also make cell reject sestamibi . - Some drug , include drug call tariquidar , may block pump action P-glycoprotein , give chemotherapy time work . Tariquidar also help sestamibi stay cell longer . Objectives : -To evaluate use sestamibi determine chemotherapy reject enough block drug present stop rejection . Eligibility : -Patients18 year age old tumor 2 cm large enrol eligible enrollment active National Cancer Institute treatment protocol . Design : - Patients two scan , one receiving drug second 1-2 hour receive tariquidar . The second scan do 72 hour first . For scan , Tc-94m sestamibi inject vein series picture take image camera call PET ( positron emission tomography ) scanner . The picture show sestamibi distributes body monitor effect tariquidar drug resistance . Blood sample collect scan examine effect tariquidar P-glycoprotein normal cell . - Some patient may ask undergo tumor biopsy test presence P-glycoprotein cancer cell . This requested patient whose tumor easily accessible biopsy do minimal risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - A pilot study PET image Tc-94m sestamibi ass activity multidrug transporter , MDR-1 ( Multi Drug Resistance Protein 1 ) /P-glycoprotein , ATP ( adenosine 5'-triphosphate ) -binding cassette protein transport drug cell , thereby reduce intracellular drug accumulation . - Tariquidar safe , nontoxic antagonist P-glycoprotein . Previous study demonstrate tariquidar increase retention radioimaging agent , Tc99 sestamibi normal liver subset tumor . These study limit semiquantitative nature total body image conventional radionuclide scintigraphy - In collaboration Clinical Center Nuclear Medicine Department , PET image agent develop , Tc-94m sestamibi , FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) grant approval use human . Objectives : -To evaluate feasibility Tc-94m sestamibi PET imaging agent , allow great resolution quantitation thereby make possible direct quantitative comparison tumor uptake treatment P-glycoprotein antagonist . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age , eligible , complete enrollment active NCI ( National Cancer Institute ) protocol treatment cancer . - Negative pregnancy test within 24 hrs Tc-94m injection . - An index lesion great 2cm require optimize PET image . - Prior treatment P-glycoprotein antagonist allow . Design : - Designed feasibility study . Patients meet eligibility criterion sign informed consent undergo PET sestamibi image scan Department Nuclear Medicine . Seventy-two hour later , dose tariquidar administer repeat image study . - Blood obtain analysis pharmacokinetics Tc-94m sestamibi , isolation peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay P-glycoprotein inhibition circulate CD56+ cell . These assessment need confirm impact tariquidar P-glycoprotein normal cell - example , involve drug excretion circulate mononuclear cell . These result use inform finding PET image study . - Fifteen patient enrol pairwise comparison make sestamibi residence time tumor , normal liver , kidney , heart . All comparison note exploratory .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must eligible enrollment active NCI ( National Cancer Institute ) protocol treatment cancer . Patients great equal 18 year old . Performance Status ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) 0 2 . Patients must able give informed consent . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 24 hr Tc94m injection . Patients previously receive tariquidar eligible , since study systematically show loss MDR1 ( Multi Drug Resistance Protein 1 ) /Pgp expression tumor follow exposure tariquidar anticancer agent . An index lesion great 1.5 cm require optimize PET ( positron emission image ) image . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pregnant breastfeed enrolled order prevent radiation exposure develop fetus infant . Patients weigh great 136 kg ( weight limit scanner table ) . Patients tumor size le 1.5 cm exclude . HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) positive patient exclude prevent potential drug interaction tariquidar antiretroviral agent .</criteria>
