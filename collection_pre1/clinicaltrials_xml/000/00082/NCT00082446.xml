	<brief_title>Combination Study With MVA BN Dryvax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal phase I trial expand available data safety immunogenicity MVA-BN vaccinia-naïve adult . The secondary goal vaccine trial : determine optimum dose MVA-BN , give twice , induce immune response attenuate Dryvax® take reaction ; compare ability 2 route administration MVA-BN , subcutaneous intramuscular , induce immune response high test dose . A total 90 healthy adult volunteer age 18-32 participate study . The volunteer randomly assign 1 6 group immunize : MVA-BN ( subcutaneously ) 1 3 dose level Dryvax® ( per scarification ) ; placebo ( subcutaneously ) Dryvax® ( per scarification ) ; MVA-BN ( subcutaneously ) high dose level placebo scarification ; MVA-BN ( intramuscularly ) high dose level Dryvax® ( per scarification ) . The study last 30 month . Each volunteer 's participation last 6 month treatment group . Subjects randomize treatment group D E follow-up 2 year . During time , volunteer return periodically blood draw check immune response . Subjects require visit dress change need post-Dryvax vaccination . Variables investigate include : adverse event side effect vaccine , immunogenicity test include antibody cellular response vaccine .</detailed_description>
