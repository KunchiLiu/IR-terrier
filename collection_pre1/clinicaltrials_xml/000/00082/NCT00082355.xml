	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness low-dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA , alteplase ) dissolve blood clot deep leg vein . Alteplase use clear blood clot coronary artery patient heart attack . Blood clot develop deep leg vein cause pain swelling may break loose lodge lung . Current routine treatment use anticoagulant heparin stop clot enlarge prevent clot move lung reliably dissolve clot leg.In early study show rtPA could use actually dissolve clot . This study determine whether low dos rtPA dissolve clot fewer bleed complication current higher-dose regimen . Patients 18 year age old blood clot deep vein pelvis leg may eligible study symptom 14 day less never clot deep vein . Participants admit hospital 5 day . On first treatment day , patient venogram show location clot . The radiologist injects x-ray contrast material small vein foot watch dye x-ray move leg , reveal clot ( ) . A catheter ( plastic tube ) insert vein either behind knee , groin , neck , advance reach clot . When catheter place , rtPA inject radiologist watch vein x-ray image . The amount rtPa need depend size clot . Up five venogram may do clot require maximum four rtPA treatment allow study . During treatment , patient receive standard dos heparin , give continuously vein , After completion treatment , anticoagulation continue use low molecular weight heparin ( usually enoxaparin ) give subcutaneous injection transition medication conversion anticoagulation warfarin ( also know coumadin ) , another blood thinner , take mouth . Patients continue take warfarin 6 month . During thrombolytic therapy , blood sample draw shortly first dose rtPA five time point afterward measure rtPA circulation factor indicate whether rtPA affect clot ability . Blood also draw least day monitor heparin level . To evaluate impact treatment function leg , patient return Rehabilitation Medicine Department Radiology department 6 week ( 4 8 week ) 6 month clinical image evaluation impact therapy venous function . The objective determine well treatment restore venous function whether do safely- without cause bleed complication , main risk previous thrombolytic treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Alteplase Treat Blood Clots Deep Leg Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) low extremity routinely treat anticoagulant , effective prevent pulmonary embolism , reliably restore venous function leg affect DVT , often leave permanent vein damage lead chronic disability know post thrombotic syndrome . There evidence may prevent , therefore long-term sequela avoid , thrombus dissolve quickly thrombolytic agent . In previous protocol develop method use intra-clot injection alteplase ( recombinant tissue plasminogen activator , rtPA ) treatment low extremity DVT . Although treatment successful complication , pharmacokinetic data obtain suggest regimen make safer perhaps even effective use substantially low dose alteplase . The current protocol pilot study test hypothesis treat 25 patient first-time DVT symptomatic less equal 14 day , accept refer physician within outside National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . They treat less equal 10 mg alteplase per day four day . Depending location extent blood clot , catheter introduce jugular , femoral , popliteal , and/or posterior tibial vein ankle inject alteplase ( dilute normal saline 0.1mg/ml , throughout entire length clot ) day total daily dose limited 10mg alteplase per day.The protocol design low-dose regimen unsuccessful , patient subsequently receive higher-dose regimen previously show effective . During thrombolytic therapy , catheter leave vein maintain venous access also use infuse unfractionated heparin provide regional therapeutic systemic anticoagulation . After complete thrombolytic therapy , patient anticoagulated approximately 6 month treatment conversion intravenous infusion unfractionated heparin thrombolytic therapy low molecular weight heparin ( enoxaparin ) subsequent conversion oral warfarin anticoagulation 6 month . Efficacy treatment evaluate 3 time point ( pre- 1 day post-thrombolytic therapy initial outcome ; 6 week short term outcome ; 6 month durability outcome ) clinical examination ( department Rehabilitation Medicine ) medical image venography duplex ultrasound sans department Radiology . The protocol also monitor safety . Safety monitoring focus bleeding complication primary risk form thrombolytic anticoagulation regimen . As adverse event , bleed complication classify either expect ( example , vascular puncture access sit treatment catheter insert ) ; unexpected remote sit instrumentation conduct ( example , Intracranial retroperitoneal bleed ) .The latter form bleeding report attributed use thrombolytic anticoagulant therapy usually much serious former . A second classification severity adverse event . For protocol serious adverse event event life quality life threatening , require additional hospitalization , surgical intervention , case thrombolytic therapy require blood transfusion . A minor adverse event one feature resolve without sequelae conservative management without need invasive intervention . A secondary objective ( add protocol amendment ) study rate recurrent DVT 5 year period treatment . Historical study show recurrent venothromboembolism rate 30 % patient treated anticoagulation alone . Thrombolytic therapy improve preservation venous function may reduce recurrence rate venothromboembolism although protocol accrue new patient , protocol remain active allow data compilation test hypothesis patient already treat complete 2014 , expect date protocol termination .</detailed_description>
