	<brief_summary>This Phase II , non-randomized , open label study ILX651 patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer previously treat docetaxel . Approximately 40 patient enrol study expect last 24 month . All patient treat ILX651 administer IV daily 5 consecutive day every 21 day . The primary objective study determine PSA response rate . The secondary objective determine response measurable disease , duration response , time PSA progression , time treatment failure , survival , safety tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile ILX651 .</brief_summary>
