	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate child recurrent refractory neuroblastoma treat hu14.18-interleukin-2 ( hu14.18-IL2 ) fusion protein . - Determine adverse event drug patient . - Determine immunologic activation patient treat drug . - Determine induction anti-hu14.18-IL2 antibody patient treat drug . - Correlate antitumor response measurement toxicity , immune activation , anti-hu14.18-IL2 antibody activity patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord measurable/evaluable disease ( measurable standard radiographic criterion vs evaluable MIBG ( meta-iodobenzylguanidine ) scan and/or bone marrow histology vs disease identify quantified bone marrow immunohistochemistry ) . For standard radiographic criterion study use definition measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) National Cancer Institute . Complete Response ( CR ) - Disappearance target lesion . No evidence tumor site ( chest , abdomen , liver , bone , bone marrow , node , etc ) . Very Good Partial Response ( VGPR ) - Greater 90 % decrease disease measurement CT/MRI target lesion , take reference disease measurement do confirm measurable disease target lesion study entry ; pre-existing bone lesion CR MIBG ; MIBG scan SD CR soft tissue lesion correspond lesion CT/MRI . Partial Response ( PR ) - At least 30 % decrease disease measurement CT/MRI target lesion , take reference disease measurement do confirm measurable disease target lesion study entry . Progressive Disease ( PD ) - Any one following : ) At least 20 % increase disease measurement CT/MRI target lesion , take reference small disease measurement record since start treatment . b ) Appearance one new lesion new site tumor . c ) PD define either bone marrow MIBG lesion . Stable disease ( SD ) - The patient classify stable disease overall response stable disease either CT/MRI lesion , bone marrow , MIBG criterion . No new lesion ; new site disease . Patients enrol 3 stratum , evaluate antitumor response follow 2 monthly course ( treatment Days 1-3 , follow 25 day observation , ) . Patients progressive disease take protocol therapy . Patients stabilization regression disease eligible receive 2 monthly course treatment . Additional treatment follow course 4 allow patient show continued clinical response , maximum 10 course treatment . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-60 patient ( 20 stratum 1 2 0-20 stratum 3 ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
