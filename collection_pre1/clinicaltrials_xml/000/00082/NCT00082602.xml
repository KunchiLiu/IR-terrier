	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study Extended Release ( ER ) Galantamine Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To improve dose convenience current formulation galantamine , new daily dosing Extended Release ( ER ) formulation develop . In different large study , approximately 900 patient Alzheimer 's disease participate , efficacy Extended Release formulation confirm . During first 8 week treatment , nausea vomit occur less frequently Extended Release Intermittent Release formulation . This suggest patient might better tolerate rapid dose escalation initial maintenance dose 16mg daily , thereby improve risk/benefit ratio first 4 week therapy , i.e . receive drug sooner . The trial objective : 1 ) demonstrate safety tolerability galantamine Extended Release 16 mg daily titrate 8 mg daily one week ; 2 ) evaluate effect galantamine Extended Release cognition measure Mini Mental State Examination . Results prior trial show galantamine Intermittent Release ( twice day dose ) high rate adverse event dose escalation occur one-week interval . Therefore , current galantamine label recommends drug dose escalate every 4 week . The study hypotheis rapid dose escalation Extended Release formulation subject Alzheimer 's disease safe well tolerate . Comparison adverse event rate make first 8 week Reminyl Extended Release group another trial Extended Release formulation titrate 8 mg daily 16 mg daily 4 week . Subjects receive galantamine Extended Release capsule mouth start 8 mg daily one week titrate 16 mg daily . This dose maintain 11 additional week . 8 mg Galantamine Extended Release Capsules daily one week . After one week titrate 16 mg daily 11 week .</detailed_description>
