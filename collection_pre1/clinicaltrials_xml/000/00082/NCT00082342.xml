	<brief_summary>This study examine effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) gait ( walk ) problem rigidity patient Parkinson 's disease . tDCS method brain stimulation may able change electrical activity nerve brain , possibly cause Parkinson 's disease symptom improve . Patients 40 80 year age moderately severe Parkinson 's disease whose main symptom problem walk , include freezing , rigidity , may eligible study . Candidates must take Sinemet another L-DOPA drug much tremor . Participants assign receive either real sham ( placebo ) tDCS . Both group eight treatment 3-1/2 week . For tDCS , electrode place wet pad scalp . An electrical current pass electrode , travel scalp skull , cause small electrical current cortex-the out part brain . Participants neurological examination , include evaluation walking , tDCS session . Patients ' motor function re-evaluated 1 , 3 , 6 month last tDCS treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) need improvement , particularly area gait freeze . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) pass weak direct current ( DC ) current skull across cortex do many year numerous effect describe healthy subject patient mental illness . Recently , show objective mean , control experiment , type treatment robust lasting effect excitability motor cortex healthy human . We hypothesize tDCS beneficial effect gait freezing medicate patient , propose test control trial . Specifically , propose look effect 1-2 mA tDCS anode position frontal pole and/or premotor primary motor cortex , cathode mastoid process . Over one-year period , enroll 42 adult PD evaluate acute tDCS effect period four week ( eight tDCS session , nine visit ) . Additional rating do one three month end tDCS session . Symptoms evaluate standard test motor function , include Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) specific test gait freeze . We also look cumulative , long-lasting effect three-month period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients PD correspond inclusion criterion recruit Human Motor Control Section Clinic ( HMCS ) . Subjects men woman age 4080 year DOPAresponsive , akineticrigid PD . Patients never participate HMCS protocol PD interview examine either principal investigator physician Brain Stimulation Unit HMCS order establish diagnosis PD rule neurological condition . Only patient Hoehm Yahr grade 2 4 `` '' accept . Patients must regimen include levodopa . The total dose levodopa dopamine agonist ( use dopamine equivalent ) equal 375 milligram per day . Other antiparkinsonian medication also acceptable . Patients problem walk , include freezing , gait time 10meter distance six second . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion significant medical psychiatric illness ( except symptom often associate PD levodopa therapy , sundowning benign hallucination ) , pallidotomy , implant electrode generator deep brain stimulation , pregnancy . Persons surgically traumatically implanted foreign body pacemaker , implant medical pump , implant hearing aid , metal plate skull , metal implant skull eye ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard TEP also exclude . Most exclusion also come category significant medical illness . Patients participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue risk stress reason tendency fall , excessive fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehensiveness also exclude . Patients unable walk 10meter distance exclude . Mentally impaired patient capacity provide consent exclude study .</criteria>
