	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study cancer survivor identify increase risk develop late-occurring complication undergo treatment childhood cancer . A patient 's gene may affect risk develop complication , congestive heart failure , heart attack , stroke , second cancer , year undergo cancer treatment . Genetic study may help doctor identify survivor childhood cancer likely develop late complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Identifying Late-Occurring Complications Childhood Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify key adverse event develop patient ( case ) primary cancer diagnose age 21 younger . II . To characterize key adverse event respect nature primary malignancy ( pathology , stage ) cod detail therapeutic protocol . III . To identify treatment-related demographic risk factor direct comparison case-group control identify remain patient primary diagnosis . IV . To compare frequency mutation polymorphisms specific candidate gene case control , use constitutional deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) case control . V. To explore role nature gene-environment interaction development key adverse event . OUTLINE : DNA RNA peripheral blood buccal sample patient analyze presence polymorphism candidate gene associate increase risk late-occurring complication .</detailed_description>
