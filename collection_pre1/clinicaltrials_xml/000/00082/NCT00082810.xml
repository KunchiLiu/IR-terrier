	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give tipifarnib together fulvestrant work second-line therapy treat postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive inoperable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer progress previous first-line endocrine therapy . Tipifarnib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen . Combining tipifarnib fulvestrant may kill tumor cell respond first-line therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy tipifarnib ( R115777 , Zarnestra™ ) combination fulvestrant base clinical benefit rate ( CBR , combination complete response rate , partial response rate , stable disease 24 week ) postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer progressive disease first-line endocrine therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine median time progression ( TTP ) duration response tipifarnib ( R115777 , Zarnestra™ ) combination fulvestrant postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer . II . To determine median overall survival tipifarnib ( R115777 , Zarnestra™ ) combination fulvestrant postmenopausal woman hormone receptor- positive metastatic breast cancer progressive disease first-line endocrine therapy . III . To determine toxicity profile tipifarnib ( R115777 , Zarnestra™ ) combination fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone ( historical control ) postmenopausal woman hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer progressive disease first-line endocrine therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity* . NOTE : *Fulvestrant continue even tipifarnib hold toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
