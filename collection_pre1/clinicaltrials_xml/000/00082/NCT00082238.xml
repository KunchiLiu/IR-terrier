	<brief_summary>People CF high incidence diabetes , call CFRD . CFRD important cause worsen morbidity mortality , thus understand pathophysiology underlie development imperative . Insulin deficiency well recognize one cause CFRD ; however clinical presentation study pathogenesis indicate etiology complex . There strong evidence normal metabolism carbohydrate , protein fat alter CF . We believe inflammatory response chronic underlie lung disease responsible insulin resistance alters substrate metabolism , change , addition insulin deficiency cause CFRD . Our global hypothesis hyperglycemia cause , part , high rate gluconeogenesis result excessive amino acid substrate availability cause cytokine-mediated protein catabolism . We hypothesize inflammation alters normal fatty acid metabolism lead lipogenesis , energy wasteful pathway . We recruit 24 adult CF subject 10 control ( similar distribution lean tissue mass , age gender ) categorize accord glucose tolerance ( OGTT ) , well insulin secretion insulin sensitivity use Tolbutamide-stimulated IVGTT Minimal Model . Clinical status characterize measure pulmonary function modify NIH score , addition measuring level circulate cytokine . Gluconeogenesis ( GNG ) quantify measure incorporation 2H 2nd , 5th 6th carbon glucose . Amino acid turnover rate measure use stable isotope lactate alanine whole body protein turnover ( WBPT ) measure use [ 1-13C ] leucine [ 15N2 ] urea . Fat metabolism evaluate measure ketone body turnover use stable isotope , quantify lipogenesis use isotopomer equilibration method . Key enzymes fatty acid metabolism also measure . We utilize indirect calorimetry measure rest energy expenditure . Subjects recruit CF center University Texas- Southwestern South Central CF Consortium . Our proposal intend well describe unique metabolism people CF , provide comprehensive evaluation pathophysiologic change contribute development CFRD wasting ; part applicant 's long-range goal identify underlying cause CF relate diabetes catabolism disease-specific therapy develop . We fully expect propose study provide new important information .</brief_summary>
