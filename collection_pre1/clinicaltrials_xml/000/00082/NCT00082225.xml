	<brief_summary>Patients type cancer call Hodgkin 's lymphoma non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , come back go away high risk come back treatment , include best treatment investigator know disease . Investigators ask patient volunteer research study use new experimental therapy consist special immune system cell call LMP2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes combination special protein call monoclonal antibody . Some patient Hodgkin non-Hodgkin Lymphoma show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis lymphoma . EBV find cancer cell half patient lymphoma , suggest may play role cause lymphoma . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . Investigators want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill EBV infected cell survive blood affect tumor . The investigator use sort therapy treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post transplant lymphoma . In type cancer tumor cell 9 protein make EBV surface . They grow T cell laboratory recognize 9 protein able prevent treat post transplant lymphoma . However Hodgkin disease non-Hodgkin Lymphoma tumor cell express 2 EBV protein . In previous study investigator make T cell recognize 9 protein give patient Hodgkin disease . Some patient partial response therapy patient complete response . Investigators think one reason may many T cell react protein tumor cell . They try find improve treatment grow T cell recognize one protein express Lymphoma cell call LMP-2 . These special T cell call LMP-2 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . In study investigator also try see improve result treat patient first special protein call antibody give EBV specific T cell . The reason EBV specific T cell work well bone marrow transplant patient prevent treat EBV cancer . These patient immune cell give trained T cell therefore lot space train cell grow . Investigators hope improve effect train T cell Hodgkin disease non-Hodgkin Lymphoma patient first temporarily remove patient 's T cell give trained cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators first test biopsy tumor already do see tumor cell EBV positive . They get permission take 60ml ( 12 teaspoonful ) blood patient donor one two occasion use blood grow T cell laboratory . They first grow special type cell call dendritic cell stimulate T cell put specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry LMP-2a gene dendritic cell . These dendritic cell treat radiation could grow . They use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP-2a surface . Investigators grow LMP-2a specific CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell ( make patient 's blood donor 's blood infecting EBV laboratory ) . The investigator also put adenovirus carry LMP2 gene EBV infect cell increase amount LMP2 cell . Again , EBV infect cell treat radiation could grow . Once sufficient number T cell make , investigator test make sure kill cell LMP2a surface . These cell ready give patient agree study . Investigators also take 500 ml ( 2 1/2 cup ) extra blood patient donor , frozen . In case patient 's cell recover expect antibody cell infusion , cell thaw give back patient . If patient agree treatment get treat CD45 antibodies 4 day row 2-3 day later get dose LMP2 specific CTLs . The CD45 antibody give patient vein 6-8 hour monitor least 6 hour infusion . After infusion The patient check level CD45 blood 24 hour ( optional ) and/or 48-72 hour last infusion check level low enough give patient CTLs . The CTLs thaw injected central line , patient one , vein arm 10 minute , pretreatment Tylenol Benadryl . We monitor clinic 4 hour injection . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Methodist Hospital . We follow patient clinic CTL injection . If reduction size lymphoma CT MRI scan assess radiologist , receive six additional dos T cell wish .</detailed_description>
