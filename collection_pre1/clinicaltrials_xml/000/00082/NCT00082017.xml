	<brief_summary>This study examine effect experimental drug call UCN-01 ( 7-hydroxystaurosporine ) T-cell lymphoma . UCN-01 inhibits growth several different tumor cell , , laboratory study , work particularly well tumor cell take patient T cell lymphoma . Patients 9 year age old T cell lymphoma relapse respond chemotherapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis . Additional test may do clinically indicate , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , bone marrow aspiration biopsy , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) CT 's magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evidence central nervous system disease . Participants give UCN-01 28-day treatment cycle . The drug give vein continuous 72-hour infusion first cycle 36-hour infusion subsequent cycle . The total number cycle patient receive depends well tumor responds drug well patient tolerates drug side effect . Patients well may receive treatment 1 year . Patients whose disease worsen treatment tolerate therapy take study . Some screening test repeat periodically course treatment monitor safety treatment response . X-rays scan do every treatment cycle first 6 cycle , cancer stable improving , interval image study lengthen every 4 cycle . Patients whose tumor safely biopsied undergo procedure enter study 3 5 day complete first UCN-01 treatment . Biopsies require open surgery ( e.g. , chest abdomen ) do absolutely necessary medical care . Biopsy tissue , blood , fluid analyze gene protein study relate lymphoma research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 ( 7-Hydroxystaurosporine ) Treat Relapsed T-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - UCN-01 ( 7-hydroxystaurosporine ) , non-specific protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor appear several mechanism action include protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoenzyme inhibition cyclin dependent kinase activation inhibition . - We demonstrate cell line derive T-cell lymphoma , include ( 2 ; 5 ) translocation , sensitive UCN-01 . The ( 2 ; 5 ) translocation , associate three quarter case anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) , oncogenic fusion protein - nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( NPM-ALK ) . - Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) one potential target UCN-01 action , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) derive SUDHL-1 cell contain NPM-ALK protein show sensitive UCN-01 . Objectives : - To assess clinical response UCN-01 progression-free overall survival patient relapse refractory systemic Anaplastic Large Cell mature T-cell Lymphomas . - To assess effect UCN-01 ALK expression ALCL cell . - To assess effect UCN-01 soluble tetrameric antibody complex ( TAC ) ( CD25 ) . - To evaluate mature T-cell lymphoma malignant cell complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarray . Eligibility : - Relapsed refractory systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma ( ALCL ) T Null phenotype relapse refractory mature T-cell lymphoma . - All patient evaluable measurable disease entry study . - Requires systemic therapy - Performance Status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) less equal 2 - Age 7 year old - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) negative - Patients receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 week study entry . Design : - The study Phase II study . - Patients receive first cycle UCN-01 72 hour day 1-3 subsequent cycle 36 hour . Patients stable disease may receive UCN-01 1 year beyond achieve maximum response stable disease , restaging do every 2 cycle first 6 cycle every 4 cycle thereafter . - Two sequential biopsy perform investigate complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) expression microarray . Soluble Tac ( CD25 ) serially follow patient . - For two histology , study conduct use Simon two-stage optimal design . Up 37 patient treat .</detailed_description>
