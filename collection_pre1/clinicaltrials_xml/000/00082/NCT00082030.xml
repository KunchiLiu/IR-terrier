	<brief_summary>This study explore brain function relate depressive symptom examine DNA gene may involve depressive disorder , particularly gene regulate synthesis metabolism brain neurotransmitter catecholamine . It compare finding patient major depressive disorder remission normal , healthy volunteer . Patients remit major depressive disorder healthy normal volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen psychiatric medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Participants undergo follow test procedure eight visit NIH Clinical Center : Memory Tasks Problem Solving Brain Imaging Subjects test measurement intelligence memory ability . They also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , test us magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For procedure , patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The MRI last 60 minute . Catecholamine Depletion Study For study , subject take capsule contain either AMPT ( drug temporarily reduce brain catecholamine activity ) placebo ( lactose capsule , affect brain catecholamine activity ) 9 a.m. , 2 p.m. , 7 p.m. one visit return next day take additional capsule 7 a.m. noon . In addition study medication , subject keep low-monoamine diet ( e.g. , chocolate , cheese , smoke meat , various food enumerate ) smoke , drink alcohol , take food drink contain caffeine . After take study capsule , subject positron emission tomography ( PET ) functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan , follow : - fMRI : While lie MRI scanner , subject performs monetary reward task somewhat like play computer video game money . The amount cash subject win depend performance . It possible lose money previously , performance decline . This portion study provide information brain process reward role catecholamine process . - PET : The subject inject arm glucose solution radioactive substance attach detect PET scanner . During scan , subject look photograph face computer screen ask tell gender person . This test show brain blood flow measure brain glucose ( sugar ) metabolism , reflect brain activity . At end scan , subject ask mood general well . They return Clinical Center follow day evaluation emotional state . The catecholamine depletion study repeat second time 14 day first . Subjects receive AMPT capsule first study take lactose capsule second study , vice-versa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The depressive anhedonic response precipitate CD raise possibility dysfunction dopamine system stable , sometimes latent characteristic MDD . Following line reason , central catecholamine dysfunction evince CD may equally salient subset unaffected relatives genetic risk develop disorder . We plan extend phase I project unaffected relative BD MDD patient order evaluate sensitivity CD endophenotype MDD BD . In order maximize statistical power , recruit equal number healthy low high-risk relative . Here , risk define basis chronological age ( see detail ) . Furthermore , recently become feasible conduct genome-wide association study quantify burden risk allele carry individual . Certainly , identity risk allele remain unknown unproven . Nevertheless , Francis McMahon 's group , collaborate , identify upwards 20 common risk variant two independent sample . Individuals carry 19 risk allele find 4 time likely case control . This approach may provide u another method quantify genetic risk . The endophenotypic status sensitivity CD evaluate psychometric instrument , FDG PET , fMRI-coupled appetitive learning task . We access high resolution PET scanner ( High Resolution Research Tomograph ) enable u study hitherto irresolvable structure importance habenula peri-aqueductal gray matter ( PAG ) addition previously implicate region ventral striatum OFC . Analysis metabolic activity region sham CD condition remit MDD relative BD MDD patient great theoretical import . So identifying region brain involve reward response selectively impacted CD , question hope answer use fMRI-coupled appetitive learning task .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : MDD Sample : 40 subject ( age 1845 ) remit MDD select . MDD define DSMIV criterion , one follow additional criterion : 1. history two major depressive episode , 2. history one major depressive episode family history major depression . Remission define period least three month subject take antidepressant agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 21item ) score nondepressed range ( le 8 ) , one clinically significant depressive symptom . Unaffected MDD Relative Sample : 40 healthy relative MDD probands ( age 1845 ) recruit . Subjects screened ensure history psychiatric illness . Unaffected BD Relative Sample : Healthy relative BD probands ( age 1845 ) recruit . Subjects screened ensure history psychiatric illness . Healthy Control Samples : Healthy subject ( age 1845 ) without know personal firstdegree family history psychiatric disorder firstdegree relative select . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any subject appear incapable provide informed consent exclude study . Subjects take effective antidepressant medication Subjects must take antidepressant medication likely alter monoamine neurochemistry cerebrovascular cardiovascular function least 3 month prior study . Subjects : 1. psychosis extent ability provide inform consent doubt 2. medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy , i.e . hypertension , cardiovascular disorder 3. history drug ( include benzodiazepine [ BZD ] ) alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) long 2 year 4. current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test screening day challenge study ) 5. current breast feeding 6. smoker 7. serious suicidal ideation behavior 8. general MRI exclusion criterion ( e.g. , subject metallic implant ferromagnetic exclude fMRI scanning ) . Subjects must exhibit moderate alcohol use . Subjects current excessive use alcohol ( great 4 ounces/day men great 3 ounces/day woman ) ineligible participation , drug use confound result 9. smoker ineligible evidence interaction nicotine depression , possibility withdrawal symptom may affect behavioral neural response CD 10. history suicidality axis I diagnose beside major depressive disorder 11. lactose intolerance 12. woman use reliable contraception method . Finally subject upper respiratory tract infection last week exclude may impact sense smell . Subjects beyond age 45 Individuals whose first major depressive episode arise medical psychiatric condition Subjects show significant side effect AMPT depletion dystonic reaction receive adequate treatment exclude study</criteria>
