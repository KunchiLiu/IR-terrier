	<brief_summary>This study examine usefulness imaging procedure call dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) localize characterize prostate cancer . For test , medicine inject vein MRI measure medicine flow prostate gland . The measurement provide information blood vessel prostate gland , provide information cancer . Several needle biopsy perform procedure , result biopsy compare information DCE-MRI . Men 18 year age older suspect confirmed prostate cancer may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , review tumor pathology . Participants undergo DCE-MRI needle biopsy prostate . The day morning procedure , patient give antibiotic call Levofloxacin . They also small enema morning test . A local anesthetic give area around prostate numb tissue decrease discomfort procedure . A tube place rectum obtain good picture prostate gland imaging . During scan , patient may ask breathe air contain high concentration oxygen carbon dioxide room air . The MRI scan guide physician select area prostate biopsy . For biopsy , needle place rectum prostate gland . When needle place , small tissue sample withdrawn . This procedure repeat 4 10 biopsy take . During procedure , last 1 hour , patient lie stomach stretcher . Patients plan undergo surgery radiation treatment cancer NCI may four 1-mm non-reactive gold marker place prostate DCE-MRI procedure . The marker leave place help target radiation treatment show biopsy take prostate remove . At end procedure , patient move bed recover may get urinate 30 60 minute . After period observation , patient discharge home dose antibiotic take next day . Some patient may ask repeat MRI biopsy procedure treatment prostate cancer help investigator learn whether MRI test still helpful treatment . Repeat test optional .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accurate spatial delineation biologic characterization tumor within prostate gland non-invasive mean , MR imaging , stand impact spectrum prostate cancer care . At present image technique accurately delineate tumor extent . With dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) , signal intensity plot time various region interest within prostate , reflect physiological parameter tissue perfusion , blood flow , vascular density vascular permeability . Preliminary study suggest malignant tumor demonstrate rapid intense uptake contrast , well rapid washout compare normal peripheral zone . However , histopathologic confirmation finding limit . This study strive establish correlation K ( trans ) calculate DCE-MRI data correspond tissue histopathology . This achieve acquire needle biopsy APT-MRI ( Access Prostate Tissue MRI-guidance ) system accurate spatial temporal reference DCE-MR image . The study accrue 80 patient 2-year period primary analysis relate K ( trans ) probability malignancy use Generalized Estimating Equations . Patients undergone TRUS-guided biopsy suspect prostate cancer patient pathological diagnosis prostate cancer potential candidate enrollment . Prior procedure , blood drawn urine collect measure PSA level protein profile . Patients undergo endorectal coil MR image prostate gland , include conventional anatomic image dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI . During MR imaging , 4 10 needle biopsy core prostate obtain use trans-rectal needle guide system ( APT-MRI ) . The ability obtain prostate biopsy core prostatic subzones sit interest document , overall procedure time acute toxicity associate procedure . Histopathology laboratory result needle core biopsy compare correspond DCE-MRI measurement , prior TRUS-biopsy result , and/or prostatectomy specimen . This procedure may repeat late time patient 's course observation , therapy , follow . This therapeutic trial . Patients admit protocol admit protocol experimental treatment also specifically meet eligibility criterion protocol . Patients may derive benefit MRI-guided biopsy , state protocol consent document .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients TRUSguided biopsy suspect prostate cancer past twelve month , patient pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate gland receive definitive local therapy . Age great equal 18 year . Informed consent : All patient must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Contraindication transrectal biopsy : Bleeding disorder ; PT/PTT great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ; Platelets le equal 50K ; Active anticoagulation ; Severe immunocompromise ; Severe hemorrhoid ; Surgically absent rectum . Contraindication MRI : Patients weigh great 136 kg ( weight limit scanner table ) ; Allergy MR contrast agent ; Patients pacemaker , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel injury implantable electronic device compatible MRI . Allergy local anesthetic quinolone antibiotic . Patients know diagnosis prostate cancer know treatment plan proceed prostatectomy result biopsy would affect surgical management . Other medical condition deem PI associate make patient ineligible protocol procedure .</criteria>
