	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well carboplatin etoposide without oblimersen sodium work treat patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Biological therapy , oblimersen sodium , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving carboplatin etoposide together oblimersen sodium may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Etoposide With Without Oblimersen Sodium Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess percentage patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat G3139 ( oblimersen sodium ) , carboplatin , etoposide live long 12 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate patient treat G3139 , carboplatin , etoposide . II . To assess toxicity combination G3139 , carboplatin , etoposide . III . To compare toxicity observe see cohort patient treat carboplatin etoposide alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oblimersen sodium intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-8 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 6 , etoposide IV 60 minute day 6-8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
