	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility treat patient stage IV melanoma D1/3-MAGE-3-His fusion protein SB-AS02B adjuvant . - Determine clinically confirm response rate ( partial complete response ) patient treat regimen . - Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate patient treat regimen . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine immune response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive D1/3-MAGE-3-His fusion protein emulsify SB-AS02B adjuvant intramuscularly every 3 week total 12 week ( 4 injection ) . In absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , patient receive second 12-week course begin week 16 . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-45 patient accrue study within 5-9 month .</detailed_description>
