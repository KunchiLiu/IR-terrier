	<brief_title>Study Systemic Spinal Chemotherapy Followed Radiation Infants With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All child study receive Regimen 1 chemotherapy . Children whose tumor limit one area beginning study go radiation therapy Regimen 2 chemotherapy . Children whose tumor find one part brain cerebrospinal fluid begin study discontinue treatment protocol Regimen 1 chemotherapy . Regimen 1 Chemotherapy - Those child normal CSF flow study begin study receive Regimen 1 chemotherapy along mafosfamide . Those child abnormal CSF flow study receive Regimen 1 without mafosfamide repeat CSF flow study perform completion first 10 week treatment . If CSF study reflect normal CSF flow , intrathecal mafosfamide give second 10 week Regimen 1 . Regimen 1 divide two course . Each course last 10 week , total 20 week treatment . During Regimen 1 patient receive three medication ( cyclophosphamide , vincristine , cisplatin ) give central venous line . The patient also receive one medication give mouth ( etoposide ) . Cyclophosphamide , vincristine , cisplatin , etoposide anticancer drug useful treatment brain tumor . The experimental drug , mafosfamide , inject spinal fluid . This give either spinal tap , Ommaya reservoir , . Alternating mafosfamide spinal tap Ommaya reservoir may improve well drug work make sure spread throughout spinal fluid . If patient VP VA shunt ( specialized device relieve pressure inside head come block normal flow spinal fluid ) , patient receive Ommaya reservoir , dose mafosfamide give spinal tap . The start dose mafosfamide dose safely give old child . If dose cause severe side effect , next group patient receive high dose mafosfamide . If severe side effect occur , next group patient receive low dose mafosfamide During end Regimen 1 , patient evaluate response brain tumor treatment . A second operation may necessary remove brain tumor . Children whose tumor spread time begin study complete treatment point . Children whose tumor spread start study begin radiation therapy , tumor appear unchanged shrink Regimen 1 . Radiation Therapy - The dose , location , time radiation depend age child diagnosis , location his/her tumor , response his/her tumor Regimen 1 chemotherapy . The radiation treatment use protocol design attempt reduce side effect usually occur standard radiation therapy . The child receive radiation use new technology call `` conformal radiation '' . Conformal radiation design reduce amount normal brain tissue expose high dos radiation . Regimen 2 Chemotherapy - After radiation therapy , patient receive additional chemotherapy , last 20 week . Regimen 2 chemotherapy Regimen 1 chemotherapy , except patient give drug cisplatin mafosfamide . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study perform total 2 dos intrathecal mafosfamide . PK study tell u patient 's body handle study drug , mafosfamide . Sampling time ( time collect cerebrospinal fluid PK study ) prior drug administration 10 minute , 2 hour , 4 hour follow drug administration . These study perform one dose drug give spinal tap one dose drug give Ommaya reservoir . The pharmacokinetic study optional choose allow sample draw . Refusing pharmacokinetic study affect patient 's participation/treatment study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion/ Age : &lt; 3 year . Histology : Patient must histologically confirm primary intracranial CNS medulloblastoma/PNET embryonal tumor ( medulloepithelioma , ependymoblastoma , neuroblastoma , pineoblastoma ) , atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor , intracranial germ cell tumor , choroid plexus carcinoma . Patients M+ ependymoma also eligible . Performance Status : Karnofsky Lansky &gt; = 30 % Bone Marrow Function : All patient must Hgb &gt; = 10 g/dl , ANC &gt; = 1,500/mm3 , platelet &gt; = 100,000/mm3 . If patient positive bone scan , pretreatment bone marrow aspirate biopsy must free tumor . Hepatic/Renal Function : All patient must adequate hepatic ( total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , SGPT &lt; 5x normal ) , renal ( normal serum creatinine age technetium clearance &gt; 40/ml/min/m2 ) function . Prior Therapy : Patients may receive prior radiotherapy chemotherapy , exception steroid . Patients must receive investigational agent . ( Patients may receive investigational agent supportive care 30 day completion mafosfamide therapy . ) Surgery : Patients must begin protocol therapy within 35 day definitive surgery . Central Line : Patients must willing central line . CSF flow : Patients must willing CSF flow study determine whether receive intrathecal chemotherapy . Patients without VP VA shunt must willing Ommaya reservoir CSF flow study show evidence obstruction compartmentalization flow . Patients obstruction compartmentalization CSF flow initial flow study must willing repeat flow perform within initial 10 week induction therapy , ideally week 810 . If repeat flow study show resolution obstruction compartmentalization , patient expect begin intrathecal mafosfamide Regimen 1 course 2 therapy . Patients without VP VA shunt resolution normal flow additionally Ommaya reservoir place .</criteria>
