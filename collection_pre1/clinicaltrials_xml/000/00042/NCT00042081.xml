	<brief_title>Prevention Autogenous Vein Graft Failure Coronary Artery Bypass Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary vascular disease manifest narrowing coronary artery one common manifestation atherosclerotic vascular disease . The clinical manifestation coronary artery disease include death , angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure arrhythmia . Restoration circulation heart may undertake use variety technique include angioplasty , stenting , bypass grafting . Approximately 359,000 patient underwent coronary bypass procedure U.S. 1999 . Long term study observe incidence vein graft occlusion 19 % 1 year , 25 % 5 year 50 % 15 year operation overall rate 2.5 % per year first year observation . The consequence graft failure significant primary atherosclerotic disease include ischemia , myocardial infarction death . CGT003 novel therapeutic investigation treatment prevent vein graft failure . It act inhibit transcription factor , E2F , activate response injury occur thin-walled vein graft expose pressure arterial circulation . Blockade E2F inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation redirect vein graft remodeling occurs within first several day implantation towards medial hypertrophy strengthen medial layer blunts formation neointima . Inhibition neotinimal formation couple expansion medium result decrease risk accelerate atherosclerosis consequent vein graft failure several year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENTS MUST : Have coronary artery disease schedule undergo coronary artery bypass ( CABG ) procedure include least two segment autogenous vein ( sequential graft count two separate graft ) . Be 18 80 year old . Have document negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Be use acceptable method birth control reproductive potential . Have agree participate voluntarily sign date IRBapproved , Patient Informed Consent form . ( If one first 2400 patient enrol ) agree participate voluntarily sign date IRBapproved , Patient Informed Consent form Angiography population . Note : Patients receive arterial bypass leave anterior descend artery addition two vein graft require protocol ARE eligible study . Note : Patients ARE eligible enrollment regardless whether plan procedure cardiopulmonary bypass pump . Note : Patients wish undergo elective Angiography one year SHOULD NOT enrol first 2400 patient .</criteria>
