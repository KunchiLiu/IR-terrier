	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common disable condition expand elderly population US worldwide . Its etiology remain unknown genetic environmental factor suspect . The long-term goal propose study clarify etiology PD identify mean prevent . Specifically , study association PD susceptibility gene previously find associate novelty seek behavior , substance use ( tobacco , alcohol , caffeine ) , anxiety depressive disorder . The hypothesis test derive directly current work preliminary finding . We employ case-unaffected sibling control study design analyse use generalization sibling transmission dysequilibrium test , `` S-TDT '' . In total , nine candidate susceptibility gene consider , five undergone limit study PD . The candidate susceptibility gene include three detoxification gene , three dopaminergic gene , three serotonergic gene . We include 800 case PD refer Mayo Clinic 120-mile radius 5-state region approximately 10-year period . We also include eligible sibling age 40 year , project blood DNA sample available 563 affected probands sibling 1,180 unaffected sibling stratify 521 informative sibships . Sibships multiple affect unaffected sibling include . PD case undergo clinical assessment blood sampling , provide family information face-to-face interview follow write mail-in form . All living sibling age 40 screen PD use validate telephone instrument . Subjects screen negative PD provide DNA mail-in blood sample kit . Persons screen positive clinically assessed Mayo Clinic home , blood DNA sample directly obtain . Genotyping perform use polymerase chain reaction method blind affected unaffected status . The study avoid population stratification bias use sibling control . The candidate susceptibility gene select primary analysis relate personality trait , substance use , psychiatric disease find associate PD . The selection gene represent major paradigm shift . We also establish large DNA bank rapid efficient test new genetic hypothesis PD . This application submit response RFA ES-00-002 ( `` The Role Environment Parkinson 's Disease '' ) . We specifically address RFA 's objective evaluate endogenous ( include biomarkers ) exogenous ( include dietary lifestyle ) susceptibility factor PD use molecular epidemiology tool .</detailed_description>
