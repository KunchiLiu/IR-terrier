	<brief_summary>This study investigate cause acute chronic rejection transplant heart . To find good way detect , treat possibly prevent heart transplant rejection , information cause need . Acute chronic heart transplant rejection may cause certain substance body produce response new heart . This study try find blood urine test detects gene protein serve marker rejection . Such test may lead early detection improve treatment . Patients 18 year wait list heart transplant UNOS-approved heart transplant center , whose institutional review board approve protocol , may eligible study . Healthy volunteer also include study establish database normal value comparison patient undergoing heart transplant . In addition , patient heart transplant within past 1 5 year enrol pilot study . Normal volunteer screen participation electrocardiogram ( EKG ) echocardiogram , non-invasive test evaluate heart function . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Review medical record Patients heart transplant wait list receive heart medical record review collect information condition . - Blood sample 60 cc ( 3 tablespoon ) blood collect participant needle stick vein . The sample analyze gene protein might predict heart rejection . In addition , many gene blood cell cell line blood vessel unrelated heart transplant rejection whose function significance unknown also examine ideas future research . Patients enrol wait list , transplantation , additional 44 cc ( 2 tablespoon ) blood collect heart biopsy rejection episode first year transplant , 60 cc collect yearly biopsy next 9 year . - Urine sample Between 100 300 cc ( 3 10 ounce ) urine may collect participant confirm blood test result</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac transplantation successful improve survival end stage heart failure . But graft rejection limit survival transplantation . In first year , acute cellular rejection infection remain common cause morbidity mortality . Afterwards , cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) , result chronic vascular rejection , major cause morbidity mortality . Within first year post-transplantation , almost two-thirds recipient experience least one rejection episode . At five year post-transplantation , nearly 50 % survivor CAV . Clinically , symptom acute rejection relatively nonspecific ( fatigue , dyspnea , fever ) . Most CAV patient remain asymptomatic develop serious problem myocardial infarction , heart failure , ventricular dysrhythmias sudden cardiac death . Presently , gold standard diagnose acute cardiac allograft rejection right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy . This invasive method diagnosis subject morbidity random sample interpretation error . Likewise , gold standard diagnose CAV cardiac catheterization intravascular ultrasound , invasive procedure also subject morbidity . Noninvasive method electrocardiography , echocardiography , nuclear study study , unsuccessful , thus far , either condition . Peripheral blood evaluation cytokines cytoimmunologic marker also unsuccessful either condition . This clinical trial study feasibility use functional genomics proteomics identify gene protein respectively serve reliable biomarkers acute cardiac cellular rejection CAV . We plan recruit subject transplant wait list . We analyze blood patient pre-transplant serially post-transplant one year regularly yearly basis . By correlate putative biomarkers clinical , histological , image base evidence allograft disease hope build database comprise functional genomics , cytokine , cytoimmunologic proteomics data relevant immunologic relationship donor organ recipient . With database hope obtain minimal subset differentially express gene , cytokine , cytoimmunologic protein change profile predictive acute allograft rejection CAV . This eventually serve basis diagnostic blood test . Thus , application functional genomics , cytokine , cytoimmunologic analysis proteomics hope derive noninvasive method detect acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection CAV , thereby minimize need invasive method diagnosis . Further well understanding genetic program trigger protein change induce rejection may lead identification target pathway develop new therapeutic approach aim prevention . Recently , several publish report establish detection donor DNA recipient blood serve diagnostic tool graft injury . The level donor DNA measure percentage circulate cell-free donor DNA ( % ccfdDNA ) accurately diagnose acute rejection high sensitivity specificity , time several month diagnosis examine endomyocardial biopsy . The ability cell free DNA diagnose graft injury early open new window re-examine marker rejection . These marker traditionally evaluate use biopsy result , often positive late rejection . % ccfdDNA offer opportunity well characterize analysis .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Transplant Patients : 1 . Adult heart transplant center generally accept patient within physiologic age range 12 65 year old , however , study heart transplant patient must 18 year age . 2 . Indication cardiac transplantation outline 24th Bethesda Conference Cardiac Transplantation . These follow : Peak VO ( 2 ) less 10 ml/kg per minute le 50 % maximal predict VO ( 2 ) achievement anaerobic metabolism . Severe cardiac ischemia consistently limit routine activity amenable surgical percutaneous revascularization . Recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia refractory accept therapeutic modality . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Transplant Patients : Adult heart transplant center exclude infant , toddler , child physiologic age less 12 , adult advance physiologic age ( le 65 ) , however , study exclude heart transplant patient less 18 year age . The final decision exclude candidate cardiac transplantation make hospital 's heart transplant committee . The committee use , guideline , criterion outline 24th Bethesda conference . INCLUSION CRITERIA Control Subjects : Any healthy normal man woman appropriate age gender match transplant patient . EXCLUSION CRITERIA For Control Subjects : 1 . EKG evidence clinically relevant heart disease . 2 . Echocardiogram evidence clinically relevant heart disease . 3 . Any disease process well control medication . 4 . Total tobacco use great one month last 5 year . 5 . Symptoms coronary cardiac insufficiency . 6 . More one major risk factor coronary artery disease exclude gender age . 7 . Confirmed intrauterine pregnancy woman .</criteria>
