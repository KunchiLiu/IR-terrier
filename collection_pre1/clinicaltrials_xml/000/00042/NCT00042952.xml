	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Progressive , Refractory , Recurrent Stage II Stage III Testicular Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine activity imatinib mesylate patient progressive , refractory , recurrent pure testicular seminoma ovarian germ cell dysgerminoma cisplatin-based chemotherapy . II . Determine toxicity drug patient population . III . Determine KIT expression identify mutation c-kit gene patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial response stable disease normalization human chorionic gonadotropin may undergo surgical resection residual lesion tumor status assessment . If residual viable germ cell tumor present resect specimen , patient may resume imatinib mesylate . If viable germ cell tumor present resect specimen , therapy administer . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue study within 32-38 month .</detailed_description>
