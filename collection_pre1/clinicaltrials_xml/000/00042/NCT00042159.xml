	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Treatment Patients With Persistent Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Auditory hallucination cause distress , functional disability , problem control behavior . In addition , auditory hallucination often resistant drug treatment . Brain imaging study suggest voice arise part brain ordinarily involve perceive speak speech . In TMS , electromagnet place scalp produce magnetic pulse pass skull stimulate underlying cerebral cortex ( part brain ) . Low frequency ( per second ) TMS know reduce reactivity excitability part brain directly stimulate without damage brain tissue . This study determine low frequency rTMS direct brain area responsible speech processing use alternative treatment auditory hallucination relate psychotic symptom . Before start rTMS , patient undergo : ( 1 ) medical psychiatric evaluation , ( 2 ) neuropsychological test assess concentration memory ability , ( 3 ) fMRI brain scan ( take 1 Â¼ hour require injection ) . After evaluation complete , patient randomly assign ( e.g. , flip coin ) receive either low frequency rTMS placebo stimulation 16 minute per day 10-day period . During time , patient know whether ( ) receive real placebo stimulation . For 5 day , stimulation administer area leave temporal lobe brain involved perceiving speech . This area call Wernicke 's area . For another 5-day period , similar area right side brain stimulate . After 10-day trial complete , patient told ( ) receive real placebo TMS . If patient receive real TMS experience significant improvement `` voice '' , ( ) choose receive stimulation part brain produce great improvement . If patient receive placebo stimulation , ( ) offer trial real rTMS . TMS generally painful , uncomfortable due tingle knock sensation and/or contraction scalp facial muscle . There small risk seizure associate TMS , frequency stimulation use study ( 1 stimulation per second ) , risk significant patient prior history seizure , epilepsy , neurological problem . We give TMS 90 person schizophrenia auditory hallucination case seizure . We also concern TMS may cause memory concentration problem . Therefore , carefully monitor patient early sign difficulty , use daily questionnaire assessment weekly neuropsychological test . If suspect patient experience problem memory concentration , trial stop . A small percentage patient previous study ( less 5 % ) report problem memory end soon trial stop .</detailed_description>
