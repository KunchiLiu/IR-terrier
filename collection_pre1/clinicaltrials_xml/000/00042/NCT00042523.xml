	<brief_summary>This study examine possible relationship certain antibody find patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) cognitive ( thought processing ) impairment patient . Antibodies proteins produced cell immune system fight foreign invader bacteria virus . In autoimmune disease like SLE , however , immune system produce antibodies body 's healthy tissue . Antibodies target brain may cause cognitive dysfunction . Many patient SLE mild severe cognitive impairment involve , example , short- long-term memory , think process relate object time space . Patients 18 year age old SLE may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination , include blood urine test - Psychiatric interview questionnaire ass depression - Neuropsychological test - answer question give examiner fill test form questionnaire - Tests cognitive function - answer question give automated computer program performing task use computer mouse - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain - test use strong magnetic field radio wave generate image brain . The patient lie still stretcher inside cylinder contain magnetic field . The patient 's head stabilize plastic strap foam pad . During imaging , substance call gadolinium-DTPA injected arm vein catheter ( thin plastic tube ) . This substance use enhance image . Patients may also ask undergo optional procedure call lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) examine relationship cognitive impairment amount antibody cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) - fluid circulate around brain spinal cord . For procedure small area skin lower back numbed local anesthetic . A needle inserted space bone low back , 2 tablespoon CSF withdrawn needle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Antibodies Cognitive Dysfunction Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive dysfunction common patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , observe many two-thirds patient . Cognitive dysfunction long duration deterioration significant impact occupational functioning SLE patient also compromise compliance treatment . The pathogenesis cognitive dysfunction SLE patient likely multifactorial , include vascular origin , direct neuronal damage due autoantibody cytokine , metabolic effect , effect certain medication . More one half SLE patient anti-DNA antibody , recently demonstrate subset anti-DNA antibody cross-reacts pentapeptide consensus sequence ( residues 283-287 ) human N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor NR2a NR2b subunits cause excitotoxic death neuron . NMDA receptor important memory function learning , thus antibody may mediate cognitive dysfunction SLE . In cross-sectional study , 60 patient SLE may enrol . Participants undergo neuropsychological testing , neuroimaging study , blood test antibody reactivity pentapeptide consensus sequence human NMDA receptor NR2a NR2b subunit ( anti-pentapeptide Ab ) . The primary objective study evaluate association cognitive dysfunction serum anti-pentapeptide Ab . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform evaluation potentially confounding central nervous system ( CNS ) disease cerebral infarction , blood brain barrier breakdown employ gadolinium enhancement . Furthermore , participant agree , lumbar puncture perform cerebrospinal fluid obtain preliminary evaluation intrathecal level anti-pentapeptide Ab associate cognitive dysfunction . If anti-pentapeptide Ab associate cognitive dysfunction , therapeutic intervention via NR2 receptor blockade blockade anti-pentapeptide Ab may consider future study .</detailed_description>
