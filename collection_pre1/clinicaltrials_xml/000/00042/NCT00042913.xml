	<brief_title>Epratuzumab Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat epratuzumab . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV 1 hour weekly 4 week . - Arm II : Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV 1 hour weekly 8 week . - Arm III : Patients receive high-dose epratuzumab IV 1 hour weekly 4 week . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient ( 50 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
