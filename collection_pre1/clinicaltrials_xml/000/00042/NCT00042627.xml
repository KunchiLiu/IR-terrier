	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether people donate granulocyte ( type white blood cell ) leukapheresis increase risk develop cataract ( change lens eye impair vision ) . Apheresis method collect large number white blood cell . The procedure similar donate whole blood , collect blood circulate cell separator machine , white cell extract , rest blood return donor . Before procedure , donor give steroid call dexamethasone . This drug temporarily increase number granulocyte circulate blood , thus allow twice many cell collect . Recently , one blood collection center report great number cataract small number granulocyte donor receive repeated dos steroid granulocyte mobilization . The donor unaware cataract , small affect vision . Although people take high dos steroid long period time know increase risk cataract , steroid give infrequently ( dos use granulocyte donation ) associate cataract . This study examine eye granulocyte donor platelet donor . Platelets-blood component necessary clotting-are also collect pheresis , donor give steroid procedure . The examination finding compare see difference risk cataract formation two group . People 18 year age older donate granulocyte platelet NIH Department Transfusion Medicine four time since 1984 may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Detailed medical history , include allergy , corticosteroid use , diabetes mellitus , asthma - Detailed eye history , include cataract , glaucoma , eye disease infection , eye trauma , corrective lens - Detailed history sun exposure - Eye examination , include measurement visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examination lens retina . - Photographs eye use special camera</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Risk Cataracts Granulocyte Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase prevalence cataract recently describe small number granulocyte donor receive repeated dos adrenal corticosteroid part mobilization regimen granulocyte donation . Mild posterior subcapsular cataract ( PSCs ) find 4 11 ( 36 % ) granulocyte donor versus 0 9 platelet donor . Though relationship corticosteroid administration development PSCs well establish , steroid recipient develop lesion . Observational study suggest development PSCs associate risk steroid give prolonged period time ( great 10 mg/day 1-2 year ) . To maximize cellular yield granulocytapheresis procedure , granulocyte donor give single dose adrenal steroid day prior donation . Since 1984 , standard practice NIH Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) administer dexamethasone 8 mg orally 12 hour prior donation . Since 1996 dexamethasone 8 mg orally well granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor ( G-CSF ) 5 microg/kg subcutaneously administer day prior donation maximize cell yield apheresis . It also standard procedure DTM restrict granulocyte donation per month ( 12 times/year ) , medical exception . To determine prevalence ophthalmologic abnormality , particularly PSCs , DTM granulocyte donor , propose perform medical history comprehensive blind ophthalmologic examination consent granulocyte donor . Age gender-matched volunteer plateletpheresis donor invite control . If increase incidence PSCs lens eye abnormality find granulocyte donor compare plateletpheresis donor , attempt correlate factor operate granulocyte donation relate increase risk .</detailed_description>
