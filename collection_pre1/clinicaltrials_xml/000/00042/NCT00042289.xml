	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) antiretroviral ( ARV ) tuberculosis ( TB ) medication pregnant woman infant . ( Pharmacokinetics various interaction drug body . ) This study also evaluate PKs certain ARVs postpartum woman start hormonal contraceptive . The PKs drug evaluate measure amount medicine present blood and/or vaginal secretion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman experience unique physiological change may result clinically significant alteration drug PKs . Unfortunately , clinical trial study PKs ARV , TB , hormonal contraceptive drug pregnant woman . The development appropriate dosing regimens HIV-infected pregnant woman critical health mother fetus . Overdosing may lead maternal adverse event increase risk fetal toxicity , underdosing may lead inadequate virologic control , increase risk develop drug resistance mutation , high rate perinatal HIV transmission . This study evaluate PKs ARVs use pregnancy ; evaluate TB drug use pregnancy , woman HIV-positive also take ARVs woman HIV-negative take ARVs ; evaluate PKs hormonal contraceptive medication take along ARVs . There five main group study arm : HIV-infected pregnant woman take ARVs without TB treatment , HIV-infected pregnant woman take ARVs first-line TB treatment , HIV-uninfected pregnant woman take ARVs first-line TB treatment , HIV-infected HIV-uninfected pregnant woman without ARVs second-line TB treatment drug-resistant TB , HIV-infected postpartum woman take ARVs hormonal contraceptive . Participants receive medication studyâ€”they continue ARV , TB , and/or contraceptive medication prescribe health care provider . Women 20 0/7 week 37 6/7 week pregnant enrol study remain study 12 week delivery . Postpartum woman enrol 2 12 week delivery follow 6 7 week start contraceptive . Infants follow 16 24 week life . At study visit , participant undergo medical history , physical exam , blood collection . At visit , woman arm undergo vaginal swab . Blood collection mother detach umbilical cord occur delivery . Intensive PK sampling perform study visit second third trimester pregnancy and/or postpartum , depend study arm . Additional study visit may occur depend ARV drug regimen prescribe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Maternal Participant must belong one follow 5 group : 1 . HIVinfected pregnant woman great equal 20 week gestation NOT TB treatment receive one ARV drugs/drug combination specify protocol 2 . HIVinfected pregnant woman great equal 20 week gestation receive one ARV drugs/drug combination specify protocol TB treatment least one TB drug , specify protocol , study entry 3 . HIVuninfected pregnant woman great equal 20 week gestation receive least two firstline TB drug , specify protocol , study entry 4 . HIVinfected HIVuninfected pregnant woman great equal 20 week gestation receive least two secondline TB drug , specify protocol , study entry 5 . HIVinfected woman 2 12 week ( 14 84 day ) postdelivery receive one ARV drug combination list protocol AND start postpartum contraceptive list protocol The woman must stable ARV drug/drug combination and/or TB drug combination least 2 week prior PK sample If woman receive specific generic ARV formulation , protocol team approve formulation HIVinfected pregnant woman must plan continue current ARV regimen postpartum PK sampling complete . HIVinfected postpartum woman hormonal contraceptive must plan continue ARV contraceptive regimen final PK sampling complete . For HIVinfected woman : confirm HIV infection , document positive result two sample collect different time point prior study entry . More information criterion find protocol . HIVuninfected pregnant woman must document negative HIV antibody test current pregnancy . Note : adequate source documentation , include date specimen collection , date testing , test perform , test result , must available . Participants enrol 3rd trimester must enroll 37 6/7 week gestation Participant provide legal informed consent per local regulation If woman complete study becomes pregnant , may reenroll study enrol different arm study initial enrollment Maternal Women medicine know interfere absorption , metabolism , clearance drug evaluate ( see protocol information ) . Rifampicin permit woman evaluate TB ARV drug interaction . If pregnant , carry multiple fetus Clinical laboratory toxicity , opinion site investigator , would likely require change medicine regimen period study Infant Enrollment Criteria : All infant mother enrol pregnancy ( meet criterion specify ) enrol , utero , immediately maternal enrollment . Infant Requirements Washout Pharmacokinetic Sampling : Born HIVinfected mother enrol pregnancy ARV arm ( include infant bear HIVuninfected mother receive TB drug ) Birth weight great 1000 gram Is NOT receive disallow medication describe Section 7 protocol Does severe congenital malformation medical condition compatible life would interfere study participation interpretation , judge site investigator Born singleton delivery ( multiple birth )</criteria>
