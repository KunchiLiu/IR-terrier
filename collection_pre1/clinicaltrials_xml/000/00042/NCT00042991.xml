	<brief_title>Gefitinib Radiation Therapy Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define safety gefitinib administer conjunction irradiation child newly diagnose non-disseminated diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma newly diagnose incompletely resect supratentorial malignant glioma ( STMG ) receive enzyme induce anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) . II . To define safety gefitinib child newly diagnose , incompletely resect STMG receive EIACDs . III . To assess safety efficacy gefitinib give radiation therapy child newly diagnose brainstem glioma measure progression-free survival estimate survival distribution . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare hemodynamic magnetic resonance ( MR ) parameters metabolic fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan correlate clinical response progression population . II . To characterize expression ErbB1 receptor tissue STMG patient use immunohistochemistry western blot assay . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics gefitinib patient group determine effect EIACD pharmacokinetics . IV . To explore pharmacogenetic polymorphism gefitinib ( e.g. , CYP3A4/5 BCRP ) relate gefitinib pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ( phenotype-genotype ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gefitinib ( Phase I close accrual effective 10/27/2003 ) . Patients stratify accord follow : Stratum 1A : Intrinsic brain stem glioma ; receive concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) Stratum 1B : Incompletely resect supratentorial malignant glioma ( STMG ) ; receive concurrent EIACDs Stratum 2 : Incompletely resect STMG ; receive concurrent EIACDs . Phase I portion ( patient strata 1A , 1B , 2 ) ( phase I close accrual effective 10/27/2003 ) : Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Treatment repeat every 4 week 13 course ( 1 year ) . Patients also receive standard brain irradiation daily , 5 day week , 6 week begin concurrently initiation first course gefitinib . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos gefitinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II portion ( patient stratum 1A ) : Once MTD recommend Phase-II dose determine , additional patient newly diagnose brain stem glioma ( BSG ) treat MTD recommend Phase-II dose . Patients follow three month last protocol treatment enrol strictly phase I component . Patients contribute phase II portion follow early date death three year initiation protocol therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Considering seven dose level investigate three stratum , dose level accrue six patient , total 126 patient ( 42 stratum ) may accrue study within 2 year . ( Phase I close accrual effective 10/27/2003 ) . A total 40 patient include patient treat maximum tolerate dose recommended Phase-II dose Phase I accrue phase II study within 10 month .</detailed_description>
