	<brief_summary>Objective : The objective protocol : develop maintain repository clinically characterize patient primary lateral sclerosis future research protocol , characterize natural history neurodegenerative disorder corticospinal neuron degeneration , investigate propose etiology , risk factor , biomarkers development disorder disease progression Study Population : 240 patient adult-onset progressive spasticity diagnosis primary lateral sclerosis relate upper motor neuron disorder Design : Patients refer physician primary lateral sclerosis undergo screen evaluation first visit . The screening visit include review outside medical record , neurological examination , diagnostic test determine possible cause spasticity . Patients fulfil clinical criterion primary lateral sclerosis history examination follow determine natural history disorder . Measures motor cognitive function make baseline follow-up visit follow clinical progression . Magnetic resonance imaging carry determine imaging change occur time . Patients identify protocol eligible research protocol invite participate additional protocol . Outcome Measures : Clinical progression document measure finger-tapping , timed gait , speech . The association clinical progression MRI measure assess secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
