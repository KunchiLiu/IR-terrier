	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa Plus Thalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy interferon alfa thalidomide , term response rate , time progression , overall survival , patient relapse refractory low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect regimen patient population . III . Correlate ancillary biological study clinical endpoint patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously every 12 hour oral thalidomide daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month disease progression .</detailed_description>
