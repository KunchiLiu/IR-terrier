	<brief_summary>This study investigate compare air stream voice production patient abductor spasmodic dysphonia normal volunteer . People abductor spasmodic dysphonia uncontrolled muscle spasm speech , result weak voice . A good understanding abnormality disorder may help development effective treatment . Healthy volunteer patient abductor spasmodic dysphonia may eligible study . Candidates physical examination medical history . ( Patients videotape voice-recorded medical interview review specialist identify type severity speech disorder . ) All candidate also undergo procedure call flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy record movement vocal fold speech , breathe task sing , whistle prolong vowel . For test , inside nose spray anesthetic ( lidocaine ) numb nasal cavity decongestant ( oxymetazoline ) widen nasal passage . Then , thin flexible tube call nasolaryngoscope pass nose larynx ( voice box ) . A camera attach eyepiece nasolaryngoscope record movement vocal fold . Participants airway interruption test detect pressure change voice box production continuous sound . A nose clip place subject 's nose two sensor device place neck pick change movement position vocal cord voice . A mouthpiece place mouth , subject ask say `` ah '' continuously specify sound level . This voicing repeat 33 time periodic break . Patients also give injection botulinum toxin . These injection effective , vary degree , 60 percent patient abductor spasmodic dysphonia . This study use different approach botulinum toxin injection test effect patient pressure high normal . Rather inject posterior cricoarytenoid muscle cricothyroid muscle , typically do , thyroarytenoid muscle , close voice box , inject one side . A second one-sided injection may give 2 3 week effect see first injection . Speech record visit measure change symptom injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persons abductor spasmodic dysphonia ( ABSD ) difficulties phonation onset voiceless consonant result breathy break . Previously , ABSD think involve heighten activity laryngeal abductor muscle , posterior cricoarytenoid . Botulinum toxin injection posterior cricoarytenoid muscle disorder , however , provide partial benefit 50 % person ABSD . An electromyographic study laryngeal muscle ABSD find asymmetry adductor muscle ( thyroarytenoid muscle ) ABSD . Thyroarytenoid ( TA ) activation level differ two side person ABSD . An electromyographic study laryngeal muscle ABSD find asymmetry adductor muscle ( thyroarytenoid muscle ) ABSD . Thyroarytenoid ( TA ) activation level differ two side person ABSD comparison control ; right TA show great activity leave . This suggest ABSD might involve increase tone one side larynx , treatment address asymmetry muscle tone . We hypothesize TA muscle activity great one side ABSD , A ) phonation threshold pressure great normal person ABSD , B ) treatment botulinum toxin phonation threshold pressure great normal show symptom reduction follow injection TA muscle one side . Both normal volunteer person ABSD study . Phonation Threshold Pressure ( PTP ) measure use brief interruption supraglottal airflow valve phonation tube . The electroglottographic signal use determine vocal fold vibration cease valve close . The PTP measure difference estimate subglottal pressure achieve phonation offset follow valve closure , minimum subglottal vocal tract pressure point vocal fold vibration cease follow interruption airflow . Persons ABSD high phonation threshold pressure normal receive injection botulinum toxin injection thyroarytenoid muscle one side base movement asymmetry observe fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy . Blinded measure symptom frequency make treatment determine symptom improve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Criteria inclusion patient ABSD : General Criteria : 1 . Symptoms present speech apparent rest . 2 . Symptoms le evident whisper , sing falsetto . 3 . Symptoms become bad prolonged speaking , practice anxiety . 4 . Reflexive emotional aspect voice function unaffected , cough , laughter cry . 5 . No surgical treatment ABSD injection botulinum toxin last 9 month . 6 . Willing undergo botulinum toxin injection thyroarytenoid muscle . Diagnostic Characteristics : 1 . Prolonged vocal fold open voiceless consonant excessive breathiness , individual experience difficulty close vocal fold produce vowel follow voiceless consonant ( p , , k , , f , h , th ) . Sounds `` '' , `` h '' , `` k '' come open vowel `` ah '' `` uh '' `` home '' , `` coffee '' , puppy '' usually affect . 2 . Normal vocal fold movement control nonspeech task cough , throat clearance Valsalva maneuver fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy . Criteria inclusion normal volunteer : 1 . Persons without pulmonary , neurological , otolaryngological , psychiatric speech , voice hearing problem determine medical history examination physician . 2 . Persons without respiratory difficulty asthma , bronchitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 3 . No smoker tobacco user . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ABSD Normal Volunteers The Following individual exclude fro participation study : 1 . Any person history respiratory difficulty asthma , bronchitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 2 . Any person abnormality larynx benign laryngeal disease , laryngeal carcinoma , laryngeal congenital anomaly . 3 . Any person reduction vocal fold movement range nonspeech task , whistling , would suggest either vocal fold paralysis cricoarytenoid joint fixation neoplasm . 4 . Any person functional voice disorder whisper aphonia complete aphonia , muscular tension dysphonia . 5 . Any person report period symptom remission atypical spasmodic dysphonia . 6 . Any person oropharyngeal abnormality velopharyngeal insufficiency , neuromuscular disorder . 7 . Smokers tobacco user . 8 . Any person currently treatment major depression manicdepressive illness , schizophrenia bipolar disorder . However , history previous episode minor reactive depression would exclude person participation .</criteria>
