	<detailed_description>The persistent intractable cause infant child mortality morbidity US remain preterm low birthweight delivery . Pregnant woman US experience high incidence complication among developed country . Despite many effort increase prenatal care , rate preterm delivery substantially change last decade . Even disturb observation immigrant Hispanic woman experience worsen birth outcomes longer live US , despite increase access prenatal care , improve socio-economic status good education . ( Within five year move US , odds ratio preterm low birth weight delivery increase 1.9 , 4 % 7 % . ) As migrant woman become acculturated US , must expose factor adversely affect pregnancy outcome . But known risk factor , poverty , lack education , smoking , substance abuse , inadequate pregnancy weight gain , low pre-pregnancy weight , high altitude , chronic disease , primipara , high parity , explain small percentage change incidence . The prospective study enroll cohort approximately 1500 pregnant Hispanic woman attend prenatal care service OB/GYN group San Joaquin General Hospital Stockton , CA . The majority Hispanic woman ( 67 % ) receiving prenatal care group Mexican immigrants vary length US residency , 26 % involve farm labor and/or type manual labor . Eighteen percent US-born Mexican woman . A study unique population Hispanic woman vary lengths US residency , factor relate occupational risk , acculturation preterm low birth weight delivery , provide excellent opportunity examine factor acculturation-based cause preterm low birthweight ( PTLBW ) . The investigator hypothesize job stress occupational exposure relate farm work best explain worsen pregnancy outcome among Hispanic woman . However , order ensure understanding mechanism increase rate preterm low birthweight within population , study also examine risk factor could possibly associate acculturation preterm low birthweight . Such factor include change nutrition intake , certain type genital infection Bacterial Vaginosis , Gonorrhea Chlamydia . The knowledge emerge direct application design improved program prevention preterm low birthweight delivery among Hispanic woman . Just important , provide insight underlie cause scandalously high rate throughout US population .</detailed_description>
