	<brief_title>Resperine , Gabapentin , Lamotrigine Treatment Cocaine Dependence : 2 - 7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable progress preclinical research provide basis hypothesis driven clinical trial cocaine dependence . A great mechanistic understanding cocaine many clinically approved medication lead identification many promising medication treatment cocaine dependence . For reason NIDA develop CREST ( Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial ) protocol provide need incremental medication screen step preclinical research full blow expensive Phase III pivotal trial . While patient receive manual base psychotherapy , three medication screen compare unmatched placebo eight-week , 60-subject , four cell design trial . Other important feature CREST protocol include collect baseline measurement two week period analyze primary outcome measure ( quantitative urine toxicology clinical global improvement scale ) term composite score overall individual patient improvement . The three medication evaluate trial include reserpine , gabapentin lamotrigine . Reserpine screen well-known preclinical ability functionally antagonize cocaine ( deplete neurochemical elevate cocaine ) . Gabapentin lamotrigine hypothesize interfere glutamatergic cocaine sensitization/kindling mechanism relevant addiction .</detailed_description>
