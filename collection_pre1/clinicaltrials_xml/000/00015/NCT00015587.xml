	<brief_summary>This study case-control study investigate cause childhood leukemia Northern California . The overall purpose epidemiologic study find specific genetic environmental factor may increase risk leukemia child . The study conduct Patricia Buffler , PhD School Public Health - University California Berkeley collaboration California Department Health Services 16 hospital locate throughout state California .

	<detailed_description>This study case-control study incident childhood leukemia ( subtypes ) diagnose since mid-1995 . Children newly diagnose leukemia enrol study . Criteria inclusion study : 15 year age , prior cancer diagnosis , residency state California time diagnosis , availability English Spanish speak parent guardian . Pre-treatment biological specimen , include bone marrow peripheral blood , obtain analysis UCB lab Dr M. Smith . The lab use Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) detect chromosome specific aneuploidy translocation . A number chromosomal translocation , include ( 9 ; 22 ) ( 8 ; 21 ) , know centrally involved development childhood leukemia . Molecular characterization case translocation may provide insight time critical exposure nature etiological agent involve . One comparison subject ( control ) recruit consent case . For case , four potential control randomly select California birth certificate file match date birth , gender , mother 's race , parental Hispanicity , county residence . One four birth certificate control randomly select recruit participate study . An in-depth personal interview ask variety question , include : residential history ; occupational household exposure history ; mother ' reproductive history ; event index pregnancy delivery ; family history illness ; child 's health vaccination history , contact child ; maternal child exposure cigarette smoke pregnancy since birth ; maternal child history x-rays . Saliva specimen obtain case control biological mother . The saliva sample send study office process Genetic Epidemiology lab UC Berkeley . DNA case control analyzed polymerase chain reaction genetic polymorphism . Genetic polymorphism examine two glutathione transferase gene , M1 Tl . Case sample peripheral blood , bone marrow , archive newborn blood also use detect N-ras mutation . Three tier exposure assessment implement . Tier 1 enrolls interviews case control seek identify risk factor , include residential occupational chemical exposure . In Tier 2 , case birth certificate control change residence base specific criterion part reliability study , seek determine self-reported chemical use time interview find home visual survey several month interview . Tier 3 aim document potential household exposure sample dust floor surface . The objective identify difference concentration pesticide , metal , polyaromatic hydrocarbon , cotinine , polychorinated biphenyls , ethylenethiourea home case control . Further , case-case analysis identify case chromosomal translocation interest live home high concentration target compound case translocation . These analysis determine whether leukemic child common genetic change experience common exposures whether genetic change approximately temporal occurrence . Finally , evaluate whether child without leukemia differ respect susceptibility .</detailed_description>
