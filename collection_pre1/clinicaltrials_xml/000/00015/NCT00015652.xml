	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness new treatment hepatitis C ( HCV ) patient also HIV . The usual treatment HCV people HIV-infected interferon-alfa ( IFN ) ribavirin ( RBV ) , approve treatment Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This study use new , longer act form IFN call PEG-IFN alfa-2b . PEG-IFN alfa-2b approve FDA use treat HCV yet approve use RBV . This study also use IL-2 , substance body naturally produce . People HIV infection usually make enough IL-2 . IL-2 test study see `` boost '' immune system 's response HCV . The FDA approve IL-2 treatment cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HCV infection increasingly important clinical problem patient infect HIV . In HIV-uninfected patient acute HCV infection , presence vigorous T-cell proliferative response HCV protein associate normalization serum transaminase level viral clearance . Furthermore , early result suggest IL-2 may improve transaminase level HCV/HIV patient . These observation provide rationale immune-based therapeutic approach HCV/HIV coinfection . This study explore use initial immunostimulatory therapy IL-2 follow addition antiviral therapy PEG-IFN alfa-2b RBV , possible synergistic approach treatment . Patients receive IL-2 12 week follow addition PEG-IFN alfa-2b RBV Week 12 visit . Patients remain IL-2 , PEG-IFN alfa-2b , RBV additional 48 week . At Week 60 , study treatment permanently discontinue patient continue evaluate Week 84 . Toxicity intolerance evaluate . Data collect biochemical virologic response .</detailed_description>
