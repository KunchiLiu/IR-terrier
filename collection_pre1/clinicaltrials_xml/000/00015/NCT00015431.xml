	<brief_summary>This study determine whether people common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) without gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms gut abnormality ( inflammation loss function ) change immune system cell chemical blood gut . People CVID decrease level serum immunoglobulin IgG IgA . Patients sinus , lung infection , many also stomach intestinal problem , chronic diarrhea , inability absorb nutrition food , intestinal infection cause bacteria . CVID patient gastrointestinal symptom 10 year age old may eligible study ; CVID patient without gastrointestinal symptom 18 year age old enrol control subject . Candidates screen review medical record , medical history physical examination , HIV blood test , stool sample , hydrogen breath test . The breath test measure amount hydrogen breath drinking sugar water , show digestive effect bacteria upper intestine . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center several day undergo follow procedure : - Medical history physical examination - Blood test - Urine stool sample - 48-hour stool fat collection measure amount undigested fat stool determine ability gut digest absorb fat diet - D-Xylose absorption test measure ability sugar compound travel across line intestine determine ability gut absorb nutrient - Upper endoscopy thin flexible light tube advance mouth evaluate esophagus , stomach begin small intestine - Lower endoscopy thin light tube advance rectum evaluate colon Identification GI abnormality associate change immune response CVID patient help develop test new treatment disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune System Gut Abnormalities Patients With Common Variable Immunodeficiency With Without Gastrointestinal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) clinically heterogeneous disorder characterize decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG IgA level . In addition chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infection , many patient develop gastrointestinal manifestation disable fatal . Data suggest gut abnormality primary immune basis , implicate T cell primarily , related infectious complication CVID . Currently standard therapy associate gastrointestinal disease outside empiric nutritional intervention weight loss non-specific anti-diarrheal agent . In addition data prevalence gastrointestinal abnormality CVID patient overt gastrointestinal symptom . The objective study characterize gastrointestinal abnormality occur CVID patient correlate immunophenotype cytokine secretion peripheral blood lamina propria lymphocytes monocyte . CVID patient gastrointestinal symptom malabsorption/maldigestion chronic diarrhea target study . We also include group patient without gastrointestinal symptom provide estimate background prevalence severity gut abnormality . Subjects undergo standard immunologic workup include peripheral blood lymphocyte marker phenotyping cytokine response well test gastrointestinal absorption , examination gut histology endoscopic biopsy , measurement gut mucosal cytokine expression . Analysis variable include clinical ( weight , stool frequency , result gut absorption test ) , laboratory ( lymphocyte cytokine assay ) , gut abnormality ( histology score specific lesion ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must verifiable diagnosis common variable immune deficiency specifically decrease IgG least one Ig isotype two standard deviation normal control level . Must age 10 year old old patient gastrointestinal symptom age 18 year old absence gastrointestinal symptom . Must free active sinopulmonary infection time enrollment . Must negative result stool examination culture enteric pathogen ( Salmonella , Shigella , Yersinia , Campylobacter , Vibrio , E. Coli O157/H7 ) , Clostridia difficile toxin assay , enteric parasite ova ( include Cryptosporidia , Cyclospora , Microsporidia Giardia ( stool EIA ) ) . Adults unable provide initial ongoing consent may participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Absence antibody deficiency state include Xlinked agammaglobulinemia , hyper IgM syndrome , selective deficiency IgG subclass , Ig heavy chain gene deletion . Use immunomodulating drug within follow time prior enrollment : daily corticosteroid ( 4 week ) , azathioprine/6MP , cyclosporine , methotrexate , FK506 ( 3 month ) . The use shortterm single dose corticosteroid pretreatment regimen IVIG acceptable . Positive test antiHIV . Significant systemic major disease include congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease preexist recent onset CNS demyelinate disorder , pulmonary disease , renal failure , organ transplantation , decompensated liver disease , serious psychiatric disease , malignancy opinion investigator would preclude successful endoscopic evaluation . Pregnancy , avoid endoscopy without strictly therapeutic intent relatively high risk population .</criteria>
