	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether metformin alone , rosiglitazone alone , metformin rosiglitazone together low insulin level blood decrease fat abdomen part body . Studies show certain anti-HIV medication cause number side effect , include high blood sugar ( result body 's failure use insulin ) , high insulin , excess fat build-up abdominal area . These side effect know increase risk heart disease . Metformin rosiglitazone 2 drug show low insulin resistance lessen abdominal fat patient HIV-infected . This study investigate use drug HIV-infected patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Rosiglitazone , Alone Combination , HIV-Infected Patients With Insulin Fat Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study document hyperglycemia , insulin resistance , glucose intolerance seemingly increase proportion patient HIV infection . Other study describe variety syndrome fat accumulation fat loss , include abdominal obesity . Although initially attribute specifically protease inhibitor ( PI ) , abnormality also observe antiretroviral-experienced PI-naive patient . Hyperinsulinemia abdominal obesity strong independent risk factor coronary artery disease . In noninfected patient , metformin thiazolidinediones show reduce insulin resistance different mechanism also reduce visceral adiposity . This study investigate use metformin rosiglitazone , member thiazolidinedione class , HIV-infected patient hyperinsulinemia central fat accumulation . At study entry , clinical laboratory assessment perform . A standard OGTT , plasma sample draw 120 minute , perform glucose insulin determination . After completion entry evaluation , patient assign randomly 1 4 double-blinded treatment arm : Arm A : Metformin plus rosiglitazone placebo . Arm B : Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone . Arm C : Metformin plus rosiglitazone . Arm D : Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone placebo . Patients still study drug Week 16 ( either full reduce dose ) switch open-label phase receive combination metformin rosiglitazone Week 32 . Patients evaluation Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02 : Evaluations must perform fasting condition . ] Safety index , fast insulin glucose level , visceral [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02 : subcutaneous abdominal ] fat assess . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02 : Patients discontinue study treatment due pregnancy study Week 32 evaluation ( except CT DEXA scan ) . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02 : A mid-thigh measurement add study secondary endpoint look change extremity subcutaneous fat therapy rosiglitazone . Rosiglitazone peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gamma activator increase subcutaneous adipogenesis may thus increase subcutaneous fat improve insulin resistance way . ]</detailed_description>
