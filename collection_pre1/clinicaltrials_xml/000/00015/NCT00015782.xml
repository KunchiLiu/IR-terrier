	<brief_summary>Mucolipidosis Type IV ( ML-IV ) metabolic disorder cause mental motor retardation well visual impairment . There storage material practically cell body , cause problem brain eye . The disease cause defect gene make protein call mucolipin . Patients ML-IV make enough normal mucolipin . More 80 patient diagnose , Ashkenazi Jews . The disease often appear first year life either delayed motor development corneal cloud . There conflict report concern progressive nature disease . Some patient clear deterioration , others seem stay level disease long time . This study may lead good understanding disease , medical difficulty patient , good way diagnose ML-IV . Patients definite diagnosis disease , well patient need confirmation disease , candidate study . Patients admit annually Clinical Center maximum five day . A history take physical exam do . Blood urine test do along brain wave recording , complete eye examination , psychological test , speech language rehabilitation evaluation . A maximum 3 mL/kg blood drawn child total 60 mL adult . Various eye test also do , sedation . DNA extract possible use study . A skin biopsy take first visit . There possibility improve medical management rehabilitative treatment result participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Pathogenesis Mucolipidosis Type IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol study patient various neurometabolic disorder . Mucolipidosis type IV ( ML-IV ) , developmental degenerative disease cause mutation MCOLN1 gene lead absent dysfunctional protein call mucolipin . The goal protocol assess neurological medical status patient characterize clinical laboratory abnormality order determine natural history disease . Patients follow least yearly comprehensive clinical , neurological ophthalmological examination combine neuropsychological , blood , urine radiological test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Mucolipidosis type IV All patient definitive diagnosis mucolipidosis typeIV consider potential candidate study . Patients compatible clinical history need clinical laboratory confirmation MLIV consider well . The general health well candidate must sufficient allow travel National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , modest amount blood drawing , collection appropriate urine sample , performance necessary roentgenographic magnetic resonance ( MR ) image study ophthalmological examination monitor sedation . The patient must able return NIH least year regular basis .</criteria>
