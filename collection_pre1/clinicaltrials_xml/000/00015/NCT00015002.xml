	<detailed_description>After NICHD Consensus Development Conference 1994 , antenatal administration antenatal corticosteroid ( betamethasone dexamethasone ) prevention death serious morbidity associate preterm birth become accepted standard American obstetric practice . Studies show maximum beneficial effect occur fetus deliver within 7 day antenatal steroid administration . The efficacy safety single course corticosteroid substantiate unknown whether repetitive dose similar efficacy maternal , fetal neonatal risk . Repeat course steroid often administer . Two popular regimen exist patient remain undelivered one week initial therapy remain risk preterm birth . In one , steroid repeat weekly 34 week gestation , , steroid give . This multicenter trial test safety efficacy weekly administration antenatal steroid . Twenty four hundred woman &lt; 32.0 week gestation risk spontaneous preterm delivery remain pregnant least seven day initial course corticosteroid randomize either weekly course mask study drug ( betamethasone placebo ) 4 week delivery , whichever come first . Patients ask side effect weekly visit sample maternal blood randomization delivery collect . Cord blood placenta also collect . Cranial ultrasounds do neonate . On subgroup patient , adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test perform auditory brainstem response ( ABR ) perform . All infant attend follow-up visit 18 22 month correct age certify examiner , mask study group assignment , collect physical neurological data . The Bayley Scales Infant Development also administer .
