	<brief_summary>Plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein ( HRG ) bind platelet presence zinc ( 1 ) . This bind totally block monoclonal antibody direct platelet membrane CD36 . Therefore , CD36 assume carry platelet bind site HRG ( 2 ) . Because CD36 also variety ligand , include polyanionic lipid , also possible contains bind site heparin ( also polyanionic ) might involve pathogenesis heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . Demonstrating absent HRG heparin bind platelet lack CD36 would confirm bind site either ligand locate membrane protein . Because 3 % 11 % healthy Japanese report lack CD36 platelet , population practical source cell examine physiologic role ( ) CD36 . Therefore , recruit blood donor Japanese community NIH campus . Their platelet test presence CD36 . Recruitment close two individual identify whose platelet lack CD36 willing donate 30 cc blood 4 5 subsequent occasion bind study radiolabeled HRG heparin .</brief_summary>

It also report 2.4 % African Americans 4 % Taiwanese lack protein platelet . Therefore , recruit blood donor Japanese , African American , Taiwanese community NIH campus .
