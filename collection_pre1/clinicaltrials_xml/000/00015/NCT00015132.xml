	<brief_title>Tiagabine , Sertraline , Donepezil Treatment Cocaine Dependence - 9</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable progress preclinical research provide basis hypothesis driven clinical trial cocaine dependence . A great mechanistic understanding cocaine many clinically approved medication lead identification many promising medication treatment cocaine dependence . For reason NIDA develop CREST ( Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial ) protocol provide need incremental medication screen step preclinical research full blow expensive Phase III pivotal trial . While patient receive manual base psychotherapy , three medication screen compare unmatched placebo eight-week , 80-subject , four cell design trial . Other important feature CREST protocol include collect baseline measurement two week period analyze primary outcome measure ( quantitative urine toxicology clinical global improvement scale ) term composite score overall individual patient improvement . The three medication evaluate trial include tiagabine , sertraline , donepzil . Tiagabine hypothesize interfere glutamatergic cocaine mechanism relevant addiction . Sertraline potent selective inhibitor neuronal 5-HT reuptake , may modulate reinforce cue effect cocaine . Donepezil hypothesize interfere cholinergic cocaine mechanism relevant addiction .</detailed_description>
