	<brief_summary>Community base study show increase cardiovascular mortality associate acute exposure particulate air pollution . Electrocardiographic change also report animal expose particle control condition . We hypothesize cardiovascular patient may experience life-threatening arrhythmia associate particulate air pollution episode . Implanted cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) device continuously monitor heart rhythm , detect arrhythmias initiate intervention . These device provide passive , continuous monitor cardiac arrhythmia . We assess association community exposures air pollution measure ambient monitor cardiac arrhythmias detect implanted cardioverter defibrillator device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Air Pollution Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Records cardiac arrhythmias detected patient implanted cardioverter defibrillator link measurement concentration constituent ambient particulate air pollution . Time series method use assess temporal association , adjust seasonal , weekly , diurnal pattern , meteorology , co-pollutants . Characteristics subject show strong air pollution association assess , well effect modification medication co-morbidities . ICD patient follow clinically every three six month . The ICD device interrogate data retrieve non-invasive radio frequency retrieval implanted device . Device performance check . Detected arrhythmias therapeutic intervention list . For detected episode , date time record , along short electrogram heartbeat immediately event . Daily ambient particle mass ( PM10 PM2.5 ) particle constituent measure Boston since January 1995 . The Massachusetts Department Environmental Protection measure concentration gaseous pollutant include carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , sulfur dioxide . Meteorological factor include temperature , humidity , barometric pressure measure National Weather Service station Logan airport . Meteorologic factor gaseous co-pollutants consider independent predictor arrhythmic event , confounders particulate air pollution association .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The sample population consist cardiac patient implanted cardioverter defibrillator device attend device clinic New England Medical Center ( NEMC ) Cardiac Electrophysiology Pacemaker Laboratory . All patient implant ICD device event time date record live great Boston area include .</criteria>
