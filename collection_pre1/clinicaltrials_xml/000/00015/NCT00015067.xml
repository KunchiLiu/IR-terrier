	<brief_title>Cocaine-Methylphendidate Interaction Study - 4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct evaluate cardiovascular risk prescribe 90 mg methylphenidate ( MPD ) daily treat cocaine dependence . This within-subject study complete inpatient setting . It non-blinded MPD dose single-blinded cocaine dose . Each patient give intravenous cocaine 0 , 20 40 mg three different steady state level MPD ( 0 , 60 90 mg ) . Seven non-treatment seek cocaine addict , recruit community , complete study . There cardiac rhythm abnormality note except sinus tachycardia sinus bradycardia . There incidences seizure myocardial ischemia . In repeated measure ANOVA , MPD show independent positive effect heart rate ( p=0.0001 ) SBP DBP . There cocaine MPD interaction vital sign . Peak systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) patient 60 minute infusion 169 mm 108 mm , respectively . The first occur 60 mg MPD placebo cocaine give second MPD placebo cocaine give . Peak heart rate patient 60 min infusion 143/min 60 mg MPD 40mg cocaine . The number adverse event report cocaine MPD give together less number report either drug give alone . The adverse event report cocaine MPD give together included headache , nervousness , lightheadedness . Subjective rating drug effect reveal MPD enhance patient ' response , desire , cocaine . MPD appear safe drug use cocaine addict continue use cocaine dosage test .</detailed_description>
