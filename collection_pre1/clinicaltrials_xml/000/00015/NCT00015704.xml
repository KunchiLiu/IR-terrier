	<brief_summary>Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) help body make infection-fighting white blood cell , include CD4 CD8 T cell . One HIV treatment strategy plan treatment interruption ( stop anti-HIV drug CD4 count level virus blood certain level ) . The purpose study see IL-2 use potent anti-HIV drug allow long HIV treatment interruption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Interleukin-2 HIV Treatment Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One approach reconstitute HIV-diminished immune system use potent antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) conjunction IL-2 . IL-2 cytokine secrete activated T cell regulate proliferation differentiation CD4 CD8 T cell . Although treatment IL-2 cause temporary increase HIV viral load , clinical study IL-2 reveal long-term adverse effect viral load . IL-2 therapy may also help purge host 's latent viral reservoir activation rest lymphocyte harbor provirus . Another approach manage HIV infection strategic treatment interruption . Results small pilot trial suggest HIV replication highly suppress consecutive course ART follow short treatment interruption , CD4 T cell count maintain interruption positive effect HIV-specific immunity . This study evaluate potent ART , start interrupt base CD4 cell count , without IL-2 . Patients stratify base lifetime CD4 T-cell nadir ( low measurement ) one three group . Group 1 nadir 200 CD4 cells/mm3 ; Group 2 nadir great 200 CD4 cells/mm3 ; patient document nadir count available join Group 3 . Within group , patient randomly assign one two study arm . Arm A patient receive pulse potent ART IL-2 , Arm B patient receive pulse potent ART alone . Patients Arm A receive potent ART IL-2 give subcutaneous injection twice daily 5 day every 8 week least 17 week . Arm B patient receive potent ART alone least 17 week . Both group go treatment interruption approximately 64 week , follow potent ART alone additional 24 week . Patients repeat cycle potent ART without IL-2 , treatment interruption , potent ART alone throughout study . This study last approximately 4 year . Clinical laboratory assessment perform periodically throughout study . CD4 T cell count viral load determine patient enter next treatment step . Potent ART provide study . A5109s limited-center substudy design determine whether viral replication impairs lymphocyte proliferation vivo . Patients substudy-participating site register substudy immediately begin first treatment interruption main study .</detailed_description>
