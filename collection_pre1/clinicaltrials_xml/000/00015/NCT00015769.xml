	<brief_summary>This study explore possible effectiveness levetiracetam patient bipolar illness respond adequately standard treatment . Levetiracetam recently approve treat seizure . Other drug class levetiracetam , include carbamazepine valproate , widely recognize substitute medication lithium use adjunct , anticonvulsant also show promise improve bipolar symptom . Patients bipolar illness whose manic , depress unstable mood adequately control current treatment respond previously two standard treatment ( i.e. , lithium , valproate , carbamazepine neuroleptic ) may eligible study . Participants take levetiracetam start 500 mg daily . If dose well tolerated , increase 500 mg twice day . Every 3 day , dos may increase target dose 3000 mg/day reach . Higher dos , exceed 4000 mg/day , may try patient respond fully low dos . Patients observer use standard rating evaluate patient ' response therapy 8-week study . If , 8 week , result appear promising , patient may continue treatment additional 6 month evaluate longer-term effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Levetiracetam ( Keppra® ( Registered Trademark ) ) Bipolar Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost approve anticonvulsant compound ( exception gabapentin tiagabine ) suggest acute antimanic long-term mood stabilize property . Carbamazepine valproate gain widely recognize role treatment algorithm bipolar illness , lamotrigine show promising antidepressant effect . Levetiracetam ( Keppra® ( Registered Trademark ) ) recently approve anti-epileptic drug available , deserve pilot exploration bipolar illness variety reason . These include : positive side-effects profile ; derivative nootropic agent piracetam memory-enhancing property animal study ; likely unique mechanism action since active traditional excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitter system ; active traditional anticonvulsant model pentylenetetrazol ( PTZ ) maximum electroshock ( MES ) seizures , able stop development complete phase amygdala-kindled seizure ; metabolize hepatic enzyme thus adverse pharmacokinetic interaction . We propose pilot exploration levetiracetam adjunctive agent patient bipolar illness inadequately responsive routine psychopharmacological agent bipolar illness . At NIMH study maximum 10 acutely depressed , 10 manic , 10 cycling patient enrol Protocol 97-M-0039 . We would start Levetiracetam dose 500 mg/day , exceed 4000 mg/day . Response base primarily percentage patient show `` much '' `` much '' improvement GCI-BP score three group augment percentage decrement cross-sectional scale Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS ) Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) conjunction prospective rating NIMH-LCMp . Should preliminary evidence efficacy observe open add-on clinical trial , systematic control study design confirmation promise target area efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet DSM IV criterion bipolar I , bipolar II , bipolar NOS , schizoaffective illnessbipolar type eligible study . They enrol approve Protocol # 97M0039 thus H.I.V . provide consent rating form utilized study . Patients inadequate response two standard agent ( i.e. , lithium , valproate , carbamazepine , neuroleptic ) treatment bipolar illness eligible open adjunctive levetiracetam . If serum creatinine normal , creatinine clearance preform ; must 85 order patient eligible study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women childbearing age active method birth control likely become pregnant exclude . Men woman significant renal disease also exclude . For depressed phase , patient IDS score 18 great , LCM depression score low moderate great , GCIBP severity score moderate great 2 week , i.e. , DSMIV durational criterion . For hypomanic/manic phase , patient YMRS score 8 great , LCM mania rating mild great , CGIBP severity score moderately ill great 7 day . Those cycle group would meet severity criterion depression mania . They would four mood `` switch , '' overall illness rating CGIBP severity score moderate great .</criteria>
