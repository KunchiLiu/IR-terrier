	<brief_summary>The CATIE Alzheimer 's Disease Trial part Clinical Antipsychotic Trials Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) Project . The study people Alzheimer 's disease trouble think behavior . In particular , study try find best treatment people hallucination ( see hearing thing n't ) , delusion ( false belief ) , agitation . The design trial help increase chance participant study receive medication help . The study use three medication know atypical antipsychotic ( olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone ) , new medication currently available treat problem .

	<detailed_description>There four phase . Phase I : In initial treatment phase ( Phase 1 ) , patient randomize one three atypical antipsychotic placebo ratio 100:100:100:150 respectively . After two week , investigator move patient next phase lack efficacy tolerability . At week 12 , investigator decide whether current medication sufficiently optimal would beneficial try another randomized medication . Phase 2 : Phase 2 start patient randomized second medication , i.e. , olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone , citalopram . Patients randomize antipsychotic treatment another antipsychotic treatment citalopram ratio 3:3:2 , placebo antipsychotic treatment citalopram ratio 1:1:1:3 respectively . Therefore , 50 % patient take placebo Phase 1 randomize antipsychotic Phase 2 , 50 % randomize citalopram Phase 2 . After initial two week Phase 2 , investigator move patient next phase , due lack efficacy tolerability . After patient Phase 2 study drug approximately 12 week , investigator decide whether current medication sufficiently optimal whether would beneficial try another randomized medication . Phase 3 : Phase 3 randomized open-label treatment one medications previously receive , i.e. , olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone , citalopram . Treatment failure second treatment switch third open-label treatment . During Phase 3 patient maintain treatment openly manage clinically week 36 . If investigator determines patient 's response sufficiently optimal randomize open-label medication , first two week Phase 3 , investigator prescribe another medication ( investigator 's choice ) patient . If occurs patient class Open-Choice Phase . Open-Choice Phase : The Open-Choice Phase enter anytime 36-week study directly three phase . There four reason patient enter open choice phase : - Withdrawal Phase 1 Phase 2 patient surrogate decision-maker refuse proceed next randomized phase ; - Withdrawal Phase 3 ; - Withdrawal current study drug three previous phase due antipsychotic medication longer required opinion investigator ; - Withdrawal due concomitant treatment exclusionary medication . The Open-Choice Phase design keep patient monitor trial 36-week duration .</detailed_description>
