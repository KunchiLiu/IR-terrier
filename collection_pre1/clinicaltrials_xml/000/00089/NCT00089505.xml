	<brief_summary>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) commonly include anti-HIV drug regimen . However , HIV infect woman previously take single dose NNRTI nevirapine ( SD NVP ) prevention mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV may respond well NNRTIs woman never take NVP . Another class anti-HIV drug , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , may effective woman previously take NNRTIs . This study compare effectiveness NNRTI- PI-based regimen woman take NVP prevention MTCT HIV . This study also compare regimen include NNRTI regimens include PI woman never take NVP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NVP NNRTI choice prevent MTCT HIV , especially resource-limited setting . However , prolong use NVP may result drug resistance , decrease efficacy future anti-HIV regimen contain NVP . PIs expensive cause different adverse effect NNRTIs , PI-containing regimens may effective NNRTI-containing regimen treat HIV infected woman previously take NVP MTCT prophylaxis . This study compare efficacy NNRTI- PI-containing anti-HIV regimen woman previously take NVP MTCT HIV woman never take NVP . The study last minimum 48 week . Participants group previous NVP exposure : participant previously take NVP MTCT prophylaxis ( Trial 1 participant ) , participant never take NVP ( Trial 2 participant ) . Participants trial randomly assign one two arm , NVP-containing arm ( NVP/NVP trial 1 participant NoNVP/NVP trial 2 participant ) PI-containing arm ( NVP/LPV_r Trial 1 participant NoNVP/LPV_r Trial 2 participant ) . At start study , Arm NVP/NVP NoNVP/NVP participant receive emtricitabine ( FTC ) daily , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) daily , NVP daily first 14 day twice daily . Arm NVP/LPV_r NoNVP/LPV_r participant receive FTC TDF daily lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) twice daily . FTC TDF may replace either arm combination drug FTC/TDF . If participant experience virologic failure , toxicity , otherwise tolerate regimen , switch different regimen . Arm NVP/NVP NoNVP/NVP participant switch regimen two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) LPV/RTV ; Arm NVP/LPV_r NoNVP/LPV_r participant switch regimen two NRTIs NVP . Study visit occur entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , every 12 week thereafter . Visits consist physical exam , medication assessment , blood collection . Participants ask complete adherence questionnaire Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , every 24 week thereafter , quality life questionnaire Weeks 24 ever 24 week thereafter . Study drug provide participant 48 week final participant randomize . As per amendment ( date April 13 , 2009 ) , participant ask take part extension study . Enrollment extension completely voluntary . The purpose extension monitor , great extent , participant ' health transition study treatment local , clinical care . During study extension participant receive medication study ; expect participant receive treatment local clinic . Participants enrol extension enter extension time last visit current study . For extension , participant ask come back clinic two time study visit : 12 72 week entry extension . Because long time study visit , participant also contact phone ( mean ) close 48 week entry extension . At visit , participant ask health medication , include current anti-HIV drug . Participants also ask HIV care receive outside study . As part study , investigator may need review participant ' non-study medical record speak non-study care provider , find HIV care medical problem , also check result lab test . During study extension period , participant blood drawn also test pregnancy .</detailed_description>
