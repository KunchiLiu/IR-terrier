	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Males females 2 18 year age Cohorts 1A 1B , one month 6th birthday Baseline/Day 1 Cohort 2 , one month 12th birthday Baseline/Day 1 Cohort 3 , one month 19th birthday Baseline/Day 1 A female eligible enter participate study : 1. nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female premenarchial ) ; , 2. childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test screen , negative urine pregnancy test Day 1 agrees use one follow method contraception ( contraception method must use consistently correctly , i.e. , accordance product label instruction physician ) . Premenarchial female develop childbearing potential study expect follow one method contraception list . Agreement complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration study drug , throughout study 2 week discontinuation study medication . Should female subject childbearing potential decide become sexually active course study , must counsel willing use one contraception method list : Double barrier contraception ( male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm , diaphragm/spermicide ) Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) publish data show expected failure rate le 1 % per year ( IUDs meet criterion ) Any method publish data show low expected failure rate method le 1 % per year . Hormonal contraception recommend , due decrease efficacy contraception well increase risk hepatic transaminase elevation ( see Section 8.2 ) . All subject childbearing potential develop childbearing potential participating study counsel practice safe/safer sex . Parent legal guardian ( subject whenever possible ) ability understand provide write informed consent subject participate trial . Verbal witness assent must obtain subject whenever possible . Screening plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; =400copies/mL . Subjects must meet one follow criterion : Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) naïve PInaïve subject ( define receive less one week PI length therapy Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) and/or NonNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) ) . PIexperienced subject ( define receive great one week prior PI therapy three PIs ) . Prior RTV boost PI therapy consider one PI long RTV dose low recommend use RTV antiretroviral age Exclusion criterion : Prior history receive APV FPV &gt; 7 day . NNRTI use within 14 day prior study drug administration anticipate need concurrent NNRTI therapy treatment period study . Subjects , investigator 's opinion , able comply requirement study . Subject initial acute phase Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Clinical Category C event infection ( per 1994 classification ) Baseline . Subject may enrol provide receive treatment infection , treatment contraindicate FPV , subject clinically improve Baseline visit . Presence malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal dysfunction might interfere drug absorption render subject unable take oral medication . Pregnant lactating female . Presence serious medical condition ( e.g. , hemoglobinopathy , chronic anemia , history insulin resistance , diabetes , cardiac dysfunction , hepatitis clinically relevant pancreatitis ) , opinion investigator , might compromise safety subject .

Any acute laboratory abnormality screen , opinion investigator , preclude subject 's participation study investigational compound . If subject find acute Grade 4 laboratory abnormality screening , test may repeat within screen window . Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality screen would exclude subject study participation .
