	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study vaccine therapy sargramostim see well work compare vaccine therapy alone treat patient undergone surgery stage IIB , stage IIC , stage III , stage IV melanoma . Vaccines make peptide may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Combining vaccine therapy sargramostim may make strong immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate immune reactivity tyrosinase:368-376 ( 370D ) /gp100 : 209-217 ( 210M ) /MART-1 26-35 ( 27L ) peptide vaccine Montanide ISA 51 without GM-CSF administer booster five vaccination two year . OUTLINE : This randomize , parallel , continuation study . Patients stratify accord response prior vaccination ( response 1 peptide v response 2 peptide ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive vaccination comprise tyrosinase peptide , gp100 antigen , MART-1 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 ISA-51 VG subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 week 0 , 26 , 52 , 78 , 104 ( total 5 vaccination ) . Arm II : Patients receive vaccination comprise tyrosinase peptide , gp100 antigen , MART-1 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 ISA-51 VG arm I . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC day 1-5 week 0 , 26 , 52 , 78 , 104 . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 2-4 week , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient ( 20 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
