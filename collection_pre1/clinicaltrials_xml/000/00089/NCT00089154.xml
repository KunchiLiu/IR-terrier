	<brief_title>Apolizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate progression-free survival rate patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) noncontiguous stage II stage III IV small lymphocytic lymphoma treat apolizumab . II . Determine safety drug , term frequency severity treatment-related adverse event , patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical response apolizumab varies genetic subtype CLL . II . Determine pharmacokinetic clearance truly predict 1D10 antigen density individual patient CLL cell apolizumab clearance correlate response select toxicity observe . III . To determine importance reactive oxygen specie specific signal pathway promote apolizumab-mediated apoptosis vitro vivo primary CLL cell correlate clinical response therapy . IV . To determine cellular property convey resistance apolizumab CLL vivo . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive apolizumab IV 2-4 hour day 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 week , 1 2 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
