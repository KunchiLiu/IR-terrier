	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) common , progressive disease affect memory cognition . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) identify genetic factor may increase risk develop Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . While several consensus statement advise clinical use APOE genotyping , call research evaluate impact susceptibility genotyping explore process communicate risk issue . The REVEAL I Study fund 1999 enroll adult child patient AD determine would choose obtain APOE genotyping , devise education counsel protocol disclosure APOE genotyping , study impact disclose information . The REVEAL I study demonstrate Alzheimer 's disease risk assessment APOE genotyping give relative people Alzheimer 's disease without cause severe adverse psychological behavioral effect . The REVEAL II study examine whether receive risk assessment APOE genotyping disclosure Condensed Education Counseling Protocol safe effective receive information current Extended Protocol . This study also examine whether difference among group receive disclosure APOE result risk assessment different provider type , physician genetic counselor . At least one-third participant REVEAL II African American , order explore racial identity affect desire obtain genetic risk assessment impact receive . Individuals parent sibling affect Alzheimer 's disease may enter study either self-referral study coordinator recruitment . Participants schedule phone interview demographic information , relative 's medical history , attitudes toward genetic test risk assessment Alzheimer 's disease , interest go next step study assess . During second step study , participant randomly assign one three study arm . Participants control arm study give full educational counseling protocol originally develop first funding period study . All participant opportunity continue study blood drawn genotype analysis risk assessment . Follow-up session provide psychometric measure questionnaire . Participants see genetic counselor two follow-up appointment , six week six month disclosure risk information . A final 12 month follow-up questionnaire complete mail follow phone call genetic counselor .</detailed_description>
