	<brief_summary>The angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) valsartan drug commonly use treat high blood pressure . Valsartan may also help slow progression kidney disease HIV infect people . The purpose study compare valsartan antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ART alone slow kidney disease progression people HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ART treatment HIV may slow progression HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ; nevertheless , predict many HIV infect patient ART reach ESRD next decade . Medications affect renin-angiotensin system , ARB valsartan , may useful treat HIVAN . In small study HIV infect patient HIVAN treat angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) fosinopril , kidney function stable patient take ACEI , function decrease patient . These data promising , suggest ARB like valsartan may also slow progression HIVAN improve patient ' prognosis . This study compare valsartan ART ART alone slow kidney disease progression people HIV . This study last 96 week . All participant continue take current ART regimen study randomly assign one two arm : Arm 1 receive valsartan daily , Arm 2 receive placebo daily . Doses drug placebo may adjust first 8 week base blood pressure read take study . In addition , patient antihypertensive drug , dosage adjustment may necessary drug study . No ART antihypertensive drug valsartan provide study . Study visit occur every week Week 8 , every 8 week end study Week 96 . Study visit include physical examination , medication assessment , blood pressure reading . In addition , blood collection occur entry , Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
