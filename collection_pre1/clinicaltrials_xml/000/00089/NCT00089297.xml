	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving cetuximab combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving cetuximab surgery may kill tumor cell remain . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together combination chemotherapy radiation therapy work treat patient undergo surgery stage III stage IV head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect induction therapy comprise cetuximab , paclitaxel , carboplatin follow chemoradiotherapy comprising cetuximab , paclitaxel , carboplatin , radiotherapy maintenance therapy comprise cetuximab 1-year event-free survival ( freedom surgery primary site freedom recurrence death ) patient stage III IV operable squamous cell cancer head neck . Secondary - Determine pathologic antitumor response primary site patient treated regimen . - Determine disease-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine local/regional distant failure rate patient treated regimen . - Determine effect treatment regimen selective biologic pathway , total phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor , ERK/MAPK , P13K/AKT patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy ( week 1-6 ) : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour , paclitaxel IV 1 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . During week 7 8 , patient undergo biopsy evaluation primary site . Patients proceed chemoradiotherapy . - Chemoradiotherapy ( week 9-13 ) : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1 hour , paclitaxel IV 1 hour , carboplatin IV 15 minute day 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , week 9-13 . Patients positive biopsy week 7 8 persistent tumor primary site induction therapy undergo second biopsy chemoradiotherapy week 14 . Patients negative biopsy week 7 8 achieve complete clinical pathological response primary site OR patient whose biopsy becomes negative week 14 receive additional 3-weeks chemoradiotherapy begin week 15 . Patients receive cetuximab , carboplatin , paclitaxel chemoradiotherapy ( outline ) day 99 , 106 , 113 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 3 week ( week 15-17 ) . Patients N1-N3 disease undergo neck dissection week 20-21 . Patients positive biopsy week 14 receive additional chemoradiotherapy , rather undergo surgical resection primary site week 18-19 . Patients N1-N3 disease also undergo neck dissection time . - Maintenance therapy : Beginning completion surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy , patient receive cetuximab IV 1 hour weekly 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . ACTUAL ACCRUAL : A total 74 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

Baseline measurement evaluation must obtain within 4 week prior registration study . Age &gt; 18 year . Women childbearing potential sexually active male strongly advise use accept effective method contraception . Original diagnostic material must submit baseline EGFR assessment designate laboratory . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients fix nodal metastasis spine carotid artery , patient invasion root tongue , pharyngeal muscle , post pharynx , vertebral fascia invasion laryngeal cartilage strap muscle tracheal ( &gt; 1cm ) invasion . Prior chemotherapy , surgery radiation immunotherapy head neck cancer . Prior malignancy except situ lobular breast carcinoma , situ cervical carcinoma , basal cell cancer previously excise control cutaneous squamous cancer ( &lt; 200 mm thick ) permit . Significant history cardiac disease i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled arrhythmia . Prior antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor include inhibitor target EGFR pathway .
