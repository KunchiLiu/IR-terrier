	<brief_title>MDX-010 Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety profile MDX-010 ( ipilimumab ) monoclonal antibody identify tolerable immunologically active dose level B cell lymphoma patient . II . To evaluate clinical response rate B cell lymphoma patient treat MDX-010 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate phenotype function memory T cell treatment MDX-010 : - Quantitation phenotypic characterization peripheral blood tumor infiltrate T-cells , include cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+CD25+ regulatory T cell . - Measurement tumor-specific T cell peripheral blood lymphocyte . - Measuring proliferation memory T cell response recall antigen ( tetanus toxoid keyhole limpet hemocyanin [ KLH ] ) . II . Measurement anti-tumor antibody serum pre- post-therapy . III . To evaluate time progression . IV . To evaluate duration response treatment MDX-010 . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients group accord prior treatment vaccine therapy lymphoma ( yes v ) . PHASE I : Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day total 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6 patient group receive escalate dos MDX-010 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive MDX-010 phase I MTD . Patients follow 1 4 month every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
