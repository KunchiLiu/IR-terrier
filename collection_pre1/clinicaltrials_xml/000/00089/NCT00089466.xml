	<brief_title>Safety Activity Oral HIV Entry Inhibitor AMD11070 HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMD11070 oral HIV-1 entry inhibitor target CXCR4 receptor T cell . AMD11070 show safe well-tolerated Phase I clinical trial HIV uninfected people . The goal study evaluate safety antiretroviral activity eight dose level AMD11070 HIV infect adult X4-tropic virus . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AMD11070 also study . This study last 90 day . All participant receive medication 10 day . There eight cohort study , maximum six participant per cohort . Cohort A receive 200 mg AMD11070 every 12 hour ; Cohort B receive 400 mg AMD11070 every 12 hour ; Cohort C receive 600 mg AMD11070 every 12 hour ; Cohort D receive 800 mg AMD11070 every 12 hour ; Cohort E receive 1000 mg AMD11070 daily ; Cohort F receive 1500 mg AMD11070 daily ; Cohort G receive 1000 mg AMD11070 every 12 hour ; Cohort H receive 2000 mg AMD11070 daily . Cohorts B , C , D , E open sequentially , provide one six participant precede cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) base safety evaluation Day 17 . Cohort G open enrollment Cohort E fill ; Cohort H open enrollment Cohort F fill . Cohort F open enrollment provide one six participant Cohorts E G experience DLT . All study participant offer receive open-label AMD11070 separate long-term safety study . Participants either admit general clinical research center ( GCRC ) dose period dosing , PK testing , study monitor do outpatient basis , depend study site . Participants admit GCRC dose period allow daytime pass GCRC Days 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . During study , participant continuous heart monitoring , serial electrocardiogram ( EKGs ) , vital sign check . Fasting blood collection occur Days 5 10 . Trough PK test occur entry Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 11 . Intensive 24-hour PK test 24-hour urine collection occur Days 10 11 . After treatment , target physicals urine collection occur Days 17 , 30 , 90 , additional blood collection occur Days 17 , 21 , 30 , 90 . Participants undergo EKG Days 17 90 . Participants also undergo opthalmologic evaluation questionnaire sometime receive AMD11070 .</detailed_description>
