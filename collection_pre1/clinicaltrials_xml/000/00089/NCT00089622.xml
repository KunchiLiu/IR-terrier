	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness skin patch formulation dopamine agonist Lisuride control parkinsonian symptom dyskinesia ( involuntary movement ) cause levodopa . Lisuride currently available tablet form ; study test whether patch formulation provide continuous stimulation dopamine receptor well control disease symptom . Patients 40 80 year old Parkinson 's disease dyskinesia may eligible 4-month study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Screening baseline evaluation : Participants evaluate medical history , physical examination , neurologic evaluation , blood test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram . A chest X-ray MRI CT scan brain do , need . If possible , patient stop take antiparkinsonian medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) 1 month ( 2 month Selegiline ) study begin throughout duration . Dose-finding phase : Patients admit NIH Clinical Center 2 3 day levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For test , patient stop take Sinemet instead levodopa infused vein . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly parkinsonian symptom improve unacceptable side effect occur maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently . ( Patients dose infusion last 3 month undergo phase study . ) Active study phase : Patients randomly assign one two treatment group . One group receive placebo ( patch active drug ) patch contain Lisuride ; group receive placebo throughout entire study . Patients instruct apply patch . During first 2 week study phase , number patch contain active drug gradually increase individual 's optimum dose reach . Patches change every 2 day . During time , intake antiparkinsonian medication taper patient evaluate frequently . For next 3 month , patient wear patch continuously optimum dose . The patch change every 2 day week , depend individual patient 's need . Two levodopa infusion study do active study phase dose-finding phase - begin dose escalation phase end dose maintenance phase . In addition , patient test ability perform different motor task . Sleep study : Because oral Lisuride cause excessive sleepiness , patient ask participate sleep study evaluate sleep pattern night daytime sleepiness . The subject 's brain , muscle , breathe continuously monitor sleep . Also , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) do record brain wave subject lie quietly , breathes deeply , watch flash light , sleep , performs task . Safety check : Patients monitor closely safety history side effect , blood test , ECG time new supply study drug dispense . Follow-up : 2 week complete active phase study , patient contact phone follow-up evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive degenerative disease unknown etiology . Treatment symptomatic successful approach replace miss dopamine administration precursor levodopa . As disease progress , usefulness approach gradually diminish , motor complication become source significant disability . Although number pharmacological strategy attempt improve situation , none yet prove fully satisfactory . A novel transcutaneous formulation dopamine agonist lisuride use test ability approach reduce levodopa-induced motor response complication . Objective : The objective study evaluate risk benefit continuous dopaminomimetic replacement therapy patient advance Parkinson 's disease . Study population : Approximately 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patient enrol randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , proof-of-principle study , last approximately 16 week . Lisuride efficacy assess use validate motor function scale . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test . Anticipated Risks Benefits : The potential risk associate study amount minor increase minimal risk primarily associate adverse reaction medication involve . Lisuride approve use Europe 20 year wide margin safety . Patients receive drug could benefit improvement clinical condition ; placebo also receive proper medical care may lead good quality life . Outcome Estimate Potential Meaning Field : This study understand mechanism contribute motor disability patient PD thus lead development improve therapeutic intervention disorder associate motor response complication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals meet follow inclusion criterion eligible participate : Patient diagnose idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . Patient relatively advance disease levodopaassociated motor response complication , include , peakdose dyskinesia wearingoff fluctuation . Patient optimize oral levodopa , usually interdose interval less equal 3.0 hour . Patient willing adhere protocol requirement evidence write , informed consent . Patient age 40 80 year , inclusive . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals meet follow exclusion criterion immediately study enrol immediately exclude study , appropriate : Patient history medical condition reasonably expect subject unwarranted risk , history severe cardiac ( myocardial infarction within 12 month prior study , dysrhythmia ) , severe cerebrovascular , convulsive , significant hepatic ( enzyme elevation great twice upper limit normal ) , renal ( creatinine exceed upper limit normal ) disorder . Patient take prohibited medication . Patient unable treat levodopa/carbidopa alone participant protocol . Patient unilateral bilateral deep brain stimulating ( DBS ) device unable unwilling turn period protocol participation . Patient prior bilateral pallidotomy . Patient cognitive impairment indicate Minimental status examination ( MMSE ) score less 25 . Patient use adequate contraceptive method last 2 month , ( female ) pregnant breastfeeding , least one year postmenopausal unwilling unable continue contraceptive use study . Patient participate clinical study investigational drug within last 30 day . Patient dermatological problem , eczema hirsutism , would interfere transcutaneous therapy . Patients know hypersensitivity lisuride skin patch material . Patients slow lisuride metabolism due CYP450 2D6 deficiency require drug also metabolize CYP450 2D6 , include Betablockers : Smetoprolol , propafenone , antidepressant : amitriptyline , clomipramine , desipramine , imipramine , antipsychotic : haloperidol , risperidone , thioridazine , drug : codeine , dextromethorphan , flecainide , ondansetron , tramadol . CONCOMITANT MEDICATION EXCLUSION : The following medication prohibit least one month prior randomization ( except note ) course study : Dopamine agonists kind ( 1 week , Cabergoline 8 week ) . Any investigational drug specifically permit protocol . MAO inhibitor , selegiline ( 2 month ) . Anticholinergics . Drugs use primarily treat Parkinson 's disease may modify parkinsonian symptom , include neuroleptic , metoclopramide alpha beta adrenergic receptor antagonist . Drugs consider ameliorate dyskinesia include NMDA antagonist ( amantadine , budipine , memantine , remacemide dextromethorphan ) , alpha beta adrenergic receptor antagonist , anxiolytic ( buspirone ) exception antidepressant SSRI group fluoxetine , antipsychotic ( clozapine , quetiapine olanzapine ) , cannabinoid receptor antagonist , adenosine A2a antagonist , exacerbate dyskinesia ( sodium valproate CNS stimulant ) . Drugs know 5HT receptor subtype affinity ( ritanserin , sumatriptan ) .</criteria>
