	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety side effect two experimental vaccine patient kidney cancer determine whether vaccine `` turn '' immune response cancer . Each vaccine contain one two peptide ( piece proteins ) fibroblast growth factor 5 ( FGF-5 ) antigen , protein produce cancer cell , oil-based liquid call Incomplete Freud 's Adjuvant ( Montanide ISA-51 ) enhance immune response vaccine . Patients 16 year age old kidney cancer spread beyond kidney whose primary kidney tumor remove within 6 month enter study high risk disease recurrence may eligible study . Patients must tissue type human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A2 ) human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A3 ) ( determine blood test human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) type ) tumor must produce FGF-5 peptide . Candidates screen physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , tumor biopsy ( removal small sample tumor examination ) patient whose tumor easily accessible , scan ( compute tomography ( CT ) , bone scan ) x-ray current scan available . Participants divide two group accord HLA type ( HLA-A2 HLA-A3 ) receive vaccine appropriate HLA type . They divide three group : 1 ) Group 1 include patient need ineligible treatment interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , protein make certain infection-fighting white cell help fight tumor ) patient previously IL-2 therapy ; 2 ) Group 2 include patient require immediate treatment IL-2 ; 3 ) Group 3 include patient whose cancer surgically remove risk recurrence . Patients Groups 1 3 receive two peptide injection four time week every 3 week year , tumor grows ( return patient Group 3 ) side effect severe continue . Tumors evaluate physical examination scan x-rays every 12 week blood test do every 3 week . Patients Group 2 receive two peptide injection every day 4 day , along dos IL-2 start day first peptide injection . The vaccine give injection skin thigh . IL-2 infuse vein 15 minute every 8 hour 12 dos , depend tolerance . The vaccine IL-2 repeat every 10 14 day , tumor evaluation every 2 month . Patients stay hospital 1 week treatment cycle receive IL-2 . All patient undergo leukapheresis , procedure collect large number white blood cell . Blood collect needle arm vein flow cell separator machine , white cell extract . The rest blood return patient needle needle arm . The white cell examine evaluate vaccine change action immune cell . Some patient may undergo additional biopsy normal skin tumor lymph node look effect vaccine immune cell tumor . Patients Group 1 whose cancer grow patient Group C whose cancer return may offer IL-2 treatment give Group 2 patient , along peptide vaccine . If disease respond IL-2 , treatment may repeat 2 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Several preliminary clinical result treatment cancer lend credence hypothesis augment T-cell response improve IL-2 therapy . A peptide vaccine derive melanoma/melanosomal antigen , GP100 , give high-dose IL-2 result response rate 30 % small Phase II study . These result lead effort identify similar T-cells tumor-associated antigen IL-2 responsive tumor renal cell cancer . Work laboratory generate renal cancer-reactive T-cell clone , raise tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) within renal cell cancer ( RCC ) metastasis undergo spontaneous regression . This clone HLA-A3 restrict recognize autologous tumor well number allogeneic RCC line also express HLA-A3 . Expression clone antigen recognize clone demonstrate RCC-associated antigen recognize unmutated fibroblast growth factor 5 ( FGF-5 ) . We conclude numerous study FGF-5 tumor associate antigen over-expressed majority RCC several favorable characteristic target immunotherapy . At point , demonstrate laboratory tumor-reactive T-cells generate patient renal cancer recognize naturally present FGF-5 either context HLA-A2 HLA-A3 via minimal determinant 117-126 : FGF-5 ( MLSVLEIFAV ) FGF-5:172-176/217-220 ( NTYASPRFK ) , respectively . With study plan determine vaccination peptide enhance number FGF-5-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) precursor patient renal cancer affect anticipate response rate high-dose IL-2 . Objectives : The primary objective patient renal cell carcinoma determine overall response rate toxicity peptide vaccination HLA-A2 HLA-A3- bind peptide FGF-5 HLA-appropriate patient , explore effect vaccination response rate high-dose IL-2 . The primary objective patient receive vaccination adjuvant set evaluate immunologic response toxicity FGF-5 peptide vaccination likely receive repeat vaccination prior require IL-2 . The secondary objective evaluate immunologic response FGF-5 peptide vaccination . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A2+ HLA-A3+ , must age great equal 16 , expect survival great three month . For cohort A B , patient must measurable metastatic renal cancer FGF-5 tumor expression . For cohort C , patient require Stage III primary tumor ( i.e . T3/T4 N1/N2 ) excise within last 6 month . ) Patients cohorts A B must tumor site safely accessible biopsy indication resection site tumor ( e.g . indicated nephrectomy symptomatic metastasis ) willing undergo biopsy , FGF-5 expression determine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) eligible detectable . Patients must meet specific safety laboratory criterion . May undergone systemic therapy cancer past 3 week ( 6 week nitrosureas ) , major medical illness , require systemic steroid therapy . Design : Patients first divide cohort measurable metastatic disease ( Cohorts A B ) high-risk loco-regional disease ( Cohort C ) . Patients measurable metastatic disease separate require immediate IL-2 therapy ( Cohort B ) ( cohort A ) . Cohort A begin receive vaccination HLA-appropriate peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 Montanide® ( Registered Trademark ) ISA 51 VG daily four day every 3 week continue year , tumor progression document . At point , ineligible high-dose IL-2 previous IL-2 inpatient ( consider high dose dos great equal 600,000 IU/kg ) take study , still eligible IL-2 yet receive , high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 ( 720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hour 12 dos ) add peptide vaccination regimen . Two cycle , separate 10-14 day , give every two-month period ( constitutes course. ) . Patients Cohort A cross vaccination plus IL-2 therapy , receive peptide MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide® ( Registered Trademark ) ISA 51 VG vaccination day prior start IL-2 cycle ( instead every 3 week , accommodate IL-2 regimen ) repeat daily three additional day ( total four day ) IL-2 administration . Patients Cohort B begin high-dose bolus IL-2 therapy two cycle within every two month period , cycle precede peptide MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide® ( Registered Trademark ) ISA 51 VG vaccine day prior start IL-2 cycle peptide MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide® ( Registered Trademark ) ISA 51 VG repeat daily three additional day ( total four day ) IL-2 administration . Patients Cohort C undergo HLA-appropriate vaccination peptide MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide® ( Registered Trademark ) ISA 51 VG daily four day every 3 week continue 6 month disease relapse document . At time relapse , eligible patient Cohort C receive treatment high-dose bolus IL-2 continue peptide vaccination use schedule specify Cohort A crossover arm . For patient cohort A peptide vaccine alone , evaluation perform every 3 month first 6 month therapy stable , every 3-6 month thereafter . For cohort A B peptide vaccine plus high-dose IL-2 therapy , evaluation perform every 2 month IL-2 , every 3-6 month stable patient therapy . For cohort C , evaluation perform every 3 month first year every 6-12 month thereafter . The maximal accrual possible would 210 patient ( Cohort A 80 patient , Cohort B 66 patient Cohort C 64 patient ) , maximal enrollment could take 5 year .</detailed_description>
