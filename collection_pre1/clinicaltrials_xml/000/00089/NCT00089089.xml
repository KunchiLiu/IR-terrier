	<brief_title>Decitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose single agent decitabine toxicity use schedule population patient solid tumor lymphomas . II . Definition dose tumor DNA demethylation optimum . III . Definition dose peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMN ) demethylation optimal . IV . Definition decitabine pharmacokinetics correlation plasma concentration hypomethylation effect . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Preliminary assessment decitabine efficacy ( objective response ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive decitabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 day 1-5 8-12 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos decitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
