	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether experimental vaccine intend prevent HIV infection safe whether cause side effect . It also examine whether vaccine , call VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP , cause immune response , monitor participant social impact HIV vaccine study . VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP contain synthetic DNA code part four HIV protein . It also contain `` promoter '' piece DNA need start protein production . The promoter DNA also synthetic like promoter another virus call cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . The vaccine contain live HIV virus CMV cause either illness . Healthy volunteer 18 44 year old HIV-negative may eligible 32-week study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants receive three injection experimental vaccine approximately 28 day apart . The injection give system call Biojector 2000 delivers vaccine skin muscle without use needle . Subjects observed side effect least 30 minute vaccination require telephone clinic staff 1 2 day injection report . In addition , give diary card take home , record temperature symptom daily five day . Participants return clinic two week injection . They return complete diary card check health change problem since last visit . They ask feel medication , , take . Blood urine sample collect . Some subject may ask laboratory test regular visit need evaluate change health . Participants also ask social effect may experience result participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response 6-plasmid multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccine , VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP . The hypothesis regimen safe human administration elicit immune response HIV-1 clade B Gag , Pol Nef proteins , well clades A , B C Env proteins . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability humans investigational vaccine secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity vaccine measure intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) 4 week second third dose vaccine social impact participate HIV-1 vaccine trial . Product Description : VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP compose 6 close , circular DNA plasmid 16.67 percent ( weight ) vaccine . Each 6 plasmid vaccine express single gene product . Plasmids VRC 4401 , VRC 4409 VRC 4404 design express clade B HIV-1 Gag , Pol Nef , respectively . VRC 5736 , VRC 5737 , VRC 5738 design express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein clade A , clade B , clade C , respectively . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( deltoid muscle ) use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer ( 18 44 year old ) enrol . Study Plan : Fifteen volunteer enrol , show schema : Name Vaccine : VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP Number Subjects : 15 Vaccine Injection Schedule : ( least 21 day injection ) Day 0 : 4 mg Day 28 plus minus 7 : 4 mg Day 56 plus minus 7 : 4 mg Study Duration : 32 week clinical follow-up participant . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety regimen ; secondary endpoint cellular immune response measure ICS within first 4 week second third dos social impact Week 32 . Exploratory analysis include HIV-specific antibody assay , ICS immunological assay interval Day 0 Week 32 .</detailed_description>
