	<brief_summary>This Phase II study docetaxel , bevacizumab , prednisone thalidomide patient androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer previously untreated chemotherapy . The primary objective study determine combination docetaxel , thalidomide bevacizumab able associate sufficiently high proportion patient prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response worthy investigation metastatic prostate cancer . We also look multiple secondary endpoint . These include possible pharmacokinetic interaction among study agent , potential correlation patient genotype efficacy treatment . We also look circulate tumor cell blood treatment . Additionally monitoring tolerability regimen survival duration endpoint well . We hope use trial build promise result see thalidomide/docetaxel protocol significant PSA decline trend toward survival benefit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Androgenindependent metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate define progressive metastatic disease gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonists post surgical castration Histopathological documentation prostate cancer confirm National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Laboratory Pathology National Institutes Health , Pathology Department Walter Reed Medical Center Pathology Department National Naval Medical Center , prior start study . In addition , patient whose slide lose unavailable eligible study provide documentation prostate cancer meet criterion clinically progressive prostate cancer outline section 3.1.1.3 . Clinically progressive prostate cancer document prior entry . Progression must document least one follow parameter : Two consecutively rise prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) level . The first rise PSA must minimum one week reference value . It recognize PSA fluctuation confirmatory PSA value might less previous one . In case , patient would still eligible provided next PSA great first rise PSA value . Patients must PSA great equal 5.0 . At least one new lesion bone scan . Progressive measurable disease . Patients must undergo bilateral surgical castration must continue GNRH agonist . Those patient receive antiandrogen agent enter trial due rise PSA must demonstrate continued rise PSA 4 week stop flutamide 6 week stop bicalutamide nilutamide .

Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Present clinical sign symptom brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis confirm compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan . Uncontrolled , intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( American Heart Association ( AHA ) Class II worse ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Persistent systolic blood pressure great equal 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great equal 100 mmHg . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction docetaxel , bevacizumab , and/or combination .
