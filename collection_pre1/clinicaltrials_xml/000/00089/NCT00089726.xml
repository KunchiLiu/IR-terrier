	<brief_summary>The main purpose research study determine vaccine make patient 's lung cancer tumor cell effective make cancer shrink disappear . The vaccine give patient , patient get vaccine cyclophosphamide ( type chemotherapy ) . Studies animal cancer vaccine trial suggest cyclophosphamide may make tumor vaccine potent . This study try determine vaccine give without chemotherapy effective destroying lung cancer cell . Additionally , study collect information vaccine safety , without chemotherapy , whether vaccine improve lung cancer-related symptom ( e.g. , shortness breath ) . Tumors surgical resection process make vaccine . Prior treatment , patient randomize equally one two treatment group , Cohort A Cohort B . Patients Cohort A treat CG8123 vaccine patient Cohort B treat CG8123 vaccine plus single dose cyclophosphamide administer one day prior first , third , fifth vaccine treatment . Patients receive intradermal ( beneath skin ) vaccine injection every two week eight week , total five vaccine treatment . The duration study , include active follow , approximately two year . After , patient followed-up yearly total 15 year .</brief_summary>
