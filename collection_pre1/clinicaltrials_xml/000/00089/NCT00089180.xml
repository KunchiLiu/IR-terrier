	<brief_title>T4N5 Liposomal Lotion Preventing The Recurrence Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer Patients Who Have Undergone Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare incidence nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) ( average per patient ) sun-exposed skin renal transplant recipient history NMSC treat T4N5 liposomal lotion v placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare proportion patient develop NMSC sun-exposed skin treatment cessation treatment regimen . II . Compare incidence NMSC sun-exposed skin patient cessation treatment regimen . III . Compare incidence recurrent de novo actinic keratoses ( AKs ) patient treat regimen . IV . Determine whether either regimen induces regression AKs leave untreated sun-exposed skin patient . V. Compare proportion patient develop melanoma , treat untreated site , cessation treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord study center . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . Six month randomization , lesion suspicious nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) surgically remove histologically analyze . All 10 randomly select non-suspicious lesion remove . Of 10 lesion , 5 shave biopsied immediately pre-treatment histologic surrogate endpoint biomarker ( SEB ) analysis determine baseline actinic keratosis : wart ratio . Patients also undergo pre-treatment biopsy normal appear sun-exposed non-sun-exposed skin ( buttock ) . Arm I : Patients apply T4N5 liposomal lotion topically non-occluded , sun-exposed area head , neck , face , upper extremity daily 12 month . Arm II : Patients apply placebo topically non-occluded , sun-exposed area head , neck , face , upper extremity daily 12 month . Treatment arm continue absence development metastatic cutaneous squamous cell cancer melanoma . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient ( 50 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
