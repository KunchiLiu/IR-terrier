	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Improve Milder Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : OSA characterize mild , moderate , severe , accord number respiratory disturbance per hour sleep ( RDI ) , define American Academy Sleep Medicine . CPAP primary treatment sleep apnea . The column pressure deliver upper airway device immediately eliminate respiratory disturbance apply . There evidence randomize controlled study CPAP also improve functional status , key manifestation OSA , include excessive daytime sleepiness , individual severe OSI ( i.e. , RDI great 30 ) . However , limited research explore improvement functional status individual less severe OSA ( i.e. , mild OSA RDI 5-15 moderate OSA RDI 16-30 ) . The large placebo effect report controlled study OSA-associated functional outcome mandate need placebo study evaluate true impact treatment . Results three randomize control study milder OSA examine issue equivocal , principally serious methodological limitation . It remain unclear whether CPAP treatment improve daily function milder OSA ( RDI 5-30 ) . This critical issue level disease severity represent large segment OSA comprise 15 % U.S. population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using Granger 's model functional assessment , study examine whether functional status improve participant milder OSA follow CPAP treatment . The study employ randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel study design , use sham CPAP device placebo participant significant daytime sleepiness . The study test hypothesis change functional status ( measure Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ) 8 week treatment great participant treat active CPAP compare placebo . Secondary aim study include examine whether CPAP also improve daytime sleepiness , determine whether CPAP reduce nocturnal blood pressure low risk stroke hypertension link OSA .</detailed_description>
