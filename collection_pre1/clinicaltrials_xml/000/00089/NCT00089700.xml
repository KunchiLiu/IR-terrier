	<brief_title>TNX-355 With Optimized Background Therapy ( OBT ) Treatment-Experienced Subjects With HIV-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 48-week , multicenter , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , multi-dose , three-arm safety efficacy study approximately 80 subject compare TNX-355 plus OBT placebo plus OBT adult subject infect HIV-1 . Subjects must : 1 ) stable viral load 10,000 copies/mL , determine within 8 week prior randomization ( Day 1 ) ; 2 ) treat HAART least 6 month ( cumulatively ) ; 3 ) triple class experience , historical evidence exposure three traditional class antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) : nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) ; 4 ) presently fail fail HAART regimen within 8 week prior screen ( Screening visit 1 ) . Subjects assign OBT base upon past medication history result virus sensitivity testing ( PSGT , ViroLogic , Inc. ) , randomize study arm begin receive OBT plus study medication Day 1 visit . Fusion/entry inhibitor permit part optimize background therapy . All subject randomize equally ( 1:1:1 ratio ) , double-blinded fashion , among three arm receive OBT plus one following : Arm A , alternate intravenous infusion TNX-355 , 15 mg/kg placebo weekly first 9 dos ( Week 8 visit ) , intravenous infusion TNX-355 , 15 mg/kg every two week ; Arm B , TNX-355 , 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion weekly first 9 dos ( Week 8 visit ) , intravenous infusion TNX-355 , 10 mg/kg every two week ; Arm C , weekly intravenous infusion placebo first 9 dos ( Week 8 visit ) , intravenous infusion placebo every two week . Subjects continue receive blind therapy therapy fail . Subjects achieve viral load reduction least 0.5 log10 baseline value two consecutive protocol-defined assessment Week 12 consider virologic failure . Subjects experience virologic failure Week 16 ( i.e. , early point virologic failure confirm Week 12 ) option assign new OBT plus open-label TNX-355 give 15 mg/kg infusion every two week . Subjects experience second virologic failure discontinue study . The total duration study treatment 48 week , primary endpoint Week 24 .</detailed_description>
