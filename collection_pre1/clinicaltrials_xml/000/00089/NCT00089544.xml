	<brief_summary>Thalidomide may stop growth soft tissue sarcoma stop blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving thalidomide together radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . This phase II trial study well give preoperative ( surgery ) thalidomide together radiation therapy work treat patient low-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma , well give thalidomide together radiation therapy , doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine work treat patient high-grade intermediate-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma arm , leg , chest wall , abdominal wall .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine treatment delivery toxicity combination thalidomide radiotherapy patient low-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall . II . Determine treatment delivery toxicity combination thalidomide doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine , radiotherapy patient high- intermediate-grade primary soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall compare result patient treat RTOG-9514 . III . Determine feasibility use specific tissue circulate biomarkers antiangiogenic response patient treat regimen , multi-institutional setting . IV . Determine quantitative change patient variability biomarkers , , therapy regimen . V. Determine baseline data set biomarkers , particularly circulate endothelial cell , patient treat regimen . VI . Determine tolerance long-term post-operative thalidomide patient . VII . Determine clinical response pre-operative therapy patient . VIII . Correlate local control disease-free survival surrogate biological endpoint patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This pilot , cohort study . Patients high- intermediate-grade tumor &gt; = 8 cm diameter assign cohort A patient low-grade tumor &gt; 5 cm diameter assign cohort B. Cohort A : Patients receive doxorubicin , ifosfamide , dacarbazine IV continuously day 1-3 , 22-24 , 43-45 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 4 , 25 , 46 continue blood count recover . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily day 7-11 , 14-18 , 21 , 28-32 , 35-39 , 42 . Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 7-21 26-42 . Patients undergo surgical resection day 84 98 . Beginning 2 week surgery , patient receive oral thalidomide daily 12 month absence unacceptable toxicity . Cohort B : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily begin day 1 continue 1 week surgery . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , week 1-5 . Patients undergo surgical resection day 77 91 . Beginning 2 week surgery , patient receive oral thalidomide daily 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient ( 22 per cohort ) accrue study within 17 month .</detailed_description>
