	<brief_title>Androgens Subclinical Atherosclerosis Young Women - Ancillary CARDIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) denote hyperandrogenism symptom ovulation dysfunction ( e.g. , infertility , oligomenorrhea ) . Women diagnose PCOS represent extreme end abnormal ovarian function . While PCOS rare , approximately 20 percent woman expect subclinical polycystic ovary , identify sonogram . Factors associate PCOS , insulin resistance dyslipidemia , also risk factor coronary artery disease evidence suggest woman PCOS likely experience coronary artery disease . This raise question : subclinical case polycystic ovary increase risk coronary artery disease ? The study ancillary Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) Study , large cohort study support NHLBI . The CARDIA population provide unique opportunity explore association 15-year period risk factor ascertainment population include store blood + DNA specimens serum androgen relevant genetic marker ascertain . In addition , participant coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) determination year 15 exam . In ancillary study additional year 16 visit occur purpose obtain trans vaginal ultrasound determination ( TVUS ) obtain clinical evidence hyperandrogenism look joint effect clinical evidence serum marker predictor CAC . The study response initiative Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release June , 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The ancillary study year 16 CARDIA recall 1,200 woman receive coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) determination year 15 . These woman additional blood draw three 10 day last menstrual period , questionnaire administer regard clinical symptom PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) aspects hyperandrogenism . Two principal analysis perform . The first longitudinal analysis use year 2 year 10 data use serum marker hyperandrogenism genetic marker DNA sample predictor CAC define present ( absent ) determine year 15 examination . The principal method analysis logistic regression . An additional analysis relate androgen level year 2 lipid level coronary risk factor ascertain year 2 , 7 , 10 15 .</detailed_description>
