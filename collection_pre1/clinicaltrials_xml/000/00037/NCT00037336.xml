	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Premature cardiovascular disease major cause mortality rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The mechanisms underlying accelerate atherosclerosis relationship inflammation RA poorly understood . Recent study indicate inflammation effect inflammatory cytokine , oxidative stress , lipid peroxidation , important pathogenesis atherosclerosis . The study 's hypothesis accelerate , inflammation-promoted atherosclerosis occur RA . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study test hypothesis : 1 ) structural functional vascular damage frequent severe patient establish RA match control related cumulative disease severity ; 2 ) impairment vascular integrity associate clinical laboratory marker inflammation , plasma homocysteine concentration , oxidative stress . To address two hypothesis relationship longstanding inflammation vascular integrity determine cross-sectional study 75 patient establish RA prospectively obtain clinical data available 15 year , 75 match non-RA control . Endothelium-dependent , flow-mediated dilation brachial artery measure ultrasound , coronary calcium volume measure electron beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) provide functional structural measure vascular integrity , respectively . F2-isoprostane excretion , reliable index lipid peroxidation vivo , homocysteine lipid concentration measure . Vascular integrity , oxidative stress , lipid homocysteine compare control RA patient . In RA patient relationship RA activity damage index obtain 15 year vascular function damage measure determine . Using technique address hypothesis 3 ) rate progression vascular disease patient early RA alter control inflammation . In prospective cohort 100 patient early RA receive usual clinical care 100 match non-RA control follow 24 month relationship clinical biochemical measure inflammation vascular integrity determine compare `` responder '' `` non-responders '' . These study provide basic understanding interrelationship inflammation , lipid , oxidative stress vascular damage , suggest strategy reverse prevent damage RA , potentially , disease .</detailed_description>
