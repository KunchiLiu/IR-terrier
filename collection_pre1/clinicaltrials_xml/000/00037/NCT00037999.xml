	<brief_summary>The objective project determine safety efficacy testosterone supplementation adjunct traditional rehabilitation therapy care deconditioned old men . Our long range goal determine whether hormone ( e.g. , combine testosterone growth hormone ) helpful adjunct traditional rehabilitation therapy . This project important VA health care system 38 % American veteran age ( age &gt; 65 year ) , bioavailable testosterone diminish old age men , low testosterone associate impaired muscle strength , lack muscle strength hinders rehabilitation . Older men successfully rehabilitate often get admitted nursing home long term care , cost approximately $ 40,000/year . Payment long term care currently one difficult health care problem . If testosterone supplementation improve rehabilitation outcome , pilot data suggest , patient satisfy long-term care financial resource save . We conduct randomize , placebo-controlled trial test hypothesis supplementation testosterone improve rehabilitation outcome deconditioned old men . Specifically , screen hospitalize old men delay discharge hospital ( &gt; 7 day hospital stay ) . Men least one new impairment ability perform activity daily live ( e.g. , inability walk ) , low serum testosterone concentration , contraindication ( e.g. , prostate breast cancer ) offer opportunity participate . Study participant randomize receive either testosterone ( 5 mg transdermally night ) placebo ( match transdermal patch ) daily double-blind fashion duration hospital course ( expect average duration study 29 day ) . Subjects receive rehabilitation usual , member health care team blind whether subject receive testosterone placebo . At baseline , weekly , discharge , 6 12 month discharge , subject assess use validated measure ( i.e. , Functional Independence Measure - FIM ) . Our hypothesis testosterone supplementation , adjunct traditional rehabilitation therapy , improve rehabilitation outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our overall goal determine safety efficacy testosterone supplementation adjunct traditional rehabilitation therapy health outcome deconditioned old men . Specifically , conduct randomize , placebo-controlled trial test hypothesis supplementation testosterone improve rehabilitation outcome deconditioned old men . We use objective validated measure ( i.e. , FIM , muscle strength ) ass health outcome . We begin enrol subject within three month receipt funding , study 60 subject ( 30 group ) within 24 month . All subject undergo follow-up evaluation 6 12 month completion inpatient rehabilitation cessation testosterone supplementation . Therefore , project complete within 3 year . Our short term goal ( within 3 year ) delineate safety efficacy testosterone supplementation rehabilitation outcome deconditioned old men . Our long range goal determine whether hormone ( e.g. , combine testosterone growth hormone ) helpful adjunct traditional rehabilitation therapy care old men</detailed_description>
