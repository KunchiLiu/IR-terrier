	<brief_title>Relation Diet Serum Homocysteine Level Youths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Data observational study suggest plasma total homocysteine ( tHcy ) concentration may independent modifiable risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) adult . Plasma tHcy level respond rapidly nutrient supplementation folic acid vitamin Bl2 B6 , alone combination . The available data potential prevention provide strong rationale understanding determinant tHcy youth . However , large U.S. study examine relation tHcy level individual ' dietary intake folic acid vitamin Bl2 B6 youth . DESIGN NARRATIVE : During Child Adolescent Trial Cardiovascular Health ( CATCH ) Phase 3 , cross-sectional study serum tHcy level conduct eighth grade student ( Jan-June 1997 ) . Higher mean level plasma total homocysteine observe among male , Blacks , non-users multi-vitamins strong , inverse association serum level folic acid less extent , serum vitamin Bl2 . A second measurement cohort grade 12 conduct order ass dose-response relation serum tHcy dietary intake ( measure grade 8 ) folic acid , vitamin B12 vitamin B6 . In addition equal importance , change evaluate serum folic acid tHcy level grade 8 12 , full implementation fortification cereal grain product U.S. folic acid impact distribution tHcy level adolescent describe . Effective January 1 , 1998 , U.S. Department Agriculture mandate addition folic acid flour grain product United States . CATCH unique opportunity examine effect `` natural experiment '' distribution serum tHcy cohort , serum tHcy level measure grade 8 , prior full implementation mandate . Furthermore , study adequate sample size examine change among important demographic subgroup , male vs. female Caucasians vs. African Americans vs. Hispanics . Information generate study valuable design specific dietary intervention youth target subgroup child may high risk CVD .</detailed_description>
