	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) common infection patient SCI major cause morbidity mortality population . The bladder patient SCI , especially indwell catheter , often colonize bacteria may may cause symptom UTI . Bacteria cause symptom usually consider benign colonizer often leave untreated may afford protection symptomatic infection harmful bacteria . We apply concept use benign bacteria prevent symptomatic infection , so-called bacterial interference , deliberately colonize bladder patient SCI non-pathogenic prototype Escherichia coli ( strain 83972 ) . The preliminary result VA-funded study compare rate symptomatic UTI patient SCI colonize E. coli 83972 vs. historical rate symptomatic UTI prior study enrollment indicated deliberate colonization bladder patient SCI E. coli 83972 safe promising ability prevent symptomatic UTI . However , innovative approach bacterial interference successfully apply population patient SCI , essential : ( A ) confirm ultimate efficacy bacterial interference conduct prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( objective # 1 ) ; ( B ) enhance practicality apply innovative approach SCI patient delineate bacterial host factor promote successful colonization E. coli 83972 ( objective # 2-3 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial conduct . Patients sustain SCI &gt; 18 month earlier , suffer neurogenic bladder ( require intermittent bladder catheterization , indwell suprapubic catheter , external collection device ) , history frequent symptomatic UTI ( &gt; 2 episode precede year ) eligible enrollment . Exclusion criterion include urolithiasis , indwell nephrostomy catheter , indwell transurethral foley catheter , supravesical urinary diversion , vesicoureteral reflux , condition anticipate require antibiotic therapy chronic recurrent extraurogenital infection ( e.g . infect decubitus ulcer ) , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus immunosuppression . Patients consider unreliable pursue adequate follow-up incapable give informed consent also exclude . Subjects discontinue measure suppress UTI least two week prior entry study . All patient complete history physical examination , serum creatinine , plain X-ray abdomen ( KUB ) , urine culture immediately prior entry study . Renal ultrasound urodynamic evaluation urinary tract also obtain upon study entry unless perform precede year .</detailed_description>
