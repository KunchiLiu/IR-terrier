	<brief_title>Stroke Rehabilitation Outcomes With Supported Treadmill Ambulation Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gait training often delay rehabilitation process gait think require preparation improve strength , balance , coordination initiation complex demanding activity . We propose new approach perform early gait train acute stroke patient , consist Supported Treadmill Ambulation Training ( STAT ) combine conventional rehabilitation achieve functional ambulation . Hypotheses : This study test three hypothesis ; 1 . The STAT group develop great gait speed , long walk endurance , low oxygen cost walk compare stroke patient receive regular rehabilitation care . 2 . The STAT group develop good functional outcome ( Functional Independence Measurement total score transfer locomotion subscales ) compare stroke patient receive regular rehabilitation care . 3 . The STAT group develop high submaximal oxygen consumption measure bicycle ergometer test compare stroke patient receive regular rehabilitation care . Specific Objectives Projected Timetable : Since stroke patient reduce walk capability , poor health status , decrease functional capacity , well sedentary lifestyle , specific objective project : 1 . Compare effect regular inpatient stroke rehabilitation regular stroke rehabilitation combine STAT acute stroke gait performance ; 2 . Compare effect regular inpatient stroke rehabilitation regular rehabilitation combine STAT acute stroke functional outcome , define Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) ; 3 . Compare effect regular inpatient stroke rehabilitation regular stroke rehabilitation combine STAT acute stroke oxygen consumption seat exercise task . 4 . Explore whether neurophysiological characteristic use Brain Motor Control Assessment ( BMCA ) predict rehabilitation outcome . Timetable : This 3-year project compare outcomes two strategy intervention stroke rehabilitation . Admission , randomization , test , intervention , reevaluation , discharge follow time frame establish facility provide regular rehabilitation care stroke patient . On average , stroke rehabilitation process last two three week .</detailed_description>
