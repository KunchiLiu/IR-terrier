	<brief_summary>The purpose trial examine short term effect ( 24 Weeks ) GM1 Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) symptom , well effect long-term treatment ( 120 Weeks ) GM1 disease progression , examine extent GM1 treatment influence underlie disease process PD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GM1 Ganglioside Effects Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design examine extent GM1 ganglioside improve symptom , delay disease progression , , perhaps , partially restore damaged brain cell PD patient . GM1 ganglioside chemical normally find brain normal part outer cover membrane nerve cell . This study compare effectiveness GM1 standard PD treatment . In addition study clinical measure motor cognitive functioning , investigator use PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan image brain dopamine nerve ending subgroup patient . Patients mild moderate idiopathic PD divide 2 group . One group receive GM1 24 week receive placebo . At end 24 week period , patient enter 96 week treatment period patient receive GM1 . In parallel , group standard-of-care patient mild moderate PD monitor 1 2 year period ass natural progression PD . These patient receive clinical evaluation treatment group subject receive experimental medication .</detailed_description>
