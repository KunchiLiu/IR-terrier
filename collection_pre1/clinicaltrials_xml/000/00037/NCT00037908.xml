	<brief_summary>Our overall goal develop therapeutic intervention improve upper-limb motor function hemiparetic person base improved understanding mechanism responsible loss recovery . We intend rigorously evaluate efficacy intervention clinical trial , study mechanism intervention affect motor recovery . In proposal , use control , randomize , double blind clinical trial study effect shoulder elbow strength training subject subacute phase recovery follow stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Strength Training Upper-Limb Function Post-Stroke Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : The specific hypotheses test proposal refer person post-stroke hemiparesis subacute phase recovery ( complete out-patient therapy program , still less 6 month post-CVA ) . 1. ) Standard functional rehabilitation combine strength training form high-intensity resistance exercise result great gain elbow shoulder strength standard functional rehabilitation alone . b ) This increase strength accompany increase hypertonia . c ) This increase strength accompany significant muscular hypertrophy . 2 . Standard functional rehabilitation combine strength training result great improvement motor function functional rehabilitation alone . 3 . Strength train result improve control elbow trajectory track movement shoulder-elbow reaching movement . Specific Objectives 1 . To perform control , randomize , double-blind clinical trial test effect high-intensity resistance exercise shoulder elbow . Two intervention compare : standard functional rehabilitation ( SFR ) , standard functional rehabilitation combine high-intensity resistance exercise ( strength training ) ( SFR+STR ) . We study person post-stroke hemiparesis subacute phase recovery , i.e . complete outpatient therapy program , still less 6 month post-CVA . Outcome measure include strength ( maximal voluntary isovelocity joint torque ) , hypertonia ( onset threshold stretch reflex , Modified Ashworth Scale ) , standard clinical assessment activity daily live ( Barthel Index , Functional Independence Measure ) , upper extremity motor function ( Fugl-Meyer exam , Functional Test Hemiparetic Upper Extremity ) . 2 . To study neuromuscular mechanism associate improvement strength motor control result intervention . Strength change investigate measure muscle hypertrophy , hyperreflexia , passive stiffness . Changes control upper extremity movement investigate measure motor performance muscle activation pattern trajectory track reach task . Our long term goal develop therapeutic intervention improve upper-limb motor function person post-stroke hemiparesis . Improved motor function involve increased strength shoulder elbow , also increase strength dexterity wrist hand . The propose study establish foundation demonstrate positive effect strength training person hemiparesis . Then , future study , investigate effect specific intervention hand wrist investigate physiologic mechanism subserve change neuromuscular function follow strength training .</detailed_description>
