	<brief_title>New CVD Risk Factors Lowered Cognitive Functioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Arterial hypertension high blood pressure ( HBP ) major risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) stroke ; also risk factor lower cognitive functioning . Except diabetes , comparatively study common risk factor , particularly regard interrelationship among risk factor may adversely affect cognitive ability . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine association cognitive functioning three cardiovascular risk factor : 1 ) high blood pressure ; 2 ) high total plasma homocysteine ( tHcy ) , 3 ) ApoE e4 genotype . These association examine cross-sectionally well longitudinally , use data collect follow-up visit member cohort follow past 18-19 year . Longitudinal data use examine current change cognitive functioning . Some analysis prospective ( e.g. , high blood pressure change cognitive functioning ) , others cross-sectional ( e.g. , ApoE e4 current cognitive functioning ) retrospective ( e.g. , tHcy change cognitive functioning ) . Structural equation model use examine cross-sectional data elucidate general theoretical model . Two-stage growth curve analyse survival analysis appropriate method analyze longitudinal data . The study include comprehensive set measure already collect collect follow-up visit . All potential confounders association three target predictor variables various domain cognitive functioning appear include design .</detailed_description>
