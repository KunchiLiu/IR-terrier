	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The cardiovascular disease complication Type II diabetes mellitus major public health problem . The research design provide new information relation specific biomarkers , gene , diet risk CVD complication high-risk Type II diabetes mellitus population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study assess biochemical marker dyslipidemia endothelial dysfunction , omega-3 fatty acid relation risk CVD among men woman diagnose type 2 diabetes two large ongoing cohort study , Nurses Health Study ( NHS ) Health Professionals Follow-up Study ( HPFS ) . By 1998 , 12,600 confirm type 2 diabetic case already accumulate two cohort . By year 2002 , 5,507 blood sample prospectively collect person previously newly diagnose type 2 diabetes available analysis . Using unparalleled resource , investigator evaluate ( 1 ) The relationship plasma level cell adhesion molecule ( i.e . sICAM-1 , sVCAM-1 , E-selectin ) , diabetic dyslipidemia , risk CVD among diabetic ; ( 2 ) association Lp ( ) concentration risk CVD among diabetic , independent high triglyceride low HDL ; ( 3 ) association long-term intake omega-3 fatty acid CVD risk diabetes . The main NHS HPFS grant provide follow-up documentation CVD addition covariate information . Overall , large size cohort , prospective design , high follow-up rate , availability archive blood specimen provide unique opportunity study relationship diabetic dyslipidemia risk CVD extremely cost-efficient timely manner . In addition , two cohort provide unusual opportunity compare lipid profile endothelial marker CVD diabetic men woman .</detailed_description>
