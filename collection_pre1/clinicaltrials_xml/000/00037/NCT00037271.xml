	<brief_title>Genome Scan Obesity Multi-Ethnic Sample</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite intensive effort genetic basis obesity difficult establish . Linkage analysis use genome-wide scan potentially identify genomic region previously think associate susceptibility obesity provide comprehensive test consistency previous study . The study use considerable resource generate four cooperate network NHLBI-supported `` Family Blood Pressure Program '' ( FBPP ) conduct genome-wide scan data obesity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Family Blood Pressure Program , microsatellite marker type density -10cM Mammalian Genotyping Service ( MGS ) Marshfield , WI . The complete data set include 9,940 individual represent 4 ethnic group ( white , black , Hispanic Asian ) . Obesity characterize weight/height ratio ( body mass index ) waist/hip ratio . This data set large prior genome scan obesity , inclusion multiple ethnic group make possible examine genetic heterogeneity . The specific aim study conduct linkage association analyse localize region influence obesity . Investigators work closely FBPP Coordinating Center ( Washington University , St. Louis ) investigator four FBPP network . Evidence seek consistency result obtain analyse genome scan perform individual , result summarize literature , find meta-analysis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
