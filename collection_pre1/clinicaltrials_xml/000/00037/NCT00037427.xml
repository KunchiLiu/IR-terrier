	<brief_title>Airway Responses Following Chlorine Gas Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The specific aim study determine : ( 1 ) effect asthma pre-existing airway hyper reactivity pulmonary function airway reactivity inflammation response chlorine ; ( 2 ) effect chlorine concentration pulmonary function airway reactivity inflammation response chlorine ; ( 3 ) ass time dynamic pulmonary function airway reactivity inflammation response chlorine . It hypothesize airway hyperactivity high chlorine concentration result large change pulmonary function airway reactivity inflammation response , change differential time course follow chlorine exposure . This study use two controlled human exposure experiment , utilize single-blind , repeated-measures , counter- balance design . The two subject group experiment consist 21 individual airway hyperactivity , 21 individual asthma airway hyperactivity . In Experiment One , subject expose 15 minute separately : ( 1 ) chlorine 0.4 ppm ; ( 2 ) chlorine 1.0 ppm ; ( 3 ) filter air ( Control ) . Pulmonary function airway reactivity measure immediately pre-exposure 1 20 hour post-exposure . Airway inflammation , determine cellular biochemical component sputum-induction , measure 65 hour pre-exposure 20 hour post-exposure . In Experiments Two , subject expose 15 minute separately : ( 1 ) chlorine ( concentration determine Experiment One ) ; ( 2 ) filter air ( Control ) . Pulmonary function airway reactivity measure immediately pre-exposure 3 72 hour post-exposure . Sputum-induction perform 65 hour pre-exposure 3 72 hour post-exposure . The result study provide information major irritant chemical relevant occupational environment . Specially , susceptibility large sub-population increase risk , dose-response effect , post-exposure time dynamic effect chlorine gas determine . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
