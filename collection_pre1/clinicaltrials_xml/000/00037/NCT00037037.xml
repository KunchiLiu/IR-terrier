	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Combining vaccine therapy sargramostim may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase I trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy without sargramostim treat patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients With High-Risk Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare safety melanoma peptide vaccine without sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient high-risk metastatic melanoma . - Compare change peptide-specific cellular humoral immunologic profile patient treat regimen . - Compare tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprise tyrosinase leader inject 2 separate site , Melan-A ELA inject another site , NY-ESO-1a NY-ESO-1b combine injected one site , MAGE-10.A2 inject another site , intradermally weekly week 1-6 . - Arm II : Patients receive vaccine arm I . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin 2 day vaccination continue 5 day . Treatment arm continue week 6 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 2 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient ( 10 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
