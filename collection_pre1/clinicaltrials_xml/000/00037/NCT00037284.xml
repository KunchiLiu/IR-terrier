	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent study demonstrate immune system play important role coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Research also show psychological factor major depression acute mental stress involve clinical progression CAD . Depression associate high level immune parameter play role CAD ( cytokine , marker low grade inflammation , infectious pathogen burden , adhesion molecule ) , measure also increase response acute physical mental stress . The pathophysiological mechanism link depression mental stress adverse cardiovascular outcome may therefore mediated immunological factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine clinical outcome patient undergo percutaneous coronary revascularization , major problem remain frequent ( 20 percent-40 percent ) occurrence coronary restenosis new cardiac event six month intervention . These adverse outcome substantial impact cost medical care patient ' quality life . Since previous research examine role behaviorally-induced change immune parameter prediction CAD progression , follow immunological measure examine : cytokine ( IL-1B , IL-4 , IL-6 , IFNy , TNFa ) , acute phase protein ( CRP , fibrinogen ) , lymphocyte count differential , adhesion molecule ( ICAM-1 , LFA , L-selectin ) , composite measure pathogen burden ( CMV , H. pylorus , C. pneumoniae ) . Using longitudinal design , project determine time course change depression change immune parameter . Moreover , present study determine contribution behavioral immunological factor clinical progression coronary disease follow coronary angioplasty . These data may therefore improve identification patient risk recurrent cardiac event restenosis coronary angioplasty , provide understand pathophysiological mechanism involve coronary disease progression .</detailed_description>
