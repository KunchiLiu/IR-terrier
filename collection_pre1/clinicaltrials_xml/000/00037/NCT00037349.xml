	<brief_title>Heart Rate Recovery Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although considerable attention pay prognostic significance heart rate rise exercise , recently note heart rate fall exercise , `` heart-rate recovery , '' may even powerful predictor outcome . Heart-rate recovery exercise consequence central reactivation vagal tone . As impaired parasympathetic function associate increase risk death , study test hypothesis impaired heart-rate recovery powerful independent predictor mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall aim project use heart-rate recovery substantially improve prognostic value exercise test . The specific aim project : 1 ) Derive biologically meaningful mathematical model heart-rate recovery . Data 20,000 patient undergone exercise test Cleveland Clinic Foundation 1990 1998 use ; patient test perform exercise workstation record heart rate every 10 second exercise . Heart-rate recovery measure difference heart rate peak exercise heart rate different point recovery . Modeling base exponential family , use stepwise selection , bootstrapping , information theory approach . Correlates different pattern heart rate recovery determine . 2 ) Using result model heart-recovery derived work Specific Aim 1 , determine prognostically define optimal definition abnormal heart rate recovery demonstrate abnormal heart rate recovery powerful independent predictor mortality diverse patient group . Data exercise tolerance test 40,000 patient study Cleveland Clinic Foundation 1990 1999 analyze . Statistical method use include nonparametric Kaplan-Meier product limit method Cox proportional hazard model bootstrap validation , include use random forest technique . 3 ) Using completely parametric technique , develop predictive survival model heart-rate recovery include along clinical data exercise finding , include exercise capacity heart rate change exercise . The advantage parametric technique include : ) allow model nonproportional hazard might permit differential strength effect different follow-up time different set risk factor ; b ) generate absolute risk , relative risk ; c ) permit patient-specific prediction . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
