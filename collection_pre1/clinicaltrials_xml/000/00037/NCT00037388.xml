	<brief_title>Pediatrics : Chlamydia , Sickle Cell Anemia Stroke Risk - Ancillary STOP II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Infection Chlamydia pneumoniae ( C. pneumoniae ) associate increase risk cerebrovascular disease general population . Children sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) 200 time likely cerebrovascular disease normal child know alter immune response many infectious pathogen . C. pneumoniae lead infectious cause acute chest syndrome , interestingly , well- establish risk factor stroke child SCA . Preliminary data indicates SCA patient magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -documented cerebral infarction 12 time likely C. pneumoniae infection SCA patient normal MRI scan . The investigator hypothesize SCA patient abnormal immune response C. pneumoniae result persistent infection , turn , trigger development cerebrovascular disease . Sickle cell anemia patient elevate velocity transcranial doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) know high risk develop stroke elevate TCD likely reflect underlie vascular disease . In addition , Stroke Prevention Sickle Cell Anemia Trial ( STOP ) demonstrate almost 40 percent child elevate TCD evidence cerebral infarction MRI . Children abnormal TCDs , therefore , appropriate population investigate association cerebrovascular disease C. pneumoniae infection . The study response initiative Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release June , 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study ancillary STOP II clinical trial . The intent : 1 ) To determine C. pneumoniae infection associate cerebral infarction child SCA ; 2 ) To characterize immunological response C. pneumoniae infection patient SCA . Establishing link C.pneumoniae infection cerebral infarction open door novel , less toxic approach treatment prevention stroke SCA , include antibiotic vaccine .</detailed_description>
