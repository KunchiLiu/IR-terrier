	<brief_summary>We propose develop evaluate workstation significantly enhance application Constraint-Induced ( CI ) Therapy automate instrument several task currently use shape training . The motivation development device follow : 1 ) Patients could receive CI therapy home without need constant supervision therapist . Many veteran resource travel local VAMC two three week period require treatment . A home-based device would expand pool veteran could receive CI therapy . 2 ) For subject able receive CI therapy clinic , device would facilitate effective post-treatment home-practice program . 3 ) Currently , patient treat one-on-one basis clinic . This device could allow one therapist treat 3 4 patient one time , thereby substantially reduce cost therapy . 4 ) This workstation would provide clear comprehensive quantification progress treatment . This could indicate task patient progress least rapidly , would therefore enable effective modification treatment plan treatment progress .

In first 18 month , workstation design fabricate . To expedite design , rely simple modification `` shelf '' component . In last 18 month , control , randomize , clinical trial compare effectiveness automate CI therapy program standard CI therapy . The standard CI therapy group would receive shape train clinical setting , one-on-one therapist .

	<detailed_description>Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) lead cause disability United States . CVAs particular problem VA large population World War II Korean War veteran age range CVAs frequent ; fiscal year 1997 national VA system 22,000 admission acute CVA . The consequent motor deficit veteran sustain result large cost VA Federal Government . The reduction CVA-related disability thus represent high VA national health care priority . Constraint-Induced ( CI ) therapy one technique proven control , randomized study substantially reduce incapacitate motor deficit more-affected upper extremity patient mild moderately severe chronic stroke . The procedure CI therapy relatively simple deem effective produce transfer increase extremity use activity daily live real world environment . The therapy involve promote use more-affected upper extremity 90 % waking hour constrain less-affected extremity two three consecutive week rest hand splint sling device prevents movement hand wrist activity daily live . The patient receive type training term `` shape '' 7 hours/day ( rest interval ) weekdays period ( massed practice ) . We propose develop evaluate workstation significantly enhance application CI therapy automate instrument several task currently use shape training .
