	<brief_summary>The purpose study see certain vitamin ( C , E , B1 , B2 ) keep lactate level become high patient take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) anti-HIV drug . Some patient take anti-HIV drug develop hyperlactatemia . Hyperlactatemia condition lactate ( natural substance normally present body ) level high . Too much lactate body lead serious health problem . When patient suffer hyperlactatemia take anti-HIV drug , doctor temporarily stop drug . Patients restart anti-HIV drug lactate level return normal . If patient restart drug take developed hyperlactatemia , risk may develop high lactate level . This study want find taking antioxidant ( substance reduce tissue damage due oxygen radical ) certain B vitamin may help prevent patient develop hyperlactatemia restart anti-HIV drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperlactatemia serious complication NRTI treatment HIV . Most physician temporarily discontinue antiretroviral therapy patient serious hyperlactatemia , restart antiretrovirals lactate level normalize . Two option restart antiretrovirals switch different NRTIs switch NRTI-sparing regimen . The latter option probably safer , grow number HIV-infected population already expose available class antiretrovirals may lack option . This study investigate ability antioxidant B vitamin prevent recurrence hyperlactatemia patient restart NRTI-containing regimen . Patients 2 clinic visit ( screen pre-entry ) prior entry study . Prior visit , patient must fast refrain exercise least 8 hour . At screen visit , blood drawn lactate level . Women reproductive potential pregnancy test . At pre-entry visit , blood drawn second lactate level . Within 30 day screen visit , patient return clinic enter study . Patients eat drink , except medication water , least 8 hour prior visit . Upon study entry , follow perform : physical exam ; blood draw routine lab test , HIV viral load , CD4 count , repeat lactate ; urinalysis ; pregnancy test . All patient receive follow regimen Week 48 : vitamin C , E , B1 , B2 . One week start vitamin regimen , patient restart antiretroviral regimen receive time hyperlactatemia . Within 30 day study entry , patient exact dose antiretrovirals receive time hyperlactatemia , take account necessary dose escalation . Evaluations perform Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 every 4 week thereafter Week 24 . After Week 24 , evaluation perform 8-week interval Week 48 . Antiretrovirals supply study .</detailed_description>
