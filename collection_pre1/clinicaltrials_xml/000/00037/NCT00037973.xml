	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine whether individual Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) complete ventilation-feedback training combine moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength program demonstrate significantly longer exercise duration constant work rate treadmill test compare subject randomly assign moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program without ventilation-feedback ventilation-feedback . Secondary study objective determine whether individual COPD complete ventilation-feedback training combine moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program demonstrate significantly : ( ) great exercise tolerance aerobic power ; ( b ) low perception breathlessness progressive constant work rate leg-cycle treadmill exercise testing ; ( c ) high tidal volume lower breathing frequency constant work rate give workload progressive testing ; ( ) low score Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire indicate improve quality life ; ( e ) high transition focal score ( less dyspnea ) Transition Dyspnea Index ; ( f ) maintain sustain breathing-pattern adjustment exercise compare subject randomly assign moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength program without ventilation-feedback ventilation-feedback .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statement Problem : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) term use characterize individual chronic bronchitis emphysema obstruction airflow spirogram . 1 ) Patients COPD poor exercise capacity reflective underlying disease . 2 ) The symptom lung disease trigger simple low-intensity activity daily live dress undressing , bath shopping insufferable , consequently patient become sedentary . An increasingly sedentary lifestyle lead muscle deconditioning make physical activity even intolerable . 3 ) The cycle continue downward spiral . Pulmonary rehabilitation essential assist person COPD cope disease . The two primary objective pulmonary rehabilitation control alleviate symptom respiratory illness assist patient toward optimal capability carry his/her activity daily live . 4 ) The propose study evaluate efficacy unique program ventilation-feedback training combine leg-cycle walking exercise improve exertional endurance , perceive dyspnea quality life person COPD . Hypothesis : Individuals COPD complete 12-weeks ventilation-feedback training combine moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program demonstrate significantly longer exercise duration treadmill constant work rate ( CWR ) exercise test compare subject randomly assign moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train ventilation-feedback training program . Specific Objectives : Short-term Objectives- The primary objective propose study determine whether individual COPD complete 12-weeks ventilation-feedback training combine moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program demonstrate significantly longer exercise duration treadmill CWR exercise test compare subject randomly assign moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program without ventilation-feedback ventilation-feedback program . The secondary objective propose research determine whether individual COPD complete ventilation-feedback training combine moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train ventilation-feedback program , compare subject randomly assign moderately-high intensity exercise upper body strength train program , demonstrate significantly : ( ) great work tolerance aerobic power maximal leg-cycle treadmill exercise test ; ( b ) low perception breathlessness progressive CWR leg-cycle treadmill exercise test ; ( c ) significantly high tidal volume ( VT ) low breathing frequency CWR give workload progressive leg-cycle treadmill exercise test ; ( ) low score Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire ( CRDQ ) 5 indicate good quality life ; ( e ) high transition focal score Transition Dyspnea Index ( TDI ) .6 In addition , six week complete train program subject repeat treadmill CWR test . This do ass whether positive effect ventilation-feedback training persist beyond 12-week training period . Long-term Objectives : If hypothesis correct , use ventilation-feedback technique teach efficient breathe pattern activity daily live . In time , system miniaturize portable thereby make new technique readily usable pulmonary rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
