	<brief_summary>Patients end stage renal disease often secondary hyperparathyroidism due high phosphorus low calcium level blood . Preliminary animal study initial human study indicate parathyroid hormone level may change quickly base ingestion phosphorus , prior change blood level calcium phosphorus . This follow-up study attempt determine effect independent increase blood glucose level . If , would suggest yet unidentified gastrointestinal receptor mediates parathyroid hormone level . This may affect time administration type phosphate binder use treat patient secondary hyperparathyroidism . The knowledge parathyroid hormone level change acutely may also affect recommend time blood sample</brief_summary>

Experimental design involve use glucose clamp maintain constant , mild increase blood glucose level . Frequent , schedule lab test obtain period hyperglycemia evaluate phosphorous , calcium , glucose level relationship change value change parathyroid hormone level . The primary outcome evaluate change parathyroid hormone level presence hyperglycemia compare result initial study</detailed_description>
