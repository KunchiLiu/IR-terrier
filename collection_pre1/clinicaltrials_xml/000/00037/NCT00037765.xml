	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cystic Fibrosis cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene result impaired chloride transport across epithelial cell . While many organ involve , infection , inflammation destruction lung ultimately result morbidity mortality . There association residual CFTR function severity disease , however great variability within specific mutation suggest gene modifier . Even though 900 mutation CFTR relate CF lung disease , F508 common one represent 70 percent American CF population . Thus , establish phenotype/genotype correlation use homozygote F508 patient likely identify gene responsible mild form disease . Why important ? Whereas since identification gene CFTR significant amount knowledge accumulate CFTR function CF pathogenesis , cure CF ( treat monogenic disease ) elusive . Identification genetic modifier ( may explain 10 percent CF patient die age 10 , 1/3 age 20 50 percent live 32 year age ) expand therapeutic target may lead shift severe phenotype milder one . Moreover , approach outline study may also result good understanding CFTR delta F508 biogenesis function , may identify gene directly relate CFTR . The study response Request Applications title `` Genetic Modifiers Single Gene Defect Diseases '' release August , 2000 co-sponsored National Institute Diabetes , Digestive , Kidney Diseases . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) display wide range disease severity , particularly pulmonary phenotype . Although variability attribute specific mutation within CFTR gene ( allelic heterogeneity ) , much variability adequately explain . The central hypothesis study much `` severity '' ( `` mildness '' ) CF lung disease reflect influence non-CFTR `` modifier '' allele ( gene ) . The study design identify association non-CFTR gene pulmonary phenotype . To accomplish goal , study conduct 600 CF patient CFTR genetic background , i.e. , homozygous deltaF508 , extremes pulmonary phenotype , i.e. , severe mild lung disease . Pulmonary disease severity ( mildness ) quantitated longitudinal lung function analysis informative censoring . The overall strategy test association candidate modifier allele ( gene ) severity ( mildness ) pulmonary disease . Key clinical feature ( gender ; age-at-diagnosis ; sweat chloride ; nutrition ; respiratory microbiology ) important variable overall analysis . Initially , study test candidate gene ( n=200 ) implicate pathophysiology CF lung disease . A pooling strategy use expedite first round test . After pool DNA `` severe '' patient , pool DNA mild patient , gene ( allele ) identify great association phenotype . Follow-up genotyping individual subject allow subgroup analysis ( gender ; age-at-diagnosis ; nutrition ; respiratory microbiology ) gene , well complex analysis search interaction among different allele . Subsequent study involve genome-wide test single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) identify locus ( gene ) present initial list candidate gene . Identification gene modulate severity pulmonary phenotype improve understand pathophysiology CF lung disease , identify new target therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
