	<brief_summary>The short-term research objective propose study follow : 1 . To measure effect audiological intervention select domain specific ( i.e. , Communicative , Interpersonal , Social role ) overall function use WHO-DASII , generic health measure conceptually ground ICIDH-2 model disablement function . 2 . To measure effect audiological intervention select domain specific ( i.e. , Role Functioning-Emotional ; , Social Functioning ) overall function use MOS-SF36V , generic health measure currently utilized Veteran 's Health Administration . 3 . To determine accuracy measure audibility ( SII ) , hear handicap ( HHIE ) , , hear disability ( APHAB ) predict domain specific overall functioning , life-satisfaction measure WHO-DASII MOS-SF36V evaluate . 4 . To compare hear aid treatment effect measure change WHO-DASII domain specific overall functioning score measure change disease specific instrument examine similar construct . 5 . To compare hear aid treatment effect measure change MOS-SF36V domain specific overall functioning score measure change disease specific instrument examine similar construct . 6 . To determine compare cost-effectiveness hearing aid intervention calculate use WHO-DASII MOS SF-36V outcome data . The long-term research objective compare cost-effectiveness cost-utility audiologic intervention health care intervention commonly associate veteran population ( e.g . mental health , cardiology , pulmonary , orthopedic , etc . ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives Projected Timetable : 1. . Short-term objective : 1. . To measure effect audiological intervention select domain specific ( i.e. , Communicative , Interpersonal , Social role ) overall function use WHO-DAS II , generic health measure conceptually ground International Classification Impairment , Disability , Handicap ( ICIDH ) -2 model disablement functioning ( WHO , 1999 ) . 2. . To measure effect audiological intervention select category specific ( i.e. , Role Functioning-Emotional Social Functioning ) overall function use MOS-SF36V , generic health measure currently utilized Veterans Health Administration . 3. . To determine accuracy measure audibility ( SII ) , hear handicap ( HHIE ) , , hear disability ( APHAB ) predict domain specific overall functioning , life-satisfaction measure WHO-DAS II MOS-SF36V evaluate . 4. . To compare hear aid treatment effect measure change WHO-DAS II domain specific overall functioning score measure change disease specific instrument examine similar construct . 5. . To compare hear aid treatment effect measure change MOS-SF36V domain specific overall functioning score measure change disease specific instrument examine similar construct . 6. . To determine compare cost-effectiveness hearing aid intervention calculate use WHO-DAS II MOS-SF36V outcome data . 2. . Long-term objective : To compare cost-effectiveness cost-utility audiologic intervention health care intervention commonly associate veteran population ( e.g . mental health , cardiology , pulmonary , orthopedic , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
