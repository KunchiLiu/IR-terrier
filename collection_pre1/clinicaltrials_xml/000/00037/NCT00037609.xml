	<brief_summary>The primary objective phase I study determine safe dose combination therapy capecitabine exisulind . A secondary objective ass pharmacokinetic interaction two drug assess biological activity exisulind . The primary objective Phase II part study assess anti-tumor activity combination therapy measure objective tumor response .

	<brief_title>Safety , Efficacy Pharmacokinetic Between Capecitabine Exisulind Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study : Capecitabine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 2nd 3rd line chemotherapy patient metastatic breast cancer previously fail anthracycline taxane chemotherapy . Capecitabine produce objective tumor response around 20 % median duration response 32 week patient ( 1 ) . These result indicate improvement treatment anthracycline taxane resistant breast cancer need . Exisulind ( sulindac sulfone , FGN-1 , APTOSYNTM ) sulfone metabolite sulindac , widely use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAID ) drug . Sulindac sulfone lack inhibitory activity two isoforms cyclooxygenase , COX 1 COX 2 , devoid gastrointestinal renal toxicity associate NSAIDs . Exisulind selectively stimulate program cell death variety neoplastic cell include colon , prostate , mammary epithelial cell without affect normal cell ( 2,3 ) . Exisulind inhibits growth breast cancer cell line vitro also inhibit chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis rat ( 4,5 ) . The drug also synergistic diverse group cytotoxic compound include cisplatin , taxanes retinoids ( 6 ) . Exisulind exert effect inhibit novel phosphodiesterase belongs PDE5 family specifically degrade cGMP ( 7 ) . Inhibition enzyme result rise intracellular cGMP level lead apoptosis yet unknown mechanism . Exisulind also inhibit transcription factor NF-kB ( 8 ) . The NF-kB pathway activate cellular stress include exposure inflammatory cytokine , cytotoxic agent oxidative stress ( 9 ) . It believe activation NF-kB protect cell death , therefore , inhibition transcription factor may contribute proapoptotic , chemotherapy potentiate effect exisulind . Exisulind selectively promote apoptosis neoplastic cell whereas chemotherapeutic drug induce program cell death non-selective manner . We hypothesize combination 2 drug increase response rate selectively augment cytotoxic activity chemotherapy . Furthermore , continuous maintenance treatment , chemotherapy dos , minimally toxic drug selectively induce apoptosis cancer cell may improve response duration ultimately may translate improved survival well quality life . Each drug alone establish maximum tolerate dose human . However , combination exisulind capecitabine test . This phase I-II study propose test safety efficacy combination patient metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Each patient must meet criterion order consider enrollment Phase I study : Histologically confirm breast cancer either clinical , radiological laboratory evidence metastatic disease . Patients must receive anthracyclinecontaining taxane chemotherapy either adjuvant treatment therapy metastatic breast cancer . There limit prior chemotherapy regimens hormonal therapy receive . Concomitant bisphosphonate treatment allow patient bone metastasis . Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy include surgery radiation . Zubrod performance status &lt; 2 . ( See Appendix A ) Adequate bone marrow function : platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 , ANC &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dl . Normal renal function : creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl . Adequate liver function : Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL . Transaminases ( SGOT ) LDH , alkaline phosphatase must &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal absence bone liver metastasis , &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal presence radiologically apparent liver metastasis bone metastasis , respectively . Female patient must nonchildbearing potential nonlactating use adequate contraception . BetaHCG check premenopausal patient clinically indicate . Patients brain metastasis whose disease remain stable 6 month complete therapy brain eligible . Written informed consent . In addition , patient participate Phase II portion study : Must bidimensionally measurable evaluable disease . Lytic lesion see plain radiographs consider evaluable conjunction bone scan abnormality . Bone scan abnormality alone , pure blastic bone metastasis irradiate lesion consider measurable evaluable accept . Also , pleural peritoneal effusion consider evaluable disease . Exclusion Criteria A patient must enrol follow criteria applies : Known hypersensitivity sulindac ( CLINORIL ) . Known hypersensitivity contraindication capecitabine ( XELODAR ) include prior therapy capecitabine . Clinical laboratory evidence significant liver disease . Concomitant treatment cytotoxic agent capecitabine participation investigational study . Uncontrolled psychiatric , social ( addictive ) disorder would preclude obtain informed consent patient participation study .</criteria>
