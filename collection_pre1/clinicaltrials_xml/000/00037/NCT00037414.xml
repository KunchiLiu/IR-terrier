	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There grow evidence link osteoporosis atherosclerosis . Recent study document bone mineral density ( BMD ) inversely correlate severity aortic coronary artery calcification , marker atherosclerosis . Cardiovascular disease osteoporosis tremendous negative public health impact nation . Besides increased mortality , negative impact include severely diminished quality life huge financial burden . With ever age population , situation get even bad . As increase number individual live well 80 90 , great deal interest become know healthy aging . The study response Request Applications ( RFA ) entitle Bone Formation Calcification Cardiovascular Disease develop jointly National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases ( NIAMS ) support research pathophysiology molecular mechanism vascular calcification , possible link vascular calcification , bone formation , cardiovascular disease . The RFA release January , 2001 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study evaluate relationship BMD coronary artery aortic calcification , measure electron beam compute tomography , 700 member large Amish pedigree already participate Amish Family Osteoporosis Study ( AFOS ) . By focus family , investigator hope tease respective contribution genetic non-genetic factor cluster trait . The AFOS initiated 1997 identify gene influence susceptibility osteoporosis family ascertain fracture risk . Through NIH fund available AFOS parent study , investigator genotype 391 highly polymorphic short tandem repeat ( STR ) marker space approximately 10 cM interval perform genome-wide scan detect quantitative trait locus ( QTLs ) associate variation bone marrow density relate trait . The Old Order Amish ideal study since close founder population relatively genetically homogeneous , large family size , well-documented genealogy . The study use available measure bone marrow density , related trait , genotype AFOS along newly collect measure vascular calcification . The specific goal determine bone marrow density correlate coronary artery aortic calcification ( CAC ) , , determine contribution common gene share environment association family . The investigator next assess genetic heritability non-genetic contribution variability vascular calcification determinant CAC family . They assess individual joint contribution lipid oxidation bone marrow density vascular calcification . Using extensive genotyping available , perform genome wide scan coronary artery aortic calcification . These result complement similar analysis obtain bone-related phenotype . Finally , determine chromosomal region link variation bone marrow density also link variation vascular calcification another possible joint determinant CAC ( lipid oxidation ) .</detailed_description>
