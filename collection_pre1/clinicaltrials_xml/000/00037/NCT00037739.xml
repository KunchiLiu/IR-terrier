	<brief_title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Gene Localization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) slowly progressive disorder characterize airway obstruction last least several month . The two major cause COPD chronic bronchitis emphysema . Either disorder may occur without airway obstruction , airways obstruction cause impairment lung function lead disability death . COPD major health problem United States throughout world , consistently rank among common cause death United States . Cigarette smoke primary environmental factor increase risk COPD , environmental factor also implicate . However , despite well-established role , environmental factor alone cause COPD . Symptomatic COPD develop 10-20 percent heavy cigarette smoker , probably genetic susceptibility , although common COPD susceptibility gene yet identify . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study apply statistical linkage analysis family data . Pulmonary measurement already collect 159 member 16 pedigree evidence support COPD susceptibility gene pedigree obtain segregation analysis . Each 11,995 genetic marker , already genotyped pedigree member , test evidence linkage infer COPD susceptibility gene . Evidence linkage one genetic marker identifed genomic location COPD susceptibility gene . The high density marker allow fine-mapping gene . Successful completion gene localization project necessary prerequisite project identify characterize COPD susceptibility gene . Identifying gene mutate increase risk COPD may increase understand pulmonary function , well allow gene-carriers identify make aware susceptibility .</detailed_description>
