	<brief_title>Measuring Sensitivity Nonignorability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite considerable number recent development , miss data associate methodology continue important topic research biostatistics , medicine public health . As investigator begin understand limitation model-based inference assumption non-ignorable missingness , recent attention turn formulation implementation sensitivity analyse . Having general-purpose index ass sensitivity departures ignorability would extremely useful researcher variety field health science . This especially true index relatively easy compute interpret . DESIGN NARRATIVE : It would useful general , easily compute diagnostic characterizes data set respect potential sensitivity nonignorability . The investigator develop diagnostic measure effect small perturbation ignorability coefficient estimate univariate linear model miss observations.They extend analysis number direction : ) They develop general class diagnostics Bayes direct- likelihood inference , demonstrate application number important special case . ii ) They develop analogous theory sensitivity nonignorability frequentist estimation test . iii ) They develop general form diagnostic coarse-date model , generalization miss data include censor round special case . iv ) They analyze number real- world data set represent important case nonignorability interest , include dropout longitudinal data , censor survival data , cross-over clinical trial .</detailed_description>
