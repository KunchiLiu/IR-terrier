	<brief_summary>The Diarrhea Prevention investigational drug trial , evaluate whether add investigational drug standard treatment advanced colorectal cancer reduce amount diarrhea patient experience . The standard approve treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer repeat cycle chemotherapy consist combination irinotecan ( also know CPT-11 , Camptosar ) , 5-fluorouracil ( also know 5FU ) , leucovorin ( also know LV ) . Preclinical data animal model suggest investigational drug may offer effective mean prevent CPT-11/5FU/LV-induced diarrhea . It also hypothesize investigational drug-mediated anti-angiogenesis could induce favorable tumor response .</brief_summary>
