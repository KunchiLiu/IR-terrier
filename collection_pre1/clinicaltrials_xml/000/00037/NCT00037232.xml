	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In study chronic disease , environmental genetic factor influential . In highly common disease , coronary heart disease , genetic effect may influential determine age onset disease determine whether one get disease . When sufficient information available , family study help localize possible disease gene human chromosome genetic linkage analysis , familial aggregation disease help separate effect inheritance , environment lifestyle risk disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study develop : ( 1 ) general strategy evaluate fit parametric dependence model familial cluster age disease-onset ; ( 2 ) computationally simple method genetic linkage analysis age onset data ; ( 3 ) application illustration recently develop additive frailty model complex familial dependence structure . Method ( 1 ) apply family study cardiovascular disease twin study appendectomy . Method ( 2 ) apply ongoing genetic study conduct University California San Francisco . Method ( 3 ) apply family study coronary heart disease Western Australia . Well-documented , user-friendly program develop make publicly available . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
