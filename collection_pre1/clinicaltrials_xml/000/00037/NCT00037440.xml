	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : While onset symptomatic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) typically occur middle age later , development underlie pathology clearly long-term process , early-state lesion identify autopsy even child . Understanding course CVD risk development childhood middle age clearly valuable understand pathology CVD target preventive measure effectively . Furthermore , genetic factor agree play significant role development CVD , gene contribute interindividual variation CVD risk relatively small effect risk give individual , even though aggregate effect contribute significantly CVD risk overall population . Relatively little known effect genetic variant course CVD risk factor development individual time . The Bogalusa Heart Study ( BHS ) , begin 1973 study CVD risk factor child evolve cover development CVD risk factor childhood early middle age , offer unparalleled resource investigate genetic factor influence within-individual change time quantitative factor , serum lipid blood pressure , relate CVD risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Approximately 1500 individual examine BHS least three separate occasion period 20 year , consent participate study genetic factor influence CVD risk , genotype measure select locus either know strongly suspect affect interindividual variation CVD risk . Longitudinal multilevel regression use measure effect variation loci quantitative CVD risk factor profile within individual determine whether gene effect CVD risk variation age-dependent .</detailed_description>
