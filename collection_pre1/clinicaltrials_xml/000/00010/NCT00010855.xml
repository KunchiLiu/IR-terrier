	<brief_summary>Analgesics sedative administer control distress minimally invasive surgical procedure limit effectiveness serious side effect . Unabated distress interferes smooth progression ongoing procedure , elicit adverse response patient need additional intervention . The long-term objective research provide safe practical behavioral method reduce cognitive physiologic distress associate invasive procedure . Currently , method benefit least 8 million patient annually US . Extrapolating risk intravenous conscious sedation number invasive procedure perform annually , predict 47,000 patient suffer serious cardiorespiratory complication 2,600 die . These number include effect psychological damage inflict poorly manage procedure-related stress patient ' subsequent health behavior . This application set pursue three aim : 1 ) Prospectively determine impact self-hypnotic relaxation cognitive physiologic distress tumor embolizations ; 2 ) Prospectively determine impact self-hypnotic relaxation distress postoperative period ; 3 ) Determine impact intraprocedural self-hypnotic relaxation distress subsequent tumor embolization . We hypothesize : 1 ) Self-hypnotic relaxation decrease cognitive physiologic distress tumor embolizations . 2 ) Self-hypnotic relaxation decrease cognitive physiologic distress tumor embolization post-embolization ischemia expect induce painful stimulus systemic distress . 3 ) The beneficial effect self-hypnotic coping skill acquire invasive procedure carry next invasive procedure . Upon completion , efficacy durability procedural administration nonpharmacologic analgesia know rigorous practical assessment . The relative performance self-hypnotic relaxation quantify compare standard care empathic control well-characterized population patient within control monitor environment busy interventional radiology practice . Results compete renewal provide next level data need future study design determine broad clinical utility multicenter randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
