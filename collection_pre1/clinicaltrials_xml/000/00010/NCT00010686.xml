	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis postmenopausal woman one important public health challenge time . With million woman affect billion dollar spent complication , need develop effective approach disease . Postmenopausal woman particular risk loss estrogen associate menopause lead bone loss much great magnitude one would expect basis age alone . Estrogen replacement therapy , logical effective therapeutic approach , associate serious concern adverse event , thus , limited use . The recent development selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMS ) may help continue show promise . Interest natural source estrogenic substance prevent postmenopausal bone loss expect outgrowth general interest alternative medicinals wide variety human disorder . Concerns potential adverse consequence conventional use estrogen replacement therapy , limit knowledge long term use SERMS- add support quest . No systematic investigation role dietary phytoestrogens bone mass skeletal dynamic yet conduct . With dramatic increase interest source estrogenic activity , important u determine whether agent efficacious . Otherwise , field plague year come incomplete , anecdotal scientifically poorly documented action agent bone metabolism . It expectation study begin provide documentary information field clearly need . The rationale explore potential phytoestrogens maintenance skeletal health postmenopausal woman clear compelling . Women randomly assign one three healthy eat plan , course year-long study , learn choose cook food help optimize health go menopause beyond .</detailed_description>
