	<brief_summary>Preventing dementia important goal age population . This proposal initial 42 month study effect standardize ginkgo biloba extract ( GBE ) prevent delay cognitive decline people age 85 year old ( old old ) . The study focus old old present distinct advantage primary prevention study particularly high risk develop mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , precursor dementia . Because population previously mainstream use alternative medicine , safety GBE age group also test study . The study randomize , placebo control double blind . Approximately 200 elderly cognitively healthy subject enrol followed detection conversion MCI . This pilot study view necessary first step order demonstrate GBE , alternative complementary therapy , disease modify effect brain , distinct symptomatic effect . The study test feasibility randomize start design , trial design propose method discern brain- disease- modifying symptomatic effect . The magnitude biological effect treatment also assess volumetric quantitative MRI , complementary mean confirm whether brain modifying effect ( measure decrease brain volume loss treatment ) . Peripheral marker oxidation status measure possible anti-oxidant effect GBE .</brief_summary>
