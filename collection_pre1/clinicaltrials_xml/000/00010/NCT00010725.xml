	<detailed_description>Older African Americans suffer disproportionately high rate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity mortality . In response health disparity old African Americans white , national mandate call new research innovative approach CVD prevention high risk population . Oxidative stress recently implicate pathogenesis atherosclerotic CVD . Available evidence epidemiological study , clinical trial , laboratory mechanistic study indicate antioxidant intervention may useful prevention treatment atherosclerotic CVD high risk old population . Furthermore , hypothesize dietary food source antioxidant nutrient may clinically effective conventional nonfood-derived vitamin supplementation . Surveys indicate relatively high rate complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) use , include herbal medicine , old African Americans . Yet , exception previous clinical trial present Center team , control study CAM therapy older African Americans previous control study efficacy mechanism herbal antioxidant prevention CVD high risk population . Preliminary study find CAM herbal preparation ( MAK ) derive traditional Vedic medicine demonstrate potent antioxidant anti-atherogenic effect laboratory pilot human study . This study evaluate effect traditional CAM herbal preparation old African Americans . This control clinical trial field site , Howard University Medical Center Washington , DC , involve 138 old African American men woman ( 55 year age old ) document atherosclerotic CVD randomize supplementation either traditional CAM herbal preparation ( MAK 4+5 ) , conventional vitamin cocktail ( E+C ) placebo 12 month . Clinical mechanistic outcome include carotid artery atherosclerosis ( IMT ) , endothelial dysfunction ( brachial artery reactivity ) , oxidize LDL , traditional CVD risk factor ( BP , lipid , diet , exercise , smoking , weight ) quality life . Participants continue usual care . The result clinical study provide much need understanding basic clinical effect traditional herbal antioxidant preparation pathophysiological mechanism atherosclerotic CVD high risk group . This facilitate translation research finding CAM clinical practice prevention disease underserved understudied population high risk old African Americans .</detailed_description>
