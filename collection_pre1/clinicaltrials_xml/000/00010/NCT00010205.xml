	<brief_title>Benzoylphenylurea Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose benzoylphenylurea patient advanced malignancy . II . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea weekly 6 week . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos benzoylphenylurea maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
