	<detailed_description>System : NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation System Summary : The NeuRx-RA/4 intend use individual sustain spinal cord injury , require aid respiration . The device connect diaphragm delivers current stimulate muscle contraction aid respiration . This device currently hold Investigational Device Exemption No . G920162 United States currently undergo clinical trial University Hospitals ( Cleveland ) , Shepherd Center ( Atlanta ) Vancouver ( Canada ) . Introduction : The purpose study determine new , investigational diaphragm pace system provide part full time respiratory support spinal cord injure person normally need mechanical ventilator . Patients high-level spinal cord injury typically experience chronic ventilatory insufficiency due respiratory muscle paralysis ; patient must support predominantly positive pressure mechanical ventilation ventilator . The diaphragm pace system ( NeuRx-RA/4 ) provide electrical signal motor point muscle cause diaphragm contract allow patient breathe naturally . Synapse Biomedical , conjunction Case Western Reserve University University Hospitals Cleveland , evaluate activate diaphragm percutaneous intramuscular electrode implant laparoscopically . This eliminate direct contact phrenic nerve , allow circuitry electronics remain outside body , provide direct , selective activation hemidiaphragm . The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation ( DPS ) System implant 25 individual high-level spinal cord injury , result 20 year cumulative active implantation time . The long term patient implant March 6 , 2000 use DPS System sole mean respiratory support five year . With exception second patient , meet revise inclusion criterion gain benefit implant , remain patient able achieve significant tidal volume DPS System . Based current result , NeuRx RA/4 DPS System demonstrate safety efficacy patient high-level spinal cord injury . Given result date study demonstrate preliminary efficacy patient population . With unexpected significant adverse event report NeuRx RA/4 DPS System perform reliably safely patient population . Device Description : The NeuRx RA/4 Respiratory System manufacture Synapse Biomedical . The NeuRx RA/4 System comprise follow component : external , battery power Stimulator Device , associate Programmer/Controller , Intramuscular Electrodes , associate percutaneous Lead Wires , Surgical Placement Tool Set , surgical Mapping Station . Inclusion Criteria : - Age 18 year old - Cervical spinal cord injury dependant mechanical ventilation - Clinically stable follow acute spinal cord injury - Bilateral phrenic nerve function clinically acceptable demonstrate EMG recording nerve conduction time - Diaphragm movement stimulation visible fluoroscopy - Clinically acceptable oxygenation room air ( &gt; 90 % ) - Hemodynamically stable - No medical co-morbidities would interfere proper placement function device - Committed primary caregiver - Negative pregnancy test females child-bearing potential - Informed consent patient designate representative Exclusion Criteria : - Co-morbid medical condition preclude surgery - Active lung disease ( obstructive , restrictive membrane disease ) - Active cardiovascular disease - Active brain disease - Hemodynamic instability low oxygen level room air - Hospitalization treat active infection within last 3 month - Significant scoliosis chest deformity - Marked obesity - Anticipated poor compliance protocol either patient primary caregiver . - Currently breastfeed</detailed_description>
