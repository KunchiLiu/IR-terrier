	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness two treatment regimen lurtotecan liposome patient advance recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , primary fallopian tube cancer , peritoneal cancer previously treat chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lurtotecan Liposome Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare anti-tumor efficacy two treatment schedule lurtotecan liposome , term clinical/radiological response CA125 tumor marker , patient previously treat advanced recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer . II . Compare safety , pharmacokinetics , possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship treatment schedule patient . III . Compare time progression patient treat treatment schedule . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord time last prior chemotherapy ( le 6 month vs 6 month ) number prior chemotherapy regimen ( 1 vs 2 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV 30 minute day 1-3 . Arm II : Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course document CR . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) receive 4 additional course document PR disease progression investigator 's discretion . Patients stable disease continue therapy maximum 6 course . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month disease relapse progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-74 patient ( 20-37 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 10 month .</detailed_description>
