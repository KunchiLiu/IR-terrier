	<brief_title>Effects Reiki Painful Neuropathy Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) type II diabetes currently least 20 % subject 65 year old . Numerous data suggest hyperglycemia may independent risk factor macrovascular complication . Diabetic painful neuropathy ( DPN ) affect 5-50 % patient diabetes exacerbated poor glycemic control . DPN characterize acute functional abnormality nerve fiber follow chronic nerve fiber loss blunt nerve fiber regeneration . Symptoms include tingle burn sensation calf , ankle foot . Pharmacological treatment diabetic autonomic neuropathy ( DAN ) DPN include tricyclic antidepressant , cardiotoxic low efficacy rate . The ADA recommend utilization diet exercise primary mean glycemic control , therefore DPN . Because increased level extremity pain , patient DPN less likely include exercise part health regimen . Diabetic autonomic neuropathy ( DAN ) commonly complicate diabetes invoke cause sudden death diabetic patient . The excess cardiac mortality diabetic appear augmented presence DAN patient advance deficit sympathetic cardiovascular enervation may augment cardiac arrhythmogenesis . An bio-energy modality know Reiki energy manipulation technique similar Therapeutic Touch , hands-on modality familiar nursing relief chronic pain , well accelerate heal full thickness dermal wound . The study approach apply Reiki patient DPN +/- DAN semi-double blind , randomize , crossover study ascertain glycemic control cardiac autonomic function improve patient . Outcome measure include HBA1c value , McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire , quality life questionnaire . Participants also test ability tolerate exercise 6 minute walk test . This study help elucidate whether bio-energy technique reduce pain level , improve glycemic control increase exercise tolerance improve cardiac autonomic function , major contributor CHD mortality .</detailed_description>
