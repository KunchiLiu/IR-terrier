	<brief_title>Carboplatin Combined With Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Thymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate patient advance thymoma thymic carcinoma treat carboplatin paclitaxel . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenous ( IV ) infusion 3 hour follow carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression . Patients achieve complete partial remission stable disease receive 4 additional course therapy maximum 6 course . Further treatment may give discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35-68 patient accrue study within 3.8-4.6 year .</detailed_description>
