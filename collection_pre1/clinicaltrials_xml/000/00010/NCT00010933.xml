	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate novel method CAM aim alleviate chronic pain related functional bowel disorder child . To end , two CAM modality investigate independently , namely Guided Imagery use Chamomile tea form botanical therapy . Functional abdominal pain define pain unrelated identifiable organic gastrointestinal disorder . The two subcategories functional bowel disorder examine study RAP IBS . The definition RAP child follow Apley 's classic definition paroxysmal abdominal pain occur child age 4 16 year persist three month , frequency three episodes abdominal pain three month interval . A similar pattern abdominal pain relieve defecation and/or associate alter bowel habit and/or stool consistency define IBS . Despite definition , note typical frequency pain episode associate functional bowel disorder least three time per month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Functional Abdominal Pain Children : Evaluation Relaxation/Guided Imagery Chamomile Tea Therapeutic Modalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional bowl disorder define variable combination gastrointestinal symptom readily explain structural biochemical abnormality . In child , typically encompass irritable bowel syndrome recurrent abdominal pain childhood , two closely related disorder reflect similar pathophysiologic process . Both functional disorder pervasive child possibly precede symptom persist adulthood . These also account considerable medical expense morbidity result school absenteeism . Existing therapy limit , lack success frequently frustrate parent , family , physician . The purpose pilot project explore use alternative medicine modality treat functional abdominal pain rely address currently accept pathophysiologic model functional bowel disorder . Available evidence indicate 3 major mechanism syndrome : alter intestinal motility , alter intestinal sensory threshold , psychosocial factor . Recurrent abdominal pain occur 10 30 percent child adolescent , evidence suggest many child recurrent abdominal pain ultimately develop symptom compatible irritable bowel syndrome adulthood . As many 68 % school child suffer recurrent abdominal pain symptom compatible diagnostic criterion irritable bowel syndrome adult . Colonic motility study suggest exaggerated colonic motor function patient abdominal pain compare control , increase perception abdominal pain follow balloon distention rectum , anxiety depression compare healthy child community . The approach therapy include reassurance , fiber , antispasmodic effective long-term management recurrent abdominal pain childhood . Accordingly , pilot project attempt evaluate objectively two alternative modality address mechanism could offer therapeutic option . In specific aim 1 , randomize control trial institute confirm effectiveness relaxation/guided imagery modality treat functional bowel disorder child determine guide imagery improve outcome beyond achievable use relaxation train alone . In second trial , use chamomile tea adjunct traditional mode treat functional bowel disorder child assess compare control receive chamomile tea . The primary outcome reduction pain measure Likert-scale pain inventory use face marker . The advantage inventory face find universal across ethnicity age group . Secondary outcome include bowel habit stool consistency , measure functional disability use Functional Disability Index , psychiatric profile use Child Depression Inventory , Revised Children 's Manifest Anxiety Scale , Children 's Global Assessment Scale . In addition , compliance measure assess phone contact nurse clinician . Data management undertaken quantify analysis already describe .</detailed_description>
