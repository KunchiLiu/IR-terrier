	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death disability old African Americans , account 40 % disproportionate risk mortality observe African Americans compare white Americans . The majority CVD patient experience acute cardiac event , many sudden unexpected , despite conventional treatment disease associate traditional risk factor . The pathophysiologic basis cardiac event fully establish , substantial evidence indicate psychosocial stress sympathetic nervous system adverse effect vasomotor function long-term autonomic balance . Recent advance understand pathophysiology acute cardiac events-specifically , roles arterial vasomotor dysfunction sympathetic nervous system imbalance play pathophysiology acute events-provide platform new mechanistic investigation interplay psychosocial environmental stress CVD . Preliminary evidence demonstrate elevated peripheral vasoconstriction due stress-mediated sympathetic nervous system response African Americans suggest mechanism particularly relevant group .</detailed_description>
