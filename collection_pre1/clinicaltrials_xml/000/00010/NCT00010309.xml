	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients Who Have Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety maximum tolerate dose vaccine contain two adenoviral vector encode melanoma antigens Melan-A/MART-1 gp100 patient stage II-IV melanoma . II . Assess dose-response change frequency MART-1 gp100 reactive T cell ( CD4+ CD8+ ) patient receive one three different vaccine regimen . III . Assess T-cell response one melanoma antigen follow three treatment antigen patient . IV . Assess effect concomitant vaccination antigens T-cell response patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients sequentially enrol 1 3 treatment arm . Each treatment arm 3 group . Arm I : Patients receive Ad2/MART-1v2 vaccine Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine intradermally ( ID ) low dose level every three week either 6 15 week depend assignment . Arm II : Patients receive Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine Ad2/MART-1v2 vaccine ID mid-range dose level every three week either 6 15 week depend assignment . Arm III : Patients receive Ad2/MART-1v2 vaccine Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine ID high dose level every three week either 6 15 week depend assignment . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos Ad2/MART-1v2 and/or Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine arm maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 3 month , 6 month , 1 year completion treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-36 patient accrue 1 year .</detailed_description>
