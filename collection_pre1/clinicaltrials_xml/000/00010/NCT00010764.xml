	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia ( FM ) , one common rheumatic condition , condition unknown etiology characterize widespread muscle pain stiffness . Treatment generally unsatisfactory randomize , control treatment trial unable demonstrate sustain effective intervention . A single , brief trial electroacupuncture demonstrate remarkable improvement among patient FM , although lasting effect evaluate . Nonetheless , recently publish National Institutes Health Consensus Development Statement Acupuncture say `` musculoskeletal condition fibromyalgia , myofascial pain ... .are condition acupuncture may beneficial '' . Thus , 96 patient recruited referral clinic fatigue 12 week ( 24 treatment ) trial . These patient randomize 3 control group 1 `` true '' acupuncture group . The control group consist group receive acupuncture treatment unrelated condition ( morning sickness ) , group receive needle insertion non-channel , non-point location , `` true '' placebo group . This latter group acupuncture needle guide tap skin , needle tap . Thus , specific aim study 1 ) evaluate short long term efficacy side effect 12 week randomize , control trial bi-weekly acupuncture treatment FM ; 2 ) establish useful scientifically sound control group study acupuncture use FM model condition characterize chronic pain ; 3 ) use subjective objective measure overall health pain determine optimal time length treatment ; 4 ) examine concordance allopathic acupuncture-based measure outcome . For purpose study , subject ask complete unique set study measure enrollment , 4 , 8 , 12 week , 1 6 month post-treatment . Our primary outcome patient global assessment , subjective pain , mean number tender point . Secondary outcome pain threshold , analgesic use , physician global assessment , functional status , sleep , psychological distress , fatigue . Thus , trial immediate long term implication scientific study acupuncture well clinical care estimate 5 million patient FM US . From methodological point view , propose trial establish appropriate method choose control group large trial conduct , suggest optimum duration treatment , evaluate utility diverse allopathic alternative outcome measure . Of equal importance , however , research test potentially establish effectiveness acupuncture .</brief_summary>
