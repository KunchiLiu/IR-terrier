	<detailed_description>For people become hemiplegic result stroke , critical safety-related retrain area physical function wheelchair transfer . In addition , incorporate relatively unsupervised home care rehabilitation process , clinician require good mean assess functional gain provide effective training tool . Our goal develop personalized training clinical assessment instrument base Video-Based F-PAT ( Functional Performance Assessment Training ) rely manipulation digitize videoclips . Our development objective ( 1 ) enhance pilot F-PAT web site allow clinician password-protected access digitize video assessment information ; ( 2 ) train Occupational Therapist collaborator create personalize videotapes patient take home . Our clinical objective implement 2-year evaluation F-PAT design concept 30 subject , divide 3 group , patient undergo acute rehabilitation VA Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center discharge home sub-acute facility . This study dual goal evaluate effectiveness personalized training videotape effectiveness video-based assessment methodology . The study divide subject three treatment group compare effectiveness accepted practice , generic videotape , personalize videotape home-based instruction client care provider . Comparison outcomes do use videotape task performance release acute therapy program follow-up evaluation one month later . The subject evaluate blinded physiatrist view rating digitize videoclips task performance F-PAT web site . This study determine personalize videoclip-based instructional material effective , videoclip comparison clinician effective diagnosis assessment instrument . If possible logistical reason subject return clinic follow-on evaluation , F-PAT team visit subject 's home perform videotape on-site . The remainder evaluation input physiatrist occur subsequently clinic .</detailed_description>
